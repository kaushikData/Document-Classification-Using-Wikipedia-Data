'''Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site''' is a {{convert|10|ha|adj=on}} property in [[Baddeck]], [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, overlooking the [[Bras d'Or Lakes]].&lt;ref name="Historic Places"&gt;{{CRHP|1154|Alexander Graham Bell|25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site is a unit of the national park system, and includes the [[Alexander Graham Bell]] Museum, the only museum in the world containing the actual artifacts and documents from Bell's years of experimental work in Baddeck. This site was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in 1952. 

== Museum ==
[[File:Entrance to Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site of Canada.JPG|thumbnail|left|Entrance to Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]]

The museum features artifacts donated in 1955 from the Bell family's personal museum, located in the Kite House at [[Beinn Bhreagh]].&lt;ref name="Historic Places" /&gt; The museum also features memorabilia associated with Bell's experiments, including: the original [[HD-4]] hull of a hydrofoil boat that set the world speed record in [[Baddeck]] of over 70 MPH in 1919; a full-scale replica of that boat; the [[AEA Silver Dart]] which in 1909 J.A.D. MacCurdy piloted up into the air over the ice of Baddeck Bay to become the first heavier-than-air craft to be flown in Canada and possibly the British Empire -- plus many other exhibits and documents from Bell's years of research activities on the transmission of speech and sound by wire and by light, as well as his experiments with kites, planes and high speed boats. &lt;ref name="Historic Places" /&gt; The museum also features displays relating to Bell's work with the [[deafness|deaf]] and how it led to the [[invention of the telephone]].

In addition to its displays, the museum features an observation deck on the roof of the building which offers a view of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]] estate, across the Bay. Beinn Bhreagh is a separate National Historic Site, still owned and occupied by Bell descendants. The museum was designed by renowned British Architect  O.Howard Leicester R.I.B.A. It is not in the national park system and not open to the public. For more, see [[Bras d'Or Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/ns/grahambell/visit/visit3.aspx Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site of Canada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210000428/http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/ns/grahambell/visit/visit3.aspx# |date=2013-02-10 }}, [[Parks Canada]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ariadne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|i|ˈ|æ|d|n|i}}; {{lang-el|Ἀριάδνη}}; {{lang-la|Ariadne}}), in [[Greek mythology]], was a [[Cretan]] princess. She is mostly associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of the [[Minotaur]] and [[Theseus]].

==Family==
Ariadne was the daughter of [[Minos]]—the King of [[Crete]]&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 11.320, Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 947, and later authors.&lt;/ref&gt; and a son of [[Zeus]]—and [[Pasiphaë]]—Minos' queen and a daughter of [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasiphaë is mentioned as Ariadne's mother in ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.1.2 (Pasiphaë, daughter of the Sun), in Apollonius' ''[[Argonautica]]'' iii.997, and in Hyginus ''[[Fabulae]]'', 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Others called her mother [[Crete (mythology)|Crete]], daughter of [[Asterion (king of Crete)|Asterius]], husband-king of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. Ariadne was the sister of [[Acacallis (mythology)|Acacallis]], [[Androgeus (son of Minos)|Androgeus]], [[Deucalion (Cretan)|Deucalion]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Glaucus (son of Minos)|Glaucus]], [[Xenodice (mythology)|Xenodice]] and [[Catreus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.1.2&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3.1.2.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Minos put Ariadne in charge of the labyrinth where sacrifices were made as part of reparations (either to Poseidon or to Athena, depending on the version of the myth); later, she helped Theseus overcome the Minotaur and save the potential sacrificial victims. In other stories, she became the bride of the god [[Dionysus]], with the question of her being mortal or a goddess varying in those accounts.&lt;ref&gt; In creating a "biography" for a historicized Ariadne, her presence on Naxos is accounted for by Theseus' having abandoned her there; in assembling a set of biographical narrative episodes, this would have had to be placed "after" her abduction from Knossos. In keeping with the role of Minos as Crete's king, Ariadne has come to bear the late designation of "princess". The endpoint of this rationalizing process is the realistic historicizing fiction of [[Mary Renault]], ''The Bull from the Sea'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidhe, Fiana. [http://www.matrifocus.com/BEL02/spotlight.htm "Goddess Ariadne in the Spotlight"],''[[MatriFocus]]'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minos and Theseus===
Since [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] myths are passed down through oral tradition, many variations of this and other myths exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia: Greek Mythology |url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570116/Greek_Mythology.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKdfeoI?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570116/Greek_Mythology.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an Athenian version of the legend, Minos attacked [[Athens]] after his son was killed there. The Athenians asked for terms, and were required to sacrifice [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur|seven young men and seven maidens]]  to the [[Minotaur]] every seven or nine years. One year, the sacrificial party included [[Theseus]], the son of King [[Aegeus]], who volunteered to come and kill the Minotaur. Ariadne fell in love at first sight, and helped him by giving him a sword and a ball of thread (μίτο της Αριάδνης 'Ariadne's thread'), so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth.

She eloped with Theseus after he achieved his goal, but according to [[Homer]] "he had no joy of her, for ere that, [[Artemis]] slew her in seagirt Dia because of the witness of [[Dionysus]]" (''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D321 XI, 321-5]). Most accounts claim that Ariadne was abandoned by Theseus, but in some versions she is mortally wounded by Perseus &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Ariadne.html|title=ARIADNE - Greek Goddess Wife of Dionysus (Roman Libera)|website=www.theoi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Homer does not expand on the nature of Dionysus's accusation, but the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' speculates that she was already married to Dionysus when she ran away with Theseus.

===Naxos===

[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]]: Dionysus discovers Ariadne on the shore of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. The painting also depicts the [[Corona Borealis|constellation named after Ariadne]].]]

In [[Hesiod]] and most other accounts, Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]], and [[Dionysus]] rediscovered and wedded her. In a few versions of the myth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] iv. 61, v. 51; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 20. § 2, ix. 40. § 2, x. 29. § 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysus appeared to Theseus as they sailed away from Crete, saying that he had chosen Ariadne as his wife and demanding that Theseus leave her on Naxos for him; this has the effect of absolving the Athenian culture-hero of desertion. The vase-painters of Athens often showed Athena leading Theseus from the sleeping Ariadne to his ship.

With Dionysus, she was the mother of [[Oenopion]], the personification of wine, [[Staphylus]] (related to grapes), [[Thoas (Tauri king)|Thoas]], Peparethus, Phanus, Eurymedon, [[Enyeus]], Ceramus, Maron, Euanthes, Latramys and Tauropolis.&lt;ref&gt;The classical references for these offspring are at [http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Ariadne.html TheoiProject:Ariadne] and [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosFamily.html Theoi Project: Dionysus family]. Euanthes, Latramys and Tauropolis are only mentioned in [[scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 3. 997&lt;/ref&gt; Her wedding [[diadem]] was set in the heavens as the constellation [[Corona Borealis]].

Ariadne remained faithful to Dionysus but was later killed by [[Perseus]] at [[Argos]]. In other myths she hanged herself from a tree, like [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] and the hanging [[Artemis]], a Mesopotamian theme. Some scholars have posited, due to her thread-spinning and winding associations, that she was a [[Weaving (mythology)|weaving goddess]], like [[Arachne]], supporting this theory with the [[mytheme]] of the Hanged Nymph (see [[weaving (mythology)|weaving in mythology]]). Dionysus descended into Hades and brought her and his mother [[Semele]] back. They then joined the gods in [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].

==As a goddess==

[[File:Dionysos Ariadne BM 311.jpg|thumb|left|Ariadne as the consort of Dionysos: bronze appliqué from [[Chalki]], [[Rhodes]], late fourth century BCE ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]])]]

[[Karl Kerenyi]] and [[Robert Graves]] theorize that Ariadne (whose name they derive from [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]'s listing of Άδνον, a Cretan-Greek form for ''arihagne'', "utterly pure") was a [[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]] of [[Crete]], "the first divine personage of Greek mythology to be immediately recognized in Crete",&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, ''Dionysos: archetypal image of indestructible life'', 1976, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; once archaeology had begun. Kerenyi observes that her name is merely an [[epithet]] and claims that she was originally the "Mistress of the [[Labyrinth]]", both a winding dance-ground and in the Greek view a prison with the dreaded [[Minotaur]] at its centre. Kerenyi notes a [[Linear B]] inscription from Knossos, "to all the gods, honey... to the mistress of the labyrinth honey" in equal amounts, suggesting to him that the Mistress of the Labyrinth was a Great Goddess in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1976, p 90f.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Barry Powell has suggested she was Minoan Crete's [[Snake Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Barry B. ''Classical Myth.'' Second ed. with new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]], in his ''vita'' of Theseus, which treats him as a historical individual, reports that in the Naxos of his day, an earthly Ariadne was separate from a celestial one:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the Naxians also have a story of their own, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, one of whom, they say, was married to Dionysos in Naxos and bore him Staphylos and his brother, and the other, of a later time, having been carried off by Theseus and then abandoned by him, came to Naxos, accompanied by a nurse named Korkyne, whose tomb they show; and that this Ariadne also died there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the painter Aison (c. 425&amp;nbsp;– c. 410 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;The kylix is conserved at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], [[Madrid]]; see [[:File:Kylix Theseus Aison MNA Inv11365 n1.jpg|image]].&lt;/ref&gt; Theseus drags the Minotaur from a temple-like labyrinth, but the goddess who attends him, in this Attic representation, is [[Athena]].

[[File:Sleeping Ariadne 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]] ''[[Sleeping Ariadne]]'', long called ''Cleopatra'', a Roman marble in late Hellenistic taste]]

An ancient cult of [[Aphrodite]]-Ariadne was observed at [[Amathus]], Cyprus, according to the obscure [[Hellenistic]] mythographer [[Paeon of Amathus]]; Paeon's works are lost, but his narrative is among the sources cited by [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Theseus (20.3-.5). According to the myth that was current at Amathus, the second most important Cypriote cult centre of Aphrodite, Theseus's ship was swept off course and the pregnant and suffering Ariadne put ashore in the storm. Theseus, attempting to secure the ship, was inadvertently swept out to sea, thus being absolved of abandonment. The Cypriote women cared for Ariadne, who died in childbirth and was memorialized in a shrine. Theseus, overcome with grief upon his return, left money for sacrifices to Ariadne and ordered two [[cult image]]s, one of silver and one of bronze, set up. At the observation in her honour on the second day of the month Gorpiaeus, one of the young men lay on the ground vicariously experiencing the throes of labour. The [[sacred grove]] in which the shrine was located was called the grove of Aphrodite Ariadne.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund P. Cueva, "Plutarch's Ariadne in Chariton's Chaereas and Callirhoe" ''American Journal of Philology'' '''117'''.3 (Fall 1996) pp. 473-484.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primitive aspect of the cult at Amathus in this account would appear to be much older than the Athenian-sanctioned shrine of Aphrodite, who has assumed ''Ariadne'' (''hagne'', "sacred") as an [[epithet]] at Amathus.

==In Etruscan culture==&lt;!--Areatha redirects here--&gt;
Ariadne (Etruscan: '''Areatha''') is paired with Dionysus (Etruscan: [[Fufluns]]) on engraved bronze Etruscan [[bronze mirror]]backs, where the Athenian culture-hero Theseus is absent, and [[Semele]] (Etruscan: [[Semla (mythology)|Semla]]), as mother of Dionysus, may accompany the pair,&lt;ref&gt;For example on the mirror engraving reproduced in Larissa Bonfante and Judith Swaddling, ''Etruscan Myths'' (Series The Legendary Past) University of Texas/British Museum, 2006, fig. 25 p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; lending a particularly Etruscan air&lt;ref&gt;"The married couple is ubiquitous in Etruscan art.  It is appropriate to the social situation of the Etruscan aristocracy, in which the wife's family played as important a role in the family's genealogy as that of the husband." (Bonfante and Swaddling 2006:51f.).&lt;/ref&gt; of family authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5692">A '''baobhan sith''' is a type of female [[vampire]] in the [[Scottish folklore|folklore]] of the [[Scottish Highlands]], though they also share certain characteristics in common with the [[succubus]] and [[fairy]].&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. p. 16. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They appear as beautiful women who seduce their victims before attacking them and draining their blood.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

==Folklore==
According to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] folklorist [[Donald Alexander Mackenzie]], the baobhan sith usually appears as a beautiful young woman wearing a long green dress that conceals the deer hooves she has instead of feet. Like other vampires she drinks the blood of human victims and will vanish with the rising sun. She may also take the form of a [[hooded crow]] or raven.&lt;ref name=Mackenzie&gt;Mackenzie, Donald (1935). ''Scottish Folklore and Folk Life''. Blackie &amp; Son Limited. pp. 236–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous stories about the baobhan sith with a general theme of hunters being attacked in the wilderness at night. In one tale recorded by Mackenzie, there were four men who went hunting and took shelter for the night in a lonely [[shieling]] or hut. One of the men supplied vocal music while the others began dancing. The men expressed a desire for partners to dance with, and soon after that four women entered the hut. Three of them danced while the fourth sat beside the vocalist. He then noticed drops of blood falling from his companions and fled from the hut, taking refuge among the horses. His vampiric partner chased him but was unable to catch him, and when daylight came she disappeared. The man went back inside and found all three of his friends dead and drained of blood.&lt;ref name=Mackenzie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, C. M. (1905). "Folklore from the West of Ross-shire" in ''Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness'' (Vol. 26, 1910). pp. 268–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The folklorist [[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]] suggested that the baobhan sith was unable to catch the fourth man among the horses because of the [[iron in folklore|iron]] with which the horses were shod, iron being a traditional [[fairy]] vulnerability.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

In a similar tale one of the men noticed that the women had deer hooves instead of feet and fled from them. He returned the next morning to find that the other hunters had their "throats cut and chests laid open".&lt;ref name=Mackenzie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson, W. J. (Mrs.) "Fairy Tales" in ''The Celtic Review'' (Vol. 5, 1908-1909). Edinburgh: Norman Macleod. pp. 163–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a third story the hunters took refuge in a cave. Each of the men said he wished his own sweetheart were there that night, but one of them, Macphee, who was accompanied by his black dog, said he preferred his wife to remain at home. At that moment some young women entered the cave, and the men who had wished for their sweethearts were killed. Macphee was protected by his dog who drove the women from the cave.&lt;ref name=Mackenzie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John Gregorson (1900). ''Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland''. Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons. pp. 112–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

One recurring motif in these stories is that of the baobhan sith appearing almost immediately after the hunters express their desire for female companionship. This is connected with a traditional Scottish belief that if one were to make a wish at night without also invoking God's protection, then that wish would be granted in some terrible manner.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

==Literature==
*The baobhan sith have appeared on a number of occasions in author [[Mark Chadbourn]]'s fantasy trilogies ''[[The Age of Misrule (series)|The Age of Misrule]]'', ''[[The Dark Age (series)|The Dark Age]]'', and ''[[Kingdom of the Serpent]]''. 
*Baobhan sith are mentioned in [[Nicole Peeler]]'s ''Tempest Rising'' series.
*They are also mentioned in Michael Scott's ''[[The Magician: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]]''. 
*They appear in ''[[Faerie Tale]]'' by [[Raymond E. Feist]] where they are portrayed as evil fairies of the [[Unseelie Court]], who (aside from their great beauty) possess a strong compelling magic which they use to force solitary males in isolated locations to follow them to their deaths. 
*Cornelia Amiri is the author of the ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQUMNW5 Dancing Vampire]'' romance series of six novellas: ''Dance of the Vampires'', ''Vampire Highland Fling'', ''A Bonnie Vampire Dancer'', ''Vampire Waltz'', ''Valkyrie Vampire Sword Dancing'', and ''Some Vampires Shimmy''. The series is about seven baobhan sith sisters and each book features a different sister as they fall in love.
*Desdemona, an Oriental dancer and commander of the Fae army in [[Amy Hoff]]'s Scottish urban fantasy series ''Caledonia'', is a baobhan sith.
*In ''Night and Silence'', the twelfth installment of [[Seanan McGuire]]'s October Daye series, the protagonist is attacked and repeatedly bitten by a starving baobhan sith.  In this portrayal, a baobhan sith is able to mimic both the appearance and supernatural abilities of anyone whose blood she has recently consumed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">[[Image:Immanuel Bekker - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|August Immanuel Bekker]]

'''Bekker numbering''' or '''Bekker pagination''' is the standard form of citation to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum|works of Aristotle]].  It is based on the page numbers used in the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] edition of the complete works of [[Aristotle]] and takes its name from the editor of that edition, the classical [[philology|philologist]] [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1785-1871); because the Academy was located in Berlin, the system is occasionally referred to by the alternative name '''Berlin numbering''' or '''Berlin pagination'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', ex recognitione Immanuelis Bekkeri, 5 voll. Berlin,  Georgium Reimerum, 1831-1870 (the last volume contains the ''Index Aristotelicus'' by [[Hermann Bonitz]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bekker numbers consist of up to three ordered coordinates, or pieces of information: a number, the letter a or b, and another number, which refer respectively to the page number of Bekker's edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's works, the page column (a standard page of Bekker's edition has exactly two columns), and the line number (total lines typically ranging from 20-40 on a given column or page in Bekker's edition).  For example, the Bekker number denoting the beginning of Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] is ''1094a1'', which corresponds to page 1094 of Bekker's edition, first column (column a), line 1&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnes, ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'', Cambridge 1995 xxi&lt;/ref&gt;.

All modern editions or translations of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, in addition to or instead of page numbers.  Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so that the author's citations can be checked by readers without having to use the same edition or translation that the author used.

While Bekker numbers are the dominant method used to refer to the works of Aristotle, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Thomist]] scholars often use the medieval method of reference by book, chapter, and sentence, albeit generally in addition to Bekker numbers.

[[Stephanus pagination]] is the comparable system for referring to the works of [[Plato]], and [[Diels-Kranz numbering]] is the comparable system for [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]].  Unlike Stephanus pagination, which is based upon a three-volume translation of Plato's works and which recycles low page numbers across the three volumes, introducing the possibility for ambiguity if the Platonic work or volume is not specified, Bekker page numbers cycle from 1 through the end of the ''Corpus Aristotelicum'' regardless of volume, without starting over for some other given volume.  Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage that its notation is unambiguous as compact numerical information, although it relies upon the ordering of Aristotle's works as presented in Bekker's edition.

== Aristotle's works by Bekker numbers ==

The following list is complete. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', edited by [[Jonathan Barnes]], 2 vols., Princeton University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.

{{Corpus Aristotelicum table}}

== Aristotelian works lacking Bekker numbers ==

===''Constitution of the Athenians''===
The ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' (or ''Athenaiōn Politeia'') was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the [[British Museum]].  The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.

===Fragments&lt;!--linked from 'Valentin Rose (classicist)'--&gt;===
Surviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|Valentin Rose]].  These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of [[Aristotle]] was ''Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus'' (1863).  As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the [[Teubner]] series, ''[https://archive.org/details/aristotelisquif00arisgoog Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta]'', Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by ''R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in [[Walter de Gruyter]]'s reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by [[Eckart Schütrumpf]] is in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle CU-Boulder Expert Wins $75,000 Award For Research On Aristotle,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233125/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle |date=2016-04-18 }} University of Colorado Office of News Services, December 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W.D. Ross, ''Select Fragments'' ([https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft Oxford 1952]), and [[Jonathan Barnes]] (ed.), ''The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation'', vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;2384–2465.

The works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues ''On Philosophy'' (or ''On the Good''), ''Eudemus'' (or ''On the Soul''), ''On Justice'', and ''On Good Birth''.  The possibly spurious work, ''[[On Ideas]]'' survives in quotations by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.  For the dialogues, see also the editions of [[Richard Rudolf Walzer]], ''Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum'' (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, ''Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi'' (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.

{{cite bailii|litigants='''Boddington v British Transport Police'''|year=1998|court=UKHL|num=13}} is an important case in [[English administrative law]] which established the possibility of a "collateral challenge" to an allegedly unlawful administrative action.

== Facts ==
Mr Boddington was caught smoking in a railway carriage where smoking was prohibited. He was convicted and fined by a [[magistrate]] under a [[by-law]] made under the Transport Act 1962.

== Judgment ==
On [[appeal]], the question was whether Mr Boddington was entitled to raise, as a defence, the invalidity of the by-law under which he had been convicted. The difficulty was that the normal path for having an administrative action declared unlawful and invalid is an application for [[judicial review]] – which Mr Boddington had not brought.

The [[House of Lords]] held unanimously that he was entitled to bring a so-called collateral challenge in the criminal proceedings. [[Lord Irvine of Lairg|Lord Irvine]], then [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Johan Steyn, Baron Steyn|Lord Steyn]] gave the leading speeches. On the facts, however, Mr Boddington's challenge failed, and his appeal against conviction was dismissed.

Collateral challenges are an important means, alternative to an application for judicial review, of attacking the validity of an administrative action. Although collateral challenges had been permitted in [[English law]] before ''Boddington'', the case is notable for strongly asserting their continuing relevance in modern law and rooting them in [[Liberalism|liberal]] values.

''Boddington'' was adopted into [[Law of South Africa|South African law]] by the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] in ''Oudekraal Estates (Pty) Ltd v City of Cape Town and Others.''&lt;ref&gt;[2004] ZASCA 48, 2004 (6) SA 222 (SCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The British Encyclopaedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, 1809, Vol 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of ''The British Encyclopedia,'' 1809, vol. 4]]
'''''The British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences''''', claimed by its publishers to be a work "''Comprising an accurate and popular view of the present improved state of human knowledge''", was published at London in 1809 in six [[octavo]] volumes and around 150 plates.

The title page credits [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] as the author, and much of the work was overseen by [[Jeremiah Joyce]]. Some of the plates were drawn by [[John Farey, Jr.]], and engraved by [[Wilson Lowry]] and Scott.

The work was published by a syndicate of twenty-three booksellers whose names appear on the title page of each volume, headed by the firm of [[Longman]], [[C. Hurst &amp; Co.|Hurst]], Rees, &amp; Orme. Each purchased shares and in due time received a proportional profit from the eventual sales. This method of publishing was common in the 18th and early 19th century and was known as a [[conger (syndicate)|conger]]. It was particularly suited to multi-part works such as encyclopaedias.

The [[Philadelphia]] publishing house of Mitchell, Ames, &amp; White published three American editions of ''The British Encyclopedia''. The first American edition appeared in 1816-17 but little else is known of this edition. The second American edition appeared in 1818 in twelve volumes, and the third American, also in twelve volumes, closely followed in 1819 and 1821.

In 1998 John Issitt compared the text of ''The British Encyclopedia'' with the text of [[George Gregory (British writer)|Gregory]]'s ''A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences'', which was published in 1806-1807 and also edited by Jeremiah Joyce. Issitt suggests that Joyce developed Nicholson's ''Encyclopedia'' largely from the text of his prior work on Gregory's ''Dictionary'', and he contends, without an empirical showing, that 50% of the text of the two works is identical.&lt;ref&gt;John Issitt. ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/TEXTCOLL/paper4.html A tale of two encyclopaedias: transitions in the presentation of scientific knowledge],'' The Open University, The Textbook Colloquium, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; If Issitt is correct, given that Gregory's ''Dictionary'' appeared in two folio volumes and Nicholson's ''Encyclopedia'' was presented in six octavo volumes, it would seem that Joyce must have copied nearly the whole of Gregory's ''Dictionary'' into Nicholson's ''Encyclopedia''. By observation of a sample of headwords and their articles between ''bergamot'' and ''bignonia'', we find in Gregory 34 heads in 8 columns and in Nicholson 27 heads in 21 columns; of these, 17 articles share some text, and of these, only seven very short articles in Gregory are copied directly and with minimal paraphrasing into Nicholson. This is sufficient to demonstrate that  Gregory's ''Dictionary'' was indeed a useful resource for Nicholson's ''Encyclopedia'', but within this sample, less than two columns of text in Gregory can be found in Nicholson, and less than three columns of text in Nicholson can be found in Gregory. This sample then suggests that less than 25% of the text of Gregory found its way into Nicholson, and that of Nicholson's text, less than 15% can be traced to Gregory.

This series of works was completed following three summers of instruction at the [[University of Virginia]] on  [[Arthur Wesley Dow]]'s design philosophies, which were highly influential in her development as an abstract artist.&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nmwa.org/explore/artist-profiles/georgia-o%E2%80%99keeffe|title=Georgia O'Keeffe|website=National Museum of Women in the Arts||accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early the following year, photographer and art dealer, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited some of the drawings at his ''[[291 (art gallery)|291]]'' art gallery.

While teaching at [[Columbia College (South Carolina)|Columbia College]] in South Carolina, O'Keeffe completed a series of highly innovative charcoal abstractions in 1915,&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p. 76"&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=Norma J. |title=The American Collections |publisher=[[Columbus Museum of Art]] |year=1988 |isbn=0-8109-1811-0 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were unique in their form. Other earlier creators of abstract art used [[Cubist]] shapes, but she used the rhythms and shapes that she found in nature to conceptualize her subconscious feelings, which she called the "unknown", to dictate her compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.whitney.org/object/1617|title= Special (Drawing No. 8), 1916|website=Whitney Museum of American Art|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drawing XIII'' is an example of how O'Keeffe began to develop her own sense of design and composition. A rising flame or flowing river are suggested by the curved line on the right side of the drawing. On the left is a jagged line that seems to represent a lightning strike or mountains. In between the two are four rounded images that appear to be trees or a rolling hillside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/488601|title=Drawing XIII|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit==
O'Keeffe mailed the drawings to friend and former classmate, [[Anita Pollitzer]], who took them to [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at his ''[[291 (art gallery)|291]]'' gallery early in 1916. Stieglitz found them to be the "purest, finest, sincerest things that had entered ''291'' in a long while", and in April, Stieglitz exhibited ten of her drawings at ''291''.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p. 76" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography channel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/georgia-okeeffe-9427684|title=Georgia O'Keeffe|author=Biography.com Editors|website=Biography Channel|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|date=August 26, 2016|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keeffe was surprised that Stieglitz had not communicated when her work would be shown.

{{Eras of the Halakha}}

'''Chazal''' or '''Ḥazal''' ({{lang-he-n|חז״ל}}), an acronym for the Hebrew "'''Ḥ'''akhameinu '''Z'''ikhronam '''L'''iv'rakha" ({{Hebrew|'''ח'''כמינו''' ז'''כרונם''' ל'''ברכה}}, "Our Sages, may their memory be blessed"), refers to all Jewish sages of the [[Mishna]], [[Tosefta]] and [[Talmud]] eras, spanning from the times of the final 300 years of the [[Second Temple of Jerusalem]] until the 6th century CE, or {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;250&amp;nbsp;BCE&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;{{circa}}&amp;nbsp;625&amp;nbsp;CE.

==Rabbinical eras; eras of the Halakha==
{{Rabbinical eras timeline|-250|625|Chazal}}
Chazal are generally divided according to their era and the main writing done in that era:&lt;ref name="daat"&gt;http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=3917&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Soferim]]'' ("scribes"): Sages from before the era of [[Ezra|Ezra the scribe]] until the ''[[Zugot]]'' era, including the men of the [[Great Assembly]].&lt;ref name="daat"/&gt; This era stretches from the ''[[Matan Torah]]'' ("giving of the Law"; [[Mosaic authorship#History of the tradition|Moses receiving the Torah]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai]]), to the ''[[Halakha]]'' ("traditions") era, including the times of [[Simeon the Just]].
* ''[[Zugot]]'' ("pairs"): Five pairs (''zugot'') of sages from consecutive generations, who lived during a period of around 100 years towards the end of the Second Temple era. (142 BCE – ''{{abbr|ca.|circa}}'' 40 BCE)
* ''[[Tannaim]]'' ("teachers"): Refers to the sages of the [[Mishnah]], who lived in the [[Land of Israel]] until 220 CE. In addition to the Mishnah, their writings were preserved in the [[Midrash]]. Key figures among the Tannaim include [[Hillel the Elder]], [[Rabbi Akiva]], and [[Judah the Prince|Judah haNasi]].
* ''[[Amoraim]]'' ("expounders"): Refers to the sages of the [[Talmud]] who were active during the end of the era of the sealing of the Mishnah, and until the times of the sealing of the Talmud (220 CE – 500 CE). The Amoraim sages were active in two areas, the Land of Israel, and [[Babylon]]. In addition to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], their writings were preserved in midrashs such as [[Midrash Rabba]].
* ''[[Savoraim]]'' ("reasoners"): Refers to the sages of ''[[Beth midrash]]'' (Torah study places) in Babylon from the end of the era of the Amoraim (5th century) and until the beginning of the era of the [[Geonim]] (from the end of the 6th century or the midst of the 7th century).

==Chazal's authority==
Until the end of the Savoraim era, Chazal had the authority to comment on the Torah according to the [[Talmudical hermeneutics]] standards required by the [[Halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai]] &lt;ref&gt;"הלכה למשה מסיני" [http://he.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99&amp;oldid=8698156] (Hebrew wikipedia); [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08207.html Halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai], [[Jewish Virtual Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; (The unwritten laws believed to have been given to Moses at Sinai), sometimes even expounding a word or phrase outside its plain and ordinary sense. Nowadays in Orthodoxy, this authority is not delegated to the current generation's sages, and thus the [[Torah]] can not be commentated on, in matters concerning the ''[[halakha]]'' ("tradition"), if it contradicts Chazal's commentary.

Until the middle of the Tannaim era, when there was a [[Sanhedrin]] (a High Court of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]), Chazal had also the authority to decree restrictions and to enact new religious regulations, in any matter they saw fit, concerning issues that were not included in the written Torah, or were not delivered at Mount Sinai. These rabbinical ''[[Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot|mitzvot]]'' ("commandments") include the holidays of [[Purim]] and [[Hanukkah]], the laws of ''[[muktzah]]'' ("set-aside items") on [[Shabbat]], the [[ritual washing in Judaism|ritual washing of one's hands]] (''netilat yadayim'') before eating bread, the construction of ''[[eruv]]im'' (liminal gateways), and the institution of the current schedule of daily prayer services – ''[[shacharit]]'' (morning prayer), ''[[mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer), and ''[[ma'ariv]]'' (evening prayer).

{{Conservatism sidebar}}
'''Christian right''' or '''religious right''' is a term used mainly in the [[United States]] to label [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Christianity and politics|Christian]] [[political faction]]s that are characterized by their strong support of [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies. Christian conservatives principally seek to apply their understanding of the teachings of Christianity to politics and to public policy by proclaiming the value of those teachings or by seeking to use those teachings to influence law and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 Sociology: understanding a diverse society], Margaret L. Andersen, Howard Francis Taylor, Cengage Learning, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-534-61716-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-534-61716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition formed around a core of [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Protestants]] and [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Deckman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last= Deckman|first= Melissa Marie|title= School Board Battles: The Christian Right in Local Politics|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H0SSrYRzK5cC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate= April 10, 2014|year= 2004|publisher= Georgetown University Press|isbn= 9781589010017|page= 48|quote= More than half of all Christian right candidates attend evangelical Protestant churches, which are more theologically liberal.

The movement has its roots in [[American politics]] going back as far as the 1940s and has been especially influential since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=hartsem /&gt;&lt;ref name=williams /&gt; Its influence draws, in part, from grassroots activism as well as from focus on social issues and from the ability to motivate the electorate around those issues.&lt;ref name=Green2006 /&gt;
The Christian right is notable today for advancing socially conservative positions on issues including [[school prayer]], [[intelligent design]], [[embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem cell research]],&lt;ref name="embryonic stem cells" /&gt; [[homosexuality]],&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt; [[Christian views on euthanasia|euthanasia]], [[birth control|contraception]], [[sex education]], [[abortion]],&lt;ref name=Petersen /&gt; and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name=Kaplan /&gt;
Although the term ''Christian right'' is most commonly associated with politics in the United States, similar Christian conservative groups can be found in the political cultures of other Christian-majority nations.

==Terminology==
The Christian right is "also known as the ''New Christian Right'' (NCR) or the ''Religious Right''", although some consider the religious right to be "a slightly broader category than Christian Right".&lt;ref name=hartsem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Cright.htm|title=Content Pages of the Encyclopedia of Religion and Social Science|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230556/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Cright.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wacker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/twenty/tkeyinfo/chr_rght.htm|title=The Christian Right, The Twentieth Century, Divining America: Religion in American History|author=Grant Wacker|publisher=National Humanities Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John C. Green]] of the [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] states that [[Jerry Falwell]] used the label ''religious right'' to describe himself. Gary Schneeberger, vice president of media and public relations for [[Focus on the Family]], states that "[t]erms like 'religious right' have been traditionally used in a pejorative way to suggest extremism. The phrase 'socially conservative evangelicals' is not very exciting, but that's certainly the way to do it."&lt;ref name=ct&gt;Sarah Pulliam: [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/februaryweb-only/106-42.0.html Phrase 'Religious Right' Misused, Conservatives Say] ''Christianity Today'' (Web-only), February 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evangelical leaders like [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] of the [[Family Research Council]] have called attention to the problem of equating the term ''Christian right'' with [[evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. Although evangelicals constitute the core constituency of the Christian right, not all evangelicals fit the description and moreover, a number of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] are also members of the Christian right's core base.&lt;ref name="Deckman2004"/&gt; The problem of description is further complicated by the fact that ''religious conservative'' may refer to other groups. [[Mennonites]] and the [[Amish]], for example, are theologically conservative, however there are no overtly political organizations associated with these denominations.

==History==
[[File:Jerry Falwell portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jerry Falwell]], whose founding of the [[Moral Majority]] was a key step in the formation of the "New Christian Right"]]
Patricia Miller states that the "alliance between evangelical leaders and the Catholic bishops has been a cornerstone of the Christian Right for nearly twenty years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiondispatches.org/meet-the-new-christian-right-same-as-the-old-christian-right/|title=Meet the New Christian Right, Same as the Old Christian Right|last=Miller|first=Patricia|date=December 12, 2016|publisher=[[Religion Dispatches]]|language=English|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1970s, the Christian right has been a notable force in both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] and American politics when Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell and other Christian leaders began to urge conservative Christians to involve themselves in the political process. In response to the rise of the Christian right, the 1980 Republican Party platform assumed a number of its positions, including dropping support for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and adding support for a restoration of [[school prayer]]. The past two decades have been an important time in the political debates and in the same time frame religious citizens became more politically active in a time period labeled the New Christian Right.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Kimberly J., and Chris~ Powell.

While the influence of the Christian right is typically traced to the 1980 Presidential election, Daniel K. Williams argues in ''God's Own Party'' that it had actually been involved in politics for most of the twentieth century. He also notes that the Christian right had previously been in alliance with the Republican Party in the 1940s through 1960s on matters such as opposition to communism and defending "a Protestant-based moral order."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Into the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 election]], Catholics and evangelicals worked against each other, as evangelicals mobilized their forces to defeat Catholics [[Al Smith]] in 1928 and [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Casey, ''The making of a Catholic president: Kennedy vs. Nixon 1960'' (2009) pp. 3–11, 107–18&lt;/ref&gt; Secularization came to be seen by Protestants as the biggest threat to Christian values, however,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1980s Catholic bishops and evangelicals had begun to work together on issues such as abortion.&lt;ref name = "Catholic"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CC"&gt;{{cite book|title=Crisis of Conservatism?: The Republican Party, the Conservative Movement, and American Politics After Bush|author1=Joel D.

Heyer |author2=Mark J. Rozell |author3=Michael A. Genovese |publisher=[[Georgetown University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alienation of [[Southern Democrat]]s from the Democratic Party contributed to the rise of the right, as the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] provoked fear of [[social disintegration]]. In addition, as the Democratic Party became identified with a pro-choice position on abortion and with nontraditional societal values, [[social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] joined the Republican Party in increasing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perlstein |first=Rick | authorlink = Rick Perlstein | title=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America |page=164 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2008 |isbn=978-0743243025|title-link=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] received the support of the Christian right largely because of his much-acclaimed religious conversion. However, Carter's spiritual transformation did not compensate for his liberal policies in the minds of Christian conservatives, as reflected in Jerry Falwell's criticism that "Americans have literally stood by and watched as godless, spineless leaders have brought our nation floundering to the brink of death."&lt;ref name=Reinhard /&gt;

===Ability to organize===
[[File:M4l2004.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Demonstrators at the 2004 [[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]] in Washington D.C.]]
The Christian Right has engaged in battles over abortion, [[Christian views on euthanasia|euthanasia]], [[Christian views on birth control|contraception]], [[Opposition to pornography|pornography]], gambling, [[obscenity]], state sanctioned [[school prayer|prayer in public schools]], textbook contents (concerning [[creationism]]), homosexuality, and [[sexual education]]. The Supreme Court's decision to make abortion a Constitution-protected right in the 1973 ''[[Roe v Wade|Roe v. Wade]]'' ruling was the driving force behind the rise of the Christian Right in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="RozellWilcox1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rozell|first1=Mark J.|last2=Wilcox|first2=Clyde|title=God at the Grass Roots, 1996: The Christian Right in the American Elections|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847686117|page=117|quote=Initially, the abortion issue dominated the agenda of conservative Christians. But as political context changed, more issues were included. Euthanasia, the rights of homosexuals, pornography, sex education in schools, charter and home schools, and gambling have become issues of concern to the "pro-family" movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing political context led to the Christian Right's advocacy for other issues, such as opposition to euthanasia and campaigning for [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref name="RozellWilcox1997"/&gt;

[[Ralph Reed]], the chairman of the Christian Coalition, stated that the [[Pat Robertson#Political service and activism|1988 presidential campaign]] of [[Pat Robertson]] was the 'political crucible' that led to the proliferation of Christian Right groups in the United States.&lt;ref name="RozellWilcox"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rozell|first1=Mark J.|last2=Wilcox|first2=Clyde|title=God at the Grass Roots, 1996: The Christian Right in the American Elections|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847686117|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Wertheimer, on the other hand, has suggested that the New Christian Right Movement's rise was not centered around the issue of abortion, but rather [[Bob Jones University]]'s refusal to comply with the Supreme Court's 1971 ''[[Coit v. Green|Green v. Connally]]'' ruling that permitted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect penalty taxes from private religious schools that violated federal laws.&lt;ref name="ippavyui"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785|title=Evangelical: Religious Right Has Distorted the Faith|date=June 23, 2006|work=NPR.org|author=Linda Wertheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grassroots activism====
Much of the Christian right's power within the American political system is attributed to their extraordinary turnout rate at the polls. The voters that coexist in the Christian right are also highly motivated and driven to get out a viewpoint on issues they care about. As well as high voter turnout, they can be counted on to attend political events, knock on doors and distribute literature. Members of the Christian right are willing to do the electoral work needed to see their candidate elected. Because of their high level of devotion, the Christian right does not need to monetarily compensate these people for their work.&lt;ref name=Green2006&gt;John C. Green and Mark Silk, "Why Moral Values Did Count," Religion in the News, Spring 2005, http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/RINVol8No1/WhyMoral%20ValuesDidCount.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C.

====Political leaders and institutions====

Led by [[Robert Grant (Christian Leader)|Robert Grant]] advocacy group [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]], Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority, [[Ed McAteer]]'s Religious Roundtable Council, [[James Dobson]]'s [[Focus on the Family]], [[Paul Weyrich]]'s [[Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|Free Congress Foundation]] and [[The Heritage Foundation]],&lt;ref name=weyfalw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-weyrich19-2008dec19-story.html#page=1|title=Paul Weyrich, religious conservative and ex-president of Heritage Foundation, dies at 66|author=Elaine Woo|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], the new Religious Right combined conservative politics with evangelical and fundamentalist teachings.&lt;ref name=Himmelstein&gt;Jerome Himmelstein, p. 97; Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Religious Right, p.49–50, Sara Diamond, [[South End Press]], Boston, MA&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of the New Christian right, however, is usually traced to a 1979 meeting where televangelist Jerry Falwell was urged to create a "Moral Majority" organization.&lt;ref name="Martin1996a"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin|first=William|year=1996|title=With God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tzi7bIDP3aMC|location=New York|publisher=Broadway Books |isbn=978-0-553-06745-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamond1995a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sara|first=Diamond|year=1995|title=Roads to Dominion|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-0-89862-864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Weyrich was in a discussion with Falwell when he remarked that there was a "moral majority" of Americans ready to be called to political action.&lt;ref name=weyfalw /&gt; Weyrich later recalled in a 2007 interview with the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] that after he mentioned the term "moral majority," Falwell "turned to his people and said, 'That's the name of our organization.' "&lt;ref name=weyfalw /&gt;

Weyrich would then engineer a strong union between the Republican Party and many culturally conservative Christians.&lt;ref name=weyfalw /&gt; Soon, Moral Majority became a general term for the conservative political activism of evangelists and fundamentalists such as Pat Robertson, [[James Robison (televangelist)|James Robison]], and Jerry Falwell.&lt;ref name=Reinhard&gt;{{cite book|last=Reinhard|first=David|title=The Republican Right since 1945|year=1983|publisher=Univ Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, KY|isbn=978-0813114842|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Schweber, Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, writes that "in the past two decades", "Catholic politicians have emerged as leading figures in the religious conservative movement."&lt;ref name=Schweber2012/&gt;

==Institutions in the United States==

===National organizations===

One early attempt to bring the Christian right into American politics began in 1974 when [[Robert Grant (Christian Leader)|Robert Grant]], an early movement leader, founded American Christian Cause to advocate Christian ideological teachings in Southern California. Concerned that Christians overwhelmingly voted for President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976, Grant expanded his movement and founded [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]] to rally Christian voters behind socially conservative candidates.  Prior to his alliance with Falwell, Weyrich sought an alliance with Grant.&lt;ref name=weyrichgrant /&gt; Grant and other Christian Voice staff soon set up their main office at the headquarters of Weyrich's Heritage Foundation.&lt;ref name=weyrichgrant&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehBRJGC7kq0C&amp;pg=PT122|title=What Every American Should Know About Who's Really Running America|first=Melissa|last=Rossi|date=May 29, 2007|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books|isbn=9781440621031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the alliance between Weyrich and Grant fell apart in 1978.&lt;ref name=weyrichgrant /&gt;

In the late 1980s, Pat Robertson founded the [[Christian Coalition of America]], building from his [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential run]], with Republican activist [[Ralph E. Reed Jr.|Ralph Reed]], who became the spokesman for the Coalition. In 1992, the national Christian Coalition, Inc., headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, began producing voter guides, which it distributed to conservative Christian churches, both Protestant and Catholic, with the blessing of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]].&lt;ref name="SmidtPenning1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smidt|first1=Corwin E.|last2=Penning|first2=James M.|title=Sojourners in the Wilderness: The Christian Right in Comparative Perspective|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|language=English|isbn=9780847686452|page=51|quote=Perhaps the most prominent example of this was when the Archdiocese of New York joined forces with the Christian Coalition during the New York City school board elections in 1993 and allowed the distribution of Christian Coalition voter guides in Catholic parishes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Reed and Robertson, the Coalition quickly became the most prominent voice in the conservative Christian movement, its influence culminating with an effort to support the election of a conservative Christian to the [[United States presidential election, 1996|presidency in 1996]]. In addition, they have encouraged the convergence of conservative Christian ideology with political issues, such as healthcare, the economy, education and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Micklethwait and Wooldridge, The Right Nation, 2005, 111&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Focus on the Family Welcome Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Focus on the Family's Visitor's Welcome Center in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]]]

Political activists lobbied within the Republican party locally and nationally to influence party platforms and nominations.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Rozell, and Wilcox, The Christian right in American Politics, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; More recently James Dobson's group Focus on the Family, based in Colorado Springs, and the Family Research Council in Washington D.C. have gained enormous respect from Republican lawmakers. While strongly advocating for these ideological matters, Dobson himself is more wary of the political spectrum and much of the resources of his group are devoted to other aims such as media.&lt;ref&gt;Micklethwait and Wooldridge, The Right Nation, 2005, 187&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a private citizen, Dobson has stated his opinion on presidential elections; on February 5, 2008, Dobson issued a statement regarding the 2008 presidential election and his strong disappointment with the Republican party's candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizenlink.org/CLtopstories/A000006444.cfm |title=Dr. Dobson: ' I Cannot, and Will Not, Vote for McCain' |publisher=CitizenLink |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay written in 1996, Ralph Reed argued against the [[Moral absolutism|moral absolutist]] tone of Christian right leaders, arguing for the Republican Party Platform to stress the moral dimension of abortion rather than placing emphasis on overturning Roe v. Wade. Reed believes that pragmatism is the best way to advocate for the Christian right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/420824 The Evolving Politics of the Christian Right], Matthew C. Moen, ''PS: Political Science and Politics'', Vol. 29, No. 3 (Sep. 1996), pp. 461–464&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partisan activity of churches===
Overtly partisan actions by churches could threaten their 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status due to the [[Johnson Amendment]] of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charities, Churches and Politics|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=161131,00.html|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one notable example, the former pastor of the East Waynesville Baptist Church in [[Waynesville, North Carolina]] "told the congregation that anyone who planned to vote for Democratic [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[John Kerry]] should either leave the church or [[Repentance|repent]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-05-07-church-politics_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com – Democrats voted out of church because of their politics, members say|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church later expelled nine members who had voted for Kerry and refused to repent, which led to criticism on the national level. The pastor resigned and the ousted church members were allowed to return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/16/national/16church.html Political Split Leaves a Church Sadder and Grayer], ''The New York Times'', May 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral activity===

Christian right organizations sometimes conduct polls to determine which presidential candidates will receive the support of Christian right constituents. One such poll is taken at the [[Family Research Council]]'s Values Voter Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frcaction.org/index.cfm?c=WASH_BRIEFING FRC Action: Tuesday, March 25, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512182418/http://www.frcaction.org/index.cfm?c=WASH_BRIEFING |date=May 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/presidential-hopefuls-highlight-values-to-christian-conservatives-29775/ |title=Presidential Hopefuls Highlight 'Values' to Christian Conservatives |date=October 20, 2007 |last=Vu |first=Michelle |publisher=The Christian Post |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102043700/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20071020/29775_Presidential_Hopefuls_Highlight_'Values'_to_Christian_Conservatives.htm |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |accessdate=May 28, 2018 |dead-url=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; George W.

===Education===
[[File:Donald Trump delivers remarks at the Liberty University.jpg|thumb|[[Jerry Falwell Jr.]] and [[Donald Trump]] at [[Liberty University]].]]
The [[Home School Legal Defense Association]] was co-founded in 1983 by [[Michael Farris (lawyer)|Michael Farris]], who would later establish [[Patrick Henry College]], and Michael Smith. This organization attempts to challenge laws that serve as obstacles to allowing parents to home-school their children and to organize the disparate group of homeschooling families into a cohesive bloc. The number of homeschooling families has increased in the last twenty years, and around 80 percent of these families identify themselves as evangelicals.&lt;ref&gt;Rosin, God's Harvard, 2007, 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The main universities associated with the Christian right in the United States are:

===Media===
The media has played a major role in the rise of the Christian right since the 1920s and has continued to be a powerful force for political Christianity today. The role of the media for the Religious right has been influential in its ability to connect Christian audiences to the larger American culture while at the same time bringing and keeping religion into play as both a political and a cultural force.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; The political agenda of the Christian right has been disseminated to the public through a variety of media outlets including radio broadcasting, television, and literature.

Religious broadcasting began in the 1920s through the radio.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;Diamond, S. (2000) Not by Politics Alone: The Enduring Influence of the Christian right. New York: Guildford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1950s and 1980s, TV became a powerful way for the Christian right to influence the public through shows such as Pat Robertson's ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and [[ABC Family|The Family Channel]]. The Internet has also helped the Christian right reach a much larger audience. Organization's websites play a strong role in popularising the Christian right's stances on cultural and political issues, and informed interested viewers on how to get involved. The Christian Coalition, for example, has used the Internet to inform the public, as well as to sell merchandise and gather members.&lt;ref&gt;"The Christian Coalition of America: America's Leading Grassroots Organization Defending Our Godly Heritage." The Christian Coalition of America. 2006. &lt;http://www.cc.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Education===
The Christian right has strong opinions on how American children should be educated.

The Christian right strongly advocates for a system of educational choice, using a system of [[school voucher]]s, instead of public education. Vouchers would be government funded and could be redeemed for "a specified maximum sum per child per years if spent on approved educational services".&lt;ref&gt;Spring, Joel. ''Political Agendas for Education: From the Religious Right to the Green Party''. Second Edition. (Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  This method would allow parents to determine which school their child attends while relieving the economic burden associated with private schools. The concept is popular among constituents of church-related schools, including those affiliated with Roman Catholicism.

===Evolution===
{{see also|Creation and evolution in public education}}

Members of and organizations associated with the Christian right, such as the [[Discovery Institute]], created and popularized the modern concept of intelligent design, which became widely known only with the publication of the book ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/the-true-origin.html |title=The true origin of 'intelligent design' |last=Matzke |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Matzke |date=August 14, 2007 |website=[[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |type=Blog |accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Discovery Institute, through their intelligent design initiative called the ''[[Center for Science and Culture]]'', has endorsed the [[teach the controversy|teach the controversy approach]].

===Schooling===
The Christian right promotes [[homeschooling]] and private schooling as a valid alternative to public education for parents who object to the content being taught at school. In recent years, the percentage of children being homeschooled has risen from 1.7% of the student population in 1999 to 2.2% in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/index.asp |title=Homeschooling in the United States: 2003 – Executive Summary |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this increase has been attributed to the desire to incorporate Christian teachings into the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Sep07/Art_Sep07_02.html |title=Popularity of homeschooling rises nationwide, curriculum concerns, safety cited |publisher=Christianexaminer.com |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, 72% of parents who homeschooled their children cited the ability to provide religious or moral instruction as the reason for removing their children from public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/homeschool/parentsreasons.asp |title=Homeschooling in the United States: 2003 – Parents' Reasons for Homeschooling |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' case established that [[creationism]] cannot be taught in public schools, and in response officials have increasingly appropriated public funds for [[Charter schools in the United States|charter schools]] that teach curricula like [[Accelerated Christian Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/01/creationism_in_texas_public_schools_undermining_the_charter_movement.single.html|title=Creationism in Texas public schools: Undermining the charter movement.|author=Zack Kopplin|date=January 16, 2014|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of government===
Supporters of the Christian right have no one unified stance on the role of government since the movement is primarily one that advocates [[social conservatism]]; in fact, "struggles [have] broken out in state party organizations" between supporters of the Christian right and other conservatives.&lt;ref name="Farney2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farney|first=James Harold|title=Social Conservatives and Party Politics in Canada and the United States|year=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|language=English|isbn=9781442612600|page=61|quote=Struggles broke out in state party organizations between social conservatives - in general organized by the Christian Coalition - and party activists more interested in fiscal policy, foreign policy, or simply winning office.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/twenty/tkeyinfo/chr_rght.htm |title=The Christian Right, The Twentieth Century, Divining America: Religion in American History, TeacherServe, National Humanities Center |publisher=Nationalhumanitiescenter.org |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes conservative interpretations of the Bible as the basis for moral values and enforcing such values by legislation. Some members of the Christian right, especially Catholics, accept the Catholic Church's strong support for [[labor union]]s.

===Separation of church and state===
{{see also|Accommodationism}}
The Christian right believes that separation of church and state is not explicit in the American Constitution, believing instead that such separation is a creation of what it claims are activist judges in the judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrobertson.com/Teaching/Teachingonfirstamendment.asp|title=The First Amendment|publisher=PatRobertson.com|author=Pat Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html |title=Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ThinkExist.com Quotations |url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_purpose_of_separation_of_church_and_state_is/212643.html |title=James Madison quotes |publisher=Thinkexist.com |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Christian right often supports their claims by asserting that the country was "[[Christian nationalism|founded by Christians as a Christian Nation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.RES.888:|title=House Resolution 888 United States House of Representatives (Bill Text – 110th Congress (2007–2008) – THOMAS)|publisher=Library of Congress|date=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=A Nonbeliever |url=http://freethought.mbdojo.com/foundingfathers.html |title=America is not founded upon Christianity but the Enlightenment |publisher=Freethought.mbdojo.com |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Christian right take the position that the Establishment Clause bars the federal government from establishing or sponsoring a state church (e.g., the Church of England), but does not prevent the government from acknowledging religion. The Christian right points out that the term "separation of church and state" is derived from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson, not from the Constitution itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Shanea |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2006/06/the-mythical-wall-of-separation-how-a-misused-metaphor-changed-church-state-law-policy-and-discourse |title=The Mythical "Wall of Separation": How a Misused Metaphor Changed Church–State Law, Policy, and Discourse |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frc.org/familypolicylecture/policy-lecture--wall-of-separation-between-church-and-state |title=Wall of Separation Between Church and State: Myth, Reality, Results |publisher=Family Research Council |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charles E.

Thus, Christian right leaders have argued that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the display of religion in the public sphere. Leaders therefore believe that public institutions should be allowed, or even required, to display the [[Ten Commandments]]. This interpretation has been repeatedly rejected by the courts, which have found that such displays violate the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]]. Public officials though are prohibited from using their authority in which the primary effect is "advancing or prohibiting religion", according to the Lemon Supreme Court test, and there cannot be an "excessive entanglement with religion" and the government. Some, such as Bryan Fischer of the [[American Family Association]], argue that the First Amendment, which specifically restricts Congress, applies only to the Congress and not the states. This position rejects the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://action.afa.net/Blogs/BlogPost.aspx?id=2147492060 |title=The First Amendment means what it says - RIGHTLYCONCERNED.COM |publisher=Action.afa.net |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the Christian right supports the presence of religious institutions within government and the public sphere, and advocates for fewer restrictions on government funding for religious charities and schools. Both Catholics and Protestants, according to a 2005 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] study, have been supportive of [[school prayer]] in public schools.&lt;ref name="Wilson2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GallupNewport2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gallup|first1=Alec|last2=Newport|first2=Frank|title=The Gallup Poll: Public Opinion 2005|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|language=English|isbn=9780742552586|page=318|quote=Related to their support of school prayer, most Americans also believe that religion should have a greater "presence" in public schools. ... Protestants are most likely to favor school prayer (82%), followed closely by Catholics (75%).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Early American fundamentalists, such as [[John R. Rice]]&lt;ref name="ah"&gt;"[Rice] melded politics and religion in a way that made it very clear what side of any political
issue he believed God was on. God had been very clearly opposed to the New Deal "socialism" of Franklin Roosevelt,
and God was equally opposed to the Great Society "socialism" of Lyndon Baines Johnson". Andrew Himes,

===Middle East===
{{See also|Israel lobby in the United States}}
Many evangelical Protestant supporters of the religious right have given very strong support to the state of [[Israel]] in recent decades, encouraging support for Israel in the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Spector, ''Evangelicals and Israel: the story of American Christian Zionism'' (2008) pp 23–49&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have linked Israel to Biblical prophesies; for example, Ed McAteer, founder of the Moral Majority, said "I believe that we are seeing prophecy unfold so rapidly and dramatically and wonderfully and, without exaggerating, makes me breathless."&lt;ref&gt;Jan G. Linn, ''What's Wrong With The Christian Right'' (2004) p 27&lt;/ref&gt; This belief, an example of [[dispensationalism]], arises from the idea that the establishment of Israel is a prerequisite for the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, because it represents the Biblically prophesied [[Gathering of Israel]]. A 2017 poll indicates that this belief is held by 80% of evangelicals, and that half of evangelicals consider it an important cause of their support for the state of Israel. &lt;ref&gt; Bump, Philip. May 14, 2017. "Half of evangelicals support Israel because they believe it is important for fulfilling end-times prophecy" .https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/14/half-of-evangelicals-support-israel-because-they-believe-it-is-important-for-fulfilling-end-times-prophecy/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.a6be1040970d&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion and contraception===
{{See also|Bioethics|Consistent life ethic}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
The Christian right opposes abortion, believing that life begins at [[Human fertilization|conception]] and that abortion is murder. Therefore, those in the movement have worked toward the overturning of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', and have also supported incremental steps to make abortion less available. Such efforts include bans on [[late-term abortion]] (including [[intact dilation and extraction]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abortion/2003s3.html Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003] 108th United States Congress (1st session)&lt;/ref&gt; prohibitions against Medicaid funding and other public funding for elective abortions, removal of taxpayer funding for [[Planned Parenthood]] and other organizations that provide abortion services, legislation requiring [[parental consent]] or notification for abortions performed on [[minor (law)|minors]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.dailypress.com/1994-04-09/news/9404090085_1_parental-notification-notification-bill-abortion Allen Wants Parents Notified – Daily Press]. Articles.dailypress.com (April 9, 1994). Retrieved on August 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; legal protections for unborn victims of violence, [[BAIPA|legal protections for infants born alive]] following failed abortions, and bans on [[abortifacient]] medications.

The Christian right contends that morning-after pills such as [[Plan B (drug)|Plan B]] and [[Ulipristal acetate|Ella]] are possible abortifacients, able to interfere with a [[fertilized egg]]'s [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] in the [[uterine wall]].&lt;ref name="abortifacients"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/health/research/morning-after-pills-dont-block-implantation-science-suggests.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Abortion Qualms on Morning-After Pill May Be Unfounded|last=Belluck|first=Pam|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The labeling mandated by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for Plan B and Ella state that
they may interfere with implantation, but according to a June 2012, ''The New York Times'' article, many scientists believe that they work only by interfering with [[ovulation]] and are arguing to have the implantation language removed from product labels. The Christian right maintains that the chemical properties of morning-after pills make them abortifacients and that the politics of abortion is influencing scientific judgments. Jonathan Imbody of the [[Christian Medical Association]] says he questions "whether ideological considerations are driving these decisions."&lt;ref name="abortifacients"/&gt; Specifically, many Catholic members, as well as some conservative Protestant members, of the Christian right have campaigned against contraception altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2014/01/06/catholic-groups-trying-to-eliminate-coverage-of-contraception-no-matter-who-pays/|title=Catholic Groups Trying to Eliminate Coverage of Contraception No Matter Who Pays: The latest court challenges to the birth control benefit show how much the fight against the contraception mandate is really about the Christian right trying to establish an employer's "right" to control your private sex life.|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|date=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Rewire (website)|Rewire]]|language=English|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Contra-Contraception|last=Shorto|first=Russell|date=May 7, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
{{expand section|date = February 2015}}
According to some [[social science]] research, Christians and members of the Christian right are typically less concerned about issues of environmental responsibility than the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherkat | first1 = D.

===Biotechnology===
Due to the Christian right's views regarding ethics and to an extent due to negative views of [[eugenics]] common to most ideologies in North America, it has worked for the regulation and restriction of certain applications of [[biotechnology]]. In particular, the Christian right opposes therapeutic and reproductive [[human cloning]], championing a 2005 United Nations ban on the practice,&lt;ref name="human cloning ban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/2/19/102711.shtml|title=U.N. Adopts Pro-Life Declaration Against Human Cloning|work=Newsmax|date=February 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human embryonic [[stem cell research]], which involves the extraction of one or more cells from a human embryo.&lt;ref name="embryonic stem cells"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.necn.com/06/14/12/U-M-6-new-stem-cell-lines-available-for-/landing_scitech.html?&amp;apID=22fa19f8d6a8466184e77507936d67b2|title=U-M: 6 new stem cell lines available for research|agency=Associated Press|date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian right supports research with [[adult stem cell]]s, [[amniotic stem cell]]s, and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s which do not use cells from human embryos, as they view the harvesting of biological material from an embryo lacking the ability to give permission as an assault on a living being.

The Christian right also opposes [[euthanasia]], and, in one highly publicized case, took an active role in seeking governmental intervention to prevent [[Terri Schiavo]] from being deprived of nutrition and [[Dehydration|hydration]].

===Sex and sexuality===
The modern roots of the Christian right's views on sexual matters were evident in the 1950s, a period in which many Christian conservatives in the United States viewed sexual promiscuity as not only excessive, but in fact as a threat to their ideal vision of the country.&lt;ref name=Herman&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Didi|title=The Antigay Agenda: Orthodox Vision and the Christian Right|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-32764-8}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 20, 2012--&gt;{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}
Beginning in the 1970s, conservative Christian protests against promiscuity began to surface, largely as a reaction to the "permissive sixties" and an emerging prominence of sexual rights arising from ''Roe v Wade'' and the gay rights movement. The Christian right proceeded to make sexuality issues a priority political cause.&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;{{rp|28}}

The Christian right champions itself as the "self-appointed conscience of American society". During the 1980s, the movement was largely dismissed by political pundits and mainstream religious leaders as "a collection of buffoonish has-beens". Later, it re-emerged, better organized and more focused, taking firm positions against abortion, pornography, sexual deviancy, and extreme feminism.&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=George R.|title=Shotgun Wedding: Notes on Public Education's Encounter with the New Christian Right|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|date=May 1994|volume=75|issue=9}}{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Hohn|title=THE VALUES CAMPAIGN?

Slate, 15 Feb. 2018.  ''Slate''.  Start listening at 37:00.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influential Christian right organizations at the forefront of the anti-gay rights movement in the United States include Focus on the Family, Family Research Council and the [[Family Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;{{rp|15–16}} An important stratagem in Christian right anti-gay politics is in its rejection of "the edicts of a Big Brother" state, allowing it to profit from "a general feeling of discontent and demoralization with government". As a result, the Christian right has endorsed smaller government, restricting its ability to arbitrate in disputes regarding values and traditions. In this context, gay rights laws have come to symbolize the government's allegedly unconstitutional "[interference] with individual freedom".&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;{{rp|170–171}}

The central tenets of Focus on the Family and similar organizations, such as the Family Research Council, emphasise issues such as abortion and the necessity of gender roles. A number of organizations, including the New Christian Right, "have in various ways rejected liberal America in favor of the regulation of pornography, anti-abortion legislation, the criminalization of homosexuality, and the virtues of faithfulness and loyalty in sexual partnerships", according to sociologist [[Bryan S. Turner|Bryan Turner]].&lt;ref name=Petersen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petersen|first=David L.|title=Genesis and Family Values|journal= Journal of Biblical Literature|year=2005|volume=124|issue=1}}{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the Christian right often come from Christians who believe Jesus' message was centered on [[social responsibility]] and [[social justice]]. Theologian Michael Lerner has summarized: "The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a revulsion against God and religion by identifying them with militarism, ecological irresponsibility, fundamentalist antagonism to science and rational thought, and insensitivity to the needs of the poor and the powerless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Interpretation of Christianity===
{{See also|Christian left}}
One argument which questions the legitimacy of the Christian right posits that [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] may be considered a leftist on the modern [[political spectrum]]. Jesus' concern with the poor and feeding the hungry, among other things, are argued, by proponents of Christian leftism, to be core attributes of modern-day socialism and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=A Political Glossary|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/right-wing |publisher=Auburn University  |last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Right-wing, rightist|year=2005|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, Norberto and Allan Cameron,''Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The notion that conservative Christians want to reinstitute slavery and rule by genocide is not just crazy, it's downright dangerous. The most disturbing part of the ''Harper's'' cover story (the one by Chris Hedges) was the attempt to link Christian conservatives with Hitler and fascism. Once we acknowledge the similarity between conservative Christians and fascists, Hedges appears to suggest, we can confront Christian evil by setting aside 'the old polite rules of democracy.'

While the Christian Right is a strong movement in the United States, it has a presence as well in Canada.

===Canada===
{{further|Conservatism in Canada}}
{{See also|Abortion in Canada}}
Religion has been a key factor in Canadian politics since well before [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, when the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] were the party of traditionalist Catholics and Anglicans and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] were the party of [[Protestant]] dissenters and [[anti-clerical]] Catholics. This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the [[Christian left]] (represented by the [[Social Gospel]] philosophy and [[ecumenicism]]) and the Christian right (represented by [[fundamentalism]] and [[biblical literalism]]). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] while the right moved to the [[Social Credit Party (Canada)|Social Credit Party]], especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]].

The Social Credit Party, founded in 1935 represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as "[[worldly]]", and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher [[William Aberhart]] or "Bible Bill". Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the [[monetary reform]] theories of [[social credit]] to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple [[Ernest Manning]] then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada. In 1987 Manning's son, [[Preston Manning]], founded the new [[Reform Party of Canada]], which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the [[official opposition]] from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], led by [[Stephen Harper]], a member of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], who went on to become [[prime minister of Canada|prime minister]] in 2006.

Canada has had a [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] since the [[Canadian Constitution]] was patriated in 1982. As a result, there have been major changes in the law's application to issues that bear on individual and minority group rights. Abortions were completely decriminalized after two R. v. Morgentaler cases ([[R. v. Morgentaler|in 1988]] and [[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)|in 1993]]). A series of provincial superior court decisions allowing same-sex marriage led the federal government to introduce legislation that introduced [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage in all of Canada]]. Former [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] stated before taking office that he would hold a free vote on the issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2005/11/29/harper-smaesex051129.html |title=Harper reopens same-sex marriage debate |publisher=CBC TV |date=November 30, 2005 |accessdate=February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but declared the issue closed after a vote in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061207/samesexmarriage_vote_061207?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |title=Harper declares same-sex marriage issue closed |accessdate=February 29, 2008 |date=December 7, 2006 |publisher=CTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Evangelical Christian politics in Latin America}}
{{See also|Conservative wave}}

Christian right politics in [[Latin America]] is strongly connected with the growing [[Evangelical Christian]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Corrales |first1=Javier |title=A Perfect Marriage: Evangelicals and Conservatives in Latin America |date=17 January 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/opinion/evangelicals-politics-latin-america.html |accessdate=2 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lissardy |first1=Gerardo |title="La fuerza política más nueva": cómo los evangélicos emergen en el mapa de poder en América Latina |url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-43706779 |accessdate=2 June 2018 |agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics in Latin America despite being normally socially conservative tend to be more left-wing in economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Julia |title=The Church in Latin America |url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/church-latin-america |accessdate=2 June 2018 |agency=Commonweal Magazine |date=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Christianity and Conflict in Latin America |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2006/04/06/christianity-and-conflict-in-latin-america/ |accessdate=2 June 2018 |agency=Pew Research Center |date=6 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the traditional teachings of the [[Catholic social doctrine]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Evangelical Christians on the other hand are mostly from the [[Neo-Pentecostalism|neo-Pentecostal movement]] and thus believers in the [[Prosperity Theology]] which justify most of their [[neoliberal]] economic ideas.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; They are also strongly socially conservative even for Latin American standards.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands Calvinist Protestants have long had their own political parties, now called the [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) on the right, and the [[ChristianUnion]] (CU) in the center. For generations they operated their own newspapers and broadcasting association. The SGP has about 28,000 members, and three members of parliament, of the 150. It has always been in opposition to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Day, ''Political parties of the world'' (2002) p 343&lt;/ref&gt; The SGP has helped the Dutch government to get laws through the Second Chamber 2010–2012. In exchange that government did not increase the number of Sundays on which shopping is allowed.

===Other countries===
In [[Northern Ireland]], [[Ian Paisley]] led a Protestant fundamentalist party, the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], which had a considerable influence on the province's culture.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent, ''Modern Political Ideologies''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009. {{ISBN|1405154950}} (p. 325).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Davis, ''Mirror Hate: the Convergent Ideology of Northern Ireland paramilitaries, 1966–1992''. Dartmouth, 1994. {{ISBN|1855215586}} . (p.80)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[2017 UK general election]], the DUP has provided [[confidence and supply]] to the governing Conservative Party, although this agreement provoked concern from socially liberal elements of the party about possible DUP influence on social policy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kentish|first1=Ben|title=Conservative LGBT activists raise fears over DUP's 'appalling' record on gay rights|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-lgbt-dup-gay-rights-ruth-davidson-scottish-tory-leader-activists-record-a7783306.html|accessdate=11 June 2017|work=The Independent|date=10 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626050438/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-lgbt-dup-gay-rights-ruth-davidson-scottish-tory-leader-activists-record-a7783306.html|archivedate=26 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . [[Karen Armstrong]] has mentioned English evangelical leader [[Colin Urquhart]] as advocating positions similar to the Christian Right.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong, ''A History of God: the 4000-year quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.'' Ballantine Books, 1994 p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the members of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] also support some of the values of the Christian right.

In Australia, fundamentalist Christianity is the base for [[Fred Nile]] and his [[Christian Democratic Party (Australia)|Christian Democratic Party]] as well as the [[Family First Party]]. Nile in 1967–68 was Assistant Director of the Billy Graham Crusade in Sydney. Both parties promote social conservatism, opposing gay rights and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Nile, ''Fred Nile: Autobiography'' (Sydney: Strand Publishing: 2001) {{ISBN|1-876825-79-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some party members of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] and the [[Australian Labor Party]] also support some of the values of the Christian right on abortion and gay rights. The [[Australian Christian Lobby]] argues for opposition to same-sex marriage in state and federal politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/state-election-2012/christianity-and-the-lnp-20120207-1r60g.html|title=Christianity and the LNP|work=Brisbane Times|date=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], due to [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization]], and the introduction of the Catholic Church, religious conservatism has a strong influence on national policies. Some have argued that the U.S. Christian right may have borrowed beliefs from the Filipino religious conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadal |first=Kevin |date=2011 |title=Filipino American Psychology: A Handbook of Theory, Research, and Clinical Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN7-s84jAkoC&amp;lpg=PT42&amp;dq=Conservatism%20Philippines&amp;pg=PT42#v=onepage&amp;q=Conservatism%20Philippines&amp;f=false |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=42 |isbn=9781118019771 |accessdate=August 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss [[Federal Democratic Union]] is a small conservative Protestant party with about 1% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Day, ''Political parties of the world'' (2002) p 449&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scandinavia]], the [[Centre Party (Faroe Islands)|Centre Party]] is a bible-oriented fundamentalist party; it has about 4% of the votes in the Faroe Islands. However, the Norwegian [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian People's Party]], the Swedish [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]] and Danish [[Christian Democrats (Denmark)|Christian Democrats]] are less religiously orthodox and are similar to mainstream European [[Christian Democracy]].

In [[Fiji]], [[Social Democratic Liberal Party|Sodelpa]] is a conservative, nationalist party which seeks to make Christianity the [[state religion]], while the [[constitution of Fiji|constitution]] makes Fiji a secular republic. Following the 2014 general election, Sodelpa is the main opposition party in Parliament.

In [[Brazil]], the evangelical bloc have a great influence at the parliament and in the society in general. The bloc promotes strong socially conservative positions, like [[Pro-life|opposition to abortion]], LGBT rights, [[marijuana]] legalization, sexual and gender education at schools and support to decrease of age of defense of infancy. The [[Party of the Republic]], the [[Brazilian Republican Party]] and the [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]] are the main parties of the bloc, but except to [[left-wing politics|left-wings]] and far-left parties with strong social progressive beliefs like [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] or [[Socialism and Liberty Party]], Christian conservatives can be found in all political parties of Brazil. In 2016, [[Marcelo Crivella]], a licensed [[pentecostal]] pastor from the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], won in a runoff the election to mayor of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the second biggest city in Brazil, with the Brazilian Republican Party, making for the first time an evangelical bloc member mayor of a big city in Brazil.

The Christian right has a strong position in several Conservative parties worldwide, although many members of these parties would also, paradoxically, strongly oppose such views.

The '''''Chronicon Suevicum universale''''' ({{lang-de|Schwäbische Weltchronik}}, "Swabian World Chronicle"), written around 1045 in [[Medieval Latin|Latin]], is a chronicle of [[universal history]] in the form of [[annals]] for the years from Creation down to 1043. It was once commonly associated with the [[monastery of Saint Gall]], but is now thought to have been composed by a monk of [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]]. On the first hypothesis, it has been called the ''Epitome Sangallense Herimanni Augiensis'', a Saint Gall version of [[Hermann of Reichenau]]'s chronicle. On the second, it has been called the ''Reichenauer Weltchronik''.

'''''Collectio Avellana''''' (the "Avellana Compilation") is a collection of 244 documents, dating from AD 367 to 553, that includes many imperial letters written to [[pope]]s and others, imperial acts and papal letters and other documents that were gathered just after the mid-6th century. Many of the documents have not been preserved in any other collection. Contemporary copies have not survived: the oldest and best manuscript is in the [[Vatican Library]], Vat. lat. 3787 (XI). This is the text that was edited by O. Guenther, ''Epistolae Imperatorum Pontificum Aliorum Inde ab a. CCCLXVII usque DLIII datae Avellana Quae Dicitur Collectio'', in ''Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum'', Vol. 35, in 2 parts (Prague/Vienna/Leipzig, 1895). 

The compiler(s) of ''Collectio Avellana'' aimed to fill the gaps of previous compilations. The author or authors must have had access to archives of the [[See of Rome]], since they incorporated into the collection a variety of papal documents not in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' and imperial acts.

'''''Coral Gardens and Their Magic''''', properly '''''Coral Gardens and Their Magic: A Study of the Methods of Tilling the Soil and of Agricultural Rites in the Trobriand Islands''''', is the final book in anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] trilogy on the lives of the [[Trobriand Islanders]]. It concentrates on the cultivation practices the Trobriand Islanders used to grow yams, [[taro]], bananas and palms.&lt;ref name="Duranti"/&gt; It describes the gardens in which the Trobrianders grew food as more than merely utilitarian spaces, even as [[Aesthetics|works of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Tim |last=Ingold |chapter=Growing plants and raising animals: an anthropological perspective on domestication |title=The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in Eurasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zkteuesBwpQC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22coral+gardens+and+their+magic%22 |isbn=1-85728-538-7 |year=1996 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 [[Alfred Gell]] called the book "still the best account of any primitive technological-cum-[[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] system, and unlikely ever to be superseded in this respect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Alfred |last=Gell |title=Technology and Magic |journal=Anthropology Today |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=April 1988 |page=9 |doi=10.2307/3033230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been described as Malinowski's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ariel |last=Glucklich |title=The end of magic |page=43 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-510879-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JVwXxdOIPWwC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book consists of seven parts divided over two volumes. Volume I, ''The Description of Gardening'', contains the introduction and parts one to three, and volume II, ''The Language of Magic and Gardening'', parts four to seven.
*Part One: "Introduction: Tribal economics and social organisation of the Trobrianders"&lt;br /&gt;This part introduces the climate, industry, and gardening arrangements of the Trobriands and supplies initial anthropological data on the Trobriand Islanders, including by sketching out their [[social organization]] and economic institutions.
* Part Two: "Gardens and their magic on a coral atoll"&lt;br /&gt;This part describes the role of magic in Trobriand gardening, the rites it involves, Trobriand theories of [[land tenure]], and the technology and spaces associated with gardening practices. It also considers the methodological limitations of various approaches to ethnographic fieldwork, especially in relation to terminology.
* Part Three: "Documents and appendices"&lt;br /&gt;collection of documents, including plans of buildings, lineage and title diagrams, explanations of the calculation of [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|gift obligations]], and a set of notes on ethnographic methodology and its limitations.
* Part Four: "An ethnographic theory of language and some practical corollaries"&lt;br /&gt;This part considers language as a tool, a document, and a cultural reality. It discusses the difficulties of translation and the overlap and boundaries of concepts, and brings context to bear on interpretation, for the anthropologist and for the speakers. It engages with the question of pragmatics, and of the way meaning relates to words
* Part Five: "Corpus inscriptionum agriculturae quiriviniensis; or the language of gardens"&lt;br /&gt;A linguistic supplement, outlining a vocabulary of Trobriand gardening terminology and magical words.
* Part Six: "An ethnographic theory of the magical word"&lt;br /&gt;This part advances a theory of magical language, both in the Trobriand case specifically and in general terms. Malinowski argues that Trobriand magic spells, like all forms of language, must be understood in context, as "verbal acts", with a predominantly pragmatic function. Language, including magical language, is intended primarily not to communicate thought, but to bring about practical effects. This theory of a pragmatic function of language as a functional aspect of [[human behaviour]], is an early anthropological contribution to the theory of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Duranti"/&gt; 
* Part Seven: "Magical formulae"&lt;br /&gt;This section presents some Trobriand magical spells, together with Malinowski's word-by-word analysis.

==Reception==
The work continues to receive attention from contemporary anthropologists. Its assessment of the Trobriand chief's role as that of a "glorified brother-in-law" to the whole community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Austronesian chiefs: metaphorical or fractal fathers? Comment on article by Mark S. Mosko. |first=Per |last=Hage |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=l |page=763 |date=December 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one with which later anthropologists have taken issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Mark S. |last=Mosko |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=1 |year=1995 |title=Rethinking Trobriand chieftainship}}&lt;/ref&gt; It records unusually extensive [[ethnolinguistic]] data for of a work of its time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Magical Power of Words |first=Stanley J. |last=Tambiah |journal=Man |series=New Series |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=June 1968 |pages= 175–208 |doi=10.2307/2798500}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of it relating to gardening spells that the Trobriand Islanders used, and much of it incompletely analysed; it continues to provide a data source for anthropologists of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Peter |last=Appelbome |title=Word for Word / Anthropology Abstracts; A Trans-Narrating, Ethnographic Good Time Was Had by All |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/weekinreview/word-for-word-anthropology-abstracts-trans-narrating-ethnographic-good-time-was.html |date=11 December 1994 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malinowski was also praised for his serious engagement with the realities of Trobriand agriculture, its emphasis on its ceremonial aspects notwithstanding, in favour of a simpler, romanticized view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ruth |last=Blair |chapter=Transported landscapes: reflections on empire and environment in the Pacific |title=Five emus to the King of Siam |editor=Helen Tiffin |publisher=Rodopi |year=2007 |isbn=90-420-2243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is also regarded as a pioneering text in the interdisciplinary study of [[pragmatics]]. Its analysis of the context and contents of Trobriand spells was one of the first to bring ethnography to bear on the subject of language.&lt;ref name="Duranti"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Alessandro |last=Duranti |title=Linguistic Anthropology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FNa6B4bQh4C |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |pages= 216–217 |isbn=978-0-521-44993-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release details==
In a letter written around February 1929, Malinowski wrote that he was basing the monograph partly upon a draft manuscript on gardening he had written during 1916 and 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The story of a marriage |publisher=Routledge |year=1995 |first=Bronisław |last=Malinowski |isbn=0-415-12077-2 |page=137 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EF6Q0Dgrg5EC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was published by [[Routledge]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Roger |last=Sanjek |title=Fieldnotes |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1990 |page=208 |isbn=0-8014-9726-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kjOJT739rO0C&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22coral+gardens+and+their+magic%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been through several editions, including a 1966 second edition by Allen and Unwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Bronisław |last=Malinowski |title=Coral gardens and their magic |publisher=Allen and Unwin |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; US editions were published in 1965 and 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Search results for "Coral Gardens and their Magic" |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=11 June 2009 |url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;Search_Arg=coral+gardens+and+their+magic&amp;Search_Code=TKEY^*&amp;CNT=100&amp;hist=1&amp;type=quick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Croatisation''' [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|or]] '''Croatization''' ({{lang-hr|kroatizacija}}, or ''pohrvaćenje''; {{lang-it|croatizzazione}}) is a process of [[cultural assimilation]], and its consequences, in which people or lands ethnically only partially [[Croats|Croatian]] or non-Croatian become Croatian.

== Croatisation of Serbs ==

=== Religion ===

[[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] in the Roman Catholic [[Croatian Military Frontier]] were out of the jurisdiction of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] and in 1611, after demands from the community, the Pope establishes the [[Eparchy of Marča]] (''Vratanija'') with seat at the Serbian-built [[Marča Monastery]] and instates a [[Byzantine]] [[vicar]] as bishop sub-ordinate to the Roman Catholic [[bishop of Zagreb]], working to bring Serbian Orthodox Christians into communion with Rome which caused struggle of power between the Catholics and the Serbs over the region. In 1695 Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of ''[[Lika]]-[[Krbava]] and [[Zrinopolje]]'' is established by metropolitan [[Atanasije Ljubojevic]] and certified by Emperor [[Josef I, Holy Roman Emperor|Josef I]] in 1707. In 1735 the Serbian Orthodox protested in the Marča Monastery and becomes part of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] until 1753 when the Pope restores the Roman Catholic clergy. On 17 June 1777 the [[Eparchy of Križevci]] is permanently established by [[Pope Pius VI]] with see at [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]], near [[Zagreb]], thus forming the [[Croatian Greek Catholic Church]] which would after World War I include other people; Rusyns and Ukrainians of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="ER"&gt;{{Google books |id=ovCVDLYN_JgC |title=Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{Google books |id=0pmkrY29qkIC |title=Geopolitics of European Union Enlargement: The Fortress Empire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Croatisation in the NDH ==
The Croatisation during [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) was aimed primarily to Serbs, with Italian, Jews and Roma to a lesser degree. The [[Ustaše]] aim was a "pure Croatia" and the biggest enemy was the ethnic Serbs of [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]]. The ministers announced the goals and strategies of the Ustaše in May 1941. The same statements and similar or related ones were also repeated in public speeches by single ministers as [[Mile Budak]] in [[Gospic]] and, a month later, by [[Mladen Lorkovic]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Gobetti, ''"L' occupazione allegra. Gli italiani in Jugoslavia (1941–1943)"'', Carocci, 2007, 260 pages; {{ISBN|88-430-4171-1}}, {{ISBN|978-88-430-4171-8}}, quoting from V. Novak, Sarajevo 1964 and Savez jevrejskih opstina FNR Jugoslavije, Beograd 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

*One third of the Serbs (in the [[Independent State of Croatia]]) were to be forcibly converted to Catholicism.
*One third of the Serbs were to be expelled (ethnically cleansed).
*One third of the Serbs were to be killed.

== Croatisation in Dalmatia ==
Even with a predominant Croatian majority, [[Dalmatia]] retained relatively large [[Italian people|Italian communities]] in the coast (Italian majority in some cities and islands, largest concentration in [[Istria]]). Italians in Dalmatia kept key political positions and Croatian majority had to make an enormous effort to get Croatian language into schools and offices. Most [[Dalmatian Italians]] gradually assimilated to the prevailing Croatian culture and language between the 1860s and World War I, although [[Italian language]] and culture remained present in Dalmatia. The community was granted minority rights in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]; during the Italian occupation of Dalmatia in World War II, it was caught in the ethnic violence towards non-Italians during fascist repression: what remained of the community fled the area after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Društvo književnika Hrvatske, ''[https://books.google.com/books?ei=JlYZTMOvNsaj_Qa_4MGSDA&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=it&amp;id=mX9lAAAAMAAJ&amp;dqs&amp;q=Croatisation+after+World+War+II#search_anchor Bridge]'', Volume 1995, Numbers 9–10, Croatian literature series – Ministarstvo kulture, Croatian Writer's Association, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== During and prior to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ==
Following the establishment of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]] in November 1991, and especially from May 1992 forward, the Herzeg-Bosnia leadership engaged in continuing and coordinated efforts to dominate and "Croatise" (or ethnically cleanse) the municipalities which they claimed were part of Herzeg-Bosnia, with increasing persecution and discrimination directed against the [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] population.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Blaškić verdict - A.

The Lasva Valley: May 1992&amp;nbsp;– January 1993 – c) The municipality of Kiseljak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian symbols and currency were introduced, and Croatian curricula and the Croatian language were introduced in schools. Many Bosniaks were removed from positions in government and private business; humanitarian aid was managed and distributed to the Bosniaks' disadvantage; and Bosniaks in general were increasingly harassed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Many of them were deported to [[concentration camp]]s: [[Heliodrom camp|Heliodrom]], [[Dretelj camp|Dretelj]], [[Gabela camp|Gabela]], [[Vojno camp|Vojno]], and Šunje.

== Notable individuals who voluntarily Croatised ==
*[[Dimitrija Demeter]], a playwright who was the author of the first modern Croatian drama, was from a [[Greeks|Greek]] family.
*[[Vatroslav Lisinski]], a composer, was originally named ''Ignaz Fuchs''. His Croatian name is a literal translation.
*[[Bogoslav Šulek]], a [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] and inventor of many Croatian scientific terms, was originally ''Bohuslav Šulek'' from [[Slovakia]].

{{macOS topics}}
'''Dictionary''' is an [[Application software|application]] developed by [[Apple Inc.]] as a part of [[macOS]].  The application provides definitions and synonyms from various dictionaries, [[Wikipedia]] articles and a glossary of Apple-related terms.

Dictionary was introduced in [[Mac OS X Tiger|OS X 10.4]] with the [[New Oxford American Dictionary]] and ''Oxford American Writer's Thesaurus'' (as well as the Wikipedia and Apple sections). [[Mac OS X Leopard|10.5]] added Japanese dictionaries, [[Mac OS X Lion|10.7]] added the British [[Oxford Dictionary of English]], and [[OS X Mountain Lion|10.8]] added French, German, Spanish and Chinese.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:OPENSTEP Digital Webster.jpg|left|thumb|Digital Webster]] --&gt;
OS X's progenitor, [[OPENSTEP]] (and [[NEXTSTEP]]) provided similar functionality, called Digital Webster, providing [[dictionary]] and [[thesaurus]] definitions from [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary and Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus]] (termed the "First Digital Edition"). OPENSTEP Services provide lookup from all applications.

Dictionary was first introduced with [[Mac OS X v10.4]] "Tiger" and provided definitions from the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|New Oxford American Dictionary, 2nd Edition]]''. With [[Mac OS X Lion|Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion"]], Dictionary was updated to the Third Edition of the New Oxford American Dictionary and the British [[Oxford Dictionary of English]] was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: New dictionaries, multiple word views, multitouch lookups|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/12/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_new_dictionaries_multiple_word_views_multitouch_lookups|publisher=Apple Insider|accessdate=October 11, 2012|date=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==

Words can be entered in the search bar by just typing the first few letters. The application will perform an incremental search to show any matching headwords or forms, and will try to bypass spelling errors. Clicking on any word in a definition searches for that word in the dictionary again. Almost any word is clickable, except the pronunciations in phonetic characters and numerals.

The Preferences allow a user to select from three different pronunciation schemes, either US English (Diacritical or [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]), or British English (IPA).

The dictionary and thesaurus in Dictionary are in an [[XML]] format, but make use of precompiled binary index files to access the XML file directly. Therefore, the [[lexicon]] cannot easily be modified&lt;!-- (at least not without changing the binary index) --&gt;. However, the user can add new words to the macOS system-wide [[spell checker]], which uses its own lexicon.

===Quick access===
* In applications which support "Services", there is an option in the application menu (for example, Safari&gt;Services&gt;Look up in Dictionary) which brings up the Dictionary application and displays the definition of a selected word. The same option appears in the [[contextual menu]] after a Control-click on the selected word.
* The key combination '''[[control key|Control]] [[command key|Command]] D''' can be used in [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]] applications which display text – it brings up a small contextual menu-like definition or synonym of the word under the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]].
* As of [[Mac OS X Lion]], a three finger tap on the trackpad (either the built-in [[MacBook]] trackpad or the [[Magic Trackpad]]) has the same effect as the '''[[control key|Control]] [[command key|Command]] D''' shortcut.
* In applications which support the ability of the user to drag selected text, it is possible to select a word and drop it onto the icon of the Dictionary application in the [[Mac OS X Dock|Dock]].
* [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] includes a [[GUI widget|widget]] for accessing the Dictionary application.
* macOS catches any queries to the &lt;code&gt;dict:///&lt;/code&gt; URI scheme, say from a web browser, and routes them back to the Dictionary application.
* Since [[Mac OS X Leopard|OS X Leopard]], the dictionary has become tightly integrated with [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]], allowing users to view definitions from immediately within the system search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Get Immediate Dictionary Definitions Using Spotlight |url=http://osxdaily.com/2009/08/05/get-immediate-dictionary-definitions-using-spotlight/ |publisher=OS X Daily |accessdate=May 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413183326/http://osxdaily.com/2009/08/05/get-immediate-dictionary-definitions-using-spotlight/ |archivedate=April 13, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other languages===
{{Update|There are more dictionaries in macOS 10.12|section|date=September 2016}}
[[Mac OS X Leopard|OS X 10.5 (Leopard)]] added the Japanese-language dictionary [[Daijisen]], Progressive English to Japanese and Progressive Japanese to English dictionaries, and the 25,000-entry thesaurus {{Nihongo|"Tsukaikata no Wakaru Ruigo Reikai Jiten"|使い方の分かる類語例解辞典}}, all of which are provided by the Japanese publisher [[Shogakukan]]. The Japanese dictionaries do not show up by default, and must be enabled in Preferences.

In OS 10.8 Mountain Lion, the Japanese dictionaries were replaced by Super Daijirin and the Wisdom English-Japanese Dictionary. In addition, dictionaries were also added for French (Multidictionnaire de la Langue Française for Macs sold in Europe, or Les Éditions Québec Amérique for Macs sold in America), German ([[Duden]]), Spanish (Vox), and Chinese (Standard Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese).

Software such as DictUnifier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/mac-dictionary-kit/ |title=mac-dictionary-kit - Mac Dictionary Kit - Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to add more dictionaries to the application.

== Criticism ==
Though dictionary entries purport to be neutral, there is evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/apple-dictionary-definition-gay-includes-stupid-student-alerts/story?id=20864595|title=Apple Dictionary Definition of 'Gay' includes 'Stupid'|last=News|first=A. B. C.|date=2013-11-12|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Apple Dictionary application exhibits various forms of bias. A complaint was filed in 2013 about the definition for "gay," which includes the following "informal" definition, ''"offensive'' foolish, stupid, or unimpressive: ''making students wait for the light is kind of a gay rule.''" Despite the complaint, this definition has not been modified as of July 2018. In addition, writers of the dictionary exhibit [[Bias#Sexism|gender bias]] in definitions such as "political," and "apolitical." The definition for "political" associates the word with a man, "''he's a political man"'' and the example for "apolitical" associates the word with a woman, "not interested or involved in politics: ''a former apolitical housewife''." This form of gender bias has been documented in many dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/should-dictionaries-do-more-to-confront-sexism|title=Should Dictionaries Do More to Confront Sexism?|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15541">[[File:Family History Center Sign.jpg|thumb|280px|A Family History Center sign]]
'''Family History Centers''' (FHCs) are branches of the [[Family History Library]] in [[Salt Lake City]] Utah operated by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The centers supply resources for research and study of [[genealogy]] and [[family history]]. As of 2018, there are more than 5,100 FHCs in 140 countries.&lt;ref name="Statistics 2018"&gt;[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics], ''Mormon Newsroom'', March 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest FHCs are targeted toward people living within the boundaries of individual local [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]] and [[Ward (LDS Church)#Branch|branches]]. [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stakes]] and [[District (LDS Church)|districts]] may house a FHC for their constituent wards/branches, or may share a facility with multiple stakes/districts in their [[Area (LDS Church)|area]]. Regional FHCs are usually "library class" facilities designated as true branch libraries of the Salt Lake City Family History Library (FHL). FHCs with established hours of operation are open to members of the LDS Church and nonmembers alike.

==Ward, Stake and Multi-Stake Family History Centers==
FHCs vary greatly in size, hours staffed, and resources available.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;Allen, James B.; Jessie L. Embry; Kahlile B. Mehr. ''Hearts Turned to the Fathers: A History of the Genealogical Society of Utah''. Provo: BYU Studies, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of changing demographics, many smaller FHCs are closing with their resources being directed into "Library Class" facilities similar to the Los Angeles Family History Library, but not like the Riverton FamilySearch Center that has computers only.&lt;ref name="mormontimes.com"&gt;[http://www.mormontimes.com/article/13734/Family-history-centers-in-Salt-Lake-area-will-be-consolidated  Family History Centers in Salt Lake area will be consolidated], Shill, Aaron, Mormon Times, Deseret News Publishing Company, accessed June 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most of the Family History Library film/fiche assets have been converted to digital images, microfilm distribution services will end on September 1, 2017.  After that time access to microfilm/microfiche will be restricted to the Internet or to collections already at the FHC or Family History Centers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Ordering_Microfilm_or_Microfiche]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the larger Family History Centers provide some type of free access to a number of online subscription databases (e.g., ''Ancestry.com''). Mid-range FHCs may have small local book collections.

===Ward FHC===
The "Ward FHC" is the smallest, consists of at least one computer, related family history programs, most likely Internet access, and has the most variable hours per week because it has a volunteer staff. The ward (single congregation) FHC may or may not have a dedicated room in the ward building ("meetinghouse"), because most buildings are designed for multiple use. Such an FHC may or may not have microfilm or microfiche readers.&lt;ref name=fhc&gt;Family History Center Operations Guide, updated 2008, produced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stake FHC===
The "Stake FHC," which typically serves six or more ward or branch units (congregations), is the next in size and consists of two or more computers, related family history programs, Internet access, and usually offers more hours per week of service than does the ward FHC. Stake FHCs may have a small collection of CDs, books, and local historical materials. A Stake FHC usually has a dedicated room staffed by volunteers. Most have microfilm or microfiche readers and the ability to receive film/fiches from the Salt Lake City Family History Library (FHL).&lt;ref name=fhc/&gt;

===Multi-Stake FHC===
The "Multi-Stake FHC" serves two or more stake units consisting of eight or more wards and/or branches (congregations). These have larger dedicated areas within a stake center building, or other building, for the use of the FHC. These larger FHCs have dedicated book, microfilm, and microfiche areas. They have six or more computers with phone line, cable, or satellite Internet access, family history software, and often offer the institutional version of ''Ancestry.com'', ''Fold3.com'', and some other paid-access sites. All have microfilm or microfiche readers and the ability to receive film/fiches from the Salt Lake City FHL. Most have local area family history material, but are '''not''' "Library Class" facilities.&lt;ref name=fhc/&gt;

===Regional FamilySearch Libraries===
The [[List of Large Family History Centers (LDS Church)|"Regional FamilySearch Libraries"]] of the Salt Lake City Family History Library are considered "[[library]] class" facilities. Each has a dedicated internal [[Server computer|server]] and a [[Library catalog|library catalogs or card catalogs]] or online catalog for its collection. In 2010, the ''regional branch libraries were re-designated as "Large Multi-Stake FHCs"'' on the ''FamilySearch.org'' website. However a supplement to the ''Family History Center Operations Guide'' dated January 5, 2006, renamed these FHCs officially. Supervision of these facilities is under each area presidency or assigned to a member of the Presidency of the Seventy. These facilities are still considered branches of the Salt Lake City central library and often have book collections in the thousands, microfilm and microfiches in the tens of thousands, dozens of Internet-connected computers, microfilm and microfiche readers, and some digital scanners. All have dedicated servers with DSL, cable or T-1 Internet access. In addition, all had at least one multi-use classroom, and several research areas.&lt;ref name=fhc2&gt;Family History Center Operations Guide, Supplement for Large Multistake Family History Centers, dated January 5, 2006, produced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 2, Section 9, "Temple and Family History Work."&lt;/ref&gt;

These branch libraries have a dedicated unpaid full-time director or a pair of directors (usually a husband-wife team) and dozens of volunteer staff members.&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt; In many cases non-church member volunteers from the community serve. Local genealogy groups often support these library facilities to the extent that the centers see non-LDS patron usage higher than local LDS usage.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;  While the LDS Church has renamed most of them, some legacy websites reflect older names.

The BYU Family History Library was one of the original planned FHCs and is the largest Family History Center outside of Salt Lake City.  It was formerly known as the Utah Valley Regional Family History Center. It is now semi-independent of the LDS FHC system.

===FamilySearch Library===
In June 2010, the LDS Church closed down many smaller FHCs in the Salt Lake Valley and opened the Riverton FamilySearch Library, a misnomer, since the facility has no books and no magazines, having computers only. Whether this will be a trend for future FHCs is not known.&lt;ref name="mormontimes.com"/&gt; The Riverton FamilySearch Library in Riverton, Utah&lt;ref name="mormontimes.com"/&gt; has a Family Story Room available for use to record ancestor and family stories with state-of-the-art audio and video technology.

==History==
The '''Salt Lake City Genealogical Library''' was founded in 1894 to gather genealogical records and assist members of [http://www.lds.org The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] with their family history and genealogical research. It is the largest library of its kind in the world. It is open to the general public at no charge. The Family History Library is visited by an estimated 1,900 or more individual patrons each day. By 1975 there were 17 "branch libraries" around the world.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

The library collection has 2.4 million rolls of Family History Library microfilmed genealogical records and more than 742,000 microfiches in the main system. In 2003, the collection increased monthly by an average of 4,100 rolls of film, 700 books, and 16 electronic resources. A majority of the records contain information about persons who lived before 1930. Approximately 200 cameras are currently microfilming records in more than 45 countries. Records have been filmed in more than 110 countries, territories, and possessions.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

The first Family History Center (FHC), then called a branch genealogical library, was organized in the [[Harold B. Lee Library]] on [[Brigham Young University]] Campus in May, 1964.  Plans to organize family history centers in [[Mesa, Arizona]], [[Logan, Utah]], [[Cardston, Alberta]], and [[Oakland, California]], each adjacent to a [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] in one of those cities, had been announced at the 1963 October [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]].

The Family History Centers were put under the overall direction of [[Archibald F. Bennett]].  By December, 1964, there were 29 FHCs, and by 1968, there were 75. In 1987, these institutions were renamed "Family History Centers."

==Digitization and indexing projects==
{{Main|FamilySearch Indexing}}

In the late 1990s, a "pilot program" to update familysearch.org and digitize its entire collection was started using volunteers to input or "index" census and other data. This new genealogical index is considered an upgrade. It is a work in progress representing 426 regions around the world. Millions of new names have been input by volunteers and volunteers for the project are being actively solicited at FamilySearchIndexing.org. The searchable database containing the digital images and index will be available through the LDS Church's [[FamilySearch]] website.

The '''Fascism and Freedom Movement – Socialist National Party''' ({{lang-it|Movimento Fascismo e Libertà – Partito Socialista Nazionale}}, '''MFL–PSN'''), called simply '''Fascism and Freedom Movement''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[fascism|fascist]] political party. It was formed on 25 July 1991 by [[Italian Senate|senator]] [[Giorgio Pisanò]].

==History==
The Fascism and Freedom Movement always remained aloof from the area of so-called neo-fascist parties, which refuses agreements and / or alliances, stressing categorically not to be classified as a right-wing party. The party makes explicit reference to the ideals of the [[Italian Social Republic]] as corporatism, the socialization of the economy, taxation and monetary nationalism. Their ideology is based entirely on the thought of fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]], and has as its main objective the realization of Mussolini's strongly hierarchical corporate democracy based on [[social credit]]. The party is also in favor of a presidential republic, and expresses a strong sense of anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism. Fascism and Freedom was founded in 1989 as a political movement inside the [[Italian Social Movement]], referring to Senator Giorgio Pisano and his weekly Candido. Finally, it separated from the MSI on 25 July 1991.
In 2009, it added the words National Socialist Party (NSP) to its original name. The movement has been sued several times for alleged reconstitution of the dissolved [[National Fascist Party]].

It is the only recognised party in Italy with the inscription "Fascismo" on its logo.

&lt;!--Please do not remove the phrase and link to "creation myth" from the first paragraph without discussing your proposal on the talk page first. There has been a consensus since November 2011 to include it in the lead. You can read the archived talk discussion at: Talk:Genesis_creation_narrative/Archive_13#RfC:_Genesis_creation_narrative:_link_to_creation_myth.2C_yes_or_no.3F--&gt;

The '''Genesis creation narrative''' is the [[creation myth]] of both [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Leeming|Leeming|2009|p=113}} The narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]]. In the first, [[Elohim]] (the Hebrew generic word for [[God]]) creates the heavens and the earth in six days, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the [[Biblical Sabbath|seventh]]. In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name [[Yahweh]], creates [[Adam]], the first man, from dust and places him in the [[Garden of Eden]], where he is given dominion over the animals. [[Eve]], the first woman, is created from Adam and as his companion.

Borrowing themes from [[Mesopotamian mythology]], but adapting them to the [[Israelites|Israelite]] people's [[monotheism|belief in one God]],{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} the first major comprehensive draft of the [[Pentateuch]] (the series of five books which begins with Genesis and ends with [[Deuteronomy]]) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the [[Jahwist]] source) and was later expanded by other authors (the [[Priestly source]]) into a work very like the one we have today.{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=37}} The two sources can be identified in the creation narrative:  Priestly and Jahwistic.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=37}} The combined narrative is a critique of the Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism.{{sfn|Wenham|2003b|p=37}} [[Robert Alter]] described the combined narrative as "compelling in its archetypal character, its adaptation of myth to [[monotheist]]ic ends".{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=xii}}

Misunderstanding the [[genre]] of the Genesis creation narrative, meaning the intention of the author(s) and the culture within which they wrote, can result in a misreading.{{sfn|Andersen|1987|p=142}} [[Bruce Waltke]], a well-known evangelical scholar, cautions against one such misreading, the approach which reads it as history rather than theology and so leads to [[Creationism]] and the denial of [[evolution]].{{sfn|Waltke|1991|pp=6–9}} As noted scholar of [[Jewish studies]], [[Jon D. Levenson]], puts it:
{{quote|How much history lies behind the story of Genesis? Because the action of the primeval story is not represented as taking place on the plane of ordinary human history and has so many affinities with ancient mythology, it is very far-fetched to speak of its narratives as historical at all."{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=11}}}}

==Composition==
[[File:Bm-epic-g.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] tablet with the Atra-Hasis Epic in the [[British Museum]]]]

===Sources===
{{See also|Documentary hypothesis}}
Although tradition attributes Genesis to [[Moses]], biblical scholars hold that it, together with the following four books (making up what Jews call the [[Torah]] and biblical scholars call the Pentateuch), is "a composite work, the product of many hands and periods."{{sfn|Speiser|1964|p=xxi}} A common hypothesis among biblical scholars today is that the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the [[Jahwist]] source), and that this was later expanded by the addition of various narratives and laws (the [[Priestly source]]) into a work very like the one existing today.{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=37}}

As for the historical background which led to the creation of the narrative itself, a theory which has gained considerable interest, although still controversial, is "Persian imperial authorisation". This proposes that the Persians, after their [[Babylon#Persia captures Babylon|conquest of Babylon]] in 538 BCE, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single [[List of ancient legal codes|law code]] accepted by the entire community. It further proposes that there were two powerful groups in the community – the priestly families who controlled the Temple, and the landowning families who made up the "elders" – and that these two groups were in conflict over many issues, and that each had its own "history of origins", but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=169, 217–18}}

===Structure===
The creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} (There are no chapter divisions in the original Hebrew text, see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]].) The first account (1:1 through 2:3) employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement "And there was evening and there was morning, the [''x''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;] day," for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the "waters above" from the "waters below", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with sun, moon and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally land-based creatures and mankind populate the land.{{sfn|Ruiten|2000|pp=9–10}}

[[Wikt:consistency|Consistency]] was evidently not seen as essential to storytelling in ancient Near Eastern literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt; The overlapping stories of Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory but also complementary, with the first (the Priestly story) concerned with the creation of the entire cosmos while the second (the Yahwist story) focuses on man as moral agent and cultivator of his environment.{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} The highly regimented seven-day narrative of Genesis 1 features an omnipotent God who creates a god-like humanity, while the one-day creation of Genesis 2 uses a simple linear narrative, a God who can fail as well as succeed, and a humanity which is not god-like but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like.{{sfn|Carr|1996|pp=62–64}} Even the order and method of creation differs.{{sfn|Carr|1996|pp=62–64}} "Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, however elegantly they have now been combined."{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}

The primary accounts in each chapter are joined by a literary bridge at Genesis 2:4|, "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created." This echoes the first line of Genesis 1, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth", and is reversed in the next phrase, "...in the day that the {{LORD}} God made the earth and the heavens". This verse is one of ten "generations" ({{lang-he|תולדות}} ''{{transl|he|[[toledot]]}}'') phrases used throughout Genesis, which provide a literary structure to the book.{{sfn|Cross|1973|pp=301ff}} They normally function as headings to what comes after, but the position of this, the first of the series, has been the subject of much debate.{{sfn|Thomas|2011| pp=27–28}}

[[Comparative mythology]] provides historical and cross-cultural perspectives for [[Jewish mythology]]. Both sources behind the Genesis creation narrative borrowed themes from [[Mesopotamian mythology]],{{sfn|Lambert 1965}}{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=9}} but adapted them to [[God in Judaism|their belief in one God]],{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} establishing a monotheistic creation in opposition to the polytheistic creation myth of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel's]] neighbors.{{sfn|Leeming|2004}}{{sfn|Smith|2001}}

Genesis 1–11 as a whole is imbued with Mesopotamian myths.{{sfn|Lambert 1965}}{{sfn|Kutsko|2000|p=62, quoting J. Maxwell Miller}}  Genesis 1 bears both striking differences from and striking similarities to Babylon's national creation myth, the [[Enuma Elish]].{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=9}} On the side of similarities, both begin from a stage of chaotic waters before anything is created, in both a fixed dome-shaped "firmament" divides these waters from the habitable Earth, and both conclude with the creation of a human called "man" and the building of a temple for the god (in Genesis 1, this temple is the entire cosmos).{{sfn|McDermott|2002|pp=25–27}}  On the side of contrasts, Genesis 1 is [[monotheism|monotheistic]], it makes [[theogony|no attempt to account for the origins of God]], and there is no trace of the resistance to the reduction of chaos to order (Gk. [[theomachy]], lit. "God-fighting"), all of which mark the Mesopotamian creation accounts.{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} Still, Genesis 1 bears similarities to the [[Baal Cycle]] of Israel's neighbor, [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|loc=Chapter 6}}

The Enuma Elish has also left traces on Genesis 2. Both begin with a series of statements of what did not exist at the moment when creation began; the Enuma Elish has a spring (in the sea) as the point where creation begins, paralleling the spring (on the land – Genesis 2 is notable for being a "dry" creation story) in Genesis 2:6 that "watered the whole face of the ground"; in both myths, Yahweh/the gods first create a man to serve him/them, then animals and vegetation. At the same time, and as with Genesis 1, the Jewish version has drastically changed its Babylonian model: Eve, for example, seems to fill the role of a [[mother goddess]] when, in Genesis 4:1, she says that she has "created a man with Yahweh", but she is not a divine being like her Babylonian counterpart.{{sfn|Van Seters|1992|pp=122–24}}

Genesis 2 has close parallels with a second Mesopotamian myth, the [[Atra-Hasis]] epic – parallels that in fact extend throughout Genesis 2–11, from the Creation to the [[Noah's ark|Flood]] and its aftermath. The two share numerous plot-details (e.g. the divine garden and the role of the first man in the garden, the creation of the man from a mixture of earth and divine substance, the chance of immortality, etc.), and have a similar overall theme: the gradual clarification of man's relationship with God(s) and animals.{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}

The Garden of Eden story is compared to the [[Sumer]]ian myth in which the goddess [[Ninhursag]] created a beautiful garden full of lush vegetation and fruit trees, called [[Edinu]], in [[Dilmun]], the Sumerian earthly Paradise, a place which the Sumerians believed to exist to the east of their own land, beyond the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Noah Kramer|Kramer, Samuel Noah]]. ''History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Ninhursag charged [[Enki]], her lover and half brother, with controlling the wild animals and tending the garden, but Enki became curious about the garden, and his assistant, [[Adapa]], selected seven plants (eight in some versions) and offered them to Enki, who ate them. This enraged Ninhursag, and she caused Enki to fall ill. Enki felt pain in his rib, which is a [[pun]] in Sumerian, as the word "''{{lang|sux|ti}}''" means both "rib" and "life". The other deities persuaded Ninhursag to relent. Ninhursag then created a new goddess (seven or eight to heal his seven or eight ailing organs, including his rib), who was named [[Ninti]], (a name composed of "''{{lang|sux|Nin}}''", or "lady", and "''{{lang|sux|ti}}''", and which may be translated both as "Lady of Living" and "Lady of the Rib"), to cure Enki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|editor1=Charles Russell Coulter |editor2=Patricia Turner }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars suggest that this served as the basis for the story of Eve as "the mother of life" and lady of the rib, created from [[Adam]]'s rib in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Meagher 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meagher|first=Robert Emmet|title=The meaning of Helen : in search of an ancient icon|year=1995|publisher=BOLCHAZY-CARDUCCI PUBS (IL)|location=United States|isbn=0865165106}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

===Creation by word and creation by combat===
The narratives in Genesis 1 and 2 were not the only creation myths in ancient Israel, and the complete biblical evidence suggests two contrasting models.{{sfn|Dolansky|2016}} The first is the "[[logos]]" (meaning speech) model, where a supreme God "speaks" dormant matter into existence. The second is the "[[agon]]" (meaning struggle or combat) model, in which it is God's victory in battle over the monsters of the sea that mark his sovereignty and might.{{sfn|Fishbane|2003|pp=34–35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Graves and Patai|1986}}"Chapter 6"&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 1 is an example of creation by speech, while [[Psalm 74]] and [[Isaiah 51]] are examples of the "agon" mythology, recalling a Canaanite myth in which God creates the world by vanquishing the water deities: "Awake, awake! ... It was you that hacked Rahab in pieces, that pierced the Dragon! It was you that dried up the Sea, the waters of the great Deep, that made the abysses of the Sea a road that the redeemed might walk..."{{sfn|Hutton|2007|p=274}}

==Genesis 1:1–2:3==
[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[The Ancient of Days]] ([[William Blake]], 1794)]]

===Background===
The cosmos created in Genesis 1 bears a striking resemblance to the [[Tabernacle]] in Exodus 35–40, which was the prototype of the Temple in Jerusalem and the focus of priestly worship of [[Yahweh]]; for this reason, and because other Middle Eastern creation stories also climax with the construction of a temple/house for the creator-god, Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a description of the construction of the cosmos as God's house, for which the Temple in Jerusalem served as the earthly representative.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=13}}

The word ''bara'' is translated as "created" in English, but the concept it embodied was not the same as the modern term: in the world of the [[ancient Near East]], the gods demonstrated their power over the world not by creating matter but by fixing destinies, so that the essence of the ''bara'' which God performs in Genesis concerns bringing "heaven and earth" (a [[Merism|set phrase]] meaning "everything") into existence by organising and assigning roles and functions.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}}

The use of numbers in ancient texts was often [[Significance of numbers in Judaism|numerological]] rather than factual – that is, the numbers were used because they held some symbolic value to the author.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=74}} The number seven, denoting divine completion, permeates Genesis 1: verse 1:1 consists of seven words, verse 1:2 of fourteen, and 2:1–3 has 35 words (5x7); Elohim is mentioned 35 times, "heaven/firmament" and "earth" 21 times each, and the phrases "and it was so" and "God saw that it was good" occur 7 times each.{{sfn|Wenham|1987|p=6}}

===Pre-creation: Genesis 1:1–2===
:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness ''[was]'' upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–1:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the opening phrase of [[Genesis 1:1]] is commonly translated in English as above, the Hebrew is [[ambiguous]], and can be translated at least three ways:
# as a statement that the [[cosmos]] had an absolute beginning ("In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.");
# as a statement describing the condition of the world when God began creating ("When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was untamed and shapeless."); and
# essentially similar to the second version but taking all of Genesis 1:2 as background information ("When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth being untamed and shapeless, God said, Let there be light!").{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|pp=38–39}}

The second seems to be the meaning intended by the original Priestly author: the verb ''bara'' is used only of God (people do not engage in ''bara''), and it concerns the assignment of roles, as in the creation of the first people as "[[male]] and [[female]]" (i.e., it allocates them [[sexes]]): in other words, the power of God is being shown not by the creation of matter but by the fixing of destinies.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}}

''The heavens and the earth'' is a [[set phrase]] meaning "[[everything]]", i.e., the [[cosmos]]. This was made up of three levels, the habitable earth in the middle, the heavens above, an [[underworld]] below, all [[Cosmic ocean|surrounded by a watery "ocean" of chaos]] as the Babylonian ''[[Tiamat]]''.{{sfn|Spence|2010|p=72}} The earth itself was a flat disc, surrounded by mountains or sea. Above it was the [[firmament]], a transparent but solid dome resting on the mountains, allowing men to see the blue of the waters above, with "windows" to allow the rain to enter, and containing the sun, moon and stars. The waters extended below the earth, which rested on pillars sunk in the waters, and in the underworld was [[Sheol]], the abode of the dead.{{sfn|Knight|1990|pp=175–76}}

The opening of [[Genesis 1]] continues: "And the earth was formless and void..." The phrase "formless and void" is a translation of the Hebrew ''{{transl|he|[[tohu wa-bohu]]}}'', ({{lang-he|תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ}}), chaos, the condition that ''bara'', ordering, remedies.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=}} ''Tohu'' by itself means "emptiness, futility"; it is used to describe the desert wilderness; ''bohu'' has no known meaning and was apparently coined to rhyme with and reinforce ''tohu''.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=17}} The phrase appears also in Jeremiah 4:23 where the prophet warns Israel that rebellion against God will lead to the return of darkness and chaos, "as if the earth had been 'uncreated'".{{sfn|Thompson|1980|p=230}}

The opening of Genesis 1 concludes with a statement that "''darkness'' was on the face of the ''deep''" ({{lang-he|תְהוֹם}} ''{{transl|he|[[Tehom|t&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hôm]]}}''), [the] "darkness" and the "deep" being two of the three elements of the [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] represented in ''{{transl|he|[[tohu wa-bohu]]}}'' (the third is the "formless earth"). In the [[Enuma Elish]], the "deep" is personified as the goddess [[Tiamat]], the enemy of [[Marduk]];{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=}} here it is the ''formless body of primeval water surrounding the habitable world'', later to be released during the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], when "all the fountains of the great deep burst forth" from the waters beneath the earth and from the "windows" of the sky.{{sfn|Wenham|2003a|p=29}}

The ''Rûach'' of God moves over the face of the ''deep'' before creation begins. ''Rûach'' ({{lang|he|רוּחַ}}) has the meanings "wind, spirit, breath", and ''{{transl|he|elohim}}'' can mean "great" as well as "god": the ''{{transl|he|ruach elohim}}''  may therefore mean the "wind/breath of God" (the storm-wind is God's breath in Psalms 18:16 and elsewhere, and the wind of God returns in the Flood story as the means by which God restores the earth), or God's "spirit", a concept which is somewhat vague in Hebrew Bible, or it may simply signify a great storm-wind.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|pp=33–34}}

===Six days of Creation: Genesis 1:3–2:3===
[[File:The Creation - Bible Historiale (c.1411), vol.1, f.3 - BL Royal MS 19 D III.jpg|thumbnail|The Creation – [[Bible Historiale]] (c. 1411)]]
God's first act was the creation of undifferentiated light; dark and light were then separated into night and day, their order (evening before morning) signifying that this was the liturgical day; and then the sun, moon and stars were created to mark the proper times for the festivals of the week and year. Only when this is done does God create man and woman and the means to sustain them (plants and animals). At the end of the sixth day, when creation is complete, the world is a cosmic temple in which the role of humanity is the worship of God. This parallels Mesopotamian myth (the ''Enuma Elish'') and also echoes chapter 38 of the [[Book of Job]], where God recalls how the stars, the "sons of God", sang when the corner-stone of creation was laid.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|pp=21–22}}

====First day====
:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
:4 And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:3–1:5|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day 1 begins with the creation of light (and, by implication, time). God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them. In the ancient Near East the act of naming was bound up with the act of creating: thus in Egyptian literature the creator god pronounced the names of everything, and the Enûma Elish begins at the point where nothing has yet been named.{{sfn|Walton|2003|p=158}} God's creation by speech also suggests that he is being compared to a king, who has merely to speak for things to happen.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=39}}

====Second day====
:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which ''[were]'' under the firmament from the waters which ''[were]'' above the firmament: and it was so.
:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:6–1:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rāqîa‘'', the word translated as [[firmament]], is from ''rāqa‘,'' the verb used for the act of beating metal into thin plates.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=122}} Created on the second day of creation and populated by luminaries on the fourth, it is a solid dome which separates the earth below from the heavens and their waters above, as in Egyptian and Mesopotamian belief of the same time.{{sfn|Seeley|1991|p=227}} In Genesis 1:17 the stars are set in the ''raqia‘''; in Babylonian myth the heavens were made of various precious stones (compare Exodus 24:10 where the elders of Israel see God on the sapphire floor of heaven), with the stars engraved in their surface.{{sfn|Walton|2003|pp=158–59}}

====Third day====
:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry ''[land]'' appear: and it was so.
:10 And God called the dry ''[land]'' Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that ''[it was]'' good.
:11 And God said: 'Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth.' And it was so.
:12 And the earth brought forth grass, ''[and]'' herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed ''[was]'' in itself, after his kind: and God saw that ''[it was]'' good.
:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:9–1:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the third day, the waters withdraw, creating a ring of ocean surrounding a [[Flat Earth|single circular continent]].{{sfn|Seeley|1997|p=236}} By the end of the third day God has created a foundational environment of light, heavens, seas and earth.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=41}} The three levels of the cosmos are next populated in the same order in which they were created – heavens, sea, earth.

God does not create or make trees and plants, but instead commands the earth to produce them. The underlying theological meaning seems to be that God has given the previously barren earth the ability to produce vegetation, and it now does so at his command. "According to (one's) kind" appears to look forward to the laws found later in the Pentateuch, which lay great stress on holiness through separation.{{sfn|Kissling|2004|p=106}}

====Fourth day====
:14 And God said: ‘Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
:15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.’ And it was so.
:16 And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.
:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:14–1:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day Four the language of "ruling" is introduced: the heavenly bodies will "govern" day and night and mark seasons and years and days (a matter of crucial importance to the Priestly authors, as religious festivals were organised around the cycles of the sun and moon);{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|pp=41–42}} later, man will be created to rule over the whole of creation as God's regent. God puts "lights" in the firmament to "rule over" the day and the night.{{sfn|Walsh|2001|p=37 (fn.5)}}  Specifically, God creates the "greater light," the "lesser light," and the stars.  According to Victor Hamilton, most scholars agree that the choice of "greater light" and "lesser light", rather than the more explicit "sun" and "moon", is anti-mythological rhetoric intended to contradict widespread contemporary beliefs that the sun and the moon were deities themselves.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=127}}

====Fifth day====
:20 And God said: ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.’
:21 And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
:22 And God blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.’
:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. &lt;br&gt;—({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:20–1:23|HE}})

In the Egyptian and Mesopotamian mythologies, the creator-god has to do battle with the sea-monsters before he can make heaven and earth; in Genesis 1:21, the word ''tannin'', sometimes translated as "sea monsters" or "great creatures", parallels the named [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaos-monsters]] [[Rahab (Egypt)|Rahab]] and [[Leviathan]] from Psalm 74:13, and Isaiah 27:1, and Isaiah 51:9, but there is no hint (in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]) of combat, and the ''tannin'' are simply creatures created by God.{{sfn|Walton|2003|p=160}}

====Sixth day====
[[File:Criação dos Animais (1506-11) - Vasco Fernandes (Museu de Lamego).png|thumb|right|''The Creation of the Animals'' (1506–11), by [[Grão Vasco]]]]
:24 And God said: ‘Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind.’ And it was so.
:25 And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
:26 And God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’
:27 And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.
:28 And God blessed them; and God said unto them: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.’
:29 And God said: ‘Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it shall be for food;
:30 and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a living soul, [I have given] every green herb for food.’ And it was so.
:31 And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|1:24–31|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in Genesis 1:26 God says "Let us make man", the Hebrew word used is ''adam''; in this form it is a generic noun, "mankind", and does not imply that this creation is male. After this first mention the word always appears as ''ha-adam'', "the man", but as Genesis 1:27 shows ("So God created man in his ''[own]'' image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."), the word is still not exclusively male.{{sfn|Alter|2004|pp=18–19, 21}}

Man was created in the "[[image of God]]". The meaning of this is unclear: suggestions include:
# Having the spiritual qualities of God such as intellect, will, etc.;
# Having the physical form of God;
# A combination of these two;
# Being God's counterpart on earth and able to enter into a relationship with him;
# Being God's representative or viceroy on earth.{{sfn|Kvam et al. 1999|p=24}}

The fact that God says "Let ''us'' make man..." has given rise to several theories, of which the two most important are that "us" is [[majestic plural]],{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=24}} or that it reflects a setting in a [[Divine Council#Hebrew|divine council]] with God enthroned as king and proposing the creation of mankind to the lesser divine beings.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=14}}

God tells the animals and humans that he has given them "the green plants for food"{{snd}} creation is to be vegetarian. Only later, after the Flood, is man given permission to eat flesh. The Priestly author of Genesis appears to look back to an ideal past in which mankind lived at peace both with itself and with the animal kingdom, and which could be re-achieved through a proper sacrificial life in [[Pre-established harmony|harmony with God]].{{sfn|Rogerson|1991|pp=19ff}}

Upon completion, God sees that "every thing that He had made ... was very good" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:31|HE}}). This implies that the materials that existed before the Creation ("''[[tohu wa-bohu]]''," "darkness," "''[[tehom]]''") were not "very good." [[Israel Knohl]] hypothesized that the Priestly source set up this dichotomy to mitigate [[the problem of evil]].{{sfn|Knohl|2003|p=13}}

===Seventh day: divine rest===
:1 And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
:2 And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:1–2:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation is followed by rest. In ancient Near Eastern literature the divine rest is achieved in a temple as a result of having brought order to chaos. Rest is both disengagement, as the work of creation is finished, but also engagement, as the deity is now present in his temple to maintain a secure and ordered cosmos.{{sfn|Walton|2006|pp=157–58}} Compare with Exodus 20:8–20:11: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

==Genesis 2:4–2:25==

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - f 5v.png|thumb|right|200px|Seventh Day of Creation (from the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle)]]
Genesis 2–3, the [[Garden of Eden]] story, was probably authored around 500 BCE as "a discourse on ideals in life, the danger in human glory, and the fundamentally ambiguous nature of humanity – especially human mental faculties".{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=473–74}} The Garden in which the action takes place lies on the mythological border between the human and the divine worlds, probably on the far side of the [[Cosmic ocean]] near the rim of the world; following a conventional ancient Near Eastern concept, the Eden river first forms that ocean and then divides into four rivers which run from the four corners of the earth towards its centre.{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=473–74}}
It opens "in the day that the {{LORD}} God made the earth and the heavens", a set introduction similar to those found in Babylonian myths.{{sfn|Van Seters|1998|p=22}} Before the man is created the earth is a barren waste watered by an ''ed''; Genesis 2:6 the [[King James Version]] translated this as "mist", following Jewish practice, but since the mid-20th century Hebraists have generally accepted that the real meaning is "spring of underground water".{{sfn|Andersen|1987|pp=137–40}}

In Genesis 1 the characteristic word for God's activity is ''bara'', "created"; in Genesis 2 the word used when he creates the man is ''yatsar'', meaning "fashioned", a word used in contexts such as a potter fashioning a pot from clay.{{sfn|Alter|2004|pp=20, 22}} God breathes his own breath into the clay and it becomes ''nephesh'', a word meaning "life", "vitality", "the living personality"; man shares ''nephesh'' with all creatures, but the text describes this life-giving act by God only in relation to man.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=31}}

Eden, where God puts his [[Garden of Eden]], comes from a root meaning "fertility": the first man is to work in God's miraculously fertile garden.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=15}} The "tree of life" is a motif from Mesopotamian myth: in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' the hero is given a plant whose name is "man becomes young in old age", but a serpent steals the plant from him.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "The story of Adam and Eve's sin in the garden of Eden (2.25–3.24) displays similarities with Gilgamesh, an epic poem that tells how its hero lost the opportunity for immortality and came to terms with his humanity. ... the biblical narrator has adapted the Mesopotamian forerunner to Israelite theology."&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much scholarly discussion about the type of knowledge given by the second tree. Suggestions include: human qualities, sexual consciousness, ethical knowledge, or universal knowledge; with the last being the most widely accepted.{{sfn|Kooij|2010|p=17}} In Eden, mankind has a choice between wisdom and life, and chooses the first, although God intended them for the second.{{sfn|Propp|1990|p=193}}

The mythic Eden and its rivers may represent the real Jerusalem, the [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]] and the Promised Land. Eden may represent the divine garden on [[Zion]], the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem; while the real [[Gihon]] was a spring outside the city (mirroring the spring which waters Eden); and the imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubs, has been seen as a reflection of the real images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent (the [[nehushtan]]) and guardian cherubs.{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=307–10}} Genesis 2 is the only place in the Bible where Eden appears as a geographic location: elsewhere (notably in the Book of Ezekiel) it is a mythological place located on the holy Mountain of God, with echoes of a Mesopotamian myth of the king as a primordial man placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=33}}

"[[Good and evil]]" is a [[merism]], in this case meaning simply "everything", but it may also have a moral connotation. When God forbids the man to eat from the tree of knowledge he says that if he does so he is "doomed to die": the Hebrew behind this is in the form used in the Bible for issuing death sentences.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=21}}

The first woman is created to be ''ezer kenegdo'' – a term notably difficult to translate – to the man. ''Kenegdo'' means "alongside, opposite, a counterpart to him", and ''ezer'' means active intervention on behalf of the other person.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=22}} God's naming of the elements of the cosmos in Genesis 1 illustrated his [[Divinity|authority over creation]]; now the man's naming of the animals (and of Woman) illustrates Adam's authority within creation.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=20}}

The woman is called ''ishah'', "Woman", with an explanation that this is because she was taken from ''ish'', meaning "man"; the two words are not in fact connected. Later, after the story of the Garden is complete, she receives a name: ''Hawwah'' (Eve). This means "living" in Hebrew, from a root that can also mean "snake".{{sfn|Hastings|2003|p=607}} The word traditionally translated "rib" in English can also mean "side", "chamber", or "beam".{{sfn|Jacobs|2007|p=37}} A long-standing exegetical tradition holds that the use of a rib from man's side emphasizes that both man and woman have equal dignity, for woman was created from the same material as man, shaped and given life by the same processes.{{sfn|Hugenberger|1988|p=184}}  Medieval homilies about marriage as a sacrament stated that Eve was made from a more noble material (''the better half'') than Adam;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqUhR0QZIvEC|title=Geschlechterbeziehungen und Textfunktionen: Studien zu Eheschriften der Frühen Neuzeit|last=Schnell|first=Rüdiger|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110940398|location=|pages=167 ff|language=de|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationism and the genre of Genesis 1–2==
{{creationism2}}{{See also|Literary genre|Myth (disambiguation)|Narrative}}
[[File:Adam and Eve by Lucas Cranach (I).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Eden ([[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1472–1553)]]

The meaning to be derived from the Genesis creation narrative will depend on the reader's understanding of its genre, the literary "type" to which it belongs: "it makes an enormous difference whether the first chapters of Genesis are read as scientific cosmology, creation myth, or historical saga".{{sfn|Wood|1990|pp=323–24}} Misunderstanding of the genre of the text, meaning the intention of the author/s and the culture within which they wrote, will result in a misreading.{{sfn|Andersen|1987|p=142}} [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholar [[Bruce Waltke]] cautions against one such misreading, the "woodenly literal" approach which leads to "[[creation science]]" and such "implausible interpretations" as the "[[gap theory]]", the presumption of a "[[young earth]]", and the denial of [[evolution]].{{sfn|Waltke|1991|pp=6–9}} Another scholar, [[Conrad Hyers]], sums up the same thought in these words: "A [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of the Genesis accounts is inappropriate, misleading, and unworkable [because] it presupposes and insists upon a kind of literature and intention that is not there."{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=28}}

Whatever else it may be, Genesis 1 is "story", since it features character and characterisation, a narrator, and dramatic tension expressed through a series of incidents arranged in time.{{sfn|Cotter|2003|pp=5–9}} The Priestly author of Genesis 1 had to confront two major difficulties. First, there is the fact that since only God exists at this point, no-one was available to be the narrator; the storyteller solved this by introducing an unobtrusive "third person narrator".{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=7}} Second, there was the problem of conflict: conflict is necessary to arouse the reader's interest in the story, yet with nothing else existing, neither a chaos-monster nor another god, there cannot be any conflict. This was solved by creating a very minimal tension: God is opposed by nothingness itself, the blank of the world "without form and void."{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=7}} Telling the story in this way was a deliberate choice: there are a number of creation stories in the Bible, but they tend to be told in the first person, by Wisdom, the instrument by which God created the world; the choice of [[Narrative mode#Third-person, omniscient|omniscient third-person narrator]] in the Genesis narrative allows the storyteller to create the impression that everything is being told and nothing held back.{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=8}}

It can also be regarded as ancient history, "part of a broader spectrum of originally anonymous, history-like ancient Near Eastern narratives."{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=21}} It is frequently called myth in scholarly writings, but there is no agreement on how "myth" is to be defined, and so while [[Brevard Childs]] famously suggested that the author of Genesis 1–11 "demythologised" his narrative, meaning that he removed from his sources (the Babylonian myths) those elements which did not fit with his own faith, others can say it is entirely mythical.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=57–58}}

Genesis 1–2 can be seen as ancient science: in the words of [[E.A. Speiser]], "on the subject of creation biblical tradition aligned itself with the traditional tenets of Babylonian science."{{sfn|Seidman|2010|p=166}} The opening words of Genesis 1, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", sum up the author(s) belief that [[Yahweh]], the god of Israel, was solely responsible for creation and had no rivals.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=53}} Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that [[Wisdom of God|God's Wisdom]], [[Logos|Word]] and [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Spirit]] penetrated all things and gave them unity.{{sfn|Kaiser|1997|p=28}}  Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and identified [[Jesus]] with the [[Logos (Christianity)|creative word]]: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" ([[John 1:1]]).{{sfn|Parrish|1990|pp=183–84}} When the Jews came into contact with Greek thought it led to a major reinterpretation of the underlying cosmology of the Genesis narrative. The biblical authors conceived the cosmos as a flat disc-shaped earth in the centre, an underworld for the dead below, and heaven above.{{sfn|Aune|2003|p=119}} Below the earth were the "waters of chaos", the cosmic sea, home to mythic monsters defeated and slain by God; in Exodus 20:4, God warns against making an image "of anything that is in the waters under the earth".{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=53}} There were also waters above the earth, and so the ''raqia'' ([[firmament]]), a solid bowl, was necessary to keep them from flooding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryken et al|1998|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Hellenistic period this was largely replaced by a more "scientific" model as imagined by Greek philosophers, according to which the earth was a sphere at the centre of concentric shells of celestial spheres containing the sun, moon, stars and planets.{{sfn|Aune|2003|p=119}}

The idea that God created the world out of nothing (''creatio [[ex nihilo]]'') is central today to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism – indeed, the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} – yet it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The Priestly authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} This was still the situation in the early 2nd century AD, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God; by the beginning of the 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}

[[File:Geonames4.png|thumb|Worldwide density of GeoNames entries in 2006]]

'''GeoNames''' is a [[geographical database]] available and accessible through various [[web service]]s, under a [[Creative Commons]] attribution license.

==Database and web services==
The GeoNames database contains over 25,000,000 [[toponymy|geographical names]] corresponding to over 11,800,000 unique features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonames.org |title=GeoNames web site |publisher=Geonames.org |date= |accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All features are categorized into one of nine feature classes and further subcategorized into one of 645 feature codes. Beyond names of places in various languages, data stored include [[latitude]], [[longitude]], [[elevation]], population, administrative subdivision and [[postal code]]s. All [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] use the World [[Geodetic system|Geodetic]] System 1984 ([[WGS84]]).

Those data are accessible free of charge through a number of Web services and a daily database export.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programmableweb.com/api/geonames |title=GeoNames API |publisher=ProgrammableWeb |date= |accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wiki interface==
The core of GeoNames database is provided by official public sources, the quality of which may vary. Through a [[wiki]] interface, users are invited to manually edit and improve the database by adding or correcting names, move existing features, add new features, etc.&lt;ref name="gn-help"&gt;{{cite web |title=How can I help ? |url=http://forum.geonames.org/gforum/posts/list/25.page |website=GeoNames Forum |publisher=GeoNames |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic Web integration==
Each GeoNames feature is represented as a [[web resource]] identified by a stable [[URI]]. This URI provides access, through [[content negotiation]], either to the HTML wiki page, or to a [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] description of the feature, using elements of the GeoNames [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html |title=GeoNames ontology |publisher=Geonames.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ontology describes the GeoNames features properties using the [[Web Ontology Language]], the feature classes and codes being described in the [[SKOS]] language.
Through Wikipedia articles URL linked in the RDF descriptions, GeoNames data are linked to [[DBpedia]] data and other RDF [[Linked Data]].

==Accuracy and improvements==
As in other [[crowdsourcing]] schemes, GeoNames edit interface allows everyone to sign in and edit the database, hence false information can be entered and such information can remain undetected especially for places that are not accessed frequently. {{harvtxt|Ahlers|2013}} studies these inaccuracies and classifies them into loss in the granularity of coordinates (e.g., due to truncation and low-resolution geocoding in some cases), wrong feature codes, near-identical places, and the placement of places outside their designated countries.
Manually correcting these inaccuracies is both tedious and error prone (due to the database size) and may require experts.

The literature provides very few works on automatically resolving them either.
{{harvtxt|Singh|Rafiei|2018}} study the problem of automatically detecting the scope of locations in a geographical database and its applications in identifying inconsistencies and improving the quality of the database.
Computing the boundary information can help detect inconsistencies such as near-identical places and the placement of locations such as cities under wrong parents such as provinces or countries. Singh and Rafiei show that the boundary information derived in their work can move more than 20% of locations in GeoNames to better positions in the spatial hierarchy and the  accuracy of those moves is over 90%.

The '''German Football Museum''' ({{lang-de|Deutsches Fußballmuseum}}) aka '''[[German Football Association|DFB]]-Museum''' is the national museum for [[Football in Germany|German football]] in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]]. It was opened on 23 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''German Football Museum to open not before 25 October 2015''|url=https://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/staedte/dortmund/44137-City~/Erneute-Verzoegerung-Fussballmuseum-eroeffnet-erst-am-25-Oktober;art930,2732025 |publisher=Ruhr Nachrichten |language=German|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, the DFB decided to fund from the profits of the World Cup, the establishment of a national German football museum. From 14 cities that had applied as a location for the football museum DFB board elected in May 2007, the cities of Cologne, Oberhausen, Gelsenkirchen and Dortmund and decided to order for a site in the most populous state [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. In an extraordinary Bundestag of the DFB on 24 April 2009, the delegates chose the downtown area south near the [[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]], which had been used until the start of construction of the museum as a bus station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fußball-Museum: Ein Volltreffer für die Stadt|trans-title=|periodical=derwesten.de|publisher=|url=https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/dortmund/Fussball-Museum-Ein-Volltreffer-fuer-die-Stadt-id345649.html|deadurl=|accessdate=24 April 2016|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Gregor Boldt|date=25 April 2009|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Construction of the museum began in September 2012; took place in the presence of DFB president on 20 September, Wolfgang Niersbach and Prime Minister Hannelore Kraft of the ground-breaking ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bauarbeiten für das DFB-Museum starten|trans-title=|periodical=ruhrnachrichten.de|publisher=|url=http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/lokales/dortmund/Bauarbeiten-fuer-das-DFB-Museum-starten;art930,1771418|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=24 April 2016|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Alexandra Neuhaus|date=20 September 2012|year=|month=|day=|language=de-DE|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groundbreaking ceremony took place on 29 April 2013. Present were among others Wolfgang Niersbach, Reinhard Rauball and Ute Schäfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dortmund: Grundstein für DFB-Museum gelegt|trans-title=|periodical=reviersport.de|publisher=|url=http://www.reviersport.de/230636---dortmund-grundstein-fuer-dfb-museum-gelegt.html|deadurl=|accessdate=24 April 2016|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later, in 2014, the topping-out ceremony was celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deutsches Fussballmuseum in Dortmund-Startseite|trans-title=|periodical=dfb-fussballmuseum.de|publisher=www.dfb-fussballmuseum.de|url=http://www.dfb-fussballmuseum.de/aktuell/archiv/?news=89|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=24 April 2016|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land and buildings==
The German Football Museum is located close to the main train station and is part of an art and culture mile between the creative center Dortmunder U and the Konzerthaus Dortmund .

An architectural competition was advertised for the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article5257689/Streit-um-deutsches-Fussball-Museum-ist-entbrannt.html|author=Oliver Müller|title=Streit um deutsches Fußball-Museum ist entbrannt|publisher=Welt Online|date=23 November 2009|archiv-url=|archiv-date=|offline=|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture competition===
Following an international architectural competition announced by the city of Dortmund, three designs were awarded on 4 May 2011 by the jury of the architectural competition from 24 works. A full winning design did not exist. The judges awarded instead a price group of three equal awards to architects HPP Hentrich-Petschnigg + Partner (Düsseldorf), ARGE Petersen BWM Architekten und Partner (Dortmund) and pmp Architekten (Munich). In addition, the jury awarded recognitions of their work on the office Bolles + Wilson (Münster), LOOC / M (Frankfurt / Main) and Schulte-Frohlind (Berlin).

====Outcome of the architectural competition====

On 29 June 2011 the city of Dortmund and the DFB football museum was announced at a joint press conference that the office HPP Hentrich-Petschnigg + Partner, Düsseldorf and pmp Architekten, Munich equal footing, occupy first place in the international architectural competition. The ARGE Petersen BWM Architekten und Partner, Dortmund, reached third place. Following the recommendation of the jury was in talks the final winning design determined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dfb-fussballmuseum.de/aktuell/archiv/?news=45|title=Deutsches Fussballmuseum in Dortmund|publisher=dfb-fussballmuseum.de|archiv-url=|archiv-date=|offline=|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/artikel/C30108/fussballmuseum-remis-30453023.html|title=Fußballmuseum remis|publisher=faz.net|archiv-url=|archiv-date=|offline=|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published on 26 September 2011 in the daily press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/dortmund/So-soll-das-DFB-Fussballmuseum-in-Dortmund-aussehen-id5104168.html|author=Gregor Beushausen|title=So soll das DFB-Fußballmuseum in Dortmund aussehen|publisher=derwesten.de|archiv-url=|archiv-date=|offline=|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Getty Center Monorail''', also known as '''Getty Center Tram''', is an [[Otis Hovair]] [[monorail]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[Los Angeles]] serving the [[Getty Center]]. It is an electric, cable-driven [[hovertrain]], with a fleet of 6 [[people mover]]s divided in 2 convoys of 3 cars each.&lt;ref name=waymarking/&gt;

==History==
The railway line, already planned in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-14/news/we-8936_1_j-paul-getty-center "Tram System Proposed for J. Paul Getty Center"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]], July 14, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; was opened at the end of 1997, following the inauguration of the [[Getty Center]].

==Route==
The line, located north of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]], in the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside Region]] of Los Angeles, links a freeway-level parking garage to the [[Getty Center]], which includes the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. The duration of a ride is about 3 to 4 minutes and the distance is about {{convert|1.21|km|mi|abbr=on}} .&lt;ref name=waymarking/&gt;

The lower station ({{coord|34|05|15.8|N|118|28|32.8|W}}), at the bottom of the hill, lies beside [[Sepulveda Boulevard]] and the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]]. The upper station ({{coord|34|04|42.1|N|118|28|29.9|W}}), at the top of the hill, is located in the arrival plaza of the Getty Center and is part of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|24563086|Getty Center Tram}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line follows Getty Center Drive and has a [[Passing loop|passing loop]] in the middle.

The '''''Guide Hachette des Vins''''' is a [[French wine]] buying guide published by [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] Livre (Hachette Pratique).  Its first edition was released in 1985.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide Hachette des Vins : présentation et notation des vins|url=http://www.hachette-vins.com/guide-vins/actualite-vin/81/le-guide-hachette-des-vins-presentation-et-notation-des-vins|website=Hachettevins.com|publisher=Hachette Livre|accessdate=21 September 2015|language=French|date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is [[France]]'s best-selling [[wine]] guide and one of France's oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide Hachette des Vins 2016 vient de paraître !|url=http://www.hachette-vins.com/guide-vins/actualite-vin/161/le-guide-hachette-des-vins-2016-vient-de-paraitre|website=Hachette Vins|publisher=Hachette Livre|accessdate=21 September 2015|language=French|date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guide Hachette des Vins is considered to be France' most authoritative guide and commonly referred to as the bible of the French wine industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Week's Tasting The 'Little' Champagne that Ranked with the Best|url=http://www.federalwine.com/Articles/Deutz-Champagnes|website=Federal Wine &amp; Spirits|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide Hachette des Vins|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/awards-20-le+guide+hachette+des+vins|website=Wine-searcher|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Face value: After the musketeer|url=http://www.economist.com/taxonomy/term/109?page=113|website=The Economist|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=20 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine Critics and Competitions|url=http://www.bigredwine.co.uk/OP/Awards%20&amp;%20citations.asp|website=Big Red Wine Company|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fiorina|first1=Tom|title=Bringing some ‘international’ taste to France’s wine ‘Bible’|url=http://www.thevineroute.com/uncategorized/frances-wine-bible/|website=The Vine Route|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goode|first1=Jamie|title=Buying guides|url=http://www.wineanorak.com/buyb.htm|website=Wine Anorak|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blind tasting panels==
The Guide Hachette uses [[blind tasting]] panels to evaluate wines by [[appellation]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Each year 40,000 wines are tasted blind and rated by experts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

No fee is required to submit samples.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Corson-Schneider|editor1-first=Séverine|editor2-last=Cuperly|editor2-first=Christine|editor3-last=de Lavaur|editor3-first=Juliette|title=Le Guide Hachette des Vins 2016|publisher=Hachette Livre|location=Vanves|isbn=9782013962643|pages=6|language=French|chapter=Le Guide Hachette des Vins: Mode d'Emploi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the most recently bottled [[vintage]] is allowed to be submitted for blind tasting.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Wine tasting]]s are organized locally in each region between January and May.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Blind tasting sessions composed of a panel wine professionals ([[enologist]]s, wine merchants, wine brokers, [[sommeliers]]) are organized with the Syndicat Viticole or Winegrower's Syndicate of each [[appellation]] present in the guide.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Rating system==
Each wine is rated on a scale of 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Taster's grade !! Wine Quality !! Final [[wine rating|Wine Rating]]
|-
| 0 || Faulty wine || Eliminated
|-
| 1 || Poor or mediocre || Eliminated
|-
| 2 || Good || Commended (no stars)
|-
| 3 || Excellent || *
|-
| 4 || Remarkable || **
|-
| 5 || Exceptional || ***
|}

The top rated wines are subject to a second round of [[blind tasting]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  After the second tasting, the panel votes on one or two wines to receive ''Coup de Coeur'' [Judges' Favorite].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  The ''Coup de Coeur'' is considered to be the highest recommendation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=isa|title=Coup de Coeur Guide Hachette des vins 2015 !!|url=http://www.domainedemaouries-boutique.com/index.php?post/2014/12/01/Coup-de-Coeur-Guide-Hachette-des-vins-2015|website=Domaine de Maouries|accessdate=21 September 2015|language=French|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRU CLISSON 2010 : coup de coeur au GUIDE HACHETTE 2015|url=http://www.domainedelepinay.com/actualites%20du%20domaine%20de%20l%20epinay.html|website=Domaine de l'Epinay|accessdate=21 September 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Ardèche blanc - Prix "Coup de Coeur" du Guide Hachette des Vins 2010|url=http://www.thiebaud.ch/modules/shop/detail.asp?ID=6548|website=Thiébaud|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COUP DE COEUR POUR LE GUIDE HACHETTE|url=http://www.cave-bonnieux.com/blog_detail.php?id=35|website=Cave de Bonnieux|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HPC Challenge Benchmark''' combines several [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s to test a number of independent attributes of the performance of high-performance [[computer]] (HPC) systems.  The project has been co-sponsored by the [[DARPA]] [[High Productivity Computing Systems]] program, the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://investors.cray.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98390&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;t=Regular&amp;id=581048&amp;
|title=Cray X1 Supercomputer Has Highest Reported Scores on Government-Sponsored HPC Challenge Benchmark Tests
|date=2004-06-14
|accessdate=2010-01-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The performance of complex applications on HPC systems can depend on a variety of independent performance attributes of the hardware.  The HPC Challenge Benchmark is an effort to improve visibility into this multidimensional space by combining the measurement of several of these attributes into a single program.

Although the performance attributes of interest are not specific to any particular computer architecture, the reference implementation of the HPC Challenge Benchmark in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] assumes that the system under test is a [[Computer cluster|cluster]] of [[Multiprocessing|shared memory multiprocessor]] systems connected by a [[Computer network|network]].  Due to this assumption of a hierarchical system structure most of the tests are run in several different modes of operation.  Following the notation used by the benchmark reports, results labeled "single" mean that the test was run on one randomly chosen processor in the system, results labeled "star" mean that an independent copy of the test was run concurrently on each processor in the system, and results labeled "global" mean that all the processors were working in coordination to solve a single problem (with data distributed across the nodes of the system).

==Components==
The benchmark currently consists of 7 tests (with the modes of operation indicated for each):
# HPL&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/
|title=HPL – A Portable Implementation of the High-Performance Linpack Benchmark for Distributed-Memory Computers
|publisher=Innovative Computing Laboratory, University of Tennessee at Knoxville
|accessdate=2015-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (High Performance [[LINPACK]]) – measures performance of a solver for a dense [[system of linear equations]] (global).
# [[General Matrix Multiply|DGEMM]] – measures performance for matrix-matrix multiplication (single, star).
# STREAM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/
|title=STREAM: Sustainable Memory Bandwidth in High Performance Computers
|accessdate=2015-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; – measures sustained [[memory bandwidth]] to/from memory (single, star).
# PTRANS – measures the rate at which the system can [[transpose]] a large array (global).
# [[Giga-updates per second|RandomAccess]] – measures the rate of 64-bit updates to randomly selected elements of a large table (single, star, global).
# FFT – performs a [[Fast Fourier transform|Fast Fourier Transform]] on a large one-dimensional vector using the generalized [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm|Cooley–Tukey]] algorithm (single, star, global).
# Communication Bandwidth and Latency – MPI-centric performance measurements based on the b_eff&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=https://fs.hlrs.de/projects/par/mpi//b_eff/
|title=Effective Bandwidth (b_eff) Benchmark
|publisher=High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart
|accessdate=2015-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; bandwidth/latency benchmark.

==Performance attributes==
At a high level, the tests are intended to provide coverage of four important attributes of performance: double-precision floating-point arithmetic (DGEMM and HPL), local memory bandwidth (STREAM), network bandwidth for "large" messages (PTRANS, RandomAccess, FFT, b_eff), and network bandwidth for "small" messages (RandomAccess, b_eff).  Some of the codes are more complex than others and can have additional performance sensitivities.  For example, in some systems HPL performance can be limited by network bandwidth and/or network latency.

==Competition==
The annual '''HPC Challenge Award Competition''' at the [[Supercomputing Conference]] focuses on four of the most challenging benchmarks in the suite: 
* Global HPL 
* Global [[Giga-updates per second|RandomAccess]] (OR [[Giga-updates per second|BSS Random Access Benchmark]]) 
* EP STREAM (Triad) per system 
* Global FFT 
There are two classes of awards:
* '''Class 1''': Best performance on a base or optimized run submitted to the HPC Challenge website.&lt;ref&gt;The benchmark is designed to allow replacement of a limited set of functions with more highly optimized versions while remaining a "base" run.  Additional (but still limited) modifications are allowed under the category of "optimized" runs.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Class 2''': Most "elegant" implementation of four or five computational kernels including three or more of the HPC Challenge benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''''Handbook of the Birds of the World''''' (HBW) is a multi-volume series produced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] publishing house [[Lynx Edicions]] in partnership with [[BirdLife International]]. It is the first handbook to cover every known living species of [[bird]]. The series is edited by [[Josep del Hoyo]], [[Andrew Elliott (ornithologist)|Andrew Elliott]], [[Jordi Sargatal]] and [[David A. Christie]].

All 16 volumes have been published. For the first time an animal [[Class (biology)|class]] will have all the species illustrated and treated in detail in a single work. This has not been done before for any other group in the [[animal]] kingdom.

Material in each volume is grouped first by family, with an introductory article on each family; this is followed by individual species accounts (taxonomy, subspecies and distribution, descriptive notes, habitat, food and feeding, breeding, movements, status and conservation, bibliography). In addition, all volumes except the first and second contain an essay on a particular ornithological theme. More than 200 renowned specialists and 35 illustrators (including [[Toni Llobet]], [[Hilary Burn]], [[Chris Rose (artist)|Chris Rose]] and [[Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr.|H. Douglas Pratt]]) from more than 40 countries have contributed to the project up to now, as well as 834 photographers from all over the world.

Since the first volume appeared in 1992, the series has received various international awards. The first volume was selected as Bird Book of the Year by the magazines ''[[Birdwatch]]'' and ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'', and the fifth volume was recognised as Outstanding Academic Title by ''[[Choice Magazine]]'', the [[American Library Association]] magazine. The seventh volume, as well as being named Bird Book of the Year by ''Birdwatch'' and ''British Birds'', also received the distinction of Best Bird Reference Book in the 2002 [[WorldTwitch Book Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtwitch.com/awards_2002.htm |title=2002 Book Awards - Birds and Birding |publisher=Worldtwitch |date=2003-06-05 |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same distinction was also awarded to Volume 8 a year later in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtwitch.com/awards_2003.htm |title=2003 Book Awards - Birds and Birding |publisher=Worldtwitch |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual volumes are large, measuring {{Convert|32|by|25|cm|in}}, and weighing between {{convert|4|and|4.6|kg|lb}}; it has been commented in a review that "[[fork-lift truck]] book" would be a more appropriate title.

As a complement to the ''Handbook of the Birds of the World'' and with the ultimate goal of disseminating knowledge about the world's avifauna, in 2002 [[Lynx Edicions]] started the '''Internet Bird Collection''' (IBC). It is a free-access, but not free-licensed, on-line audiovisual library &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibc.lynxeds.com |title=the Internet Bird Collection |publisher=Ibc.lynxeds.com |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's birds with the aim of posting videos, photos and sound recordings showing a variety of biological aspects (e.g. subspecies, plumages, feeding, breeding, etc.) for every species. It is a non-profit endeavour fuelled by material from more than one hundred contributors from around the world.

In early 2013, Lynx Edicions launched the online database '''HBW Alive''', which includes the volume and family introductions and updated species accounts from all 17 published HBW volumes. Since its launch, the taxonomy has been thoroughly revised and updated twice (once for non-passerines and once for passerines), following the publication of the two volumes of the ''HBW and BirdLife International Illustrated Checklist of the Birds of the World''.

The '''''Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive''''' site also provides a free access 'Key to Scientific Names in Ornithology'.&lt;ref name="Jobling"&gt;[https://www.hbw.com/dictionary/key-to-scientific-names-in-ornithology?name=cockerell cockerell] Jobling, J.

|accessdate=September 23, 2007
|publisher=historylink.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They and [[Paul Dorpat]] incorporated [[History Ink]] on November 10, 1997, with seed money from [[Patsy Bullitt Collins|Priscilla "Patsy" Collins]], by birth a member of Seattle's wealthy and prominent Bullitt family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2003 HistoryLink.org expanded its content to cover [[Washington state]] history. Meanwhile, History Ink continues, focusing on the production of history books.&lt;ref name=historylinkcrowley /&gt;

==Awards==
Crowley and HistoryLink.org have won many awards, including
* The [[Pacific Northwest Historians Guild]]'s 2007 History Award
* The Washington State Historic Preservation Office's award for media in 2001
* The Association of King County Historical Organizations award for best long-term project (2000)&lt;ref name=historylinkcrowley /&gt;

'''Houghton Library''', on the south side of [[Harvard Yard]] adjacent to [[Widener Library]], is [[Harvard University]]'s primary repository for rare books and manuscripts. It is part of the Harvard College Library, the library system of [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].

== History ==
[[File:NicholasLynde bookplate.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|left]]
[[File:ElishaCooke bookplate.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|left|Bookplates from the Houghton collection]]
Harvard's first special collections library began as the Treasure Room of [[Gore Hall]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/2574586?n=1667&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasure Room moved to [[Widener Library]] after that library was completed in 1915. In March 1938, looking to supply Harvard's most valuable collections with more space and improved storage conditions, Harvard College Librarian [[Keyes Metcalf|Keyes DeWitt Metcalf]] presented the Harvard Corporation with a set of proposals which would eventually lead to the creation of Houghton Library, Lamont Library, and the New England Deposit Library. Funding for Houghton was raised privately, with the largest portion coming from Arthur A. Houghton Jr., in the form of shares of stock in [[Corning Glass Works]]. Construction was largely completed by the fall of 1941, and the library opened on February 28, 1942.

Houghton holds collections of papers of [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[John Keats]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and his family, [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and his daughter [[Louisa May Alcott]], along with the papers of other notable [[transcendentalists]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[T.S. Eliot]], [[E.E. Cummings]], [[Henry James]], [[William James]], [[James Joyce]], [[John Updike]], [[Jamaica Kincaid]], [[Gore Vidal]], and many others.

Houghton also holds the letters of [[Colonel]] [[Robert Gould Shaw]], who commanded the [[54th Massachusetts]] during the Civil War, and was killed during the assault on [[Fort Wagner]].

[[File:Lamina2.jpg|thumb|190px|Jentil.]]
[[File:Jentilarri trikuharria, Aralar mendilerroa.jpg|thumb|190px|Jentilarri, Aralar.]]
The '''jentil''' (or '''Jentilak''' with the [[Basque language|Basque]] plural), are a race of [[giant (mythology)|giants]] in the [[Basque mythology]]. This word meaning ''[[gentile]]'', from [[Latin]] ''gentilis'', was used to refer to pre-Christian civilizations and in particular to the builders of [[megalith]]ic monuments, to which the other Basque mythical legend the [[Mairuak]] are involved too.

A Jentil stands more than 12 feet tall and weighs about 1600 pounds.

The ''jentil'' were believed to have lived alongside the [[Basque people]]. They were hairy and so tall that they could walk in the sea and threw rocks from one mountain to another. This stone throwing has led to several tales and explanations for ancient stone buildings and [[Megalith|large isolated rocks]]. Even the Basque ball game, ''[[pilota]]'', is ascribed to these stone-throwers. The tradition lives on in the Basque power games of stone lifting and throwing. Some attributed to the ''jentil'' the defeat of [[Roland]] in the [[Battle of Roncevaux]], where the Basques defeated the [[Franks|Frankish]] army by throwing rocks on them. The giants were believed to have created the [[neolithic]] monuments, such as [[dolmen]]s, found around the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]. 

They also were said to have invented [[metallurgy]] and the [[saw]] and first grew [[wheat]], teaching humans to farm. However, they were unwilling to move to the valleys from the mountains, with a certain unwillingness to progress. They disappeared into the earth under a dolmen in the [[Arratzaren]] valley in [[Navarra]] when a portentous luminous cloud – perhaps a star – appeared, said to have heralded the birth of [[Christ]] (''Kixmi'') and the end of the jentil age. Other stories say ''jentil'' threw themselves from a mountain. Only [[Olentzero]] remained, a giant who appears at [[Christmas]] and is reproduced as straw dolls.

There are many structures and places around the Basque Country with ''jentil'' in their name, generally referring to pagan or ancient places, supposedly built by the jentil. Dolmens are   ''jentilarri'' or ''jentiletxe'', [[harrespil]] are ''jentilbaratz'', caves can be ''jentilzulo'' or ''jentilkoba''.

[[John Buchan|John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir]] {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]] [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]] [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]]}} (1875&amp;nbsp;– 1940) was a [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]], historian, biographer and editor. Outside the field of literature he was, at various times, a barrister, a publisher, a [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]], the Director of Information—reporting directly to prime minister [[David Lloyd George]]—during the First World War and a [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] MP who served as [[Governor General of Canada]], the [[List of Governors General of Canada#Governors General of Canada, 1867–present|15th]] since [[Canadian Confederation]].{{sfn|Matthew|2004}}{{sfn|Daniell|1992|p=4}}&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt;

Born in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland, Buchan was admitted to the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1892 to study classics; during his first year at university he edited the works of [[Francis Bacon]], which were published in 1894.{{sfn|Daniell|1992|p=5}} The following year he was awarded a scholarship to [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]; shortly after his arrival he also published his first novel, ''[[Sir Quixote of the Moors]]'', which he dedicated to [[Gilbert Murray]], his university tutor.{{sfn|MacLeod|1984|p=19}} By the time he left the university he had published five books,{{sfn|Matthew|2004}} including ''Scholar-Gipsies'', the first work of non-fiction he wrote.{{sfn|Daniell|1992|p=4}}&lt;ref name="Guard: Obit" /&gt;

Much of Buchan's non-fiction mirrored his circumstances: his time in South Africa resulted in ''The African Colony'', the First World War led to a series of books about the war in general, and the Scottish and South African forces in particular.{{sfn|Daniell|1992|pp=5–6}} He interspersed his non-fiction with further novels, and also wrote ten biographies and four volumes of poetry, as well as numerous articles and stories for magazines and journals.{{sfn|MacLeod|1984|p=19}} During the war he wrote ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'', the novel which has been adapted for film and television more than any of his other work, (film versions in [[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|1935]]; [[The 39 Steps (1959 film)|1959]]; and [[The Thirty Nine Steps (1978 film)|1978]], as well as a [[The 39 Steps (2008 film)|2008 version for British television]]).{{sfn|MacLeod|1984|p=22}}

'''''Mafesa v Parity Versekeringsmaatskappy Bpk (In Likwidasie)'''''&lt;ref&gt;1968 2 SA 603 (O).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]]. It was heard in the Orange Free State Provincial Division on 15 and 16 February 1968, with judgment handed down on 29 February. The presiding officer was Smit RP.

The case is especially important in the law of delict, as an illustration of the concept of the ''[[nova causa interveniens]]''. The plaintiff's leg had been broken in a collision, and he was discharged from hospital after the bone had clinically sufficiently knitted. Shortly thereafter, however, his crutches slipped on a smooth floor and the bone broke again. The court found that the fall had been caused by the plaintiff' own carelessness, and that the defendant was not liable for the prolongation of the recovery. The court also disallowed costs for the doctor's qualifying expenses.

== Facts ==
In an action for damages for personal injuries which he sustained in a collision, it appeared that the plaintiff, a black man named Mafesa, had suffered a fracture of the right [[femur]] and [[tibia]]. After the leg had clinically set sufficiently, he was discharged from hospital. He had been given crutches to walk with, as his leg was still in splints. He was told not to place any weight on the leg, as it could break again.

The next month he slipped and fell and again broke the thighbone. He had been walking on his crutches on a smooth floor when the crutches had slipped away from under him. He had known that the floor was smooth and also that the crutches were liable to slip, because at that time they had not had rubber tips. Mafesa had to undergo a second operation, and his recovery was prolonged for six months.

== Judgment ==
The court held that the defendant was responsible for the damage sustained as a result of the collision, but that the fall had been caused by the plaintiff's own carelessness. The defendant was not liable for the damage caused thereby: The fall was an intervening cause which broke the causal effect of the original negligence. As no evidence had been adduced to show that the plaintiff's doctor had incurred special expenses in qualifying, the court held that plaintiff's request for his qualifying expenses should not be allowed.

[[File:Pen_Box,_Image_of_Manuchihr_Khan.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Manouchehr Khan Gorji in [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]
'''Manuchehr Khan Gorji Mo'tamad al-Dawle''' (died 1847) was a government official in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] [[Iran]]. He was of [[Georgians in Iran|Georgian origin]]; hence, ''Gorji'' (i.e., "Georgian") in his surname. He was known as a sympathizer of [[Báb]], the founder of [[Bábism]] religious movement.

== Biography ==
Manuchehr was [[Christianity in Georgia (country)|Christian]] by birth and from [[Tbilisi]].{{sfn|Maeda|2009}} His original Georgian name was Chongur Enakolopashvili ({{lang-ka|ენაკოლოფაშვილი}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gvakharia|first1=Alexander|title=ახლოაღმოსავლური კრებული [Middle Eastern Collections]|date=1983|location=Tbilisi|pages=198–201|language=Georgian|chapter=ერთი ფურცელი ქართულ-სპარსული ისტორიული ურთიერთობიდან [One page from Georgian-Persian historical relations]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Maeda|2009}} During his early life, he participated in the campaign of General [[Pavel Tsitsianov]] during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813]], but was captured by the Iranian troops near the [[Yerevan Fortress]] in the summer of 1804, converted to [[Islam]], and castrated. Given an employment in the [[Shah of Iran|shah]]'s [[harem]], he rose to higher court and government positions by virtue of his military and administrative skills. Manuchehr Khan was heavy-handed in dealing with tribal and urban revolts and used his good contacts with the court to further his influence. 

Inside the court, he formed an alliance with [[Khosrow Khan Gorji]].{{sfn|Maeda|2009}} In 1837, the governor of [[Kermanshah Province|Kermanshah]], [[Bahram Mirza]], who was also the brother of then incumbent king [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]] (r. 1834–1848), was recalled to the Iranian capital of [[Tehran]] after complaints by the people of his governorate.{{sfn|Calmard|2015}} Manuchehr subsequently succeeded him as its governor.{{sfn|Calmard|2015}} 

In 1838, he was given the governorship of the royal city of [[Isfahan]], an office he would keep until his death.{{sfn|Walcher|2006|pages=657-675}} In 1839, the entire [[Isfahan Province]] was added to the domain of Manuchehr Khan Gorji, which already included Kermanshah, [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], and [[Luristan Province|Lorestan]].{{sfn|Calmard|2015}} As a result of said promotions, "he became in effect the viceroy of much central and southwestern Iran and delegated authority in Kermanshah to a series of subordinate governors".{{sfn|Calmard|2015}} Around the same time, still in the 1830s, Manuchehr Khan was responsible for the establishment of a central court of justice in Isfahan, which had both secular and religious judges, and in its implementation was roughly resembling the historical ''maẓālem'' court.{{sfn|Floor|2009}} 

The court however, was disbanded due to the presented opposition of those who found it to be working against their personal interests.{{sfn|Floor|2009}} When Báb arrived in Isfahan in 1846, Manuchehr gave him protection and, allegedly, offered military services to conquer Iran and spread his teachings into the country and even beyond it. Báb reportedly declined the offer, but accepted the governor's protection. Manuchehr Khan died shortly thereafter and Báb, left without an influential patron, fell in disfavor with the shah. Manuchehr Khan was buried at the [[Fatima Masumeh Shrine]] in [[Qom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCants|first1=William|editor1-last=Martín|editor1-first=Richard C.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam &amp; the Muslim World, Volume 1|date=2004|publisher=Granite Hill Publishers|isbn=0028656032|page=96|chapter=Babiyya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bayat|first1=Mangol|title=Mysticism and Dissent: Socioreligious Thought in Qajar Iran|date=1982|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=0815628536|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as governor of Isfahan by Ḡolām-Ḥosayn Khan Sepahdār.{{sfn|Walcher|2006|pages=657-675}}

[[File:Frans Hals, De magere compagnie.jpg|thumb|The ''Meagre Company'', 1633&amp;ndash;1637]]
[[File:Frans Hals - De officieren van de Sint-Adriaansdoelen.jpg|thumb|The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633. The portraits of the men are cut off at the knee in the traditional Haarlem style]]
The '''''Meagre Company''''', or '''''The company of Captain Reinier Reael and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw''''', refers to the only militia group portrait, or ''[[schutterstuk]]'', painted by [[Frans Hals]] outside of [[Haarlem]], and today is in the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], on loan to the [[Rijksmuseum]], where it is considered one of its main attractions of the ''Honor Gallery''. Hals was unhappy about commuting to Amsterdam to work on the painting and, unlike his previous group portraits, was unable to deliver it on time. The sitters contracted [[Pieter Codde]] to finish the work.

Hals was originally contracted in 1633, after the favorable reception of his previous militia group portrait, ''[[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633]]'', in which all ensigns are holding flags and all officers are holding their weapons. The sergeants were shown, holding [[halberd]]s to differentiate them from officers with [[spontoon]]s. Hals seems to have initially intended an Amsterdam version of the same painting, beginning on the left with a smiling flag bearer wearing a flamboyant cut-sleeve jacket with lace and holding a flag in the color of his sash. Though it is impossible to tell on which side of the canvas Hals began painting, the light falls onto the figures from the left in the "standard" Hals tradition and this is also where the most important figures are situated within the painting.  Since each sitter paid for his own portrait, it is presumed that Hals began with the most important sitters in order to "sell" canvas room to other paying officers. Whether or not Hals did in fact start on the left or drew a sketch of the entire group at once, the flag bearer on the left in this painting has been painted in a remarkably flamboyant way from the tip of his hat to the toe of his boots. This was possibly to prove to the decision makers in Amsterdam that Hals was capable of painting a schutterstuk in the "Amsterdam style", which included the entire figure. In Haarlem, the civic guards were traditionally portrayed in the ''kniestuk'' style of being "cut off at the knee" in three-quarter length portraits.

The flag bearer is Nicolaes van Bambeeck. Seated next to him are Captain Reael, with hat and commander's staff, and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw, balding and holding a spontoon. The further to the right, however, the less the two paintings resemble each other. In 1636 Hals was called to Amsterdam to finish the painting, but he refused, offering to receive the sitters in his Haarlem studio with assurances that they would not need to sit very long. His offer was refused and Codde was hired to finish the piece. Because the men are thinner than the men portrayed in other, later, Amsterdam schutterstukken hanging near this painting, the piece was later nicknamed the "meagre company". Besides the ensign and the seated men, the names of the other officers are unknown today.
==Comments by Van Gogh==
[[File:Frans Hals, left ensign detail - De magere compagnie.jpg|thumb|The figure of the standard-bearer in the extreme left corner, right up against the frame]]
The impressionist painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] was inspired by the painting, which he saw when he paid a visit to [[the Night Watch]] in the newly opened [[Rijksmuseum]] in 1885. He sent an enthusiastic letter about it to his brother Theo:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let534/letter.html#n-4 Letter by Vincent van Gogh] to Theo van Gogh, Nuenen, 10 October 1885&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don’t know whether you remember that to the left of the Night watch, in other words as a pendant to the [[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild|Syndics]], there’s a painting — it was unknown to me until now — by Frans Hals and P. Codde, 20 or so officers full length. Have you noticed it??? In itself, that painting alone makes the trip to Amsterdam well worth while, especially for a colourist. There’s a figure in it, the figure of the standard-bearer in the extreme left corner, right up against the frame. That figure is in grey from top to toe, let’s call it pearl grey, — of a singular neutral tone — probably obtained with orange and blue mixed so that they neutralize each other — by varying this basic colour in itself — by making it a little lighter here, a little darker there, the whole figure is as it were painted with one and the same grey. But the leather shoes are a different material from the leggings, which are different from the folds of the breeches, which are different from the doublet — expressing different materials, very different in colour one from another, still all one family of grey — but wait!
Into that grey he now introduces blue and orange — and some white.
The doublet has satin ribbons of a divine soft blue. Sash and flag orange — a white collar.

Orange, white, blue, as the national colours were then. Orange and blue next to each other, that most glorious spectrum — on a ground of grey judiciously mixed, precisely by uniting just those two, let me call them poles of electricity (in terms of colour, though) so that they obliterate each other, a white against that grey. Further carried through in that painting — other orange spectrums against a different blue, further the most glorious blacks against the most glorious whites — the heads — some twenty — sparkling with spirit and life, and how they’re done! and what colour! the superb appearance of all those fellows, full length. But that orange, white, blue chap in the left corner — — …… I’ve seldom seen a more divinely beautiful figure — — it’s something marvellous.

Delacroix would have adored it — just adored it to the utmost.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Voetboogdoelen==
{{main|Voetboogdoelen, Amsterdam}}
The painting previously hung with others in the old Archer's meeting hall called the "[[Voetboogdoelen, Amsterdam|Voetboogdoelen]]", located on the [[Singel]]. It was located there until the building was deconstructed to build the library of the [[University of Amsterdam]]. The group paintings that formerly hung in this hall have been since transferred to the [[Amsterdam Museum]], except for this one and a later one by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], which are on permanent loan to the [[Rijksmuseum]].

==Influence on later Amsterdam group portraits==
[[File:Bartholomeus van der Helst - Het Compagnie van kapitein Roelof Bicker en luitenant Jan Michielsz Blaeuw 1639.jpg|thumb|The Company of Roelof Bicker and lieutenant Jan Michielsz Blaeuw in 1639, by Van der Helst]]
[[File:Frans Hals 020.jpg|thumb|The Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1639, by Hals]]
The 'Meagre Company' currently hangs across from its successor, the next militia group portrait to be painted in Amsterdam, Van der Helst's ''[[:File:Bartholomeus van der Helst - Het Compagnie van kapitein Roelof Bicker en luitenant Jan Michielsz Blaeuw 1639.jpg|The Company of Roelof Bicker and lieutenant Jan Michielsz Blaeuw]]'', completed in 1639. These paintings are both hung near Rembrandt's ''[[The Night Watch]]'', which was completed well over a decade after Hals' commission, in 1642. Casual observers over the centuries have noticed how much fatter the officers became in that time, which is how the ''Meagre Company'' got its nickname. The nickname "Meagre company" appears to have been first used by the 18th-century art historian Jan van Dijk in his "Kunst en Historie Kundige beschrijving en opmerkingen over alle de schilderijen op het stadhuis", p. 30, No. 20.&lt;ref&gt;P. Scheltema, Historische beschrijving der schilderijen van het stadhuis te Amsterdam. Deel I, Stadsdrukkerij 1879, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Helst was himself the son of an innkeeper in Haarlem, and, like Hals, had taken advantage of the new [[trekschuit]] commuting service between Haarlem and Amsterdam in 1632 along the [[Haarlemmertrekvaart]]. Whereas Hals gave up his Amsterdam commission to concentrate on his next Haarlem group portrait, ''[[The Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1639]]'', Van der Helst seems to have embraced Amsterdam and at the young age of 23, even married there in 1636, the year that Hals was replaced by Codde. Van der Helst was probably a pupil of either Codde or Hals, as very little is documented about his training. In his 1639 group, he was clearly influenced by Hals, since he added design ideas from the ''Meagre Company'' as well as from Hals' later 1639 Haarlem group.

If there was a competition in Amsterdam to win militia group portrait commissions, then Van der Helst was clearly favored above Codde. Codde was never given another militia group portrait commission, although he went on to become a successful painter who could afford a house on the [[Keizersgracht]]. Van der Helst, on the other hand, went on to paint several more militia group portrait commissions as well as group portraits for other Amsterdam municipal organizations.

The '''Multicore Association''' was founded in 2005. Multicore Association is a member-funded, [[non-profit]], [[computer industry|industry]] [[consortium]] focused on the creation of [[open standard]] [[API]]s, [[specifications]], and guidelines that allow system developers and [[computer programmer|programmers]] to more readily adopt multicore technology into their [[application software|applications]].

The [[consortium]] provides a neutral forum for vendors and developers who are interested in, working with, and/or proliferating multicore-related products, including [[multi-core (computing)|processors]], infrastructure, devices, software, and applications. Its members represent vendors of [[Central processing unit|processors]], [[operating system]]s, [[compiler]]s, [[Software development process|development]] tools, [[debugger]]s, [[Enterprise Service Layer|ESL]]/[[Event-driven architecture|EDA]] tools, and simulators; and application and system [[Software developer|developers]].

The [[consortium]]’s president is Markus Levy, who is also president of [[EEMBC]], the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium. Sven Brehmer is the CTO, as well as president of PolyCore Software[http://www.polycoresoftware.com www.polycoresoftware.com].

== Completed Projects ==
In 2008, the '''Multicore Communications API''' working group released the consortium's first specification, referred to as [[MCAPI]]. MCAPI&amp;#8482; is a [[message-passing]] API that captures the basic elements of communication and synchronization that are required for closely distributed (multiple cores on a chip and/or chips on a [[circuit board]]) embedded systems. The target systems for MCAPI&amp;#8482; span multiple dimensions of [[heterogeneity]] (e.g., core heterogeneity, [[interconnect fabric]] heterogeneity, memory heterogeneity, [[operating system]] heterogeneity, software [[toolchain]] heterogeneity, and programming language heterogeneity).

In 2011, the MCAPI working group released MCAPI 2.0. The enhanced version adds new features, such as domains for routing purposes. MCAPI Version 2.0 adds a level of hierarchy into that network of nodes through the introduction of “domains.” Domains can be used in a variety of implementation-specific ways, such as for representing all the cores on a given chip or for dividing a topology into public and secure areas. MCAPI 2.0 also adds three new types of initialization parameters (node attributes, implementation-specific configurations, implementation information such as the initial network topology or the MCAPI version being executed). The MCAPI WG is chaired by Sven Brehmer.

In 2011, the '''Multicore Resource Management API''' working group released its first specification, referred to as [[MRAPI]]. MRAPI is an industry-standard API that specifies essential application-level resource management capabilities. Multicore applications require this API to allow coordinated concurrent access to system resources in situations where: (1) there are not enough resources to dedicate to individual [[task (computing)|task]]s or processors, and/or (2) the [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)]] system does not provide a uniformly accessible mechanism for coordinating resource sharing. This API is applicable to both SMP and AMP embedded multicore implementations (whereby AMP refers to heterogeneous both in terms of software and hardware). MRAPI (in conjunction with other Multicore Association APIs) can serve as a valuable tool for implementing applications, as well as for implementing such full-featured resource managers and other types of layered services. The MRAPI WG was chaired by Jim Holt.

In 2013, the '''Multicore Task Management API''' (MTAPI) working group released its first specification. MTAPI is a standard specification for an application program interface (API) that supports the coordination of tasks on embedded parallel systems with homogeneous and heterogeneous cores. Core features of MTAPI are runtime scheduling and mapping of tasks to processor cores. Due to its dynamic behavior, MTAPI is intended for optimizing throughput on multicore-systems, allowing the software developer to improve the task scheduling strategy for latency and fairness. This working group was chaired by Urs Gleim of [[Siemens]].

In 2013, the '''Multicore Programming Practices''' (MPP) working group delivered a [[multi-core (computing)|multicore]] software programming guide for the industry that aids in improving consistency and understanding of [[multi-core (computing)|multicore]] programming issues. The MPP guide provides best practices leveraging the [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] language to generate a guide of genuine value to engineers who are approaching multicore programming. This working group was chaired by Rob Oshana of [[NXP Semiconductors]] and David Stewart of [[CriticalBlue]].

in 2015, the '''Software/Hardware Interface for Multicore/Manycore''' (SHIM) working group delivered a specification to define an architecture description standard useful for software design. Some architectural features that SHIM describes are the hardware topology including processor [[Multi-core_processor|cores]], [[Hardware acceleration|accelerators]], [[cache memory|caches]], and inter-core communication channels, with selected details of each element, and instruction, memory, and communication performance information. This working group was chaired by Masaki Gondo of eSOL[http://www.esol.com].

==Active Working Groups==

* The '''Multicore Communications API''' (MCAPI) working group is currently adding more features and functions to expand the usefulness of MCAPI for Version 2.x. The working group is working on interoperability and 'zero copy' functionality, including bidirectional interaction between 'application and application' using shared memory and bidirectional interaction between 'application and driver', which is being led by Sven Brehmer of PolyCore Software.
* The '''Virtualization''' working group will focus on defining and optimizing a set of [[paravirtualization]] information and functions to communicate with an [[Hypervisor]]. The working group will also focus on a system to categorize the various virtualization features and functionality including within multicore processors. This working group is chaired by Rajan Goyal of [[Cavium Networks]] and Surender Kumar of [[Nokia Networks]].
* The '''Open Asymmetric Multi Processing (OpenAMP)''' working group will focus on standardizing the APIs, providing detailed documentation for the specification, and expanding the functionality of [[OpenAMP]]. This working group is chaired by Tomas Evensen of [[Xilinx]].

'''Māori mythology''' and '''Māori traditions''' are the two major categories into which the [[legend]]s of the [[Māori people|Māori]] of New Zealand may usefully be divided. The [[rituals]], beliefs, and the world view of Māori society were ultimately based on an elaborate [[mythology]] that had been inherited from a [[Polynesia]]n homeland and adapted and developed in the new setting (Biggs 1966:448).

==19th-century sources==
===Missionaries===
Few records survive of the extensive body of Māori mythology and tradition from the early years of European contact. The [[missionaries]] had the best opportunity to get the information, but failed to do so at first, in part because their knowledge of the language was imperfect. Most of the missionaries who did master the language were unsympathetic to Māori beliefs{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}, regarding them as  'puerile beliefs', or even 'works of the devil'.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Exceptions to this general rule were [[J. F. Wohlers]] of the [[South Island]],&lt;ref&gt;Wohler's work is presented in Christine Tremewan's ''Traditional Stories from Southern New Zealand: He Kōrero nō Te Wai Pounamu'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Taylor (missionary)|Richard Taylor]], who worked in the [[Taranaki]] and [[Wanganui River]] areas, and [[William Colenso]] who lived at the [[Bay of Islands]] and also in [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]]. "The writings of these men are among our best sources for the legends of the areas in which they worked" (Biggs 1966:447).

===Non-missionary collectors===
In the 1840s [[Edward Shortland]], [[Sir George Grey]], and other non-missionaries began to collect the myths and traditions. At that time many Māori were literate in their own language and the material collected was, in general, written by Māori themselves in the same style as they spoke. The new medium seems to have had minimal effect on the style and content of the stories. Genealogies, songs, and narratives were written out in full, just as if they were being recited or sung. Many of these early manuscripts have been published, and {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} scholars have access to a great body of material (more than for any other area of the [[Pacific]]) containing multiple versions of the great myth cycles known in the rest of Polynesia, as well as of the local traditions pertaining only to New Zealand. A great deal of the best material is found in two books, ''Nga Mahi a nga Tupuna'' (The Deeds of the Ancestors), collected by Sir George Grey and translated as ''Polynesian Mythology''; and ''Ancient History of the Māori'' (six volumes), edited by John White (Biggs 1966:447).&lt;ref&gt;Later scholars, however, have been critical of the editing methods used by these collectors, especially Grey.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of the legends==
The three forms of expression prominent in Māori and Polynesian [[oral literature]] are genealogical recital, poetry, and narrative prose.

===Genealogical recital===
The reciting of genealogies ([[whakapapa]]) was particularly well developed in Māori oral literature, where it served several functions in the recounting of tradition. Firstly it served to provide a kind of time scale which unified all Māori [[Mythology|myth]], [[tradition]], and [[history]], from the distant past to the present. It linked living people to the gods and the legendary heroes. By quoting appropriate genealogical lines, a narrator emphasised his or her connection with the characters whose deeds were being described, and that connection also proved that the narrator had the right to speak of them. "In the cosmogonic genealogies, to be described later, genealogical recital is revealed as a true literary form. What appears at first sight to be a mere listing of names is in fact a cryptic account of the evolution of the universe"' (Biggs 1966:447).

===Poetry and song===
Māori poetry was always sung or chanted; musical rhythms rather than linguistic devices served to distinguish it from prose. [[Rhyme]] or [[assonance]] were not devices used by the Māori; only when a given text is sung or chanted will the metre become apparent. The lines are indicated by features of the music. The language of poetry tends to differ stylistically from prose. Typical features of poetic diction are the use of [[synonyms]] or contrastive opposites, and the repetition of key words. "Archaic words are common, including many which have lost any specific meaning and acquired a religious mystique. Abbreviated, sometimes cryptic utterances and the use of certain grammatical constructions not found in prose are also common" (Biggs 1966:447-448).

===Prose narrative===
Prose narrative forms the great bulk of Māori legendary material. Some appears to have been sacred or esoteric, but many of the legends were well-known stories told as entertainment in the long nights of winter. "Nevertheless, they should not be regarded simply as [[fairy tales]] to be enjoyed only as stories. The Māui myth, for example, was important not only as entertainment but also because it embodied the beliefs of the people concerning such things as the origin of fire, of death, and of the land in which they lived. The ritual chants concerning firemaking, fishing, death, and so on made reference to Māui and derived their power from such reference" (Biggs 1966:448).

==Myths==
[[Image:TahuhuNgatiAwa.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Detail from a tāhūhū (ridgepole of a house), Ngāti Awa, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, circa 1840. Believed to represent one of two ancestors: Tūwharetoa or Kahungunu.]]Myths are set in the remote past and their content often have to do with the supernatural. They present Māori ideas about the creation of the universe and the origins of gods and of people. The mythology accounts for natural phenomena, the weather, the stars and the moon, the fish of the sea, the birds of the forest, and the forests themselves. Much of the culturally institutioned behaviour of the people finds its sanctions in myth. "Perhaps the most distinctive feature of myth, as distinct from tradition, is its universality. Each of the major myths is known in some version not only throughout New Zealand but also over much of Polynesia as well" (Biggs 1966:448).

The Māori understanding of the development of the universe was expressed in genealogical form. These genealogies appear in many versions, in which several symbolic themes constantly recur. "Evolution may be likened to a series of periods of darkness (pō) or voids (kore), each numbered in sequence or qualified by some descriptive term. In some cases the periods of darkness are succeeded by periods of light (ao). In other versions the evolution of the universe is likened to a tree, with its base, tap roots, branching roots, and root hairs. Another theme likens evolution to the development of a child in the womb, as in the sequence “the seeking, the searching, the conception, the growth, the feeling, the thought, the mind, the desire, the knowledge, the form, the quickening”. Some, or all, of these themes may appear in the same genealogy" (Biggs 1966:448).
The cosmogonic genealogies are usually brought to a close by the two names Rangi and Papa (father sky and mother earth). The marriage of this celestial pair produced the gods and, in due course, all the living things of the earth (Biggs 1966:448).

The earliest full account of the origins of gods and the first human beings is contained in a manuscript entitled ''Nga Tama a Rangi'' (The Sons of Heaven), written in 1849 by [[Wī Maihi Te Rangikāheke]], of the [[Ngāti Rangiwewehi]] tribe of [[Rotorua]]. The manuscript "gives a clear and systematic account of Māori religious beliefs and beliefs about the origin of many natural phenomena, the creation of woman, the origin of death, and the fishing up of lands. No other version of this myth is presented in such a connected and systematic way, but all early accounts, from whatever area or tribe, confirm the general validity of the Rangikāheke version. It begins as follows: 'My friends, listen to me. The Māori people stem from only one source, namely the Great-heaven-which-stands-above, and the Earth-which-lies-below. According to Europeans, God made heaven and earth and all things. According to the Māori, Heaven (Rangi) and Earth (Papa) are themselves the source' " (Biggs 1966:448).&lt;ref&gt;Grey published an edited version of Te Rangikāheke's story in ''Nga Mahi a Nga Tupuna'', and translated it into English as ''Polynesian Mythology''. Grey 1971 and Grey 1956 are later editions of these early works.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corpus of Māori myths===
According to Biggs (1966:448), the main corpus of Māori mythology unfolds in three story complexes or cycles, which are:
*The cosmogonic genealogies relating the origins of gods and people
&lt;!-- Do not sort these alphabetically - they are in genealogical sequence --&gt;
**[[Rangi and Papa]]
**[[Hine-nui-te-pō]]
*The Māui complex of myths
&lt;!-- Do not sort these alphabetically - they are in genealogical sequence --&gt;
**[[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]]
**[[Irawaru]]
**[[Tinirau and Kae]]
*The Tāwhaki complex of myths
&lt;!-- Do not sort these alphabetically - they are in genealogical sequence --&gt;
**[[Tāwhaki]]
**[[Wahieroa]]
**[[Rātā (Māori mythology)|Rātā]]
**[[Matuku-tangotango]]
**[[Tūwhakararo]]
**[[Whakatau]]
**[[Whiro]]

==Traditions==
"Every Māori social group had its own body of traditional belief which validated its claims to the territory it occupied, gave authority to those of high rank, and justified the group's external relationships with other groups. These purposes were served because the members of the groups concerned believed that the traditions were true records of past events, and they acted accordingly. Alliances between groups were facilitated if it was believed that they shared a common heritage, and the commoner's respect for and fear of his chief were based, in part at least, on his belief in the semi-divine ancestry of those of high rank" (Biggs 1966:450).

"Traditions, as opposed to myths, tell of incidents which are for the most part humanly possible. Genealogical links with the present place them within the past millennium. They are geographically located in New Zealand and knowledge of them is confined to this country" (Biggs 1966:448).

===Corpus of Māori tradition===
According to Biggs (1966:451), tradition may be divided into three types:

====Discovery or origin traditions====
There were two major discovery or origin traditions. One of these traditions names [[Kupe]] as the discoverer of New Zealand. The second group of traditions regards [[Toi (name)|Toi]] as the first important origin ancestor. "Both traditions were current over wide but apparently complementary areas of the North Island. Attempts to place the two in a single chronological sequence are misguided, since there is no reliable evidence that they ever formed part of the same body of traditional lore" (Biggs 1966:451).

*According to the tribes of North [[Auckland]] and the west coast of the North Island, [[Kupe]] sailed to New Zealand from [[Hawaiki]], after murdering a man called [[Hoturapa]], and making off with his wife, [[Kuramarotini]]. Traditional songs recount Kupe's travels along the coast of New Zealand. Kupe sailed back to Hawaiki and never came back to the land he discovered. However, others came to New Zealand according to his directions (Biggs 1966:451).
*[[Toi (name)|Toi]] (Toi-kai-rākau, or Toi-the-wood-eater) is the traditional origin ancestor of the tribes of the East Coast of the North Island. Their traditions make no mention of his coming to New Zealand, and the inference is that he was born there. The [[Tūhoe]] tribe of the inland [[Bay of Plenty]], say that Toi's 'ancestor' Tiwakawaka was the first to settle the country, "but only his name is remembered" (Biggs 1966:451). Tiwakawaka is actually the name of a bird, the [[New Zealand fantail|fantail]].

====Migration and settlement traditions====
*Migration traditions are numerous, and pertain to small areas and to small groups of tribes. "Certain tribes appear to have emphasised their [[Māori migration canoes|canoe migration tradition]] and descent from crew members more than the others. In particular, the [[Hauraki]], [[Waikato]], and [[King Country]] tribes ([[Tainui]] canoe) and the [[Rotorua]] and [[Taupo]] tribes ([[Te Arawa]] canoe) appear to have placed special emphasis on their descent from a particular canoe migration" (Biggs 1966:451).

====Local traditions====
Each tribal group, whether tribe or subtribe, maintained its discrete traditional record, which generally concerned "great battles and great men"; these stories were linked together by genealogy, which in Māori tradition is an elaborate art. "In some cases the story is continuous and internally consistent from the migration down to the present. In other cases it is fragmentary and discontinuous earlier than about 1600" (Biggs 1966:453).

'''Neith''' ({{IPAc-en|n|eɪ|θ}} or {{IPAc-en|n|iː|θ}}, from {{lang-grc-koi|Νηΐθ}}, a borrowing of the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] form {{lang-egy|nt}}, likely originally ''nrt'' "she is the terrifying one"; also spelled '''Nit''', '''Net''', or '''Neit''') was an early [[ancient Egyptian deities|ancient Egyptian deity]] who was said to be the first and the prime creator. She was said to be the creator of the universe and all it contains and she governs how it functions.

Neith was the [[tutelary deity]] of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]] ({{lang-cop|ⲥⲁⲓ}} ''Sai'' from Egyptian ''Zau''), where her cult was centered in the western [[Nile Delta]] of [[Lower Egypt]] and attested as early as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw &amp; Nicholson, op, cit., p.250&lt;/ref&gt; Neith was also one of the three tutelary deities of the southern city of Latopolis ({{lang-grc-koi|Λατόπολις}}) or Snē (Sahidic Coptic: {{lang|cop|{{Script/Coptic|ⲥⲛⲏ}}}} from earlier Egyptian: ''t3-snt'', also ''iwnyt''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAlPDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|title=The Theology of Hathor of Dendera: Aural and Visual Scribal Techniques in the Per-Wer Sanctuary|last=Richter|first=Barbara A.|date=2016-04-15|publisher=ISD LLC|isbn=9781937040529|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kiQrO70c7nYC&amp;pg=PA192|title=The Egyptian God Tutu: A Study of the Sphinx-god and Master of Demons with a Corpus of Monuments|last=Kaper|first=Olaf E.|date=2003|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=9789042912175|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Latopolis was located on the west bank of the [[Nile|River Nile]] some {{convert|55|km}} south of [[Luxor]].

==Symbolism==
[[File:Bronze statuette of Neith. She wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The hieroglyphic inscriptions, partially erased, mention the name of Padihor. From Egypt. Late Period. The British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|Bronze statuette of Neith, wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt; the hieroglyphic inscriptions, partially erased, mention the name of Padihor - Egypt, Late Period, The British Museum, London]]
Neith is a goddess of war and of hunting, and had as her symbol two arrows crossed over a shield. She is a far more complex goddess than is generally known, however, and of whom ancient texts only hint of her true nature. A religious silence was imposed by ancient Egyptians for secrecy, employing euphemisms and allusions and often relying on symbols alone. In her usual representations, she is portrayed as a fierce deity, a woman wearing the Red Crown, occasionally holding or using the bow and arrow, in others a harpoon. In fact, the hieroglyphs of her name usually are followed by a determinative containing the archery elements, with the shield symbol of the name being explained as either double bows (facing one another), intersected by two arrows (usually lashed to the bows), or, by other imagery associated with her worship. Her symbol also identified the city of Sais.&lt;ref&gt;The Way to Eternity: Egyptian Myth, F. Fleming &amp; A. Lothian, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol was displayed on top of her head in Egyptian art. In her form as a [[war goddess|goddess of war]], she was said to make the weapons of warriors and to guard their bodies when they died.

As a deity, Neith is normally shown carrying the [[Was (sceptre)|was]] scepter (symbol of rule and power) and the [[ankh]] (symbol of life). She is also called such cosmic epithets as the "Cow of Heaven", a sky-goddess similar to Nut, and as the Great Flood, [[Mehet-Weret]] (MHt wr.t), as a cow who gives birth to the sun daily. In these forms, she is associated with creation of both the primeval time and daily "re-creation". As protectress of the Royal House, she is represented as a [[uraeus]], and functions with the fiery fury of the sun, In time, this led to her being considered as the [[personification]] of the [[Primordial sea|primordial]] waters of [[Creation myth#Egyptian|creation]]. She is identified as a [[Great Goddess hypothesis|great mother goddess]] in this role as a creator. She is the personification of the primeval waters, able to give birth (create) parthenogenetically (without the opposite gender). Among the pairs of deities usually noted by the later ancient Egyptians, she is paired with [[Ptah]]-Nun. In the same manner, her personification as the primeval waters is Mehetweret (MHt wr.t), the Great Flood, conceptualized as streaming water, related to another use of the verb ''sti'', meaning 'to pour'.

Neith is one of the most ancient deities associated with ancient Egyptian culture. Flinders Petrie (''Diopolis Parva'', 1901) noted the earliest depictions of her standards were known in predynastic periods, as can be seen from a representation of a barque bearing her crossed arrow standards in the Predynastic Period, as displayed in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.

Her first anthropomorphic representations occur in the early dynastic period, on a diorite vase of King Ny-Netjer of the Second Dynasty, found in the Step Pyramid of Djoser (Third Dynasty) at Saqqara. That her worship predominated the early dynastic periods is shown by a preponderance of theophoric names (personal names which incorporate the name of a deity) within which Neith appears as an element.  Predominance of Neith's name in nearly forty percent of early dynastic names, and particularly in the names of four royal women of the First Dynasty, only emphasizes the importance of this goddess in relation to the early society of Egypt, with special emphasis upon the Royal House.

In the very early periods of Egyptian history, the main iconographic representations of this goddess appear to have been limited to her hunting and war characteristics, although there is no Egyptian mythological reference to support the concept that this was her primary function as a deity. It has been suggested these hunting and war features of Neith's imagery may indicate her origin from Libya, located west and southwest of Egypt, where she was goddess of the combative peoples there.

It has been theorized that Neith's primary cult point in the Old Kingdom was established in Saïs (modern Sa el-Hagar) by Hor-Aha of the First Dynasty, in an effort to placate the residents of Lower Egypt by the ruler of the unified country. Textual and iconographic evidence indicates that she was a national goddess for Old Kingdom Egypt, with her own sanctuary in Memphis, indicating the high regard held for her. There, she was known as "North of her Wall", as counterpoise to [[Ptah]]'s "South of his Wall" epithet. While Neith is generally regarded as a deity of Lower Egypt, her worship was not consistently located in that delta region. Her cult reached its height in Saïs and apparently in Memphis in the Old Kingdom, and remained important, although to a lesser extent, through the Middle and New Kingdom. The cult regained prominence again during the twenty-sixth dynasties when worship at Saïs flourished again, as well as at Esna in Upper Egypt.
 
Neith's symbol and part of her [[hieroglyph]] also bore a resemblance to a [[loom]], and so in later syncretisation of Egyptian myths by the Greek ruling class, she also became goddess of weaving. At this time her role as a creator conflated with that of [[Athena]], as a deity who wove all of the world and existence into being on her [[loom]].

Sometimes Neith was pictured as a woman [[breastfeeding|nursing]] a baby crocodile, and she then was addressed with the title, "Nurse of Crocodiles", reflecting a southern provincial mythology that she served as either the mother of the crocodile god, Sobek, (or he was her consort). As mother of Ra, in her [[Mehet-Weret]] form, she was sometimes described as the "Great Cow who gave birth to Ra". As a maternal figure (beyond being the birth-mother of the sun-god Ra) Neith is associated with Sobek as her son (as far back as the Pyramid Texts), but in later religious conventions that paired deities, no male deity is consistently identified with her as a consort and she often is represented without one. Later triad associations made with her have little or no religious or mythological supporting references, appearing to have been made by political or regional associations only.

Some writers assert that since Neith is a creator capable of giving birth without a partner (asexually) and without association of creation with sexual imagery, as seen in the myths of Atum and other creator deities, they may interpret that as her being androgynous. Her name always appears as feminine, however. Erik Hornung interprets that in the Eleventh Hour of the Book of the Amduat, Neith's name appears written with a phallus (''Das Amduat'', '''Teil I''': ''Text'': 188, No. 800.(Äg. Abh., Band 7, Wiesbaden) 1963). See also Ramadan el-Sayed, ''La Déese Neith de Saïs'', '''I''':16; 58-60, for both hieroglyphic rendering and discussion of an androgynous nature of Neith as creator/creatress deity, and ''Lexikon der Ägyptologie'' ('''LÄ I''') under "''Götter, androgyne''": 634-635 (W. Westendorf, ed., Harassowitz, Wiesbaden, 1977). In reference to Neith's function as creator with both male and female characteristics, Peter Kaplony has said in the '''Lexikon der Ägyptologie''': "Die Deutung von Neith als ''Njt'' "Verneinung" ist sekundär. Neith ist die weibliche Entsprechung zu ''Nw(w''), dem Gott der Urflut (Nun and Naunet). (Citing Sethe, ''Amun'', § 139)". '''''LÄ'' II''': 1118 (Harassowitz, Wiesbaden, 1977). The antiquity of Neith reaches deeply into the prehistoric periods, apparently even the neolithic, however, when female deities as the sole creators were quite common in human cultures, so she should be considered in that role without having to reach for other explanations about her not following later conventions.

Neith was considered to be eldest of the deities. Neith is said to have been "born the first, in the time when as yet there had been no birth" (St. Clair, ''Creation Records'': 176). In the Pyramid Texts, Neith is paired with Selket as braces for the sky, which places these two goddesses as the two supports for the heavens (see PT 1040a-d, following J. Gwyn Griffths, ''The Conflict of Horus and Seth'', (London, 1961) p.&amp;nbsp;1). This ties in with the vignette in the '''''Contendings of Seth and Horus''''' when Neith is asked by the deities, as the most ancient among them, to decide who should rule. She was appealed to as an arbiter in the dispute between Horus and Seth. In her message of reply, Neith selects Horus, and says she will "cause the sky to crash to the earth" if he is not selected.

==Attributes==
[[File:Aegis of Neith-H1550-IMG 0172.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aegis]] of Neith, [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]] - [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]]]]
An analysis of her attributes shows Neith was a goddess with many roles. From predynastic and early dynasty periods, she was referred to as an "Opener of the Ways" (''wp w3.wt'') which may have referred, not only to her leadership in hunting and war, but also as a psychopomp in cosmic and underworld pathways, escorting souls. References to Neith as the "Opener of Paths" occurs in Dynasties 4 through 6, and is seen in the titles of women serving as priestesses of the goddess. Such epithets include: "''Priestess of Neith who opens all the (path)ways''", "''Priestess of Neith who opens the good pathways''", "''Priestess of Neith who opens the way in all her places''". (el-Sayed, '''I''': 67-69). el-Sayed asserts his belief that Neith should be seen as a parallel to Wepwawet, the ancient jackal-god of Upper Egypt, who was associated with both royalty in victory and as a psychopomp for the dead.

The main imagery of Neith as ''wp w3.wt'' was as the deity of the unseen and limitless sky, as opposed to Nut and Hathor, who respectively represented the manifested night and day skies. Her epithet as the "Opener of the Sun's paths in all her stations" refers to how the sun is reborn (due to seasonal changes) at various points in the sky, under her control of all beyond the visible world, of which only a glimpse is revealed prior to dawn and after sunset. It is at these changing points that Neith reigns as a form of sky goddess, where the sun rises and sets daily, or at its 'first appearance' to the sky above and below. It is at these points, beyond the sky that is seen, that her true power as the deity who creates life is manifested. Georges St. Clair (''Creation Records'', 1898) noted that Neith is represented at times as a cow goddess with a line of stars across her back (as opposed to Nut's representations with stars across the belly) [See el-Sayed, II, Doc. 644], and maintained this indicated the ancient goddess represents the full ecliptic circle around the sky (above and below), and is seen iconographically in texts as both the regular and the inverted determinative for the heavenly vault, indicating the cosmos below the horizon. St. Clair maintained it was this realm Neith personified, for she is the complete sky which surrounds the upper (Nut) and lower (Nunet?) sky, and which exists beyond the horizon, and thereby beyond the skies themselves. Neith, then, is that portion of the cosmos which is not seen, and in which the sun is reborn daily, below the horizon (which may reflect the statement assigned to Neith as "I come at dawn and at sunset daily").

Since Neith also was goddess of war, she thus had an additional association with death: in this function, she shot her arrows into the enemies of the dead, and thus she began to be viewed as a protector of the dead, often appearing as a uraeus snake to drive off intruders and those who would harm the deceased (in this form she is represented in the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]). She also is shown as the protectress of one of the [[Four sons of Horus]], specifically, of [[Duamutef]], the deification of the [[canopic jar]] storing the stomach, since the abdomen (often mistakenly associated as the stomach) was the most vulnerable portion of the body and a prime target during battle.

==Mythology==
[[File:ENHANCED PHOTO OF NEITH.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian war goddess Neith wearing the [[Deshret]] crown of northern (lower) Egypt, which bears the [[cobra]] of [[Wadjet]]]]
In some [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], she was identified as the mother of [[Ra]] and [[Apep]]. When she was identified as a water goddess, she was also viewed as the mother of [[Sobek]], the [[crocodile]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming &amp; Lothian, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this association with water, i.e. the [[Nile]], that led to her sometimes being considered the wife of [[Khnum]], and associated with the source of the River Nile. She also was associated with the [[Nile Perch]] as well as the goddess of the triad in that cult center.

As the goddess of creation and weaving, she was said to reweave the world on her loom daily. An interior wall of the [[Egyptian temple|temple]] at [[Esna]] records an account of creation in which Neith brings forth from the primeval waters of the [[Naunet|Nun]] the first land. All that she conceived in her heart comes into being, including the thirty deities. Having no known husband she has been described as "Virgin Mother Goddess":

{{blockquote|Unique Goddess, mysterious and great who came to be in the beginning and caused everything to come to be&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. the divine mother of Ra, who shines on the horizon...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Lesko |first = Barbara S. |title = The Great Goddesses of Egypt |pages = 60–63 |publisher = University of Oklahoma Press |year = 1999 |isbn = 0-8061-3202-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Proclus]] (412–485 AD) wrote that the [[adyton]] of the temple of Neith in [[Sais]] (of which nothing now remains) carried the following inscription:

{{blockquote|I am the things that are, that will be, and that have been. No one has ever laid open the garment by which I am concealed. The fruit which I brought forth was the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others = Trans. [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] |last= Proclus |title= The Commentaries of Proclus on the Timaeus of Plato, in Five Books |publisher= A.J. Valpy |year= 1820 | page = 82 |url = https://books.google.com/books?&amp;pg=PA82&amp;id=Qh9dAAAAMAAJ#PPA82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was said that Neith interceded in the kingly war between [[Horus]] and Set, over the Egyptian [[throne]], recommending that Horus rule.

A great festival, called the ''Feast of Lamps'', was held annually in her honor and, according to [[Herodotus]], her devotees burned a multitude of lights in the open air all night during the celebration.

The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] (c. 484–425 BC) noted that the Egyptian citizens of [[Sais]] in Egypt worshipped Neith and that they identified her with [[Athena]]. The ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', a [[dialogue]] written by [[Plato]], mirrors that identification with Athena, possibly as a result of the identification of both goddesses with war and weaving.&lt;ref&gt;'' [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 21e&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. A. Wallis Budge]] speculates that the spread of Christianity in Egypt was influenced by the likeness of attributes between the Mother of Christ and goddesses such as Isis and Neith. He asserts that the writers of the apocryphal gospels, in honoring the blessed Virgin, ascribed to her the peculiar mythologies of these goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;"''The Gods of the Egyptians: Vol 2"'', E. A. Wallis Budge, p. 220-221, Dover ed 1969, org pub 1904, {{ISBN|0-486-22056-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mir Private Museum.JPG|thumb|A private museum in [[Mir, Belarus]].]]

A '''private museum''' is a [[Collection (museum)|collection]], usually on a very limited topic and operated by individual enthusiasts, collectors, clubs or companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flavorwire.com/196371/the-10-best-private-museums-worldwide | title=The 10 Best Private Museums Worldwide | publisher=[http://flavorwire.com/ Flavorwire] | work=Visual Arts | date=July 25, 2011 | accessdate=November 1, 2011 | last=Laster | first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike a public or governmental [[museum]], a scientific monitoring and systematic documentation is not always guaranteed. Therefore, a private museum has relevance for historical research only if it complements the national collections. Under certain circumstances, a private museum also receives funding from the state, so that a comparison with [[public museum]]s is possible.{{fact|date=November 2015}}

Many, especially smaller, private museums do not meet the requirements of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM). The main reason is that qualified personnel are not sufficiently available or can hardly be financed and therefore often only very limited opening times may be offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icom-cc.org/47/about-icom-cc/definition-of-profession | title=ICOM: The Conservator-Restorer: a Definition of the Profession | publisher=[[International Council of Museums]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often private museums focus on entertainment and have a tourism focus. Their collections are on display for the public to enjoy.

'''Laurence Roy Heffernan''' (12 July 1925 – 24 September 1992) was an [[Australia]]n [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. Roy Heffernan toured all over the world, but is most famous for being one half of the original version of the [[tag team]] [[the Fabulous Kangaroos]] (with [[Al Costello]]). The Kangaroos used an "Ultra Australian" [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]] complete with [[Boomerang]]s, [[Slouch hat|bush hats]] and "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" as their entrance music.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | chapter= Top 20: #1 The Fabulous Kangaroos | pages= 17–24 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first incarnation of the Kangaroos is the most famous of all the Kangaroo versions and is often credited with popularizing tag team wrestling in the late 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="TagIntro"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | chapter= Introduction | pages= 1–16 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costello and Heffernan are also regarded as one of the top tag teams to ever compete in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TopTenTeams"&gt;{{cite book | author= Conner, Floyd | title=Wrestling's Most Wanted : The Top 10 Book of Pro Wrestling's Outrageous Performers, Punishing Piledrivers, and Other Oddities | publisher=Potomac Books | date =12 February 2001 | chapter= Terrific Tag Teams | pages= 166 | isbn=978-1-57488-308-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Kangaroos broke up, Heffernan left America to return to his home of Australia.

==Biography==

===Starting out===
Roy Heffernan was a native Australian, born in Lithgow NSW, and was an avid weightlifter and [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]] in his teens. He was trained by his father, who was also a bodybuilder, and won the [[Mr. Australia]] title before making his wrestling debut at the age of twenty. Heffernan did not have an easy time moving up the ranks in Australian pro wrestling, as the belief at the time was that a wrestler really had to go overseas to North America and learn to be a pro before the bookers would even consider moving them up the rankings of the promotion. After working on the lower cards in Australia, Heffernan left his home country in 1953 to come to America in the hopes of attaining more success there.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

===Fabulous Kangaroos===
{{Main|The Fabulous Kangaroos}}

For years, Al Costello had been working on an idea for a new tag team and even had an idea of who his partner should be in this new tag team: a wrestler he had worked with some years ago (Heffernan). The problem was that Costello and Heffernan had lost touch over the years, so the idea remained dormant until Costello went on a tour of [[Hawaii]] in 1956. Costello mentioned his idea of an "Ultra Australian" tag team to fellow wrestler and future [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]], Joe Blanchard. Blanchard was good friends with Heffernan and knew that he was working in [[Stampede Wrestling]] at that point in time. Blanchard put the two in touch with each other, and soon after, Costello was off to [[Calgary, Alberta]], [[Canada]] to join up with Heffernan. Costello and Heffernan made their debut as the Fabulous Kangaroos on 3 May 1957 for [[Stu Hart]]’s Stampede Wrestling [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] in a match against Maurice LaPointe and Tony Baillargeon. Only weeks after making their debut, the Kangaroos were working with the top tag teams of the promotion.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

After working in Stampede for a while, the Fabulous Kangaroos traveled across the United States, headlining shows wherever they went due to their ability to rile the crowd up with their [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (bad guy) tactics. On one occasion in August 1958 the Kangaroos, or "Kangaroo Men" as they were billed, nearly caused a riot in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] during a match against [[Antonino Rocca]] and [[Miguel Pérez (wrestler)|Miguel Pérez]]. The fans began to throw fruit and stones after the match ended without a decisive winner, and the promoters had to step in, turn up the lights in the arena and play the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] to stop a potential riot from breaking out.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Everywhere the team went, they seemed to win championships; be it the Texas version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Texas version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] in [[Dory Funk]]’s [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Western States]] promotion, or the forerunner to the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship, the North East version of the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=WWWFUSTag/&gt;

During their time together from 1957 until 1965, the Kangaroos wrestled in the United States, Canada, Asia and select tours of Australia and New Zealand. They worked for such companies as [[World Wrestling Entertainment|Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (the future World Wrestling Entertainment), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Ohio]], the [[Japan Wrestling Association]] and the World Wrestling Association in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

The Kangaroos never forgot the territory that started it all and worked in Canada off and on over the years. The team not only worked for Stampede Wrestling while in Canada, but also worked for [[NWA All-Star Wrestling]] based in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. The Fabulous Kangaroos’ 1965 run in NWA All-Star Wrestling turned out to be the last time the original Kangaroos teamed together. In June 1965, the Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States at least for a while longer.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

===Return to Australia===
Roy Heffernan returned to his native Australia, and became one of the main wrestlers for [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) (the Australian version) under promoter [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]]. Heffernan retained his "Ultra Australian" gimmick complete with Bush hat and boomerang, but what had made him a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (bad guy) in the United States made him a beloved [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] (good guy) in Australia.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Heffernan's Fan Club Yearbook circa 1966 gives the following physical statistics for Roy Heffernan: neck 17.5&amp;nbsp;inches; chest 48.5&amp;nbsp;inches; waist 32.5&amp;nbsp;inches; thigh 27&amp;nbsp;inches; biceps 17.5&amp;nbsp;inches; calf 17.5&amp;nbsp;inches. He was billed in 1967 as weighing 225&amp;nbsp;lb. Costello was originally supposed to join Heffernan in Australia but it never worked out that way, leaving Costello in the United States while Heffernan wrestled as a singles wrestler.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Later in his career, Heffernan became involved in the actual running of WCW before retiring in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

===Death===
Roy Heffernan died on 24 September 1992 in his home in [[Sydney]] from a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive2000/jan24_costello.html | title = Fabulous Kangaroo Al Costello dead | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | author = Greg Oliver | publisher = Slam!Wrestling| quote = Heffernan died in September 1992 at 67 from a heart attack in Sydney, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] inducted Roy Heffernan, along with Al Costello, as the first ever tag team to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="HOF"/&gt; From 2003 and forward, the Hall of Fame has honored other tag teams, but the Fabulous Kangaroos were given the honor of being the first team to enter the Hall of Fame; in the tradition of the Kangaroos they were "billed as champions on arrival" one last time.&lt;ref name="HOFRules"/&gt;

'''VirtualCourthouse.com''' is an [[online dispute resolution]] service that was founded by Judge [[Arthur Monty M.

'''Yellowikis''' was a [[MediaWiki]] [[website]] collecting basic information about businesses. This information included basic contact details such as company name, address, websites, and telephone numbers, as well as internal Yellowiki [[wikilink]]s to competitors. Yellowikis was launched in January 2005. As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the Yellowikis main page had been translated into more than 25 different languages.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Some users also entered a number of codes including a two letter country code, as well as an [[International Standard Industrial Classification]], [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Industry Classification]] or US [[Standard Industrial Classification]]. Some users are also adding [[geocode]]s and [[Skype]] ids.

==Legal issues==
A commercial business listing company, [[Yell (company)|Yell Limited]], requested that the founders of Yellowikis, Paul Youlten and Rosa Blaus, amend their site, claiming that Yellowikis was "passing itself off" as being associated with Yell.com and that people would confuse the two organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This might be considered to be anti competitive behaviour/anti competitive in the eyes of certain commentators, however, such claim is unlikely to carry water from a legal perspective. 

Yell's claim is given considerable weight by the slogan on Yellowiki's front page that they are "Yellow Pages for the 21st Century" although in their public protestations, Yellowikis claim that they are not trying to create association between themselves and Yellow Pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In some territories, however, the mark has lost its distinctiveness as a source of origin of goods and services. From 9 to 14 October 2006, the domain address redirected to the new ''Owikis'' website, which stated "The trademark dispute between Yell Limited and Paul Youlten concerning the Yellowikis website has been satisfactorily resolved".

On 15 October 2006, the Yellowikis website reappeared, with the explanation that [[United Kingdom]] users would have to use Owikis, with the word ''Yell'' from the domain name and the color yellow from the logo; international users could continue to use Yellowikis. As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the Owikis site is not yet available. As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the [http://yellowikis.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page Wikia page] is dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yellowikis.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page |title=Web Archive |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109015130/http://yellowikis.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
