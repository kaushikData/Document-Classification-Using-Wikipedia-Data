In [[contemporary history]], the '''third millennium''' is a period of time that started on January 1, 2001, and will end on December 31, 3000 of the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name=New_millennium&gt;"[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/faqs/new-millennium-where-when-why When and where did the new Millennium officially start, and why?]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from the millennium known as the '''2000s''' which began on January 1, 2000&lt;!-- Do not change the year to 2001, as the 2000s by its title contains the years that has a 2 on the first digit.--&gt;  and will end on December 31, 2999.

As this millennium is currently in progress, The first two decades of the [[21st century]] (the past [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] and the current [[2010s]]), are the subject of the historian's attention. The remaining decades of the [[21st century]] ([[2020s]] to [[2090s]]) and the remaining centuries ([[22nd century|22nd]] to [[30th century|30th]]) are researched in [[futures studies]]. Here are some possible events that will happen in those particular years:

===Time capsules===
* April 27, 2109 – A [[time capsule]] placed under the floor boards of the [[Old Queens]] Building at [[Rutgers University]], in [[New Jersey]], [[United States]] buried on April 27, 2009, is scheduled to be opened on April 27, 2109.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary |last=Diduch |title=U. celebrates Old Queens bicentennial |url=http://www.dailytargum.com/news/u-celebrates-old-queens-bicentennial-1.1735519 |publisher=[[College Media Network]] |work=[[The Daily Targum]] |location=[[Rutgers University]] |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |quote=At the ceremony, a time capsule was revealed containing several items from today to leave for the University in 2109, at the building’s tricentennial commemoration. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101071112/http://www.dailytargum.com/news/u-celebrates-old-queens-bicentennial-1.1735519 |archivedate=January 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological events===
* 2099 – According to one study, 83% of the [[Amazon rainforest]] may have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17864-no-rainforest-no-monsoon-get-ready-for-a-warmer-world.html|title=No rainforest, no monsoon: get ready for a warmer world|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By 2100, 12% (about 1250) of the bird species existing at the beginning of the 21st century are expected to be extinct or threatened with extinction.&lt;ref name="Pimm2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimm |first=Stuart |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Human impacts on the rates of recent, present, and future bird extinctions |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=103 |issue=29 |pages=10941–10946 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0604181103 |url= |accessdate=  |pmc=1544153|quote= |pmid=16829570|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By 2100, [[emperor penguin]]s could be pushed to the brink of extinction due to [[climate change|global climate change]], according to a [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] study from January 2009. The study applied mathematical models to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect an [[Antarctica]] colony of emperor penguins, and they forecast a decline of 87% in the colony's population by the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/26/AR2009012601875.html?hpid=artslot | accessdate = January 26, 2008 | work=The Washington Post | first=Will | last=Dunham | title=Melting Sea Ice May Doom Emperor Penguins, Study Finds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendric predictions===
* January 19, [[2038]] – [[Year 2038 problem|32-bit computer clocks overflow]] to represent the date as December 13, 1901.
* [[2096]] is the last leap year before [[2100]], which will not be a leap year.
* On March 1, 2100 (which will be February 16, 2100 in the Julian calendar), the difference between the [[Julian calendar]] and the [[Gregorian calendar]] reaches 14 days. Since 14 is divisible by 7, this will be the first time in history since its inception that the Gregorian calendar will have the same day of the week for each day of the month for the whole year as the Julian calendar. This will last until February 28, 2200 of the Gregorian Calendar.
* 2100 will not be a leap year since it qualifies as a year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400.
* [[File Allocation Table|FAT file systems]] theoretically support dates up to December 31, 2107 (though officially only up to December 31, 2099).
* The Year type in [[MySQL]] supports dates up to December 31, 2155.
* March 17, 2160 – Unless changes are made as to when Easter can be observed, this particular March 17 will fall within [[Holy Week]] for the first time since 2008 and fall on the same day (Monday) as it did in that year, likely requiring the movement of the [[Saint Patrick's Day|Feast of Saint Patrick's Day]] to another date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=194136 |title=No St. Pat's Day Mass allowed in Holy Week |accessdate=2008-03-13 |author=Nevans-Pederson, Mary |date=2008-03-13 |work=Dubuque Telegraph Herald |publisher=Woodward Communications, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016055134/http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=194136 |archivedate=October 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unless [[Reform of the date of Easter|changes]] are made in the religious calendar, in 2285, the Western [[Easter]] will fall on March 22 for the first time since 1818, the earliest possible date on which Easter can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/easter.php|title=Selected Christian Observances|website=aa.usno.navy.mil|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological predictions===

[[File:Orbis eruditi literatura à charactere Samaritico deducta 1689.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Bernard]]'s "Orbis eruditi", comparing all known alphabets as of 1689]]
{{Writing systems sidebar}}

An '''alphabet''' is a standard set of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (basic written [[symbols]] or [[graphemes]]) that represent the [[phoneme]]s (basic significant sounds) of any [[spoken language]] it is used to write. This is in contrast to other types of [[writing system]]s, such as [[syllabary|syllabaries]] (in which each character represents a [[syllable]]) and [[Logogram|logographic systems]] (in which each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or semantic unit).

The first fully phonemic script, the [[Proto-Canaanite]] script, later known as the [[Phoenician alphabet]], is considered to be the first alphabet, and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and possibly [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]].&lt;ref name="Coulmas 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniels 9296"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|Bright|1996|pp=92–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter T. Daniels]], however, distinguishes an [[abugida]] or alphasyllabary, a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which [[diacritic]]s modify to represent vowels (as in [[Devanagari]] and other South Asian scripts), an [[abjad]], in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants (as in the original Phoenician, [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]]), and an "alphabet," a set of graphemes that represent both [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. In this narrow sense of the word the first "true" alphabet was the [[Greek alphabet]],&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed on the basis of the earlier [[Phoenician alphabet]]. 

Of the dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular is the [[Latin alphabet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks.  While most alphabets have letters composed of lines ([[linear writing]]), there are also [[non-linear writing|exceptions]] such as the alphabets used in [[Braille]]. The [[Khmer alphabet]] (for [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]]) is the longest, with 74 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angmohdan.com/language-largest-alphabet/ |title=What Language Has the Largest Alphabet? |quote=Languages like Chinese, technically, do not use an alphabet but have an ideographic writing system. There are thousands of symbols (pictographs) in Chinese representing different words, syllables and concepts. [..] The language with the most letters is Khmer (Cambodian), with 74 (including some without any current use). According to Guinness Book of World Records, 1995, the Khmer alphabet is the largest alphabet in the world. It consists of 33 consonants, 23 vowels and 12 independent vowels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of [[collation]], specifically by allowing words to be sorted in [[alphabetical order]]. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of "numbering" ordered items, in such contexts as [[numbered list]]s and number placements.

==Etymology==
The English word ''alphabet'' came into [[Middle English]] from the [[Late Latin]] word ''alphabetum'', which in turn originated in the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλφάβητος (''alphabētos'').  The Greek word was made from the first two letters, ''[[alpha (letter)|alpha]]''(α) and ''[[beta (letter)|beta]]''(β).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alphabet|title=alphabet|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The names for the Greek letters came from the first two letters of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]; ''[[aleph]]'', which also meant ''ox'', and ''[[bet (letter)|bet]]'', which also meant ''house''.

Sometimes, like in the [[alphabet song]] in English, the term "ABCs" is used instead of the word "alphabet" (''Now I know my ABCs''...).  "Knowing one's ABCs", in general, can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything.

===Ancient Northeast African and Middle Eastern scripts===
The history of the alphabet started in [[ancient Egypt]]. Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian uniliteral signs|24 hieroglyphs]] that are called uniliterals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2451890 |title=The Development of the Western Alphabet |accessdate=2008-08-04 |author =Lynn, Bernadette |date=2004-04-08 |work=h2g2 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|Bright|1996|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ba`alat.png|thumb|left|A specimen of [[Proto-Sinaitic script]], one of the earliest (if not the very first) phonemic scripts]]
In the [[Middle Bronze Age]], an apparently "alphabetic" system known as the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]] appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the [[Sinai peninsula]] dated to circa the 15th century BC, apparently left by Canaanite workers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at Wadi el-Hol dated to circa 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.

An alphabetic [[cuneiform]] script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in [[Ugarit]] before the 15th century BC. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.&lt;ref&gt;''Ugaritic Writing'' [http://www.mazzaroth.com/ChapterThree/UgariticWriting.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the [[Phoenician alphabet]], which is conventionally called "Proto-Canaanite" before ca. 1050 BC.&lt;ref name="Daniels 9296"/&gt; The oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of King [[Ahiram]]. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century, two other forms can be distinguished, namely [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]. The Aramaic gave rise to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coulmas|1989|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[South Arabian alphabet]], a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] (an [[abugida]]) is descended. Vowelless alphabets, which are not true alphabets, are called [[abjad]]s, currently exemplified in scripts including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. The omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some "weak" consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable ([[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]). These letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coulmas|1989|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Sinaitic or Proto-Canaanite script and the [[Ugaritic script]] were the first scripts with a limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, [[Cuneiform]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and [[Linear B]]. The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script&lt;ref name="Coulmas 140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniels 9296"/&gt; and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn. Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.
[[File:Acta Eruditorum - I alfabeti, 1743 – BEIC 13408919.jpg|thumb|Illustration from [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1741]]
The script was spread by the Phoenicians across the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Daniels 9296" /&gt; In Greece, the script was modified to add vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West. The vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants; therefore it was the first true alphabet. The Greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in Greek to represent vowels. Vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical [[Linear B]] script that was used by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols, including 5 vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.

===European alphabets===
[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Zographensis]] in the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] from Medieval [[Bulgaria]]]]
The [[Greek alphabet]], in its [[Euboean alphabet|Euboean form]], was carried over by Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the [[Italic languages]]. One of these became the [[Latin alphabet]], which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the [[Romance languages]]) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.

Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], such as [[æ]] in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Ou (letter)|Ȣ]] in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] þ in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which came from the [[Runic alphabet|Futhark]] runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the [[Eth (letter)|eth]] ð of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified ''d''. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and [[Italian language|Italian]], which uses the letters ''j, k, x, y'' and ''w'' only in foreign words.

Another notable script is [[Elder Futhark]], which is believed to have evolved out of one of the [[Old Italic alphabet]]s. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the [[Runic alphabet]]s. The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from AD 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood. These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.

The [[Old Hungarian script]] is a contemporary writing system of the Hungarians. It was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system. From the 19th century it once again became more and more popular.

The [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was the initial script of the liturgical language [[Old Church Slavonic]] and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the [[Cyrillic script]]. Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former [[Soviet Union]]. [[Cyrillic alphabets]] include the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]], [[Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian]], [[Bulgarian alphabet|Bulgarian]],  [[Russian alphabet|Russian]], [[Belarusian alphabet|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian alphabet|Ukrainian]]. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by [[Clement of Ohrid]], who was their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the [[Greek alphabet]] and the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

The longest European alphabet is the Latin-derived [[Slovak alphabet]] which has 46 letters.

===Asian alphabets===
Beyond the logographic [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia. The [[Arabic alphabet]], [[Hebrew alphabet]], [[Syriac alphabet]], and other [[abjad]]s of the Middle East are developments of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], but because these writing systems are largely [[consonant]]-based they are often not considered true alphabets.

Most alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the [[Brahmi script]], which is often believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.

[[File:Zhuyin on cell phone detail.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|[[Bopomofo|Zhuyin]] on a cell phone]]

In [[Korea]], the [[Hangul]] alphabet was created by [[Sejong the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;"上親制諺文二十八字…是謂訓民正音(His majesty created 28 characters himself... It is [[Hunminjeongeum]] (original name for [[Hangul]]))", 《세종실록 (The Annals of the Choson Dynasty : Sejong)》 25년 12월.&lt;/ref&gt; Hangul is a unique alphabet: it is a [[featural alphabet]], where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like the widened mouth, L to look like the tongue pulled in, etc.); its design was planned by the government of the day; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as [[Chinese characters]], to allow for mixed-script writing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kuiwon.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/on-hangul-supremacy-exclusivity-mixed-script-predates-the-japanese-colonial-period/|title=On Hangul Supremacy &amp; Exclusivity—Mixed Script Predates the Japanese Colonial Period|date=October 16, 2013|author=Kuiwon|website=kuiwon.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).

[[Zhuyin]] (sometimes called ''Bopomofo'') is a [[semi-syllabary]] used to phonetically transcribe [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. After the later establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and its adoption of [[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]], the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it is still widely used in [[Taiwan]] where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet the phonemes of [[syllable onset|syllable initials]] are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the [[syllable rime|syllable finals]] are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the [[Syllable medial|medial glide]]) is represented by its own symbol. For example, ''luan'' is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ (''l-u-an''), where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final ''-an''. While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a [[romanization]] system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cellphones.

European alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]] and [[Persian alphabet|Persian]]) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]] and [[Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur]]).

{{alphabet}}

The term "alphabet" is used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[paleographer]]s in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is ''segmental'' at the [[phoneme]] level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish "true" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with [[diacritic]]s to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters.&lt;ref&gt;For critics of the abjad-abugida-alphabet distinction, see Reinhard G. Lehmann: "27-30-22-26. How Many Letters Needs an Alphabet? The Case of Semitic", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52, esp p. 22-27&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Wadi el-Hol script]], believed to be an abjad, which through its successor [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]), [[Cyrillic]] (via the Greek alphabet) and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] (via [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]).

Examples of present-day abjads are the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s; true alphabets include [[Latin script|Latin]], Cyrillic, and Korean [[hangul]]; and abugidas are used to write [[tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Hindi]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]. The [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.)

All three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. [[Ugaritic script|Ugaritic]], for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ʔa, ʔi, ʔu/}}. (These are the only time vowels are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ja, je, ju/}} (я, е, ю); [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] has a letter for {{IPA|/ti/}}. [[Devanagari]] is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a [[zero consonant]] as the graphic base for such vowels.

The boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, [[Sorani]] [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is written in the [[Arabic script]], which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the [[Phagspa script]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] was based closely on the [[Tibetan script|Tibetan abugida]], but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short ''a'' was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Tigrinya abugida]] and the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Amharic abugida]] (ironically, the original source of the term "abugida") have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became [[logogram|logographic]]. (See below.)
[[File:Ethiopic genesis.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ge'ez Script]] of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]]]
Thus the primary [[Categorisation|classification]] of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in [[Somali language|Somali]] and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] (a true alphabet) and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the [[Pollard script]], an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for [[Hmong alphabet|Hmong]] and [[Zhuang alphabet|Zhuang]]. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in [[Zhuyin]] not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the [[virama]] of Indic.

The number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the [[Rotokas alphabet]] has only twelve letters. (The [[Hawaiian alphabet]] is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the [[ʻOkina|ʻokina]] and five long vowels.  However, [[Hawaiian Braille]] has only 13 letters.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been ''conflated''—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented ''g'', ''d'', ''y'', ''k'', or ''j''. However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi [[papyrus|papyri]], up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become [[logogram]]s as in Egyptian [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]].
[[File:Venn diagram showing Greek, Latin and Cyrillic letters.svg|left|thumb|263x263px|Circles containing the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets, which share many of the same [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], although they have different pronunciations]]
The largest segmental script is probably an abugida, [[Devanagari]]. When written in Devanagari, Vedic [[Sanskrit]] has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the ''visarga'' mark for final aspiration and special letters for ''kš'' and ''jñ,'' though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the ''khutma'' letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English. Thai has a total of 59 symbols, consisting of 44 consonants, 13 vowels and 2 syllabics, not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length.

The largest known abjad is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], with 51 letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] (for [[Cyrillic]]), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (for the [[Latin script]]), with 46. However, these scripts either count [[digraph (orthography)|di- and tri-graphs]] as separate letters, as Spanish did with ''ch'' and ''ll'' until recently, or uses [[diacritic]]s like Slovak ''č''.

The Georgian alphabet ({{lang-ka|ანბანი}} ''{{transl|ka|Anbani}}'') is alphabetical writing system. It is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent with 33 letters.{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear why having 33 (or 34? this one conflicts with the next sentence) graphically independent letters makes the Georgian alphabet the largest true one? For example, the Armenian alphabet has 39 graphically independent letters. See 'Armenian alphabet' and 'Georgian scripts' pages for more information.|date=August 2016}} Original Georgian alphabet had 38 letters but 5 letters were removed in 19th century by [[Ilia Chavchavadze]]. The Georgian alphabet is much closer to Greek than the other Caucasian alphabets. The numeric value runs parallel to the Greek one, the consonants without a Greek equivalent are organized at the end of the alphabet. Origins of the alphabet are still unknown, some Armenian and Western scholars believe it was created by Mesrop Mashtots (Armenian: Մեսրոպ Մաշտոց Mesrop Maštoc') also known as Mesrob the Vartabed, who was an early medieval Armenian linguist, theologian, statesman and hymnologist, best known for inventing the Armenian alphabet c. 405 AD,&lt;ref name="Donald Rayfield"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VstdAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=unlikely%20pre-Christian&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-Christian&amp;f=false |first=Donald |last=Rayfield |authorlink=Donald Rayfield |title=The Literature of Georgia: A History |series=Caucasus World |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-700-71163-5 |page=19 |quote=The Georgian alphabet seems unlikely to have a pre-Christian origin, for the major archaeological monument of the first century first century AD, the bilingual Armazi gravestone commemorating Serafita, daughter of the Georgian viceroy of Mtskheta, is inscribed in Greek and Aramaic only.

Syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs, and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.

The Armenian alphabet ({{lang-hy|Հայոց գրեր}} ''{{transl|hy|Hayots grer}}'' or {{lang|hy|Հայոց այբուբեն}} ''{{transl|hy|Hayots aybuben}}'') is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the Armenian language. It was introduced by Mesrob Mashdots around 405&amp;nbsp;AD, an Armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader, and originally contained 36 letters. Two more letters, օ (o) and ֆ (f), were added in the Middle Ages. During the 1920s orthography reform, a new letter և (capital ԵՎ) was added, which was a ligature before ե+ւ, while the letter Ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ՈՒ ու (which was a digraph before).

==Alphabetical order==

The Case of Semitic", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52&lt;/ref&gt; is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the [[French language|French]] ''é'', ''à'', and ''ô'') and of certain combinations of letters ([[Multigraph (orthography)|multigraphs]]). In French, these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation. However, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the accented letters such as ''á'', ''í'', and ''ö'' are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts. In Spanish, ''ñ'' is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as ''á'' and ''é'' are not. The ''ll'' and ''ch'' were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the [[Real Academia Española]] changed the collating order so that ''ll'' is between ''lk'' and ''lm'' in the dictionary and ''ch'' is between ''cg'' and ''ci'', and in 2010 the tenth congress of the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]] changed it so they were no longer letters at all.&lt;ref&gt;Real Academia Española. "Spanish Pronto!: Spanish Alphabet." Spanish Pronto! 22 April 2007. January 2009 [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html#english Spanish Pronto: Spanish ↔ English Medical Translators.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La 'i griega' se llamará 'ye'". Cuba Debate. 2010-11-05. Retrieved 12 December 2010. [http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2010/11/05/la-i-griega-se-llamara-ye-y-la-ch-y-la-ll-desaparecen-por-decreto-de-la-academia-espanola/ Cubadebate.cu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, words starting with ''sch-'' (which spells the German phoneme {{IPAslink|ʃ}}) are inserted between words with initial ''sca-'' and ''sci-'' (all incidentally loanwords) instead of appearing after initial ''sz'', as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as [[Albanian alphabet|Albanian]], in which ''dh-'', ''ë-'', ''gj-'', ''ll-'', ''rr-'', ''th-'', ''xh-'' and ''zh-'' (all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters) would follow the letters ''d'', ''e'', ''g'', ''l'', ''n'', ''r'', ''t'', ''x'' and ''z'' respectively, as well as Hungarian and Welsh. Further, German words with [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] are collated ignoring the umlaut—contrary to [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] that adopted the [[grapheme]]s '''ö''' and '''ü''', and where a word like ''tüfek'', would come after ''tuz'', in the dictionary. An exception is the German telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like ''ä'' = ''ae'' since names as ''Jäger'' appear also with the spelling ''Jaeger'', and are not distinguished in the spoken language.

The [[Danish orthography|Danish]] and [[Norwegian orthography|Norwegian]] alphabets end with ''æ''—''ø''—''å'', whereas the Swedish and [[Finnish orthography|Finnish]] ones conventionally put ''å''—''ä''—''ö'' at the end.

It is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence. Some alphabets today, such as the [[Hanuno'o script]], are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for [[collation]] where a definite order is required. However, a dozen [[Ugaritic alphabet|Ugaritic]] tablets from the fourteenth century BC preserve the alphabet in two sequences. One, the ''ABCDE'' order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]], [[Cyrillic]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]; the other, ''HMĦLQ,'' was used in southern Arabia and is preserved today in [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.

[[Runic alphabet|Runic]] used an unrelated [[Elder Futhark|Futhark]] sequence, which was later [[Younger Futhark|simplified]]. [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] uses its own sequence, although Arabic retains the traditional [[abjadi order]] for numbering.

The [[Brahmic family]] of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on [[phonology]]: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth. This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean [[hangul]], and even Japanese [[kana]], which is not an alphabet.

==Names of letters==
The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound ([[acrophony]]), continue to be used to varying degrees in [[Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]].

The names were abandoned in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were [[Y]] and [[Z]], which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as ''Y Graeca'' "Greek Y" (pronounced ''I Graeca'' "Greek I") and ''zeta'' (from Greek)—this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term ''zed'' for Z in all forms of English other than American English. Over time names sometimes shifted or were added, as in ''double U'' for [[W]] ("double V" in French), the English name for Y, and American ''zee'' for Z. Comparing names in English and French gives a clear reflection of the [[Great Vowel Shift]]: A, B, C and D are pronounced /eɪ, biː, siː, diː/ in today's English, but in contemporary French they are /a, be, se, de/. The French names (from which the English names are derived) preserve the qualities of the English vowels from before the Great Vowel Shift. By contrast, the names of F, L, M, N and S (/ɛf, ɛl, ɛm, ɛn, ɛs/) remain the same in both languages, because "short" vowels were largely unaffected by the Shift.

In Cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on Slavic words; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in Latin.

==Orthography and pronunciation==
{{main article|Phonemic orthography}}
When an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language, an [[orthography]] generally comes into being, providing rules for the [[spelling]] of words in that language. In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the [[phoneme]]s (significant sounds) of the spoken language. In a perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling, and vice versa. However this ideal is not usually achieved in practice; some languages (such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.

The pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

Languages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:
* A language may represent a given phoneme by a combination of letters rather than just a single letter. Two-letter combinations are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]]. [[German language|German]] uses the [[tetragraph]]s (four letters) "tsch" for the phoneme {{IPA-de|tʃ|}} and (in a few borrowed words) "dsch" for {{IPA|[dʒ]}}. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] also uses a tetragraph for one of its phonemes, namely "кхъу". Two letters representing one sound occur in several instances in Hungarian as well (where, for instance, ''cs'' stands for [tʃ], ''sz'' for [s], ''zs'' for [ʒ], ''dzs'' for [dʒ]).
* A language may represent the same phoneme with two or more different letters or combinations of letters. An example is [[modern Greek]] which may write the phoneme {{IPA-el|i|}} in six different ways: {{angbr|ι}}, {{angbr|η}}, {{angbr|υ}}, {{angbr|ει}}, {{angbr|οι}}, and {{angbr|υι}} (though the last is rare).
* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons. For example, the spelling of the Thai word for "beer" [เบียร์] retains a letter for the final consonant "r" present in the English word it was borrowed from, but silences it.
* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence ([[sandhi]]).
* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.
* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items, such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.

National languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard. Some national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes. Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb "to spell" (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables. Similarly, the [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because spelling is usually trivial, as Italian spelling is highly phonemic. In standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]], one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa, as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.

At the other extreme are languages such as English, where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way. For English, this is partly because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels. Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.

Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a [[spelling reform]] to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when [[Turkey]] switched from the Arabic alphabet to a Latin-based [[Turkish alphabet]].

The standard system of symbols used by [[linguist]]s to represent sounds in any language, independently of orthography, is called the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

[[Image:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|A [[sagittal]] or side view image of a human head. The upper alveolar ridge is located between numbers 4 and 5.]]

The '''alveolar ridge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|v|i|ˈ|oʊ|l|ər|,_|æ|l|ˈ|v|iː|ə|l|ər|,_|ˈ|æ|l|v|i|ə|l|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''alveolar margin''') is one of the two [[jaw]] ridges, extensions of the [[mandible]] or [[maxilla]], either on the roof of the mouth between the upper teeth and the [[hard palate]] or on the bottom of the mouth behind the lower teeth. Most of the roof of one's mouth is the hard palate and the [[soft palate]]. The alveolar ridges contain the sockets ([[Dental alveolus|alveoli]], singular "alveolus") of the teeth. They can be felt with the [[tongue]] in the area right above the top teeth or below the bottom teeth. Its surface is covered with little ridges.

{{Quote|The [upper] alveolar ridge is a small protuberance just behind the upper front teeth that can easily be felt with the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|457255|Phonetics}} Accessed: 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consonants whose constriction is made with the [[tongue tip]] or [[tongue blade|blade]] touching or reaching for the alveolar ridge are called [[alveolar consonants]]. Examples of alveolar consonants in English are, for instance, {{IPAblink|t}}, {{IPAblink|d}}, {{IPAblink|s}}, {{IPAblink|z}}, {{IPAblink|n}}, {{IPAblink|l}} like in the words ''tight, dawn, silly, zoo, nasty'' and ''lurid''. There are exceptions to this however, such as speakers of the [[New York accent]] who pronounce [t] and [d] at the back of their top teeth ([[dental stop]]s). When pronouncing these sounds the tongue touches ([t], [d], [n]), or nearly touches ([s], [z]) the upper alveolar ridge, which can also be referred to as '''gum ridge'''. In many other languages, consonants transcribed with these letters are articulated slightly differently, and are often described as [[dental consonant]]s. In many languages [[consonant]]s are articulated with the tongue touching or close to the upper alveolar ridge. The former are called alveolar [[plosive consonant|plosive]]s (such as {{IPAblink|t}} and {{IPAblink|d}}), and the latter alveolar [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s (such as {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|ʃ}}).

'''Brazzaville''' ({{IPA-fr|bʁazavil}}, {{lang-kg|Balazavile}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of the [[Republic of the Congo]] and is on the north side of the [[Congo River]], opposite [[Kinshasa]]. Its population is estimated to exceed 1.8 million. Over a third of the population of the Republic of Congo lives in the capital, and it is home to 40% of non-agricultural employment. It is also a financial and administrative capital. Between 1940 and 1942 in [[World War II]], Brazzaville was also the capital of [[Free France]].

Brazzaville has been designated "City of Music" in 2013 by [[UNESCO]] and has become a member of the [[Creative Cities Network]] since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/10/453392-brazzaville-zahle-krakow-and-fabriano-designated-unesco-creative-cities|title=Brazzaville, Zahlé, Kraków and Fabriano designated UNESCO Creative Cities|date=2013-10-21|work=UN News|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Kindepuisbrazza.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kinshasa]] seen from Brazzaville. The two capitals are separated by the [[Congo River]].]]
[[File:brazzaville, Republic of the Congo.jpg|thumb|View of Brazzaville from space]]
Brazzaville lies on a large area to the north of the [[Congo River]], near the [[Pool Malebo]]. [[Mbamu]], a large island within the Pool, is part of the Republic of Congo's territory.

Brazzaville is {{convert|506|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} inland from the Atlantic Ocean and approximately {{convert|474|km|mi|abbr=off}} south of the [[equator]]. The city is a commune that is separated from the other [[regions of the Republic of the Congo|regions]] of the republic; it is surrounded by the Pool Department. Around the city are large plains. The town is relatively flat, and situated at an altitude of {{convert|317|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}.

To distinguish between the two African countries with "Congo" in their names, the Republic of the Congo is sometimes called Congo-Brazzaville, as opposed to Congo-Kinshasa (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, known from 1971 to 1997 as [[Zaïre]], the capital of which is [[Kinshasa]]). Kinshasa lies on the southern bank of the Congo, directly across from Brazzaville. This is the only place in the world where two national [[capital city|capital cities]] are on opposite banks of a river, within sight of each other.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/17/congo-rivalry-kinshasa-brazzaville-river-drc |title=Face-off over the Congo: the long rivalry between Kinshasa and Brazzaville |access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-19th century the two cities have been rivals in trade, sports and power.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; There have been proposals to connect the two capitals by a [[Brazzaville–Kinshasa Bridge]]. Studies reveal the anticipated cost is around 1.65 billion USD, but it is not expected that the project will be undertaken in the near or even distant future.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt;

Brazzaville was founded by the [[French colonial empire]] upon an existing indigenous [[Bateke]] settlement called Ncuna, as part of the [[Scramble for Africa]].&lt;ref name=Scramble1&gt;{{cite book |last=Pakenham|first=Thomas|date=1991 |title=The Scramble for Africa|publisher=Abacus|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian-born explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]], granted French citizenship in 1874, officially founded the settlement which commemorates his name on 10 September 1880.&lt;ref name=Scramble1/&gt; The local [[King]], [[Makoko of the Téké]], signed a treaty of protection with de Brazza which subjugated his lands to the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]].&lt;ref name=Scramble1/&gt; From October 1880 until May 1882 a small squad of troops led by Senegalese Sergeant [[Malamine Camara]] occupied the site, preventing the land from falling into Belgian hands. The first large scale building work of the city only began four years later in order as a competitor with [[Léopoldville]] (now [[Kinshasa]]) which Belgian colonists built on the other side of the river.&lt;ref name=Scramble1/&gt;

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884 placed French control over the area on an official footing. The city became the capital of the [[French Congo]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=Encyc1&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas|first=Dominic|date=2005 |title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century African History|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then continued as capital with the creation of [[French Equatorial Africa]], a federation founded in 1910, of French colonial states which encompassed [[Gabon]], the [[Central African Republic]] and [[Chad]] until 1960.&lt;ref name=Encyc1/&gt; 1910–1915 saw the construction of major municipal buildings, including a courthouse and headquarters for the Banque de l'AEF and Institut Pasteur.&lt;ref name=YoulouDianzinga2006&gt;Jean-Jacques Youlou &amp; Scholastique Dianzinga, "Une capitale dans l'histoire"; Chapter 1 in Ziavoula (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 the [[Congo-Océan railway]] came into service, linking Brazzaville with the Atlantic port of [[Pointe-Noire]].  Construction of the railway resulted in the death of over 17,000 Africans, which led to a revolt in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14121195|title=Republic of Congo profile|date=11 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosobrazza.png|thumb|left|[[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] Mausoleum]]

During World War II Brazzaville and the rest of [[French Equatorial Africa]] remained beyond the control of [[Vichy France]]; the city served as the capital of ''[[Free France|France Libre]]'' from 1940–1943.&lt;ref name=YoulouDianzinga2006 /&gt; In 1944, Brazzaville hosted a meeting of the [[French resistance]] forces and representatives of France's African colonies. The resulting [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944|Brazzaville Declaration]] represented an attempt to redefine the relationship between France and its African colonies.&lt;ref name=Encyc1/&gt;

Until the 1960s, the city was divided into European (the center of the city) and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] sections ([[Poto-Poto]], Bacongo, and Makélékélé). In 1980 it became a "[[Communes of France|commune]]" separated from the surrounding [[Pool Department]] and divided into nine "arrondissements'' (boroughs).

The city has frequently been a staging ground for wars, including conflicts between rebel and government forces and between forces of the Republic of Congo, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DCR), and [[Angola]]. It was also the scene of bloody civil wars throughout the 1990s which resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and which forced hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee the city. More recently thousands of people leaving the DRC have found their way to Brazzaville; the [[MONUSCO|local United Nations force]] and the DRC government have accused the city of deporting thousands of these refugees.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/deportation-comments-anger-congo-1695433 Deportation comments anger Congo]", ''Independent Online'' (SAPA-AFP), 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Butty, "[https://www.voanews.com/a/drc-threatens-legal-action-over-brazzaville-deportations/1923224.html DRC Threatens Legal Action over Deportations from Congo-Brazzaville]", ''VOA News'', 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 fighting occurred between police and local militia units, with at least 18 people killed.&lt;ref name=Guardian2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/heavy-gunfire-in-congo-brazzaville-capital-as-police-battle-militia |title=Heavy gunfire in Congo-Brazzaville capital as police battle militia|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
[[File:Bacongo, Brazza.jpg|thumb|Housing in the Bacongo ''arrondisement''.]]
As of the 2007 census, it had a population of 1.37 million. The projection of the CNSEE (national statistics centre) shows an increase to 1.7 million by 2015,&lt;ref name=population /&gt; but the projection was made before 2007 and based on a lower estimate of the population (1.26 million) than recorded in the census. The United Nations Population Division estimate for 2014 is 1.83 million. The populous city of [[Kinshasa]] (more than 10 million inhabitants in 2014),&lt;ref name=Kinshasa /&gt; capital of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], lies across the Congo River from Brazzaville. Together with Kinshasa, the combined [[conurbation]] of Kinshasa-Brazzaville would thus have about 12 million inhabitants, although significant political and infrastructure challenges prevent the two cities from functioning with any meaningful connection.

== Government ==
{{see also|List of mayors of Brazzaville}}
Brazzaville, like Pointe-Noire, has both the status of a [[Communes of the Republic of the Congo|commune]] (municipality) and a [[Departments of the Republic of the Congo|department]]. It is thus governed by a municipal council and a departmental council. The mayor is the president of the municipal council.&lt;ref&gt;Brazzaville.cg (site officiel de la commune de Brazzaville), "[http://www.brazzaville.cg/fr/l%E2%80%99administration-municipale L'administration municipale]"; accessed 16 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is divided into nine ''[[arrondissement]]s'' (boroughs):&lt;ref name=arrond&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brazzaville.cg/fr/les-arrondissements |accessdate= 12 September 2017 |title=Les arrondissements |work=Brazzaville.cg |language=fr |publisher=Commune de Brazzaville, Congo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Nabemba.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nabemba Tower]]
The location of Brazzaville near the pool of the Congo River enabled it to grow as an industrial, trading and port settlement, in part due to the accumulation of raw materials extracted during the colonial period.&lt;ref name=Encyc1/&gt; Industries present in Brazzaville include [[machining|machine shops]], [[textile]]s, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], and [[manufacturing]]. As a key port on the [[Congo River]], the city takes deliveries of [[raw material]]s, such as [[natural rubber|rubber]], [[wood]] and [[agriculture|agricultural product]]s. From here they are generally sent onward to [[Pointe-Noire]] for export.

As the capital city of the [[Republic of Congo]], many companies, government organizations and [[NGO]]s have regional offices in the city. The [[World Health Organization]] has its regional office for Africa located in Brazzaville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/regions/afro/en/index.html|title=Regional Office for Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies headquartered in Brazzaville include [[Equatorial Congo Airlines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Airline/ECAir|title=ECAir Fleet Details and History|website=www.planespotters.net|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mobile operator [[Warid Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=79599058|title=Company Overview of Warid Congo S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and institutions==
[[File:Cathédrale de Brazzaville avant 1926.jpg|thumb|right|The Sacred Heart Cathedral in 1926]]
Notable buildings in the city include the [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Brazzaville|Sacred Heart Cathedral]], [[St Anne's Basilica (Brazzaville)|St Anne's Basilica]] built in 1949 by [[Roger Erell]], and known for its green [[tile]]d roof; Erell also designed a house in the city for [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Other buildings include the Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza Mausoleum, the [[Nabemba Tower]] and the [[Congressional Palace (Brazzaville)|Congressional Palace]]. Other features include the [[Marien Ngouabi Mausoleum]], [[Brazzaville Zoo]] and the Poto-Poto School of Painting. The [[United States Embassy for the Republic of the Congo]] is also in Brazzaville, as is the Dutch Honorary Consulate.

The [[World Health Organization]] Regional Office for Africa is based in Brazzaville on a vast campus at the Cité du Djoué.

== Education==
The [[Marien Ngouabi University]] is a public [[university]] in Brazzaville.&lt;ref name=University&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umng.cg/?q=en/node/79 |title=Quick Facts|access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was founded in December, 1971 and has approximately 26,000 students.&lt;ref name=University/&gt;

International schools:
* [[Lycée Français Saint-Exupéry de Brazzaville]] (French)
* [[American International School of Brazzaville]]

==Climate==
Brazzaville, much like neighboring [[Kinshasa]], features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]]. Its wet season, which runs from October–May, is longer than its dry season, which covers the remaining months. Brazzaville's driest months, July and August, see on average no significant precipitation. Since Brazzaville is south of the equator, its dry season begins at around its "winter" solstice, which is the month of June. The city experiences relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year. Recently, in March 2018, Brazzaville declaration was signed to promote better management and communications conservation of Cuvette central region in Congo basin. The declaration was signed by Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Indonesia to save peatlands as world's largest terrestrial organic carbon stock.

==Transport==
[[File:Taxibrazza.png|thumb|right|200px|Taxis in Brazzaville]]
The city is home to [[Maya-Maya Airport]], which lies in the centre of the city and which has regular flights to [[Pointe-Noire]] as well as international destinations in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. A flight operates twice weekly between Brazzaville and Kinshasa, but the flight time is only five minutes.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt;

The [[Congo-Ocean Railway]] has a station in the city and in 2014 was operating the [[La Gazelle train|''La Gazelle'']] train service every other day to [[Pointe-Noire]] and intermediate destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/africa/congo/la-gazelle-train-brazzaville-to-pointe-noire|title=La Gazelle train Brazzaville to Pointe Noire|first=Lonely|last=Planet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is an important [[river port]], with [[ferry|ferries]] sailing to [[Kinshasa]] and to [[Bangui]] via [[Impfondo]].&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; Ferries and fast private boats serve as the primary means of connection between Kinshasa and Brazzaville.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; The [[Livingstone Falls]] lie on the outskirts of the city, where the [[Djoué River]] meets the Congo, rendering river transport to the coast impossible, qualifying the railway as a [[portage railway]].

Although there is no organised public transport system, privately owned buses are available in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/congo/brazzaville/transport/getting-around |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125191943/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/congo/brazzaville/transport/getting-around |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxis are available on every street and are easily recognized, being painted with a green body and white top, and the fare for a short trip is CF700.  About twenty percent of the vehicles in Brazzaville are taxis.  There are also collective taxis that drive certain routes and charge CF150.

== Homes to sculpture ==
Bridges are often used as locations for sculptures. Especially popular are animals such as lions, perhaps serving as guardians. Examples are the 485 carved stone lions of the [[Marco Polo Bridge]] in [[China]], which was first constructed in 1192, and the four [[Centre Street Bridge (Calgary)|Centre Street Bridge]] lions of [[Calgary]], which date to 1917.

Another well-known example of a bridge hosting statues is the [[Charles Bridge]] in [[Prague]], which is home to 30 statues and statuaries, mostly baroque, dating to around 1700.

A '''brocard''' is a [[legal maxim]] in [[Latin]] that is, in a strict sense, derived from traditional legal authorities, even from [[ancient Rome]]. The word is a variant of the [[Latinized name]] of [[Burchard of Worms]] (died AD 1025), Bishop of [[Worms, Germany]], who compiled 20 volumes of ''Ecclesiastical Rules''.

==History==
Begun in AD 1008, the materials took Burchard four years to compile. He wrote it while living in a small structure on top of a hill in the forest outside Worms, after his defeat of Duke Otto and while raising his adopted child. The collection, which he called the ''Collectarium Canonum'' or ''Decretum'', became the primary source for [[canon law]].

Along with numerous documents from a variety of sources, including the [[Old Testament]] and [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]], Burchard included the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'' in this collection, under the belief that it dated from an episcopal "Council of Anquira" in AD 314, but no other evidence of this council exists. Because of this inclusion, Burchard has been described as something of a rationalist. As the source of [[canon law]], Burchard's ''Decretum'' was supplanted around 1150 by the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', a much larger collection that further attempted to reconcile contradictory elements of [[canon law]].

Burchard spent the years 1023 to 1025 promulgating ''Leges et Statuta Familiae S. Petri Wormatiensis'', a collection of religious laws he endorsed as just and hoped to have officially approbated.

Although the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] first came to [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[Julius Caesar#Conquest of Gaul|55 BC]], [[Roman Law]] has had negligible influence&lt;ref&gt;http://pdfsr.com/pdf/influences-of-roman-law-and-civil-law-on-the-common-law&lt;/ref&gt; on [[English common law]]. Latin legal phrases are used in English only because Latin was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Medieval era]]. Although some of these phrases are in common use in law, such as ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'', ''[[novus actus interveniens]]'', ''[[talem qualem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195557558.001.0001/acref-9780195557558-e-3249?rskey=0DnFO4&amp;result=3248&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[de minimis non curat lex]]'', and  ''[[consensus ad idem]]'', the common law is not premised on the principles of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and their use is being replaced by that of vernacular substitutes. For example, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' previously included numerous brocards among its entries.

==Examples==
;''Contra non valentem agere nulla'' [or ''non''] ''currit praescriptio'' : A [[statute of limitation]] does not run against those who cannot act; this is the basis of the American discovery rule limiting prescriptive limitation periods.
;''[[Dura lex, sed lex]]'' : "The [[law]] [is] harsh, but [it is] the law". It follows from the principle of the [[rule of law]] that even [[Draco (lawgiver)|draconian]] laws must be followed and enforced; if one disagrees with the result, one must seek to change the law.
;''[[Ignorantia juris non excusat|Ignorantia legis non excusat]]'' : "Ignorance of the law is no excuse."  Not knowing that one's actions are forbidden by the law is not a defense.
;''In claris non fit interpretatio'' : When a rule is clearly intelligible, there is no need of proposing a (usually extensive) interpretation.
;''Inadimplenti non est adimplendum'' : "One has no need to respect his obligation if the counter-party has not respected his own." This is used in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] to briefly indicate a principle (adopted in some systems) referred to as the [[synallagmatic contract]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jusbelli.com/Bouvier/bouvier1856_sw.html&lt;/ref&gt;
; ''[[Lex specialis derogat legi generali]]'' : "A law governing a specific subject matter overrides a law which only governs general matters." 
; ''[[Iura novit curia]]'' : The judge knows the law (technically, there is no need to "explain the law" or the legal system to a judge/justice in any given petition).
; ''[[Nemo dat quod non habet]]'':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100228794&lt;/ref&gt; The basic rule that a person who does not own property (e.g. a thief) cannot confer it on another except with the true owner's authority (i.e. as his agent). Exceptions to this rule include sales under statutory powers, and cases where the doctrine of [[estoppel]] prevents a legal owner from denying a seller's right to sell.
; ''[[Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]'' : There can be neither [[crime]] nor [[punishment]] unless there is a [[penal law]] first.
;''[[Pacta sunt servanda]]'' : Contracts are the law ''or'' Contracts establish obligations (between those who sign them).
; ''Quod non est in registro, non est in Mundo'' : What is not reported in the (related, referring) registry, has no legal relevance. Used when a formal act (usually a recording or a transcription) is required in order to give consistence, content or efficacy to a [[right]].
; ''Res inter alios acta vel iudicata, aliis nec nocet nec prodocet'' : What has been agreed/decided between people (a specific group) can neither benefit nor harm a third party (meaning: two or more people cannot agree amongst each other to establish an obligation for a third party who was not involved in the negotiation; furthermore, any benefit that may be established will have to be accepted by the third party before it can be implemented).
; ''Sententia quae in rem iudicatam transit, pro veritate habetur'' : When a definitive [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] is declared, it is considered to be the truth. In the case of a sentence ''in rem iudicatam'' (that finally consents to consider a judgement completed), its content will then be the only legally relevant consideration of a fact.
; ''Solve et repete'' : Respect your obligation first, then you can ask for reimbursement. Used in those situations in which one of the two (or more) parties needs to complete his obligation before being allowed to ask for the opposite obligation to be respected by his counter party. Usually this principle is used in fields and subjects in which a certain general steadiness or uniformity of the system has been considered a relevant value by the legislator. The case is typical of service contracts with repeated obligations (like with gas, water, electricity providers and similars), in which irregularities on one side cannot be balanced if not in a regular situation (i.e., of payments) on the other side. The customer, for example, might be asked to pay regularly the new bill, before contesting the previous one in which he found irregular calculations, and asking for a balancement with newer bills; he thus cannot by himself determine a discount in the next payment.
; ''Ubi lex voluit, dixit; ubi noluit, tacuit'' : When the law wanted to regulate the matter in further detail, it did regulate the matter; when it did not want to regulate the matter in further detail, it remained silent (in the interpretation of a law, an excessively expansive interpretation might perhaps go beyond the intention of the [[legislator]], thus we must adhere to what is in the text of the law and draw no material consequences from the law's silence).

The Books of '''Chilam Balam''' ({{IPA-myn|t͡ʃilam ɓahlam}}) are handwritten, chiefly 17th and 18th-centuries [[Maya civilization | Maya]] [[miscellanies]], named after the small [[Yucatec]] towns where they were originally kept, and preserving important traditional knowledge in which indigenous Maya and early Spanish traditions have coalesced. Written in the [[Yucatec Maya language]] and using the Latin alphabet, the manuscripts are attributed to a legendary author called Chilam Balam, a ''chilam'' being a priest who gives prophecies and ''balam'' a common surname meaning '[[Jaguar]]'. Some of the texts actually contain prophecies about the coming of the Spaniards to Yucatán while mentioning a ''chilam'' Balam as their first author.&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1967: 3, 186-187&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Nine Books of Chilam Balam are known,&lt;ref&gt;Paxton 2001:193-194&lt;/ref&gt; most importantly those from Chumayel, [[Maní, Yucatán|Mani]], and [[Tizimin]],&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1967:6&lt;/ref&gt; but more have existed. Both language and content show that parts of the books date back to the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatan|Spanish conquest of the Yucatec kingdoms]] (1527–1546). In some cases, where the language is particularly terse, the books appear to render hieroglyphic script, and thus to hark back to the pre-conquest period.

==Contents==
Taken together, the Books of Chilam Balam give the fullness of 18th-century Yucatec-Maya spiritual life. Whereas the medical texts and chronicles are quite matter-of-fact, the riddles and prognostications make abundant use of traditional Mayan metaphors. This holds even more true of the mythological and ritualistic texts, which, cast in abstruse language, plainly belong to [[esoteric]] lore. The historical texts derive part of their importance from the fact that they have been cast in the framework of the native [[Maya calendar]], partly adapted to the European calendrical system. Reconstructing [[Postclassic period|Postclassic Yucatec history]] from these data has proven to be an arduous task. The following is an overview of the sorts of texts—partly of Mesoamerican, and partly of Spanish derivation—found in the Chilam Balam books.

1. '''History''' 
*''Histories'', cast in the mold of the indigenous calendar: migration legends; narratives concerning certain lords of the indigenous kingdoms; and chronicles up to and including the Spanish conquest.
*''Prognostication'', cast in the framework of the succession of ''[[haab]]''s (years), ''[[Tun (Maya calendar)|tun]]''s (360-day periods) and ''[[k'atun]]''s (20X360-day periods).
*''Prophecy'', ascribed to famous early 16th-century oracular priests.

2. '''Formularies with Metaphors''' 
*''Collections of riddles'', used for the confirmation of local lords into their offices (the so-called ‘language of Zuyua’).

3. '''Myth and Mysticism'''
*''Myth'', particularly the destruction and re-creation of the world as connected to the start of [[k'atun]] 11 Ahau.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlton 2010:53-85&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ritualistic mysticism'', particularly concerning the creation of the twenty named days (''[[uinal]]''); the ritual of the ‘Four Burners’ (''ahtoc''); and the birth of the maize, or ‘divine grace’ (the so-called 'Ritual of the Angels').&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1967:107-113&lt;/ref&gt;

4. '''Practical Calendars and Classifications''' 
*''Classifications according to the twenty named days'' (correlating birds of tiding, plants and trees, human characters, and professional activities).
*''Treatises on astrology, meteorology, and the Catholic liturgical calendar'' (the so-called ''reportorios de los tiempos''). The astrology is Ptolemaic and includes the European zodiac.
*''Agricultural [[almanac]]s''.

5. '''Medical Recipes'''
*''Herbal medicine'': The Chilam Balam books contain the sort of medical prescriptions that derive from Greek and Arab traditions, rather than the Mayan ‘incantation approach’, as represented by the [[Ritual of the Bacabs]].&lt;ref&gt;Paxton 2001: 191&lt;/ref&gt;

6. '''Spanish Traditions'''
*''Roman Catholic instruction'': feast days of the saints, tracts, and prayers.
*''Spanish [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]'', such as the tale of the ‘Maiden Theodora’.

==Scholarship==
Since many texts recur in various books of Chilam Balam, establishing a [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] and studying substitution patterns is fundamental to scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Miram and Miram 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The archaic Yucatec idiom and the allusive, metaphorical nature of many texts present a formidable challenge to translators. The outcome of the translation process is sometimes heavily influenced by external assumptions about the texts' purpose. As a result of these factors, the quality of existing translations varies greatly.

The Spanish-language synoptic translation of Barrera Vásquez and Rendón (1948) is still useful. To date (2012), complete English translations are available for the following Books of Chilam Balam: 
*Chumayel (authoritative edition: Roys 1933 [1967]; compare with Edmonson 1986)
*Mani (embedded in the Pérez Codex: Craine and Reindorp 1979, an adaptation of the 1949 Mexican translation of Solís Alcalá)
*Tizimin (Edmonson 1982)
*Na (Gubler and Bolles 2000)
*Kaua (Bricker and Miram 2002)
An excellent overview and discussion of the [[syncretism]] involved is to be found in the introduction to the Bricker and Miram edition of the Book of Chilam Balam of Kaua.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker and Miram 2002:1-88&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed analysis and interpretation of the main mythological and ritualistic texts with a view to their syncretic origins is given by Knowlton (2010).

== In popular culture ==
The Books of Chilam Balam are referenced in ''[[The Falling Woman]]'' by Pat Murphy as source material for the description of sacrifices at Chichén Itzá.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
A '''constitutional convention''' is an informal and uncodified procedural agreement that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those [[Commonwealth of Nations]] states that follow the [[Westminster system]] and whose political systems derive from [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional law]], most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.
In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the [[head of state]] that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the [[head of government]].

Some constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. Others, notably the United Kingdom which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).

==Definitions==
The term was first used by British legal scholar [[A. V. Dicey]] in his 1883 book, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''. Dicey wrote that in Britain, the actions of political actors and institutions are governed by two parallel and complementary sets of rules:

{{cquote|The one set of rules are in the strictest sense "laws", since they are rules which (whether written or unwritten, whether enacted by statute or derived from the mass of custom, tradition, or judge-made maxims {{sic|?|know}} as the common law) are enforced by the courts....

The other set of rules consist of conventions, understandings, habits, or practices that&amp;mdash;though they may regulate the conduct of the several members of the sovereign power, the Ministry, or other officials&amp;mdash;are not really laws, since they are not enforced by the courts. This portion of constitutional law may, for the sake of distinction, be termed the "conventions of the constitution", or constitutional morality.&lt;ref&gt;AV Dicey, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', 10th edition, pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A century later, Canadian scholar [[Peter Hogg]] wrote,

{{cquote|Conventions are rules of the constitution which are not enforced by the law courts. Because they are not enforced by the law courts they are best regarded as non-legal rules, but because they do in fact regulate the working of the constitution they are an important concern of the constitutional lawyer. What conventions do is to prescribe the way in which legal powers shall be exercised. Some conventions have the effect of transferring effective power from the legal holder to another official or institution. Other conventions limit an apparently broad power, or even prescribe that a legal power shall not be exercised at all.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==

Constitutional conventions arise when the exercise of a certain type of power, which is not prohibited by law, arouses such opposition that it becomes impossible, on future occasions, to engage in further exercises of this power. For example, the constitutional convention that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] cannot remain in office without the support of a majority of votes the House of Commons is derived from an unsuccessful attempt by the ministry of [[Robert Peel]] to govern without the support of a majority in the House, in [[First Peel ministry|1834&amp;ndash;1835]].

==Enforceability in the courts==

Constitutional conventions are not, and cannot be, enforced by courts of law. The primary reason for this, according to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in its 1981 [[Patriation Reference]], is that, "They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts may be bound to enforce the legal rules."&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, ''Attorney General of Manitoba et al. v. Attorney General of Canada et al.'' (September 28, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the conventions make certain acts, which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law, impermissible in practice. The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention, no matter how well-established or universally accepted, can "crystallize" into law, unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying for a convention at which must specify request and consensus' for enactment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1982/4.html&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK.

Some conventions evolve or change over time. For example, before 1918 the British [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] requested a parliamentary dissolution from the monarch, with the Prime Minister conveying the request. Since 1918, Prime Ministers request dissolutions on their own initiative, and need not consult members of the Cabinet (although, at the very least, it would be unusual for the Cabinet not to be aware of the Prime Minister's intention).

However, conventions are rarely ever broken. Unless there is general agreement on the breach, the person who breaches a convention is often heavily criticised, on occasions leading to a loss of respect or popular support. It is often said {{By whom|date=May 2016}} that "conventions are not worth the paper they are written on", i.e., they are unenforceable in law because they are not written down.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Examples==

===Australia===
* Whoever can command a majority in the House of Representatives is entitled to be asked by the Governor-General to form a government, and take the title Prime Minister.
* Governors-General always act on the advice of their Prime Minister or other relevant minister in regard to particular powers they may exercise.
* An incumbent Prime Minister who loses an election will advise the Governor-General to appoint the leader of the larger party as Prime Minister so the Governor-General does not need to act alone.
* State Premiers tender advice to State Governors for Federal Senate elections, in response to the Prime Minister's advice to the Governor-General to call a Federal House of Representatives election.
* State Governors are given a [[dormant commission]] to administer the Commonwealth if the Governor-General is unable to.
* Vice-regal officers act in a politically neutral way.

No convention is absolute; all but one (the second) of the above conventions were disregarded in the leadup to or during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]].

Ignoring constitutional conventions does not always result in a crisis. After the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010]], the Governor of Tasmania rejected the advice of his Premier to appoint the leader of the opposition as Premier because he felt the advice was tendered in bad faith. The Premier went on to form a new government.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* The six members of the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], that are chosen by the Parliaments of entities of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], should be chosen in a way as to establish the national balance, of "constituent peoples", in the Court (two [[Bosniaks]], two [[Croats|Croatian]]s and two [[Serb]]s), although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement.
* The Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] should be of different nationality in every new term (establishing the "rotation"), although this is not formally regulated.
* The government of an [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|entity]] should inform the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|government of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] of its intention to establish special parallel relationships with neighboring states, including negotiations. Also, the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] should be notified of any such intent, especially if there is a document that should be signed between parties, although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement (also for first example).

===Canada===
* Previously the Senate would not defeat a bill passed by the House of Commons, it was broken in 1989 when the Senate defeated a bill regulating abortions. It was broken again for a bill that would have ratified a [[free trade agreement]] between Canada and the United States.
* The Prime Minister will request the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to call an election upon the defeat of the government in a confidence or money vote. This convention was broken in 1968 when the ruling [[minority government]] unexpectedly lost a money vote. All the parties in Parliament, who were not prepared for a snap election, agreed to pass a resolution retroactively declaring the lost money vote was not a matter of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGregor |first=Janyce |title=Feeling confident about the budget vote? |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=12 May 2013 |date=11 June 2012 |quote=In 1968, Lester Pearson was prime minister, presiding over a minority Liberal government. Pearson governed largely with the support of the NDP, but in February the Liberals unexpectedly lost a final Commons vote over an amendment to the Income Tax Act. A strict reading of parliamentary convention would have suggested that vote was enough to trigger an election, because the change constituted a "money bill." But the Liberals were in the process of selecting a new leader, and Pearson gambled that no one really wanted an election right away. Pearson went on television and told Canadians that his government would put a second vote before the House of Commons specifically asking whether or not his government continued to command the confidence of the House of Commons, rather than the merits or demerits of a tax change. His gamble worked: his party won the second, more specific vote and carried on governing. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417044908/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |archivedate=April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Though it is mentioned in various constitutional documents, the precise nature of the office of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] operates mostly according to understood, uncodified British conventions.
* The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is, by statute (the ''[[Supreme Court Act]]''), composed of three justices from [[Quebec]] and six from anywhere in Canada (including Quebec).  This is because Quebec uses [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than the common law system used elsewhere in Canada; it is necessary to have a panel of at least three judges to hear civil law cases.  By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate amongst themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.  The appointment of the most senior puisne justice to chief justice is a convention that has recently fallen into disuse. There is also an attempt to appoint at least one justice straight from legal practice without having previously been a judge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Commonwealth Realms===
* The [[Governor-General]] is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day, is a resident of the country he or she will represent, and can be dismissed immediately on the advice of the Prime Minister (exceptions are [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], where the Governor-General is elected by Parliament and then formally appointed by the Queen, and the United Kingdom, which has no vice-regal office). However, in Canada, provincial lieutenant-governors are appointed on the advice of the federal prime minister, not the provincial premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=29 March 1867| title=Constitution Act, 1867| series=V.58| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html| accessdate=15 January 2009| ref=CITEREF_Victoria_1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will participate in the political process unless there is an extreme circumstance that merits the use of [[reserve powers]], or when the advice tendered is contrary to established convention.
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will make [[Partisan (political)|partisan speech]]es or state partisan opinions. This convention was broken in 1975 by [[Colin Hannah|Sir Colin Hannah]], the [[Governor of Queensland]], who called for the defeat of the [[Whitlam Government]]. The Queen, on Whitlam's advice, revoked Hannah's [[dormant commission]] to act as [[Administrator of the Government|Administrator of the Commonwealth of Australia]] and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] later refused the [[Premier of Queensland]]'s request that they advise the Queen to appoint Hannah to a second term as Governor (in 1975, Australian State Governors were still appointed on the advice of UK ministers)

===Denmark===
* The [[Danish Constitution]] makes reference to the King in great detail. Apart from the fact that this is understood to include a [[Queen regnant]] as well, references to the King acting in a political capacity are understood to mean the Prime Minister, as the Constitution stipulates that the King exercises his powers through the Cabinet.
* According to the Constitution, any public expenditure must be provided for in the annual [[money bill]] or provisional money bills. However, although not provided for in the Constitution, according to constitutional custom, the Parliamentary Budgetary Committee has the power to authorise provisional expenditure, regardless of the fact that such expenditure is not formally included in the budget (such grants are however then marked for adoption in the next forthcoming money bill).

===France===
* If the [[President of France|President]] of the Republic and the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] are [[Cohabitation (government)|not from the same party]], foreign affairs and defense are conducted by the President.
* If the president of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], the president of the [[French Senate|Senate]] or 60 deputies or 60 senators claim that a just-voted [[statute]] is unconstitutional, the President of the Republic does not sign the law and instead waits for a petition to be sent to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].

===Lebanon===
* The Lebanese constitution states that the [[President of Lebanon]] is elected by a simple majority of the [[Parliament of Lebanon]].  However, due to the country's delicate ethnic balance, the Parliament's various factions usually try to agree on a consensus candidate.
* Under the unwritten [[National Pact]], the president must always be a [[Maronite Christian]]; the [[Prime Minister of Lebanon|prime minister]] a [[Sunni Muslim]]; the speaker of Parliament a [[Shia Muslim]]; and the deputy speaker [[Greek Orthodox]].

===Malaysia===
* At the federal level, the [[King of Malaysia|King]] acts on the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]'s advice, except on certain cases. At the state level, the respective ruler or governor acts on his Chief Minister's advice.
* At the federal level, the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] is the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in the [[Dewan Rakyat]] (House of Representatives) and therefore most likely to command the support of the [[Dewan Rakyat]]; and likewise a Chief Minister, the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in a State Legislature and therefore most likely to command the support of such State Legislature. 
* The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] should be a member of the [[Dewan Rakyat]].
* The [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat]] chairs the Joint Session of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]], where the King addresses both [[Dewan Negara]] (Senate) and [[Dewan Rakyat]].

===New Zealand===
There is a convention that the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] of New Zealand should not ask for an early election unless he or she is unable to maintain [[confidence and supply]].{{clarify|date=August 2011}} By the 1950s, it had also become a convention that elections should be held on the last Saturday of November, or the closest date to this range as possible. There are several times when these conventions have been broken and an election has been held several months earlier:
*[[New Zealand general election, 1951|1951 general election]]: [[Sidney Holland]] called the election to get a mandate to face down a [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|dockworks dispute]]. The government was returned to power with an increased majority; by this time the dispute had been resolved.
*[[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]]: [[Robert Muldoon]]'s government held a narrow four-seat majority in Parliament. Muldoon hoped to strengthen his leadership, as two backbenchers ([[Marilyn Waring]] and [[Mike Minogue]]) were threatening to rebel against the government in an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. However, Waring and Minogue had not threatened to block confidence and supply. The election was a decisive defeat for the government.
*[[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 general election]]: [[Helen Clark]] called the election after the collapse of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], her coalition partners. Some critics argued that the government could still maintain confidence and supply and therefore the early election was not necessary. The Labour Party remained in power with two different coalition partners.

===Norway===
Because of the 1814 written constitution's pivotal role in providing independence and establishing democracy in the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament has been very reluctant to change it. Few of the developments in the political system that have been taking place since then have been codified as amendments. This reluctance has been labelled constitutional conservatism. The two most important examples of constitutional conventions in the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian political system]] are parliamentarism and the declining power of the King.
* Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must maintain the support of parliament (an absence of mistrust) but it need not have its express support.
* All new laws are passed and all new cabinets are therefore formed in a de jure fashion by the King, although not necessarily in a de facto sense.
* According to the written constitution, the cabinet (council of ministers) are appointed by the King. The appointment of new cabinets by the King is a formality, and the king has not directly exercised executive powers since 1905.

===Spain===
Much of Spain's political framework is codified in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], which formalizes the relationship between an independent constitutional [[Monarchy of Spain|monarchy]], the government, and the legislature. However, the constitution invests the monarch as the "arbitrator and moderator of the institutions" of government.

* The King nominates a candidate to stand for the [[Spanish Prime Minister|Presidency of the Government of Spain]], sometimes known in English as 'prime minister'. The nominee then stands before the Congress of Deputies and presents his political agenda for the upcoming legislative term, followed by a [[Indirect election|vote of confidence]] in the nominee and his agenda. The 1978 constitution allows the King to nominate anyone he sees fit to stand for the vote of confidence so long as the King has met with the political party leaders represented in the Congress beforehand. However, King Juan Carlos I has consistently nominated the political party leader who commands a plurality of seats in the Congress of Deputies.
* The Spanish public perception that the monarchy be politically non-partisan in its adherence to constitutional protocol and convention, yet while protecting the public expression of personal political views by members of the royal family. Expressions of personal political views expressed in public include when the Prince of Asturias and his sisters protested against terrorism following the 2004 Madrid bombings, or when the Queen gave controversial political viewpoints during an informal interview.
* Constitutionally, the King appoints the twenty members to the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain. However, when a vacancy is observed the King's appointment has been customarily on the advice of the government of the day. Additionally, the King appoints the President of the Supreme Court on the advice of the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain.
* According to the 1978 constitution, grandee and nobility titles, and civil and military decorations, are awarded by the King as head of state. However, in most cases since 1978, the King's appointment of nobility titles have been countersigned by the President of the Government of Spain, with civil awards having been nominated by the President and military awards having been nominated by the military.

=== Switzerland ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Politics of Switzerland]] --&gt;
The following constitutional conventions are part of the political culture of [[Switzerland]]. They hold true at the federal level and mostly so at the cantonal and communal level. Mostly, they aim to reconcile the democratic principle of [[majority rule]] with the need to achieve consensus in a nation that is much more heterogeneous in many respects than other nation-states.
* The government is a body of equals composed in [[Concordance system|political proportion]] to the weight of the various factions in [[Parliament]]; this creates a permanent [[grand coalition]].
* Members of a collective body, including the [[Swiss Federal Council|federal government]], observe [[collegiality]] at all times, that is, they do not publicly criticise one another. They also publicly support all decisions of the collective, even against their own opinion or that of their political party. In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained at the federal level, at least after the 2003 elections to the [[Swiss Federal Council]].
* The [[President|presidency]] of a collective body, particularly a government, rotates yearly; the president is a [[primus inter pares]].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom}}
While the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution that is a single document, the collection of [[legal instrument]]s that have developed into a body of law known as constitutional law has existed for hundreds of years.

As part of this uncodified British [[constitution]], constitutional conventions play a key role. They are rules that are observed by the various constituted parts though they are not written in any document having legal authority; there are often underlying enforcing principles that are themselves not formal and codified. Nonetheless it is very unlikely that there would be a departure of such conventions without good reason, even if an underlying enforcing principle has been overtaken by history, as these conventions also acquire the force of custom. Examples include:

* The texts of most international treaties are laid before Parliament at least twenty one days before ratification (the '[[Ponsonby Rule]]' of 1924).
* The monarch will accept and act on the advice of their ministers, who are responsible to Parliament for that advice; the monarch does not ignore that advice, except when exercising [[Reserve powers]].
* The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] is the leader of the [[political party|party]] (or coalition of parties) with an absolute majority of seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and therefore most likely to command the support of the House of Commons.
* All [[money bills]] must originate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].
* The monarch grants the [[Royal Assent]] to all legislation – sometimes characterised as all legislation passed in good faith. It is possible that ministers could advise against giving consent, as happens with the [[Crown dependencies]] (convention since the early 18th century – previously monarchs did refuse or withhold the Royal Assent).
* The Prime Minister should be a member of either House of Parliament (between the 18th century - 1963).
** In 1963 it was amended to the effect that no Prime Minister should come from the House of Lords. When the last Prime Minister peer, the Earl of Home, took office he renounced his peerage, and as Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]] became an MP.
** The Prime Minister can hold office temporarily whilst not a Member of Parliament, for example during a general election or in the case of Douglas-Home, between resigning from the Lords and being elected to the Commons in a by-election.
* All Cabinet members must be members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], since the cabinet is a committee of the council. Further, certain senior Loyal Opposition shadow cabinet members are also made Privy Counsellors, so that sensitive information may be shared with them "on Privy Council terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-3708.pdf Parliamentary briefing – the Privy Council], accessed 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* The House of Lords should not reject a budget passed by the House of Commons. This was broken controversially in 1909 by the House of Lords, which argued that the Convention was linked to another Convention that the Commons would not introduce a Bill that 'attacked' peers and their wealth. The Lords claimed that the Commons broke this Convention in [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s budget, justifying the Lords' rejection of the budget. The Commons disputed the existence of a linked convention. As a consequence, the Lords' powers over budgets were greatly lessened by the [[Parliament Act 1911]].
* During a [[Uk general election|General Election]], no major party shall put up an opponent against a [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker seeking re-election]]. This convention was not respected during the 1987 General Election, when both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] fielded candidates against the Conservative Speaker, [[Bernard Weatherill]], who was MP for [[Croydon North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North East]]. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) does stand against the Speaker if he or she represents a [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|Scottish constituency]], as was the case with [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]], Speaker from 2000 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/flash_map/html/map05.stm BBC NEWS | Election 2005 | Election Map&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Westminster Parliament]] will only legislate on [[reserved matters]]. It will not legislate on non-reserved matters ('[[devolved]] matters') without first seeking the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] (since 1999, the [[Sewel motion|Sewel convention]], later renamed to [[Legislative Consent Motion]]s).
* The House of Lords shall not oppose legislation from the House of Commons that was a part of the government's [[manifesto]] (the [[Salisbury Convention]]).

=== United States ===
*The [[President of the United States]] will give his [[State of the Union address]] annually and in person, before a joint session of Congress. This practice was followed by George Washington and John Adams but abandoned by Thomas Jefferson and not resumed until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson delivered his State of the Union address in person.  The constitution requires the President give an update on the state of the union "from time to time", but no specifics are outlined. Speeches have been broadcast on radio since 1923 and 1947; the last State of the Union message delivered only in writing was in 1981.*
*Much of how the [[United States Cabinet]] operates is dictated by convention; its operations are only vaguely alluded to in the US constitution.
*While members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are only required to live in the state they represent, it has generally been expected that they live in the district they represent as well, though there are some exceptions; [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] was elected in 2010 representing a district adjacent to the one he resided in.
*The [[President of the United States]] will obtain the [[Senatorial courtesy|consent of both Senators from a state]] before appointing a [[United States Attorney]], [[United States district court|federal district judge]], or [[federal marshal]] with jurisdiction in that state.
*Cabinet officials and other major executive officers resign and are replaced when a new President takes office, unless explicitly asked to stay on by the new President.
*The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] is always the Representative who leads the ruling party, even though the Constitution does not specify that the Speaker must be a member of the chamber.  Also by custom the Speaker does not vote (except to break a tie).
*The [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] will be the most senior Senator of the ruling party.
*Members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] are pledged to vote for a particular Presidential candidate, and are chosen by popular vote with the name of the candidate, and not necessarily the elector, on the ballot.
*Senate rules require a majority of 60 votes to invoke [[cloture]], that is, to break off debate on a bill and force a vote. The Senate could revise its rules at any time, but it doesn't, leaving the [[filibuster]] available as a tool for a large-enough minority to indefinitely block any measure it finds objectionable enough.

'''Culture in [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]]''', also known as the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] metropolitan area, stretches back to the 17th century. The area has seen prominent historical events, interesting artistic creations, and unique contributions to the [[culture of the United States]]. The largest city in the area, Albany, consistently ranks high on lists of top cities/metro areas for culture, such as being 23rd in the book ''Cities Ranked &amp; Rated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = America's Top Cities for Culture | url = http://www.move.com/new-homes/real-estate-news/the-top-10-cultural-cities.aspx | publisher = Move, Inc. | accessdate = 2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albany-Schenectady-Troy metro area ranked 12th among large metro areas, and Glens Falls ranked 12th among the small metro areas, in Sperling's Best Places,&lt;ref name=Techvalley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techvalley.org/Pages/News%20_%20Events/National%20Recognition.html |title=New York's Tech Valley: National Recognition |publisher=Tech Valley Chamber Coalition |accessdate=2009-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724231207/http://techvalley.org/Pages/News%20_%20Events/National%20Recognition.html |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Expansion Management (a monthly business magazine) gave the Albany-Schenectady-Troy area five Stars, its highest ranking, for quality of life features.&lt;ref name=Techvalley/&gt;

==Museums==
[[Image:Saratoga-tower.jpg|thumb|left|Saratoga Monument in [[Saratoga National Historical Park]]]]
The Capital District has many historical sites and museums covering a wide range of topics and time periods. The [[Albany Institute of History and Art]] founded in 1791 is one of the oldest museums in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanyinstitute.org/HTML/history.htm The History of the Albany Institute of History from the 1700s to the Present&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229200707/http://www.albanyinstitute.org/HTML/history.htm |date=2012-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New York State Museum]] is the oldest and largest state museum in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/membership/ |title=Support the New York State Museum |publisher=New York State Museum |accessdate=2009-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090603205328/http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/membership/ |archivedate=2009-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the museums are historical sites themselves, such as Cherry Hill, the [[Ten Broeck Mansion]], and the [[Schuyler Mansion]] in Albany, the Pruyn House in [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]], [[Old Fort Johnson]] in [[Fort Johnson, New York|Fort Johnson]], and the [[Hart-Cluett Mansion]] in [[Troy, New York|Troy]]. The [[Crailo State Historic Site]] in the city of [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]] was built in the early 18th century and is a museum of colonial [[New Netherland]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Crailo State Historic Site | publisher = New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation | url = http://nysparks.state.ny.us/sites/info.asp?siteID=7 | accessdate = 2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historical sites and museums chronicle historic events of national importance from the Revolutionary War such as the [[Saratoga National Historical Park]] in [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]] and the [[Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site]] in [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]].

[[The Children's Museum of Science and Technology]] (The Junior Museum) in [[North Greenbush, New York|North Greenbush]], the [[Burden Iron Works]] in Troy, and the [[Schenectady Museum]] in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] are three museums that are focused on the technological and scientific history of the region. The Schenectady Museum also has a [[planetarium]], as does the Albany Heritage Area Visitors Center in Albany. Though the [[Dudley Observatory]], in Schenectady, is no longer a working observatory it still remains the oldest independent organization in the United States supporting astronomy research and has one of the finest astronomy libraries in world.&lt;ref name=JustCR&gt;{{cite web | title = Just the Capital Region.com | publisher = Just the Capital Region | accessdate = 2009-11-24 | url = http://www.justthecapitalregion.com/attractions.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museums in the area cover a specific topic such as the [[National Bottle Museum]] in [[Ballston Spa, New York|Ballston Spa]], or the Throop Drug Store Museum at the [[Albany College of Pharmacy]].

==Performing arts==
[[File:PalaceTheater.JPG|thumb|The [[Palace Theatre (Albany, New York)|Palace Theatre]] in Albany]]
The Capital District is home to many venues for the performing arts, some very old and some very new. Some are owned by municipalities or the state, such as the [[Times Union Center]] (owned by Albany County), the [[Palace Theatre (Albany)|Palace Theatre]] (owned by the city of Albany), or the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]] (SPAC) and [[the Egg (building)|the Egg]] (both owned by the state of New York).

The Times Union Center is the largest venue, originally called the Knickerbocker Arena. It opened on January 30, 1990 with a performance by [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Times Union enters a new arena". Carol DeMare. ''[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]''. May 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[The Grateful Dead]] released a concert album from their March 1990 performances titled ''[[Dozin' at the Knick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dead101.com/1045.htm Dozin' at the Knick&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the venues, such as [[Proctor's Theatre (Schenectady, New York)|Proctor's Theatre]] in Schenectady and the Palace Theatre in Albany are quite old and started off in the days of [[vaudeville]]. Proctor's and the Palace have evolved into hosting dance, ballet, opera, symphony orchestra, and contemporary music performances such as Proctor's hosting of [[Mariah Carey]]'s filming of her 1993 Thanksgiving NBC Special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmariahcarey.com/Videos/thanksgiving-nbc-special.html |title=Thanksgiving NBC Special (1993) |accessdate=2009-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009161812/http://allmariahcarey.com/Videos/thanksgiving-nbc-special.html |archivedate=October 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.proctors.org/about | title = A history of Proctors | publisher = Proctor's Theatre | accessdate = 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cohoes Music Hall]], the WAMC's Performing Arts Center (The Linda) in Albany, and the [[Troy Savings Bank|Troy Savings Bank Music Hall]] are three smaller venues also in buildings as old as Proctor's and the Palace.

The Egg in Albany and SPAC in Saratoga Springs are newer venues for concerts, ballet, and orchestra performances both constructed during [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s tenure as [[governor of New York]]. In addition to outside acts performing in the region, there are local ones as well. The [[Albany Symphony Orchestra]] performs at the Palace and the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall, among other local venues, and a few outside the region as well. The Capital Repertory Theater in Albany and the New York State Theatre Institute (NYSTI) in Troy are local groups with their own performing space. Many local colleges have performing arts spaces as well; one of the newest and most sophisticated is the [[Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center]] (EMPAC) at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) in Troy.

==Festivals==
[[File:KingFountainWashingtonParkAlbany.jpg|thumb|The King Fountain in [[Washington Park Historic District (Albany, New York)|Washington Park]] in Albany during the [[Tulip Festival (Albany, New York)|Tulip Fest]]]]
One of the largest events in the Capital District is the [[Tulip Festival (Albany, New York)|Tulip Fest]] held in Albany every spring at [[Washington Park Historic District (Albany, New York)|Washington Park]]. The tradition stems from when Mayor [[Erastus Corning 2nd]] got a city ordinance passed declaring the [[tulip]] as Albany's official flower on July 1, 1948. In addition, he sent a request to Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] to name a variety as Albany's tulip. On July 11, 1948 her reply was "Her Majesty gladly accepts the invitation to designate a tulip as the official flower of Albany." She picked the variety "Orange Wonder", a bronzy orange shaded scarlet. The first Tulip Fest was celebrated the next year on May 14, 1949 with opening ceremonies still carried on today as tradition, such as the sweeping of State Street and the crowning of a Tulip Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Albany Tulip Queen | publisher = Albany Tulip Queen.com | accessdate = 2009-06-07 | url = http://www.albanytulipqueen.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[African-American]] tradition of [[Pinkster]]fest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest.

The largest [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] parade is held every year in Troy. The 42nd annual parade in 2009 is along a two-mile-long route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Troy, NY Flag Day Parade |publisher=City of Troy |url=http://www.troyny.gov/visittroy/flagdayparade.html |accessdate=2009-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415210324/http://www.troyny.gov/visittroy/flagdayparade.html |archivedate=2009-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[First Night]] celebrations are held in Saratoga Springs, while in 2006 Albany decided to eliminate its First Night celebrations in favor of a new "Albany WinterFestival" (WinterFest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New event to premier as Albany's First Night fades away | publisher = Albany Business Review | url = http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2006/12/25/daily33.html | date = December 29, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capital District has its share of historical and tourist [[non-fiction]] books; the area however has also seen a great deal of [[fiction]] written by its natives and about the region. Some of these have been turned into movies, such as ''[[Ironweed (novel)|Ironweed]]'' by [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]] and ''[[Last of the Mohicans]]'' by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. ''Ironweed'' is but one of a series of books by Kennedy that take place in Albany. The series is often referred to as the "Albany Cycle".

In addition, Albany is known for a landmark event in the history of American Reform Judaism: [[Rabbi]] [[Isaac Mayer Wise]], one of the founders of [[Reform Judaism]] in the United States, first advocated his reforms at a synagogue in Albany, where he was Albany's first and only rabbi.&lt;ref name=Judaica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaac Mayer Wise: Architect of American Reform Judaism |first=Samuel M |last=Stahl |publisher=Temple Beth-El (San Antonio, Texas) |url=http://www.beth-elsa.org/be_s0324.htm |accessdate=2010-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531035826/http://www.beth-elsa.org/be_s0324.htm# |archive-date=2009-05-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wise was also the teacher of one of only four Hebrew schools in the nation.&lt;ref name=Judaica/&gt; In 1850 he came to blows with the congregation president and the police were called to quell the riot that started on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Isaac Mayer Wise: Architect of American Reform Judaism | author = Rabbi Samuel M.

There is also a small population of [[Muslim]]s in the city. The number of colleges and universities in the area help bring in more culturally diverse students, representing ranging religious beliefs. Most of the local colleges have respective Muslim Student Associations, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Local Muslim Student Associations |publisher=Albany-Area Muslims Website |url=http://www.jannah.org/albany/msas.html |year= |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; SUNY Albany even cancelled class for [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]] during the 2004–2005 school year, however it reverted that policy the following year due to low Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Muslim Holiday and Classes Go On |last=Yusko |first=Dennis |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |page=A1 |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2010-06-22 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=8701663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developmental [[biology]] and [[zoology]], '''defeminization''' is an aspect of the process of [[sexual differentiation]] by which a potential female-specific structure, function, or behavior is changed by one of the processes of male development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/defeminization|title=Defeminization definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term might seem to imply "removal" of female characteristics, in nearly all biological contexts it refers to ''prevention'' of an aspect of female development from manifesting.

In human [[biology of gender]], the best known example of this is the prevention of development of the [[müllerian duct]] derivatives by [[anti-müllerian hormone]] (AMH) in the 3rd and 4th months of [[fetus|fetal]] development, though the term is not commonly used in discussions of human development.

In a number of non-human [[mammal]]s, there is evidence that hormones produced by the testes act directly on the [[brain]] to prevent development of female characteristics, especially female [[Animal sexual behavior|reproductive behavior]].

'''Dixie Bull''' (or '''Dixey Bull''') was an English [[sea captain]], and the first [[pirate]] known to prey on shipping off the [[New England]] coast, especially [[Maine]]. 

==Biography==
A native of [[Huntingdon]]&lt;ref&gt;Genealogical Society of Utah. British Isles Vital Records Index, 2nd Edition. Salt Lake City, Utah: Intellectual Reserve, copyright 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;, he was apprenticed Skinner to his elder brother Seth in 1627 for a period of 9 years, but did not complete his [[indenture]]s until 1648 when he was granted freedom of the city of London in the [[Worshipful Company of Skinners]]. &lt;ref&gt;
A brief account of the wicked doings of Dixie Bull: Reputedly the first pirate in New England waters : containing accounts from contemporary sources, with a copy of the first map ever cut in New England by Jim McLain, 1980
&lt;/ref&gt; He came to [[Boston]] in 1632 having been granted a [[List of Maine land patents|patent of land]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/colonial/america-west-indies/vol1/pp141-143&lt;/ref&gt; and started sailing the [[Maine]] coast with a small vessel, trading with the Indians, largely for furs, especially beaver. The Skinners were the livery company whose business was the trade in skins and furs, so he may have been acting as agent for his brother in London. In 1632, traveling in the [[Penobscot Bay]] area, he was attacked by a roving band of French in a small [[full-rigged pinnace|pinnace]]; or possibly he was present in [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] Harbor when a French force attacked the trading post there.&lt;ref&gt;Dixie Bull's hoard: ''Lost Treasure'', March 1976 issue, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the details, his ship was captured and all his trade goods and provisions confiscated.

Fired with revenge, he traveled back to Boston, assembled a crew of 20-25 men, and entered upon a career of piracy to recoup his losses. Ironically, he did not target French shipping, probably because the English traders were wealthier.&lt;ref&gt;Story of Dixie Bull: ''Discover Maine, Maine's History Magazine, Greater Bath-Brunswick Region'', Vol. 3 (2006) Issue 3, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

His fame as "the dread pirate" derived from his attack in 1632 on the settlement of [[Bristol, Maine|Pemaquid]], which was then center of the lucrative [[fur trading|fur trade]] in Maine. Few pirates had the temerity to attack a defended town.  Sailing into the harbour, with what is said to be three ships, he opened fire on the [[stockade]] there, and sacked the town. The booty seized is variously said to have been £55 or $2500.

Some stories say he joined the French, others that he returned to [[England]], and others that he was hanged in [[Tyburn]]. Legend says that he buried treasure on [[Damariscove Island]] and [[Cushing Island]] in [[Casco Bay]], [[Maine]]. The fact of his being admitted as a Skinner in 1648 shows that he did survive his piratical career and return to England. Administration of his estate was granted to his sister Susan Kendricks née Bull in Huntingdon in 1656 &lt;ref&gt;http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C3063581 PROB6/32 p 179&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Dixie Bull was soon enshrined in ballads, the most famous of them being "The Story of Dixie Bull" and "The Slaying of Dixie Bull".&lt;ref&gt;Dixie Bull ballad: '' Minstrelsy of Maine, Folk-Songs and Ballads of the Woods and the Coast '', [[Fannie Hardy Eckstorm]] and Mary Winslow Smith; Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; This ballad describes a duel between Dixie Bull and a fisherman from Pemaquid, Daniel Curtis, on an island near that town, in which Dixie Bull was killed, saving the town.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4599">'''Elkpen''' (aka '''Christian Kasperkovitz''') is a street artist based in Los Angeles, California whose work contemplates the effect of urban life on familiar, threatened or extinct flora and fauna. Elkpen can do her work in any size, place or thing that offers itself, sometimes it's a retail or corporate setting. Sometimes even a park bench, matchbook or post card her work may appear on. Her work has reached numerous cities and counties such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name="KCET street art"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fuentes|first1=Ed|title=Street Art Writes New Rules on Urban Linguistics|url=http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/writing-on-the-wall/street-art-writes-new-rules-on-urban-linguistics.html|website=www.kcet.org|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she was commissioned to create the design on the exterior of the Los Angeles River Rover, a mobile classroom which is used to teach students about the significance of the [[Los Angeles River]] to wildlife in the city. Elkpen also takes the time to do work shops with youth, presentations for communities and non profit organizations. She also associates with corporate clients to create authentic and socially progressive images and content.&lt;ref name="KCET River Rover"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jao|first1=Carren|title=River Rover Rolls into L.A.

Elkpen's work has been seen on buildings, busses, beaches, fences, light poles and bus benches in the US and Canada. She has been working as a freelance artist for over 20 years with the slogan in the back of her mind "no job is too large or too small".&lt;ref name="buzz w artist photo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grist|first1=Julie|title=Elusive Environmental Artist "Elkpen" in Larchmont|url=http://www.larchmontbuzz.com/larchmont-village-people/elusive-environmental-artist-elkpen-in-larchmont/|website=www.larchmontbuzz.com|publisher=Larchmont Buzz - Larchmont Village Newspaper|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkpen's work uses both images and words to convey biological, historical, and environmental information to draw the viewer's attention to the wildlife or lack of wildlife in a particular location. The key that distinguishes her projects from other people is her ability to hand draw images with great quality. Hand drawn images are more natural plus can give off a more lively feel for the viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grist|first1=Julie|title=Elusive Environmental Artist "Elkpen" in Larchmont|url=http://www.larchmontbuzz.com/larchmont-village-people/elusive-environmental-artist-elkpen-in-larchmont/|website=www.larchmontbuzz.com|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkpen's subjects have included cottonwood trees, alder trees, coastal prairies, Grizzlies, Giant Swallowtail and Anise Swallowtail butterflies, Fairy Shrimp, Western Kingbirds, Goldfinches, Northern Mockingbirds, Yellow Chevroned Parakeets, Black Phoebes, Woodpeckers, Crows, Bushtits and many other birds found in Southern California. She also works with clients to create authentic and socially progressive images and content that weave together a connection to place and the community around it as well as the clients overall mission.&lt;ref name="LA WEEKLY bird mural"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mauer such creatures as|first1=Mark|title=BIRDS OF HOLLYWOOD, ELKPEN, FOUNTAIN AVE MARKET|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/birds-of-hollywood-elkpen-fountain-ave-market-2368054|website=www.laweekly.com|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has previously taught in Canada and the USA. {{Cn|date=April 2017}}

== Main works ==
Probyn's work has helped to establish several new areas of scholarship – from embodied research methods to cultural studies of food. Professor Probyn is the author of several groundbreaking monographs and over a hundred articles and chapters across the fields of gender, media, and cultural studies, philosophy, cultural geography, anthropology and critical psychology. Her current research includes questions about the sustainability of food production and consumption from an ethnographic and cultural perspective.&lt;ref name ="test" /&gt; This draws from previous work on embodiment, gender, sexuality, ethics and cultural practice. Her exploration of these issues draws from contemporary debates about the more-than-human realm and the power of non-human agents and agencies.

As of 2018, her most recent book is ''Eating the Ocean'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hoare |first1=Philip |title=Eating the Ocean, by Elspeth Probyn |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-eating-the-ocean-elspeth-probyn-duke-university-press |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=Times Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Robert Curtius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊər|t|s|i|ʊ|s}}; April 14, 1886 &amp;ndash; April 19, 1956) was a [[Germany|German]] literary scholar, [[philologist]], and Romance language literary critic, best known for his 1948 study ''Europäische Literatur und Lateinisches Mittelalter'', translated in English as ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages''.

==Biography==
Curtius was [[Alsace|Alsatian]], born in [[Thann, Haut-Rhin|Thann]], into a north German family; [[Ernst Curtius]], his grandfather, and [[Georg Curtius]], his great-uncle, were both notable scholars. His family moved to [[Strasbourg]] after his father [[Friedrich Curtius]] was appointed president of the Lutheran [[Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine]], and Curtius received his Abitur from the Strasbourg Protestant gymnasium.&lt;ref name="ostheeren"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostheeren|first=Klaus|editor=[[Helen Damico]]|title=Medieval Scholarship: Literature and Philology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IwWuEy-E268C&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=23 April 2012|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-2890-2|pages=365–80|chapter=Ernst Robert Curtius (1886-1956)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled in Europe afterward, and was fluent in French and English. [[Albert Schweitzer]], who boarded with the family between 1906 and 1912, is credited with introducing Curtius to modern French literature; of great influence also was the Romance philologist [[Gustav Gröber]].&lt;ref name="ostheeren"/&gt; He studied philology and philosophy in [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] (doctorate, 1910), [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]; he wrote his ''Habilitationsschrift'' for Gröber in [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], 1913, and began teaching there in 1914. [[World War I]] interrupted his scholarly work: Curtius served in France and Poland and was wounded in 1915; his injuries were severe enough for him to be discharged in 1916; he returned to Bonn to resume teaching.&lt;ref name="ostheeren"/&gt;

==Work==
Much of Curtius's work was done while the Nazis were in power, and his interest in humanist studies is usually seen as a response to the totalitarianism of his times. Curtius saw European literature as part of a continuous tradition that began with the Greek and Latin authors and continued throughout the Middle Ages; he did not acknowledge a break between those traditions, a division that would separate historical periods from each other and support a set of national literatures without connections to each other. Greatly interested in French literature, early in his career he promoted the study of that literature in a period in Germany when it was considered the enemy's literature, a "humanist and heroic" stance that earned him the criticism of the nationalist intelligentsia in Germany.&lt;ref name="calin"/&gt;

He is best known for his 1948 work ''Europäische Literatur und Lateinisches Mittelalter''.&lt;ref&gt;Translated in English as ''[[European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages]]'', by Willard R. Trask. New York: Harper Row, 1953. {{ISBN|0-691-01899-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a major study of the [[Medieval Latin]] literature and its effect on subsequent writing in modern [[European languages]], and argued that, first, the standard "Classic-Medieval-Renaissance-Modern" division of literature was counterproductive given the continuity between those literatures, and second, that "much of Renaissance and
later European literature cannot be fully understood without a knowledge of that literature's relation to
Medieval Latin rhetoric in the use of commonplaces, metaphors, turns of phrase, or, to employ the term Curtius prefers, ''topoi''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lind|first=L.R.|year=1951|title=Rev. of Curtius, ''Europäische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter''|journal=[[The Classical Weekly]]|volume=44|issue=14|pages=220–21|jstor=4342972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was largely responsible for introducing the "literary topos" concept as a scholarly and critical discussion of literary [[Literary topos|commonplaces]].&lt;ref name="calin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Calin|first=William|editor=Leslie J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10409">The article provides details and data regarding the '''geographical''' '''distribution of all English speakers''', regardless of the legislative status of the countries where it's spoken. The [[English language]] is one of the most widely spoken languages of the world, and it's widely used in the international communication as [[lingua franca]]. Many international organizations use English as their official language.

== Statistics ==

=== Native speakers ===
This table depicts the [[First language|native speakers]] of the language, which means that the table includes people who have been exposed to the English language from birth and, thus, excludes people who use the language as a [[Second language|L2]].

{{alphabet}}
The '''Gothic alphabet''' is an [[alphabet]] for writing the  [[Gothic language]], created in the 4th century by  [[Ulfilas]] (or Wulfila) for the purpose of [[Bible translations|translating the Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the testimony of the historians [[Philostorgius]], [[Socrates of Constantinople]] and [[Sozomen]]. Cf. Streitberg (1910:20).&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabet is essentially an [[uncial script|uncial]] form of the [[Greek alphabet]], with a few additional letters to account for Gothic phonology: [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[F]] and [[G]], a questionably [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] letter to distinguish the /w/ [[Semivowel|glide]] from vocalic /u/, and the letter [[ƕair]] to express the Gothic [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]].

==Origin==

Ulfilas is thought to have consciously chosen to avoid the use of the older [[Runic alphabet]] for this purpose, as it was heavily connected with [[Germanic paganism|heathen]] beliefs and customs.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jensen (1969:474).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Greek-based script probably helped to integrate the Gothic nation into the dominant [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] culture around the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Haarmann (1991:434).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters==
Below is a table of the Gothic alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the Gothic alphabet see also [[Fausto Cercignani]], ''The Elaboration of the Gothic Alphabet and Orthography'', in “Indogermanische Forschungen”, 93, 1988, pp. 168-185.&lt;/ref&gt; Two letters used in its [[transliteration]] are not used in current English: thorn ''[[Thorn (letter)|þ]]'' (representing {{IPAslink|θ}}), and hwair ''[[Hwair|ƕ]]'' (representing {{IPAslink|ʍ|hʷ}}).

As with the Greek alphabet, Gothic letters were also assigned numerical values. When used as numerals, letters were written either between two dots (•{{lang|got|𐌹𐌱}}• = 12) or with an overline (&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;{{lang|got|𐌹𐌱}}&lt;/span&gt; = 12). Two letters, {{lang|got|𐍁}} (90) and {{lang|got|𐍊}} (900), have no phonetic value.

The letter names are recorded in a 9th-century manuscript of [[Alcuin]] ([[Codex Vindobonensis 795]]). Most of them seem to be Gothic forms of names also appearing in the [[rune poem]]s. The names are given in their attested forms followed by the reconstructed Gothic forms and their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;The forms which are not attested in the Gothic corpus are marked with an asterisk. For a detailed discussion of the reconstructed forms, cf. Kirchhoff (1854). For a survey of the relevant literature, cf. Zacher (1855).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
Most of the letters have been taken over directly from the [[Greek alphabet]], though a few have been created or modified from Latin and possibly (more controversially&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt;) Runic letters to express unique phonological features of Gothic. These are:

* {{lang|got|𐌵}} (q; derived either from a form of Greek [[Stigma (letter)|stigma]]/[[digamma]] ([[File:Greek Digamma cursive 06.svg|x16px]]),&lt;ref name=Contact&gt;Magnús Snædal ('''2015'''). “Gothic Contact with Latin” in ''Early Germanic Languages in Contact'', Ed. John Ole Askedal and Hans Frede Nielsen.&lt;/ref&gt; or from a cursive variant of [[kappa| kappa (ϰ)]], which could strongly resemble a ''[[u]]'',&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt; or by inverting Greek [[Pi (letter)|pi (𐍀)]] /p/, perhaps due to similarity in the Gothic names: ''pairþa'' versus ''qairþa''{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}})
* {{lang|got|𐌸}} (þ; derived either from Greek [[phi (letter)|phi (Φ)]] /f/ or [[psi (letter)|psi (Ψ)]] /ps/ with phonetic reassignment; possibly the letterform was switched with {{lang|got|𐍈}})&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt;
* {{lang|got|𐌾}} (j; derived from Latin [[G]] /ɡ/&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt;)
* {{lang|got|𐌿}} (u; possibly an allograph of Greek [[Ο]] (cf. the numerical values), or (less plausibly)&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt; from Runic {{script|Runr|[[ᚢ]]}} /u/)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kirchhoff (1854:55).&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|got|𐍈}} (ƕ; derived from Greek [[Theta|Θ]] /θ/ with phonetic reassignment; possibly the letterform was switched with {{lang|got|𐌸}})&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt;
* {{lang|got|𐍉}} (o; derived either from Greek [[Ω]] or from Runic {{script|Runr|[[ᛟ]]}},&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann (1991:434).&lt;/ref&gt; or from a cursive form of Greek [[Ο]], as such a form was more common for omicron than for omega in this time period, and as the sound values of omicron and omega had already merged by this time&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt;)

{{lang|got|𐍂}} (r), {{lang|got|𐍃}} (s) and {{lang|got|𐍆}} (f) appear to be derived from their Latin equivalents rather than from the Greek, although the equivalent Runic letters ({{script|Runr|[[Raido|ᚱ]]}}, {{script|Runr|[[Sowilo rune|ᛋ]]}} and {{script|Runr|[[Fehu|ᚠ]]}}), assumed to have been part of the Gothic futhark, possibly played some role in this choice.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kirchhoff (1854:55-56); Friesen (1915:306-310).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Snædal notes that “Wulfila’s knowledge of runes was questionable to say the least”, as the extreme paucity of inscriptions attests that knowledge and use of runes was rare among the East Germanic peoples.&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt; No indisputably Gothic Runic inscriptions are known to exist.&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt; Some variants of {{lang|got|𐍃}} (s) are shaped like a sigma and more obviously derive from the Greek [[Σ]].&lt;ref name=Contact /&gt;

{{lang|got|𐍇}} (x) is only used in proper names and loanwords containing Greek [[chi (letter)|Χ]]  (''xristus'' "Christ", ''galiugaxristus'' "Pseudo-Christ", ''zaxarias'' "Zacharias", ''aiwxaristia'' "eucharist").&lt;ref&gt;Wright (1910:5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the letters' numeric values, most correspond to those of the [[Greek numerals]]. Gothic {{lang|got|𐌵}} takes the place of [[digamma|Ϝ]] (6), {{lang|got|𐌾}} takes the place of [[xi (letter)|ξ]] (60), {{lang|got|𐌿}} that of [[omicron|Ο]] (70), and {{lang|got|𐍈}} that of [[psi (letter)|ψ]] (700).

==Diacritics and punctuation==
Diacritics and punctuation used in the [[Codex Argenteus]] include a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] placed on  {{lang|got|𐌹}} ''i'', transliterated as ''ï'', in general applied to express [[hiatus (linguistics)|diaeresis]], the [[interpunct]] (·) and [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) as well as [[overline]]s to indicate [[sigla]] (such as &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;''xaus''&lt;/span&gt; for ''xristaus'') and numerals.

[[File:Codex Argenteus.jpg|thumb|250px|First page of the ''[[Codex Argenteus]]'' or "Silver Bible", a 6th-century manuscript containing bishop [[Ulfilas]]'s 4th century translation of the Christian [[Bible]] into the [[Gothic language]].]]

==Unicode==
The Gothic alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in March, 2001 with the release of version 3.1.

The Unicode block for Gothic is U+10330&amp;ndash;U+1034F in the ''Supplementary Multilingual Plane''. As older software that uses [[UCS-2]] (the predecessor of [[UTF-16]]) assumes that all Unicode codepoints can be expressed as 16 [[bit]] numbers (U+FFFF or lower, the ''Basic Multilingual Plane''), problems may be encountered using the Gothic alphabet Unicode range and others outside of the ''Basic Multilingual Plane''.

'''Grave Orb''' is the name for a [[petrosphere]] that was put on the tomb of a deceased. Grave Orbs were made throughout [[Scandinavia]] from the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] until the [[Vendel era]].

The Grave Orb could have been selected for its round shape or shaped by hand. They were then put in the centre of a burial site. [[tumulus|Tumuli]], [[Stone circle (Iron Age)|stone circle]]s and [[stone ship]]s often have a reclined or raised central stone, and grave orbs derive from this practice.
They were of ritual or symbolic significance.

Some grave orbs are engraved with ornaments, such as the orb at ''Inglinge hög'' or  Barrow of Inglinge near [[Ingelstad]] in [[Småland]]. ''Hög'' is from the [[Old Norse]] word ''haugr'' meaning  mound or barrow.

[[Image:Scroll.jpg|200px|thumb|Scroll of the [[Book of Esther]], [[Seville]], [[Spain]]]]
A '''[[scroll]]''' (from the Old French ''escroe'' or ''escroue''), is a roll of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], or [[paper]] containing writing.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter. (2008) "scroll" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''history of scrolls''' dates back to ancient Egypt.  In most ancient literate cultures scrolls were the earliest format for longer documents written in ink or paint on a flexible background, preceding bound [[book]]s; rigid media such as [[clay tablet]]s were also used but had many disadvantages in comparison. For most purposes scrolls have long been superseded by the [[codex]] book format, but they are still produced for some ceremonial or religious purposes, notably for the Jewish [[Torah scroll]] for use in [[synagogue]]s.

==Origins in Africa==

Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s.

Parchment scrolls were used by several early civilizations before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with pages and was invented by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the 1st century AD{{fact|date=April 2018}}.  Nevertheless, scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.

==Eastern Mediterranean, West Asia and Europe==

===Israel===

The Hebrew tradition assumes that the [[Torah]] was copied by [[Moses]] onto a scroll (in about 1200 BCE) made from skin of a [[kosher]] animal, rather than [[papyrus]] as in Dynastic Egypt. Since there is no historical evidence for Moses and the events related in the Torah, there is no reliable way to know the time when Hebrews started using scrolls for their religious books.&lt;ref name="autogenerated99"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dever, William G. | title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It? | publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3}}p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jewish tradition, since that time scrolls, which are very durable with examples known to be hundreds of years old such as the 800-year-old Sephardic [[Sefer Torah]] from Spain, are copied from one to another.

The meticulous process of hand-copying a scroll takes about 2,000 person-hours (about one year at 40 hours per week). 

The Torah scroll contains 304,805 letters (or approximately 79,000 words). &lt;br /&gt;
Other books of the [[Tanakh]] are also written in scroll form, as well as the small [[mezuzah]] scrolls found in the door frames of most orthodox, conservative and reform Jewish households. Some Jewish families own their own [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] scroll for use during [[Purim]].

There is a difference between the [[Qere and Ketiv|כְּתִיב (''Ketiv'')]], what is and must be written (in consonantal text, with vowels omitted), and the קְרֵי (''Qere''), what is read.

===Syria and Babylon===

The Jewish communities in these countries used the same techniques to manufacture scrolls, but using deer skins. The scrolls from these areas were known for their quality and durability, and were later imported into European and Indian communities.

Non-Jewish vellum manufacturing also took place after the 3rd century BC.

===Greece and Rome===
{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''volumen''}}
[[File:Busto maschile.JPG|thumb|[[Roman portraiture]] fresco of a young man with a [[papyrus]] [[scroll]], from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century AD]]
Scrolls were used by the ancient Greeks. In Roman usage the scrolls were written latitudinally, usually placed on podiums with roll holders from which the rolls were unwound.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Romans eventually found the scroll too cumbersome for lengthy works and developed the [[codex]], which is the formal name for the modern style of book, with individual pages bound together.

===Early Christian era===

Scrolls continued to be used at times during the Early Church era until the [[Early Middle Ages]], but Christianity was an early adopter of the codex.  It is often thought that this reflects the background in trade of many early Christians, who were used to codex notebooks, and less attached to the form that was traditional among the Roman elite and religious Jews.

===European Middle Ages===

Scrolls virtually ceased to be used for books and documents in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], and were reintroduced for rare use in official treaties and other international documents of great significance during and after the Baroque Era of the 0th century. These were usually written on high quality vellum, and stored in elaborate silver and gold cases inscribed with names of participants. Earlier examples were written in Latin.  Scrolls continued in use for administrative and accounting purposes all over Europe. In English they were often referred to as "rolls", hence the [[Pipe rolls|Great Rolls]] of the English [[Exchequer]], and titles such as [[Master of the Rolls]] (a senior judge), still used in the 21st century.  The official copy of English, now British, legislation was still printed on vellum in a roll format and stored in the [[Palace of Westminster]] until 2017, when the use of Vellum was replaced with archival paper&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/21/anger-mps-bow-peers-pressure-end-500-year-old-tradition-printing/&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Exultet Scroll]] from Southern Italy and Byzantine [[Joshua Scroll]] were prestige objects that used the old form in a revivalist spirit.

===West and Central Asia===

Scrolls continued in use longer in the Islamic world, often elaborately decorated in calligraphic writing that included use of gold embossing and pigments when used for the writing of the Qur'an.

===East Asia===
{{see also|Hanging scroll|Handscroll}}

Scrolls continued in use longer in East Asian cultures like China, Korea and Japan.

The Chinese invented and perfected 'Indian Ink' for use in writing, including scrolls. Originally designed for blacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink invented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.){{fact|date=April 2018}}, became common by the year 1200 B.C.

Later other formats came into use in China, firstly the ''sutra'' or ''scripture'' binding, a scroll folded [[concertina]]-style, which avoids the need to unroll to find a passage in the middle.  By about 1,000 CE, sheet-based formats were introduced, although scrolls continued to have a place. Traditional [[painting]] and [[calligraphy]] in East Asia is often still performed on relatively short latitudinal paper scrolls displayed vertically as a [[hanging scroll]] on a wall or horizontally and flat as a [[handscroll]].

==Replacement by the ''Codex''==
The [[codex]] was a new format for reading the written word, consisting of individual pages loosely attached to each other at one side and bound with boards or cloth. It came to replace the scroll thanks to several problems that limited the scroll's function and readability. For one, scrolls were very long, sometimes as long as ten meters. This made them hard to hold open and read, a difficulty not helped by the fact that most scrolls in that era were read horizontally, instead of vertically as scrolling virtual documents are read now. The text on a scroll was continuous, without page breaks, which made indexing and bookmarking impossible. Conversely, the codex was easier to hold open, separate pages made it possible to index sections and mark a page, and the protective covers kept the fragile pages intact better than scrolls generally stayed. This last made it particularly attractive for important religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011) ''Books: A Living History.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that made the codex more attractive than the scroll was ease of copying. It was possible to hold open a codex with one hand and write notes- or copy the text- with the other. For early Christendom this was an invaluable asset, as the ability to mass reproduce their gospels was in high demand. Early Medieval Christians were some of the first to adopt the codex over the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Gary, [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v17/bp17-10.html "Adoption of the Codex Book: Parable of a New Reading Mode"], ''The Book and Paper Group Annual'', Retrieved 12/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll or roll by ten to one based on surviving examples, and by the sixth century the scroll had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other places the scroll lingered. As mentioned above, English monarchs used so called “statute rolls” to record important legislation until well into the Middle Ages. Scrolls were also commonly used in theater productions, a practice from which the term “actor’s roll” was coined.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011) ''Books: A Living History.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:Hanging scroll 7a33a8.jpg|thumb|[[Hanging scroll]]s of [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on display, [[Shanghai]]]]
Torah Scrolls are still used today in Jewish religious observance with almost insignificant changes despite the thousands of years in practice.

Some cultures use scrolls as ceremonial texts or for decoration—such as a [[hanging scroll]]—without any obvious division of the text into columns. In some scroll-using cultures painted illustrations were used as header decorations above the text columns, either in a continuous band or broken into scenes above either a single or double column of text.

One of the few modern texts the original of which was written on what is effectively a scroll is the manuscript of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'', typed onto what he called "the scroll", made of taped-together sheets of paper.

The verb "[[Scrolling|to scroll]]" is much used in the age of [[Display device|screen]] displays—[[computer]] displays, rolling [[Closing credits|credits]] in [[film]]s and so on—with the screen filled with text moving (scrolling) up or down or sideways, appearing at one edge of the display and disappearing at the other as if being unrolled from one side of a scroll and rolled up at the other.

{{other uses2|Horizon}}
In [[archaeology]], the general meaning of '''horizon''' is a distinctive type of sediment, artifact, style or other cultural trait that is found across a large geographical area, from a limited time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=horizon|title=Horizon|last=Kipfer|first=Barbara Ann|website=Archaeology Wordsmith|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term derives from similar ones in [[geology]], [[horizon (geology)|horizon]] or [[marker horizon]], but where these have natural causes, archaeological horizons are caused by man.  Most typically there is a change in the type of [[pottery]] found, and in the style of less frequent major artefacts.  Across a horizon the same type of artefact or style is found very widely over a large area, and it can be assumed that these traces are approximately contemporary.

In the [[archaeology of the Americas]] "Horizon" terminology, used as [[proper name]]s, has become used for schemes of periodization of major periods. "Horizons" are periods of cultural stability and political unity, with "Intermediate periods" covering the politically fragmented transition between them.  In the [[periodization of pre-Columbian Peru]] and the Central [[Andes]] there are three Horizon periods, with two Intermediate periods between them. The Horizons, and their dominant cultures are: Early Horizon, [[Chavín culture|Chavin]]; Middle Horizon, [[Tiwanaku]] and [[Wari culture]]; Late Horizon, [[Inca]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XGtFCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8 Daily Life in the Inca Empire], 2nd Edition, Michael A. Malpass, pp. 8-9; Essential Humanities. "History of Precolonial Meso/South America." Accessed 9 May 2017. [http://www.essential-humanities.net/world-history/meso-south-america/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same terms (Early, Middle and Late Horizons) are sometimes used for the [[List of archaeological periods (Mesoamerica)|Mesoamerican chronology]], though there the five stages defined by [[Gordon Willey]] and [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]] in 1958 remain dominant, and the [[Formative stage]], [[Classic stage]] and [[Post-Classic stage]] cover approximately similar periods.  More commonly lower-case horizons such as an "[[Olmec]] horizon" are referred to for the region.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, David C., in ''Latin American Horizons: A Symposium at Dumbarton Oaks, 11th and 12th October 1986'', pp. 83-111, 88 on Barbara Price's capitialized scheme, Dumbarton Oaks, 1993, {{ISBN|0884022072}}, 9780884022077[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k2uX2NnOH9EC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA88 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General== 
The term is used to denote a series of stratigraphic relationships that constitute a [[archaeological phase|phase]], or are part of the process of determining the archaeological phases of a site. An archaeological horizon can be understood as a break in contexts formed in the [[Harris matrix]], which denotes a change in epoch on a given site by delineation in time of finds found within [[Archaeological context|context]]s. 
 
An example of a horizon is the [[Dark earth|dark earth horizon]] in England, which separates Roman artefacts from medieval artefacts and which may indicate the abandonment of urban areas in Roman Britain during the 2nd to 5th centuries.  The term 'archaeological horizon' is sometimes, and somewhat incorrectly, used in place of the term [[Excavation (archaeology)#Stratification|layer]] or [[Stratigraphy|strata]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[File:Katharsis November 2008.JPG|upright|thumb|''Katharsis'' November 2008]]
'''''Katharsis''', A Critical Review in the Humanities and Social Sciences'', is a [[Hebrew]] [[periodical]] published twice a year and dedicated to detailed scholarly criticism of Hebrew publications in the [[Humanities]] and [[Social Studies]].

It is published and distributed by Carmel Publishing House, [[Jerusalem]]. ''Katharsis'' was established in 2004 by Mezaref, a non-profit-making society registered in Israel. The first editors were John Glucker, [[Doron Mendels]], and Moshe Shokeid.

Each issue opens &amp;ndash; following the table of contents and editorial &amp;ndash; by a 'programmatic' article criticizing some aspect of the manner in which study and research in the human disciplines are conducted in the Israeli academic world. Most of the main articles are 'review articles', dealing at length and in depth with books and articles in the Humanities and Social Studies published in Hebrew. The reviewers, experts in their respective  fields, analyse in detail the book or article under review, citing exemplary passages for discussion, and deal with the methods (or lack of them) employed (or ignored) by the authors. The main aim of ''Katharsis'' is to raise academic standards by exposing errors, distortions and wilful deceptions in sub-standard publications; but some of the reviews praise works of serious scholarship and hold them up as examples to be followed.
 
Each issue ends with the section Remembrance of Former Generations, which includes a critical article or two by one of the leading Israeli scholars of the past century, preceded by a survey of his life and an assessment of his contributions to knowledge. Each issue also has a number of short, 1&amp;ndash;2 page, 'pearls': quotations from books or articles pretending to present the reader with proper facts and explanations, while being full of basic errors. The editors explain what the errors are and what should have been written instead. At the back of each volume there is an [[English language|English]] title-page, and English summaries of the main articles.

The present [[editor in chief|editors]] are Yehuda Friedlander, John Glucker, [[Alon Harel]], Doron Mendels, and Amos Edelheit.

This is a '''list of World Heritage sites in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' as inscribed on the [[World Heritage site|World Heritage List]] of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). The [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia accepted the convention on 4 November 1992, making its sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2018, there are three World Heritage sites in Georgia, all of which are cultural sites.&lt;ref name=GE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ge/ |title=Georgia |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its inscribed sites, Georgia also maintains fifteen properties on its tentative list.&lt;ref name=GETent/&gt;

|Gelati Monastery, a masterpiece of the [[Georgian Golden Age]], was built in 1106 by [[David IV of Georgia|King David IV]] and was one of the main cultural and intellectual centers in Georgia throughout the Middle Ages. It had an Academy which employed some of the most celebrated Georgian scientists, theologians and philosophers, many of whom had previously been active at various orthodox monasteries abroad, one of which was the [[Mangan Academy]] in [[Constantinople]]. In 2010–2017, the site, also including the [[Bagrati Cathedral]], was listed as [[List of World Heritage in Danger|endangered]] due to the cathedral undergoing major reconstruction detrimental to its integrity and authenticity. In 2017, Bagrati Cathedral was removed from the World Heritage list and Gelati Monastery delisted from the endangered list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1692|title=Gelati Monastery, Georgia, removed from UNESCO’s List of World Heritage in Danger|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|date=|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/710 Bagrati Cathedral and Gelati Monastery] [[UNESCO]].

|The historic churches of Mtskheta, former capital of Georgia, are outstanding examples of medieval religious architecture in the Caucasus. They show the high artistic and cultural level attained by this ancient kingdom. The classification includes two of Georgia's most ancient religious structures: the [[Svetitskhoveli]] (Cathedral of the Living Pillar) and the [[Jvari Monastery]] (Monastery of the Cross), as well as the historical area of Mtskheta in which the two are situated. The monuments trace their origin to the dawn of Christianity in Georgia in the first half of the first millennium A.D. and were judged by UNESCO to be a testament of "the high artistic and cultural level attained by this ancient kingdom."

:''This article refers to a systematic corruption of a government by major organized crime syndicates. For the greater connotation that literally means "rule by thieves", see [[Kleptocracy]].''
{{political corruption sidebar}}
The term '''mafia state''' is a political [[buzzword]] to describe a [[Sovereign state|state]] system where the [[government]] is tied with [[organized crime]], including when government officials, [[police]], and/or [[military]] take part in [[Black market|illicit enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137529/moises-naim/mafia-states Mafia States: Organized Crime Takes Office] by Moisés Naím.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''mafia'' is a reference to any organized crime groups strongly connected with the authorities.

According to the critics of the mafia state concept, the term "has now been so used and abused in popularized descriptions of organized criminal activity that it has lost much of its analytic value".&lt;ref name=peter-andreas/&gt;

According to US diplomats, [[Alexander Litvinenko]] coined the phrase Mafia state.&lt;ref name="luhn-harding-guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/spain-issues-arrest-warrants-for-russian-officials-close-to-putin | date = 5 November 2015 | access-date = 27 April 2016 | first1 = Alec | last1 = Luhn | first2 = Luke | last2 = Harding | authorlink2 = Luke Harding | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = Spain issues arrest warrants for Russian officials close to Putin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Particular applications of the concept==

===[[Cosa Nostra]] in Italy and [[Yakuza]] in Japan===
[[File:Giulio Andreotti.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Giulio Andreotti]], seven-time [[Prime Minister of Italy]], was charged with having links to the Mafia]]
In a critical review of Moisés Naím's essay in ''[[Foreign Affairs (journal)|Foreign Affairs]]'', Peter Andreas pointed to the long existence of Italian mafia and Japanese [[Yakuza]], writing that there were close relationships between those illicit organisations and respective governments.&lt;ref name=peter-andreas&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreas |first=Peter |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137692/peter-andreas-moises-naim/measuring-the-mafia-state-menace |title=Measuring the Mafia-State Menace: Are Government-Backed Gangs a Grave New Threat? |publisher=Foreignaffairs.com |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andreas, these examples speak against incidences of mafia states as a historically new threat.&lt;ref name=peter-andreas/&gt;

In Italy, the actions of the mafia can continue to affect people's lives today. The Italian "Camorra" Mafia network became powerful in the city of [[Naples]] in the 19th Century; although it can trace its origins back to 15th Century Spain and today extending its influence to European countries above Italy as well. The Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta both as well existed in Italy with a confederation of about 150 different groups each with their own organizations and ruling body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Letizia|first1=Paoli|title=Oxford Handbook of Italian Politics|date=May 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199669745|pages=670–671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the network, known as the "[[Casalesi clan]]" became involved in business in the 1970s and 80s, eventually gaining control of large areas of the local economy "partly by manipulating politicians and intimidating judges". Among the contracts the clan gained was for the disposal of toxic waste, however, much of it was dumped illegally. This dumped toxic waste is thought to be cause of a rise in the number suffering from cancer in towns around Naples. The rise was first noticed two decades ago, and has been calculated that there has been a 40 and 47 per cent increase in cancer in women and men respectively. The Italian Senate is currently investigating the causes of the cancers, with illegal dumping thought to be the likely cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24678624 | work=BBC News | title=The toxic reason a mafia boss became a police informant | date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries described as Mafia states===

====Republics and territories of the former Yugoslavia====

[[Kosovo]], a partially recognised independent state formerly part of Serbia, was called a "mafia state" by Italian MEP [[Pino Arlacchi]] in 2011,&lt;ref name=b92.net&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=72906 |title=Kosovo is "mafia state", says Italian MEP |publisher=B92.net |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by [[Moisés Naím]] in his 2012 essay "Mafia States" in the ''[[Foreign Affairs (journal)|Foreign Affairs]]''. Naím pointed out that [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]] [[Hashim Thaçi]] is allegedly connected to the heroin trade. Many other crime allegations have been made, and investigated by several countries, against Thaçi.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Transnistria]], an [[diplomatic recognition|unrecognised]] break-away state from [[Moldova]], has long been described by journalists, researchers, politicians and diplomats as a [[quasistate]] whose economy is dependent on [[contraband]]&lt;ref name="An illegal business "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bne.eu/archive_story.php?id=3467&amp;words[]=contraband&amp;words[]=moldova | title=An illegal business that's smoking | publisher=[[Business New Europe]] | date=2012-04-18 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gunrunning]].&lt;ref name="Ющенко"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://korrespondent.net/business/149005-yushchenko-ukraina-nedopoluchaet-iz-za-kontrabandy-iz-pridnestrovya | title=Ющенко: Украина недополучает из-за контрабанды из Приднестровья | publisher=[[Korrespondent]] | date=23 March 2006 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hotbed "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/jan/18/20040118-103519-5374r/ | title=Hotbed of weapons deals | publisher=[[The Washington Times]] | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Приднестровье самоизолировалось"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/656240 |title=Приднестровье самоизолировалось |work=Kommersant-Ukraine |date=2006-10-03 |accessdate=3 September 2013 |author1=СВИРИДЕНКО, АЛЕКСАНДР |author2=НЕПРЯХИНА, НАТАЛИЯ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191045/http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/656240 |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in 2002, Moldova's president, [[Vladimir Voronin]], called Transnistria a "residence of international mafia", "smuggling stronghold" and "outpost of [[Islamism|Islamic combatants]]". The allegations were followed by attempts of customs blockade. Reacting to the allegations, [[Russia]]n state-run [[Russia-1 (TV channel)|RTR]] aired an investigative program revealing that Transnistrian firms were conducting industrial-level manufacturing of [[small arms]] purposely for subsequent [[arms trafficking|illegal trafficking]] via the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] port of [[Odessa]]. According to the program, the trade was controlled by and benefited from Transnistria's founder and then-ruler [[Igor Smirnov]].&lt;ref name="ДНЕСТРОВСКИЕ ПОРОГИ"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://gazeta.zn.ua/POLITICS/dnestrovskie_porogi.html | script-title=ru:ДНЕСТРОВСКИЕ ПОРОГИ | work=[[Zerkalo Nedeli]] | date=February 8, 2002 | accessdate=2 January 2014 | author=Bulavchenko, Aliona | language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent investigations and monitoring missions did not prove continuity in [[arms trafficking]] concerns. According to regular reports of the European Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM), there have been no signs of significant weapons smuggling from Transnistria.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} During the press-conference on 30 November 2006 head of EUBAM Ferenc Banfi officially stated that organised smuggling of weapons in Transnistria did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyWih4cCCc8 Fragment of EUBAM press-conference regarding Mission activities in 2004-2006] Transnistrian Customs Committee Press-Service.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Ukrainian Foreign Minister and acting chairman of the OSCE Leonid Kozhara gave an interview to ''El País'' newspaper, commenting on situation in Transnistria and results of work of the EUBAM mission. According to Kozhara, there have been no cases of arms traffic found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2013/06/04/actualidad/1370334170_344660.html Queremos zonas de libre comercio tanto al Este como hacia el Oeste] El Pais. 4 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts from Russia and Transnistria state that allegations of Transnistria being a "mafia state", "black hole of Europe", "heaven for arms trafficking", etc. are a carefully planned defamation campaign paid by the Moldovan government and aimed at producing negative image of Transnistria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://customs-science.net/?p=85 Some aspects of administrative legal regime of customs activities of Transnistria in context of work of international monitoring missions] Customs and Science. 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials from the [[European Union]] and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]), say they have no evidence that the Tiraspol regime has ever trafficked arms or nuclear material. Much of the alarm is attributed to efforts by the Moldovan government to increase pressure on Transdniester.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/1062030.html Moldova: Western Diplomats Say Reports Of Smuggling From Transdniester Likely Exaggerated] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

====Russia====
The term has been used by [[defector]] [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and some Western media to describe the [[political system]] in [[Russia]] under [[Vladimir Putin]]'s rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17200833 Putin's Russia 'now a mafia state'], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11893886 Wikileaks: Russia branded 'mafia state' in cables], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/24/115524 British MPs paint scary picture of Putin's Russia], [[EUObserver]]&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization came to prominence following the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], which revealed that US diplomats viewed Russia as "a [[corruption|corrupt]], [[Autocracy|autocratic]] [[kleptocracy]] centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which officials, [[Russian oligarchs|oligarchs]] and [[organised crime]] are bound together to create a 'virtual [[Russian mafia|mafia]] state.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-cables-russia-mafia-kleptocracy WikiLeaks cables condemn Russia as 'mafia state'], [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334865/WikiLeaks-Putin-probably-knew-Alexander-Litvinenko-poisoning.html 'Mafia state' leader Putin knew of poison plot that killed former KGB spy in London], [[Daily Mail]]&lt;/ref&gt; In his book titled ''[[Mafia State (book)|Mafia State]]'', journalist and author [[Luke Harding]] argues that Putin has "created a state peopled by ex-[[KGB]] and [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] officers, like himself, [who are] bent on making money above all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3329930.htm Expelled Moscow correspondent claims Russia is mafia state], abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt; In the estimation of American diplomats, "the government [of Russia] effectively [is] the mafia."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/world/europe/02wikileaks-russia.html?pagewanted=2 Below Surface, U.S. Has Dim View of Putin and Russia], [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-751968 Russia - Mafia State: It's important to tell the truth about Putin's Russia], [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Holmes, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n01/stephen-holmes/fragments-of-a-defunct-state Fragments of a Defunct State], [[London Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[New Statesman]]'', "the term had entered the lexicon of expert discussion" several years before the cables leak, "and not as a frivolous metaphor. Those most familiar with the country had come to see it as a kleptocracy with Vladimir Putin in the role of ''[[capo di tutti capi]]'', dividing the spoils and preventing [[wikt:turf war|turf war]]s between rival clans of an essentially criminal elite."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/10/russia-mafia-harding-putin Review: Mafia State], [[New Statesman]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Stephen Blank noted that Russia under Putin is "a state that European officials privately call a Mafia state" that "naturally gravitates toward Mafia-like behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Blank (2008): What Comes After the Russo–Georgian War? What's at Stake in the CIS, ''[[National Committee on American Foreign Policy|American Foreign Policy Interests]]'', 30:6, 379–391&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikolay Petrov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said "it's pretty hard to damage the Russian image in the world because it's already not very good".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121223084127/http://www.euronews.com/2010/12/02/putin-russia-s-mafia-state-image-no-disaster Russia’s "mafia state" image no disaster], euronews&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}
'''Medieval stained glass''' is the coloured and painted glass of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] from the 10th century to the 16th century. For much of this period [[stained glass]] windows were the major pictorial art form, particularly in [[France in the Middle Ages|northern France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] and [[England in the Middle Ages|England]], where windows tended to be larger than in southern Europe (in [[Italy]], for example, [[fresco]]s were more common).

Stained glass windows were used predominantly in churches, but were also found in wealthy domestic settings and public buildings such as town halls, though surviving examples of secular glass are very rare indeed.  The purpose of stained glass windows in a church was both to enhance the beauty of their setting and to inform the viewer through narrative or symbolism. The subject matter was generally religious in churches, though "portraits" and [[heraldry]] are often included, and many narrative scenes give valuable insights into the medieval world.

==History ==
[[File:Süddeutscher Glasmaler 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The prophet Daniel from Augsburg Cathedral (c. 1065)]]

=== Early stained glass ===
Window glass was in use from at least the 1st century AD and colored and painted window glass for use in religious buildings was also manufactured at an early date. The earliest extant example of ecclesiastical stained glass is possibly that from San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. A clear glass roundel with a depiction of Christ in Majesty, thought to be the 6th century, was discovered here.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest known examples of colored window glass, datable to c. 800–820, were recovered in excavations at the Abbey of San Vicenzo in Volturno, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Glass of the same colour ranges and similar date is also found in England, at the monastic sites of [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow and Monkwearmouth]], and at other sites in the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 1992, 175&lt;/ref&gt; These examples are not painted. However, it was not until the advent of the monumental cathedral and church building campaigns in the 11th and 12th centuries that the demand for colored glass began to increase significantly, reaching its highest level in the 14th and 15th centuries. The oldest surviving stained glass windows still ''in situ'' are thought to be the Prophet Windows in [[Augsburg Cathedral]], of c. 1065.

A useful 12th-century source on medieval glass manufacture is the ''De Divers Artibus'' of [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk, believed by some scholars to be [[Roger of Helmarshausen]], a metal glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Divers Artibus'' describes a number of craft processes including glassmaking and glassworking.

In the 9th century, CE or earlier (books 1 and 2 of a 3-vol Mss. completed by another in the 12th, Eraclius, in ''De coloribus et artibus Romanorum'', also gives an account of methods for producing colored glass, although he may have copied much of his text from the ''Naturalis Historia'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] of c. 77AD.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Encyclopedia of the arts, separately CS Smith and JG Hawthorne, translation of the Mappe Clavicula – introduction p4, Transactions of the American Phil. Soc., VOL 64 PT.4 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Now considered 'Inaccurate' date on works of Eraclius&lt;ref&gt;Heyworth 1992, 169&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the medieval period  the son of Anthony of Pisa, artist and instructor [[Cennino Cennini]], and, in 1556, Georgius Agricola&lt;ref&gt;1st ed De Re Metallica, as translated by (President) Herbert C. and (1st Lady) Lou Henry Hoover, The Mining Magazine, London, 1912, reprinted 1950 by the Dover Press, NY&lt;/ref&gt; also contributed texts with aspects of glassmaking and glassworking.

==Composition, manufacture and distribution ==

Prior to c. 1000, most coloured glass was of a soda-lime-silica composition. In Northern Europe soda glass was eventually almost totally superseded by potash-lime-silica glass ([[Forest glass]]). Forest glass continued to be used in stained glass for the duration of the medieval period&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; until soda glass again began to be used in the 16th century.

The potash (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) found in [[Forest Glass]] was derived from wood ash. In ''De Divers Artibus'', Theophilus describes the use of beech wood as the preferred source of ash.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne ''et al'' (eds.) 1979, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Other plant matter, such as bracken, was also used.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 57&lt;/ref&gt; As well as containing potash, beech ash comprises an assortment of compounds including iron and manganese oxides, which are particularly important for generating colour in glass.

Medieval stained glass panels could be created either by the [[cylinder blown sheet]] or [[crown glass (window)]] method.

Forest glass was manufactured in Burgundy and Lorraine near the Rhein; in Flanders; and in Normandy, in the Seine and Loire Valleys. It was distributed throughout mainland north-west Europe and Britain in the form of ready-made sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 266&lt;/ref&gt; The application of painted decoration to and final shaping of the sheets was carried out at glass working centres close by the final destination of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
{{main|Glass colour}}
The colour of glass could be affected by many factors. Sources of silica were often impure, with [[iron oxide]] being one of the most common impurities. The greenish hue of uncoloured glass is usually owing to the presence of a mixture of ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and ferric (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions in the glass matrix. It is also possible that ‘impurities’ could be introduced at the fritting stage within the glass furnace, leading to the addition of further alumina, [[silica]] and iron oxides.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inherent colour====

Inherent colour refers to the colours that may be formed in the molten glass by manipulating the furnace environment. Theophilus describes molten glass changing to a ‘saffron yellow colour’ which will eventually transform to a reddish yellow on further heating, he also refers to a ‘tawny colour, like flesh’ which, upon further heating will become ‘a light purple’ and later ‘a reddish purple, and exquisite’.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

These colour changes are the result of the behaviour, under redox conditions, of the iron and [[manganese oxide]]s which are naturally present in beech wood ash.

In the glass melt the iron and manganese behave as follows:

In an oxidising environment metal (and some non-metal) ions will lose electrons. In iron oxides, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferrous) ions will become Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferric) ions. In molten glass this will result in a change in glass colour from pale blue to yellow/brown. In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a pink glass.

As the manganese and iron may each be in different states of oxidation, the combination of the two can result in a broad range of attractive colours. Manganese in its fully oxidised state, if not present in too great a mass, will also act as a decolourant of glass if the iron is in its yellow, ferric form. The two colours in effect cancel each other out to produce a clear glass.

Experimental manufacture of potash glass emulating Theophilus’ recipes has resulted in colours ranging from colourless to yellow, amber, brown, green, blue, pink and purple.&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1978, 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Variation in colour hue and depth would also probably be affected by the source of the beech wood ash, depending on the soil chemistry where the beech tree grew, the age of the tree and the climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 143&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some of the stronger reds, blues and greens that are a feature of medieval stained glass rely on the addition of [[Copper oxide (disambiguation)|copper oxide]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

====Deliberately added colourants====

[[File:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|thumb|Detail of a panel from [[Chartres Cathedral]]]]
[[File:England YorkMinster JesseTree c1170.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Jesse Tree panel from [[York Minster]]]]

Eraclius’ ''De Coloribus et Artibus'' includes instructions for creating green and red glass by adding copper (probably in the form of ore or copper filings) to the batch, a method practiced since ancient times.  (The chapters on how to make red, green and blue glass are missing from ''De Divers Artibus''.)
As with the iron/manganese colours, the colours formed by the addition of copper oxide to the glass are dependent on the different oxidation states of the added copper. In an oxidising environment blue cupric (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions are formed, in a strongly reducing environment red colloidal cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide is formed and if reoxidised then green cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide results.

The production of bright reds and blues in particular was straightforward, as the addition of copper to the mix resulted in the reliable creation of red, blue and green. The dominance of red and blue in Romanesque and Gothic glass is obvious. However, at York Minster, for example, it was demonstrated that 90% of the medieval glass was coloured by means of iron/manganese content.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 740&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval blue soda glass====

Early medieval glass was soda-based, and although the use of soda glass in Northern Europe was almost wholly superseded by [[forest glass]] after c. 1000, there are some examples of a richly coloured blue glass (identified through [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] analysis) that was produced in the medieval period using soda as the alkali.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a considerable quantity of blue soda glass has been identified in stained glass from York Minster, and in excavations at Old Sarum and Winchester. In France, in Chartres Cathedral and St Denis in Paris, soda glass has also been found,&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 58&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt there must be many other examples.

Evidence of recycling [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[Mosaic|tesserae]] to produce window glass in the 9th century has been identified at the Benedictine Monastery of San Vincenzo, Molise, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 743&lt;/ref&gt; Theophilus, in the 12th century, was also aware of such practice. He states that mosaic tesserae: ‘little square stones’ from ‘ancient pagan buildings’ along with ‘various small vessels in the same colours’ could be used to produce glass: ‘they even melt the blue in their furnaces, adding a little of the clear white to it, and they make from it blue glass sheets which are costly and very useful in windows.’&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theophilus, the French were particularly skilled at this process.

Cox suggests that the examples analysed at York could indeed be ‘Roman, or slightly later, glass re-melted in France and imported into England’.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flashing====
Glass comprising multiple layers of clear and (usually) red glass was known to exist in the 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the [[cylinder blown sheet]] process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Azzoni et al 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied paint and silver stain===
[[Image:silver stain.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail showing use of applied paint and silver stain.]]

====Paint====
The paint applied to glass was a type of enamel, usually dark brown or black, formed from a mixture of: ground copper or iron oxide; powdered glass; wine, urine or vinegar; and gum arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 273&lt;/ref&gt; other recipes could include sugar, treacle or vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 132&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘paint’ was applied in a series of washes, with fine details added last. Both the external and internal faces of the glass could be painted, adding depth to the overall composition. The enamel was fixed by ‘firing’ the glass in an annealing oven.

====Silver stain====
Producing a strong clear yellow could be difficult in early stained glass as it relied upon the careful control of furnace conditions in order to create the appropriate reducing or oxidising environment.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of silver stain in the early 14th century not only provided a solution to this difficulty, but also allowed greater flexibility in the way in which colour could be used. The first datable example of the use of silver stain is in the parish church of Le Mesnil-Villeman, Manche, France (1313).&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Silver stain was a combination of [[silver nitrate]] or [[silver sulphide]] blended with pipe clay and applied to (usually) clear glass.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 133&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique enabled a more flexible approach to glass painting, allowing, for example, the hair of a figure to be painted on the same piece of glass as the head. It was also used to highlight details of canopywork or grisaille, and later it was added to the surface of coloured glass, to create a wider variety of glass hues.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Arthur Evans]] developed a relative dating scheme of '''Minoan chronology''' based on the excavations initiated and managed by him at the site of the ancient city of [[Knossos]]. He called the civilization that he discovered there [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]. The same scheme was later applied to the [[Greece|Greek]] mainland and the [[Cyclades]] Islands to form a general plan for dating events of the prehistoric and early historic [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. The relative chronology is based on the shapes and decorative styles of [[Minoan pottery]] found at many sites on [[Crete]] and elsewhere.

==Evans and Knossos==
[[Arthur Evans]] began excavating on a hill called ''tou tseleve he [[kephala]]'', "the headland of the chieftain", some three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the north coast of [[Crete]], on March 23, 1900. Two of the palace storerooms had been uncovered by Minos Kalokairinos in 1878, whose work ceased at the demand of the land owners. Simultaneously, coins and [[Seal (device)|seal]]s inscribed with a mysterious script were also discovered. These came to Evans' attention as the curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford]], a position he held from 1884 to 1908. The area was rumored to have been the site of the ancient city of [[Knossos]].

Evans examined the site on March 19, 1894. Nothing further could be done at that time, but in 1898 Crete became an independent republic. In 1899 Evans purchased the land with his own funds (his family had been factory owners in industrial Britain) and decided to set up an excavation. In the first two weeks he discovered the [[Linear A]] tablets, a streak of luck exceeded only by [[Carl Blegen]]'s legendary first day's dig at [[Pylos]], when he uncovered the Pylos tablets, written in [[Linear B]], a script also found at Kephala and named by Evans.

Attacking the site with crews of hundreds of diggers, Evans uncovered most of the site's {{convert|6|acre|m2}} within 6 seasons. By 1905 he had named the civilization whose traces he found there ''Minoan'', after the legendary king [[Minos]], and had created a detailed chronology of the serial phases of the pottery styles in Minoan Crete, based on what he found at [[Knossos]]. Subsequently he concerned himself mainly with restoration, an activity frowned upon by archaeologists of today. He continued to excavate there and elsewhere and to restore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webfea-lb.fea.aub.edu.lb/arch121/Aegean%20Art/page4.htm |title=Page 4 |publisher=Webfea-lb.fea.aub.edu.lb |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1935.

Evans was knighted in 1911 for his work. In 1921, the first edition of his monumental work, ''Palace of Minos'', was released, which became indispensable for any department of classical archaeology. On Evans' death in 1941, the British School of Archaeology assumed responsibility for the excavation, later turning the property over to the Greek government, while retaining excavation rights.

==Evans' chronology==
Evans' chronological framework had triple divisions each triply divided, a formula that has been retained, thus Early Minoan (EM) I, II and III, Middle Minoan (MM) I, II and III etc. Each subsection he divided into A and B, early and late. In 1918 [[Alan Wace|Alan J. B. Wace]] and [[Carl Blegen]] adapted Evans' chronology to the Greek mainland and the islands, where the culture was termed [[Helladic]] and [[Cycladic]]. In 1941 [[Arne Furumark]] applied the term Mycenaean to LH and LC. As it is clear that the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] dominated at Knossos at some point in Late Minoan (LM), the latter is often included under "Mycenaean" or called "Minoan-Mycenaean".
&lt;!---bunko: Usefully conceptualized in this artificially rigid serial organization, actual ceramics show blends of styles, either attesting gradual shifts in style or the conservative instincts of apprenticeship-trained potters and their patrons.--&gt;

The major study of Cretan pottery was Evans'. A very general stylistic trend was from dark decoration on a light background in the Early Minoan to white and red decorations on a dark wash or [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] in Middle Minoan. Finally, there was a return to the earlier manner of [[dark on light]] in Late Minoan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinclair Hood]], ''The Home of the Heroes: The Aegean before the Greeks'', 1975, {{ISBN|0-500-29009-1}}, Chapter 3, ''Dating the Bronze Age''.&lt;/ref&gt; New body shapes for vessels also emerged and various styles of decoration are evident within Evans' chronology.

Evans never intended to give exact calendrical dates to the pottery periods. He did correlate them roughly&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061206131707/http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/RA/HJK/HJKX.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; to better dated Egyptian periods using finds of Egyptian artifacts in association with Cretan ones and obvious similarities of some types of Cretan artifacts with Egyptian ones. Subsequent investigators checking Evans' work varied the dates of some of the periods a little, usually less than a few hundred years, but the chronological structure remains basically as Evans left it, a solid framework for placing events of Aegean prehistory.

Most criticism does not aim at the overthrow of Evans' system, but only complains that it does not capture all the data, such as local variations. Even with these faults the system has no competitors. In 1958 [[Nikolaos Platon]] proposed a new chronology at the Prehistoric Conference in Hamburg. In it, the terms "Pre-palace", "Old Palace" and "New Palace" were to replace Evans' scheme. The academic community accepted the scheme but not the replacement, simply stating where in Evans' system the new terms fit.

The one serious question&lt;ref&gt;There are many questions, of course, but this one persists and would overthrow an important part of Evans' chronology. A brief review can be found at the Stanford [http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/123 Archaeopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216052913/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/123 |date=2006-12-16 }} site.&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the date of the Knossos tablets. Allegations were made that Evans falsified the stratum in which the tablets were found to place the tablets at 1400 BCE when they ought to have been the same date as the Pylos tablets, 1200 BCE. This dispute became known as the [[Palmer-Boardman Dispute]] when it first appeared. Despite the intense debate that developed on the subject no conclusive evidence has yet been found to settle the question. A key part of the case was that a certain kind of vase, a stirrup jar (named from the handles) found in tablet contexts, is dated only to 1200. Other archaeologists hastened to the journalistic scene with instances of similar jars going back to 1400. The search for closure goes on. By default, archaeologists tend to use Evans' dating.

!'''Other names'''
!'''Relative chronology'''&lt;ref&gt;It is well-nigh impossible to peruse several books and articles on Crete and come up with anything like a uniform chronology. The underlying reason is no doubt that the time windows of the artifacts are not uniform. Some sites did not experience the full complement of periods; one period got extended over more than one elsewhere. The dates of the periods are not the same everywhere. The utility of a scheme such as Evans' becomes evident in a context such as this. It might be viewed as a median chronological framework.&lt;/ref&gt;
!'''Conventional dates, BCE'''&lt;ref&gt;The dates given below are a sampling from the noted works listed in the ''References'' section below. Many samples of other noted works might be selected with little likelihood of finding the same dates, but they would tend to vary about Evans' relative chronology. Note also that some of the authors, such as Hutchinson, revised their dates as part of the ongoing process of discovery. Even in different chapters of the same book the reader will find the same period dated differently by the same author.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the authors from Evans on recognize that some areas of the palaces found religious uses. On the other hand the throne rooms and private quarters tend to support the "great king" idea.

|Palaces were so destroyed by an earthquake ca. 1700 that they had to be rebuilt. This is the dividing line between Old and New Palace and between II and III.&lt;ref&gt;The events of course are not quite so simple. There was more than one earthquake. Old Palace at Knosses seems to have gone on modified until the middle of IIIA. There is some equivocation also about what building activities constitute "old" and "new", as earthquakes in Crete were frequent and rebuilding ongoing. The transition from old to new should not be regarded as any sharp event. The quest for precision goes on.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NBC Page Program''' is a 12-month paid fellowship at the  [[NBCUniversal|National Broadcasting Company (NBCUninversal)]]'s studios in New York City and [[Universal City, California]]. Over the course of one year, pages gain exposure to various areas of the NBCUniversal portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pageprogram.nbcunicareers.com/|title=NBCUniversal Page Program {{!}} NBC Universal Page Program|website=pageprogram.nbcunicareers.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pages contribute to various teams while on business, consumer and content assignments. East Coast pages also give tours and work in audience services at [[NBC Studios (New York City)|NBC Studios]] in New York City. The internship is extremely competitive and prestigious; notable people who began their careers as NBC pages include [[Regis Philbin]], [[Michael Eisner]], [[Ted Koppel]] and [[Aubrey Plaza]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Lacey|title=21 NBC Pages Turned Hollywood Players Tell All: Johnny Carson Sightings, Calls From the President, TV Cameos|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/21-nbc-pages-turned-hollywood-players-tell-all-johnny-carson-sightings-calls-president-tv-c|accessdate=April 11, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:NBC Page giving tour in 2009.jpg|thumb|NBC Page giving a tour in 2009 at  [[Rockefeller Center]].]]
The Page Program is the longest-running franchise under NBC. NBC began the page program in 1933 at its [[Rockefeller Center]] headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cCUbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jksEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2057,997741&amp;dq=goodman+ace&amp;hl=en|title=Radio Chiefs Train Studio Guides For Bigger Posts In Broadcasting|author=Steinhauser, Si|date=8 May 1935|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; later expanding it to the West Coast studios in Universal City. In the 1950s, NBC also offered page positions at their [[owned-and-operated station]]s, such as [[WRC-TV|WRC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] where future ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' personality [[Willard Scott]] was an NBC page.
 
Selection is highly competitive, with only 212 pages selected a year out of more than 16,000&amp;nbsp;applicants.&lt;ref name="Page Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcunicareers.com/page-program|website=NBCUniversal Careers|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With around 1.5 percent of applicants accepted to the program, becoming an NBC page is more competitive than gaining admission to [[Ivy League]] universities.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/campus-overload/post/life-of-an-nbc-page-isnt-quite-like-30-rock/2011/05/11/AFiTX00G_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jenna | last=Johnson | title=Life of an NBC page isn't quite like ‘30 Rock' | date=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past pages describe the interview process as grueling, as the company seeks the best corporate image to present to the public.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/nyregion/14page.html|title=For NBC Pages, 'Please Follow Me' Is a Fervent Wish|last1=Buckley|first1=Cara|date=October 13, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pages regularly get to work on such programs as ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Pages also rotate through assignments in public relations (PR), marketing, development, TV  music services, and production in a variety of shows and special projects. Many pages go on to careers with NBC or other broadcast media and a number have become celebrities or leaders of the industry in their own right.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the NBC sitcom ''[[30 Rock]]'', produced by former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' head writer [[Tina Fey]], [[Jack McBrayer]] portrays a zealous, smiling, do-good NBC page named [[Kenneth Parcell]], who appears as a page through the show's seven seasons despite pages usually only being employed for a year.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"/&gt; And while pages are usually in their 20s, it is a running joke on the show that Kenneth is unrealistically old (indeed, that he is [[immortality|immortal]])  based on his looks. (For example, in Season 5's "When it Rains, it Pours", Kenneth is seen nostalgically packing away a signed photograph of [[Fred Allen]] from 1947, dedicated: "Kenneth, you're the TOPS!" into a box marked "NBC Memories 1945-1967".)

'''Nancy Currier Dorian''' is an American [[linguistics|linguist]] who has carried out research into the decline of the [[East Sutherland Gaelic|East Sutherland dialect]] of [[Scottish Gaelic]] for over 40 years, particularly in the villages of [[Brora]], [[Golspie]] and [[Embo]]. Due to their isolation from other Gaelic-speaking communities, these East Sutherland villages presented a good opportunity to study [[language death]]. Dorian's study is possibly the longest such study in the field. She is considered "a prime authority" on language death.{{sfn|Drechsel|1990|p=554}} ''Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect'', her study into the decline of Gaelic in East Sutherland, is considered "the first major monograph"{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=432}} on language death. According to linguist Joan Argenter, Dorian's name "is well known to scholars working in" several areas of linguistics.{{sfn|Argenter|2015|p=331}}

[[File:ScotlandGaelic2001.gif|thumb|According to the 2001 census, between 2% and 4% of the population of East Sutherland spoke Gaelic.]]

Nancy Dorian was born in [[Brunswick, Maine]] in 1936.{{sfn|none|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/en/person/6589 |title=Nancy Dorian |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Tobar an Dualchais]] |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied German at the [[Connecticut College for Women]] and graduated [[summa cum laude]] in 1958. She received an MA (1961) and PhD (1965) from the [[University of Michigan]] and taught linguistics and German at [[Bryn Mawr College]] from 1965 to 1989, and also taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Kiel]]. Dorian is now a [[professor emeritus]] at Bryn Mawr.{{sfn|Dorian|2017|p=1}} She is a [[Unitarian Universalist]]; her hymn ''Dear Weaver of our Lives' Design'' won a prize for celebrating feminine imagery of the divine.{{sfn|none|p=9}}

Dorian first noticed the Gaelic language while conducting fieldwork for the [[Linguistic Survey of Scotland]] in 1963.{{sfn|Wolfram|2011|p=904}} Noting that a declining localized speech form offered a chance to find out what sorts of changes took place as a speech form passed out of use, she began a long-term study of variation and change in [[East Sutherland Gaelic]].{{sfn|Dorian|2001|p=142}}  When Dorian started studying the dialect, there were still more than 200 speakers in [[Brora]], [[Golspie]] and [[Embo]], including 105 in Embo, where they were more than a third of the population.{{sfn|Duwe|2012|pp=20-21}} Although traditional practice calls for anthropologists to change fieldwork settings, health challenges led Dorian to continue study of East Sutherland language development, a situation that had the beneficial side effect of producing a study of unprecedented scope and continuity.{{sfn|Wolfram|2011|p=904}}{{sfn|Dorian|2014|pp=3, 23, 25}} Previous researchers had focused on the NORM (non-mobile old rural male) speakers, who had more conservative language, at the expense of the wider speech community.&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celtic academics from across the world prepare for major conference |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2015/july/headline_412294_en.html |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] |accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=en, gd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She coined the term "semi-speaker" for those, mostly from the younger generations, who could speak Gaelic but imperfectly.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web |last1=McEwan-Fujita |first1=Emily |title=Nancy Dorian's "Greatest Hits" |url=https://gaelic.co/book-review-dorian-2014/ |website=Gaelic.co |accessdate=7 September 2018 |date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her attention to the way that speech competence develops differently in endangered and obsolete languages led socio-linguists to take an interest in understanding different [[speaker types]] and their relations to the process of language shift and language shift reversal. Dorian criticized researchers who focused narrowly on single speakers, which conveniently ignored the variation between speakers.{{sfn|McEwan-Fujita|2015|p=431}}&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt;

Her book ''The Tyranny of Tide: An Oral History of the East Sutherland Fisherfolk'' blurred the lines between linguistics and ethnology, revealing how these fields help illuminate and complement each other.{{sfn|H.|1988|p=622}}

==Notable works==
===''Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect'' (1981)===
Dorian published sixteen years of research on East Sutherland Gaelic as ''Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect''.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=227}} According to a review by [[Wolfgang U. Dressler]], it was "the first major monograph" on language death.{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=432}} In the view of Professor Tracy Harris and Suzanne Romaine, it was the most comprehensive work on the subject that had been published; Harris also stated that it was "a great contribution to the field of linguistics".{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=227, 229}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=272}} Dressler wrote that "[i]t would take too long to describe all the praiseworthy aspects of this book",{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=433}} and that it was "indispensible" to scholars of language death.{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=434}} Romaine highlighted the multidisciplinary perspective with which Dorian had approached her work, producing a book that would appeal to [[ethnographers]], [[sociologists]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic scholars]], [[history of Scotland|historians of Scotland]], and a wide range of linguists, including those specializing in [[sociolinguistics]], [[historical linguistics]], and [[syntax]].{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}}

Dorian identified some counterintuitive ways in which language shift was functioning in East Sutherland, noting that the Gaelic language was able to adapt to modern life even while becoming moribund. No [[diglossia]] developed, because speakers were able to borrow words from English and apply them to any discussion, even for highly technical topics.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=228}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=276}} She was able to classify speakers as "older fluent speakers", "younger fluent speakers", and "semi-speakers", describing the linguistic differences between each speaker type.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Her finding that the socioeconomically homogeonous community was characterized by a high degree of variation between speakers was later elaborated in her 2010 book ''Investigating Variation: The Effects of Social Organization and Social Setting''.{{sfn|Wolfram|2011|pp=904-905}} Certain types of syntactic distinctions, such as [[grammatical gender]], [[case (linguistics)|case markings]], and the two [[passive voice|passive constructions]], were lost gradually, rather than erased wholesale, as some theoreticians had predicted.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=274}} Dorian did not find the same types of linguistic changes which were thought to mark endangered languages.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=229}} 

She postulated that the type of [[language change|change]] in endangered languages was the same as in healthy languages, but the rate of change was greatly accelerated;{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=275}} the defining features of an endangered language were sociolinguistic rather than structural.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=229}} Her research showed that the exclusion of Gaelic from the school curriculum was a major factor in its decline, because it reduced the number of opportunities to use Gaelic and cemented its lower status and "usefulness" in the eyes of the community.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=228}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Another important factor, Dorian found, was the presence of prosperous English-speaking incomers which caused the poorer Gaelic speakers to connect the English language with economic success.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Later research showed that the features that Dorian identified for Sutherland Gaelic's decline also applied to many other obsolescent languages.{{sfn|Aitchison|1991|p=293}}

===''Investigating Obsolescence: Studies in Language Contraction and Death'' (1989)===
Dorian was inspired to organize this collection of essays when she realized that there were no conferences or journals dedicated to the study of language death, where scholars in the field could share ideas.{{sfn|Aitchison|1991|p=291}} The book was described by Dorian as a "stepping stone" to future research into language death.{{sfn|Blyth|1994|p=98}} By examining 37 languages and dialects, the authors of essays contributed to the availability of information on specific minority languages. At the same time, the different methodologies used help other researchers learn more about endangered language research.{{sfn|Blyth|1994|p=97}} The essays elucidated how [[second-language learner]] methodologies could be applied to the study of heritage speakers of endangered languages for whom the language is not their primary mode of communication, one of Dorian's main goals for the collection. In addition, the book is was described by Carl Blyth as a "milestone" because it "establishes a more coherent agenda in a disparate and still emerging field".{{sfn|Blyth|1994|p=98}} ''Investigating Obsolescence'' "undoubtedly compares to other major collections of sociolinguistic essays", according to [[Emanuel Drechsel]].{{sfn|Drechsel|1990|pp=553-554}}

==Legacy==
Carl Blyth wrote in 1994 that Dorian "deserves foremost credit for consistently drawing the attention of linguists and anthropologists to the importance of endangered languages".{{sfn|Blyth|1994|p=96}} In 2005, Dorian was the subject of a documentary that aired on [[BBC Alba]]: "Mar a Chunnaic Mise: Nancy Dorian agus a' Ghàidhlig" ("As I saw it: Nancy Dorian and Gaelic"). The documentary focused on her work on East Sutherland Gaelic.&lt;ref name=bbcalba&gt;{{cite news |title=Mar a Chunnaic Mise: Nancy Dorian agus a' Ghaidhlig |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s1x68 |accessdate=4 September 2018 |work=[[BBC Alba]] |date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McEwan-Fujita|2015|p=431}}

In 2012 Dorian was awarded the Kenneth L. Hale Award by the [[Linguistic Society of America]], an award which recognizes scholars for work on endangered or extinct languages. Dorian's award credited her for "research on Scots Gaelic that spans a period of almost fifty years—perhaps the most sustained record of research on any endangered language; and for her effective advocacy for the cause of endangered language preservation and revitalization. Hers was one of the earliest and is still one of the most prominent voices raised in support of endangered languages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kenneth L.

The '''National Digital library of India''' ('''NDLI''') is a project under [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[India]]. The objective is to integrate several national and international digital libraries in one single web-portal. The NDLI provides free of cost access to many books in English and the Indian languages.

==Launch and growth==
The Library was launched in pilot form in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Standard'', "National Digital Library up in pilot stage", 25 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/dig_lib.pdf|title=MHRD Digital Library Press Release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202051920/http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/dig_lib.pdf|archive-date=2017-02-02|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, NDL hosts 7,203,195 items in its repository, with over 150,000 volumes in English.
The Library was dedicated to the nation in June 2018.

==Languages==
The scanning of Indian language books has created an opportunity for developing Indian language [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) software. Books in Urdu and Persian are also available at the NDL. Examples include " Aligarh kee taaleemi tehreek" by Khwaja Ghulamus Sayyedain and ''Makateeb-e-Sanai'' by Professor Nazir Ahmad.

==Access and restrictions==
User registration is open to users from around the world. However, contents from some popular sources are only accessible to registered users. Some of these registration-only works are from sources such as:

* World eBook Library
* South Asia Archive
* OECD iLibrary
* Satyajit Ray Society

==Delivery formats==
Access can also be had via mobile app, available for Android at Google Play.&lt;ref&gt;NDL mobile app for Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhrd.ndl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The Library is managed by [[Indian Institute of Technology]], [[Kharagpur]]

The term '''political statement''' is used to refer to any act or non-verbal form of communication that is intended to influence a decision to be made for or by a political party.

A political statement can vary from a [[mass demonstration]] to the wearing of a badge with a [[political slogan]]. It was a term popularised in the 1960s but still has some currency.

The term has also been used to describe negotiated statements such as the [[Seville Statement on Violence]] or the [[Waldorf Statement]], or [[extempore]] utterances with political implications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8720">'''''Poshlost''''' or '''''Poshlost' ''''' ({{lang-rus |по́шлость |p= ˈpoʂləsʲtʲ}}) is a Russian word  for a particular negative human character trait or man-made thing or idea.  It has been cited as an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] word, as there is no single exact English equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rbth.com/blogs/2014/05/29/a_question_of_taste_the_untranslatable_word_poshlost_37047.html | title = A question of taste: The untranslatable word 'poshlost' | last = Mikheev | first = Alexey | date = 29 May 2014 | website = Russia Beyond The Headlines | access-date = 12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carries much cultural baggage in [[Russia]] and has been discussed at length by various writers.

It is derived from the adjective 
[[:wikt:пошлый|пошлый]].

==Description==
It has been defined as "petty evil or self-satisfied [[vulgarity]]",{{Sfn | Alexandrov | 1991 | p = 106}} while [[Svetlana Boym]]{{Sfn | Boym | 2001 | p = 279}} defines it briefly as "[[obscenity]] and bad taste".

Boym goes on to describe it at more length:{{Sfn | Boym | 1994 | p = 41}}
{{quote |''Poshlost’'' is the Russian version of banality, with a characteristic national flavoring of metaphysics and high morality, and a peculiar conjunction of the sexual and the spiritual.  This one word encompasses triviality, vulgarity, sexual promiscuity, and a lack of spirituality.  The war against ''poshlost’'' was a cultural obsession of the Russian and Soviet intelligentsia from the 1860s to 1960s.}}

Early examinations of ''poshlost'' in literature are in the work of [[Nikolai Gogol]].  Gogol wrote (of [[Pushkin]]),&lt;!--Please leave the following quotation as the author wrote it, including the part in brackets.--&gt;
{{Quote | He used to say of me that no other writer before me possessed the gift to expose so brightly life's ''poshlust'', to depict so powerfully the ''poshlust'' of a ''poshlusty'' man [''poshlost' poshlovo cheloveka''] in such a way that everybody's eyes would be opened wide to all the petty trivia that often escape our attention." | "The Third Letter à Propos ''Dead Souls''", 1843, quoted and translated by Davydov, 1995.  Brackets in original.  See below for his transliteration "poshlust".}}

In his novels, [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]] "tried to develop a heroic figure who could, with the verve and abandon of a [[Don Quixote]], grapple with the problems of Russian society, who could once and for all overcome 'poshlost’, the complacent mediocrity and moral degeneration of his environment".{{Sfn | Lindstrom | 1966 | p = 149}}  [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky |Dostoyevsky]] applied the word to the [[Satan |Devil]]; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]], to Western-influenced young people.{{Sfn | Boym | 1994 | page = 41}}

[[D. S. Mirsky]] was an early user of the word in English in writing about Gogol; he defined it as "'self-satisfied inferiority,' moral and spiritual".{{Sfn | Mirsky | 1927 | p = 158}}  [[Vladimir Nabokov]] made it more widely known in his book on Gogol, where he romanized it as "'''poshlust'''" (punningly: "[[wikt:posh|posh]]" + "[[lust]]"). Poshlust, Nabokov explained, "is not only the obviously trashy but mainly the falsely important, the falsely beautiful, the falsely clever, the falsely attractive.  A list of literary characters personifying ''poshlust'' will include... Polonius and the royal pair in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Rodolphe and Homais from ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', Laevsky in [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s 'The Duel', [[James Joyce|Joyce]]'s [[Molly Bloom|Marion [Molly] Bloom]], young Bloch in ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Search of Lost Time]]'', [[Guy de Maupassant |Maupassant]]'s '[[Bel Ami]]', [[Anna Karenina]]'s husband, and Berg in ''[[War and Peace]]''".{{Sfn | Nabokov | 1944 | p = 70 | ps = .  Brackets added.}} {{Harvnb | Nabokov | 1973}} also listed
{{quote |Corny trash, vulgar clichés, [[Philistinism]] in all its phases, imitations of imitations, bogus profundities, crude, moronic and dishonest pseudo-literature&amp;mdash;these are obvious examples.  Now, if we want to pin down poshlost in contemporary writing we must look for it in Freudian symbolism, moth-eaten mythologies, social comment, humanistic messages, political allegories, overconcern with class or race, and the journalistic generalities we all know.}}

[[Azar Nafisi]] mentions it and quotes the "falsely" definition in ''[[Reading Lolita in Tehran]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Guardian | place = [[United Kingdom |UK]] | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1039915,00.html | title = Books | type = review}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabokov often targeted ''poshlost'' in his own work; the Alexandrov definition above refers to the character of M'sieur Pierre in ''[[Invitation to a Beheading]]''.

Another notable literary treatment is [[Fyodor Sologub]]'s novel ''[[Fyodor Sologub#The Petty Demon|The Petty Demon]]''.  It tells the story of a provincial schoolteacher, Peredonov, notable for his complete lack of redeeming human qualities. [[James H. Billington]]{{Sfn | Billington | 1966 | page = 494}} said of it:
{{quote|The book puts on display a Freudian treasure chest of perversions with subtlety and credibility.  The name of the novel's hero, Peredonov, became a symbol of calculating [[concupiscence]] for an entire generation...  [Peredonov] seeks not the ideal world but the world of petty venality and sensualism, ''poshlost'.''  He torments his students, derives erotic satisfaction from watching them kneel to pray, and systematically befouls his apartment before leaving it as part of his generalized spite against the universe.}}

[[Richard Taruskin]] summarized poshlost as "highfalutin bad taste," applying the term to a performance of the [[Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev)]].

'''Positive liberty''' is the possession of the capacity to act upon one's free will, as opposed to [[negative liberty]], which is freedom from external restraint on one's actions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Berlin, Isaiah. ''Four Essays on Liberty''. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept of positive liberty may also include freedom from internal constraints.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, C. ''What's Wrong with Negative Liberty'', 1985. ''Law and Morality''. 3rd ed. Ed. David Dyzenhaus, Sophia Reibetanz Moreau and Arthur Ripstein. Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2008. 359–368. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of [[structure and agency]] are central to the concept of positive liberty because in order to be free, a person should be free from inhibitions of the social structure in carrying out their [[free will]].  Structurally, [[classism]], [[sexism]], [[ageism]], [[ableism]] and [[racism]] can inhibit a person's freedom. As positive liberty is primarily concerned with the possession of [[Agency (sociology)|sociological agency]], it is enhanced by the ability of citizens to participate in government and have their voices, interests, and concerns recognized and acted upon.

Although [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s essay "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]" (1958) is typically acknowledged as the first to explicitly draw the distinction between positive and negative liberty, [[Frankfurt School]] [[psychoanalyst]] and [[Marxist]] [[humanistic]] [[philosopher]] [[Erich Fromm]] drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' (1941), predating Berlin's essay by more than a decade.

== Overview ==
The word ''[[liberty]]'' can refer to many things, but Isaiah Berlin recognized two main types of liberty. Berlin described a statement such as "I am slave to no man" as one of negative liberty, that is, freedom from another individual's direct interference. He contrasted this with a Positive Freedom statement such as "I am my own master", which lays claim to a freedom to choose one's own pursuits in life.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] sees Negative Freedom as an "opportunity-concept": one possesses Negative Freedom if one is not enslaved by external forces, and has equal access to a society's resources (regardless of how one decides to spend their time). Positive Freedom, says Taylor, is an "exercise-concept": possessing it might mean that one is not ''internally'' constrained; one must be able to act according to their highest self – according to reason.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Suppose a rich and powerful actor is also a drug addict. This actor may possess a great deal of negative liberty, but very little Positive Liberty according to Taylor. By Taylor's definitions, Positive Freedom entails being in a mature state of decision making, free of internal or external restraints (e.g. weakness, fear, ignorance, etc.).&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

== History ==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s theory of freedom, according to which individual freedom is achieved through participation in the process whereby one's community exercises collective control over its own affairs in accordance with the "[[general will]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some interpret ''[[The Social Contract]]'' to suggest that Rousseau believed that liberty was the power of individual citizens to act in the government to bring about changes; this is essentially the power for [[self-governance]] and [[democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Rousseau himself said, "the mere impulse to appetite is slavery, while obedience to law ''we prescribe ourselves'' is liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau as quoted by Replogle, Ron. ''Recovering the Social Contract''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1989), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; For Rousseau, the passage from the state of nature to the civil state substitutes justice for instinct gives his actions the morality they had formerly lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rosen, Jonathan Wolff, Catriona McKinnon (eds.), ''Political Thought'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. F. W. Hegel]] wrote in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' (in the part in which he introduced the concept of the [[sphere of abstract right]]) that "duty is not a restriction on freedom, but only on freedom in the abstract" and that "duty is the attainment of our essence, the winning of positive freedom.&lt;ref&gt;George Klosko, ''History of Political Theory: An Introduction: Volume II: Modern'' (2nd ed.), Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 465: "we should note that Hegel's realization of the distance between his own and the traditional liberal conception of freedom, which he calls "abstract freedom," is clear in his embrace of [[positive freedom]] [in [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR149 ''PR'' §149A]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In a description of positive liberty from the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;Put in the simplest terms, one might say that a democratic society is a free society because it is a self-determined society, and that a member of that society is free to the extent that he or she participates in its democratic process. But there are also individualist applications of the concept of positive freedom. For example, it is sometimes said that a government should aim actively to create the conditions necessary for individuals to be self-sufficient or to achieve self-realization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=liberty-positive-negative |title=Positive and Negative Liberty |last=Carter |first=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Recovering the Social Contract", Ron Replogle made a metaphor that is helpful in understanding positive liberty. "Surely, it is no assault on my dignity as a person if you take my car keys, against my will, when I have had too much to drink. There is nothing paradoxical about making an agreement beforehand providing for paternalistic supervision in circumstances when our competence is open to doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Replogle, Ron. ''Recovering the Social Contract''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1989). p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, positive liberty is the adherence to a set of rules agreed upon by all parties involved. Should the rules be altered, all parties involved must agree upon the changes. Therefore, positive liberty is a [[contractarian]] philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

However, [[Isaiah Berlin]] opposed any suggestion that paternalism and positive liberty could be equivalent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=170287 |title=Open Learning – OpenLearn  |publisher=Openlearn.open.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that positive liberty could only apply when the withdrawal of liberty from an individual was in pursuit of a choice that individual himself/herself made, not a general principle of society or any other person's opinion. In the case where a person removes a driver's car keys against their will because they have had too much to drink, this constitutes positive freedom only if the driver has made, of their own free will, an earlier decision not to drive drunk.  Thus, by removing the keys, the other person facilitates this decision and ensures that it will be upheld in the face of paradoxical behaviour (i.e., drinking) by the driver.  For the remover to remove the keys in the absence of such an expressed intent by the driver, because the ''remover'' feels that the driver ''ought not to'' drive drunk, is paternalism, and not positive freedom by Berlin's definition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms. This aspect of freedom, he argues, "is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., 1966), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; For Fromm, freedom from animal instinct implicitly implies that survival now hinges on the necessity of charting one's own course.  He relates this distinction to the biblical story of man's expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]:
{{quote|Acting against God's orders means freeing himself from coercion, emerging from the unconscious existence of prehuman life to the level of man.  Acting against the command of authority, committing a sin, is in its positive human aspect the first act of freedom. [...] he is ''free'' from the bondage of paradise, but he is not free ''to'' govern himself, to realize his individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Positive freedom, Fromm maintains, comes through the actualization of individuality in balance with the separation from the whole: a "solidarity with all men", united not by instinctual or predetermined ties, but on the basis of a freedom founded on reason.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pragmatic sanction''' is a sovereign's solemn decree on a matter of primary importance and has the force of fundamental law. In the late history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] it referred more specifically to an edict issued by the Emperor.

When used as a proper noun, and the year is not mentioned, it usually refers to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], a legal mechanism designed to ensure that the Austrian throne and Habsburg lands would be inherited by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI's]] daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]].

Pragmatic sanctions tend to be issued at times in which the theoretically ideal situation is untenable, and a change of the rules is called for.
*The Pragmatic Sanction of [[Justinian I]], promulgated in August 554, on the reorganization of [[Italy]] following the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]].
*The so-called Pragmatic Sanction of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], purporting to have been issued in March 1269, regarding various clerical reforms, was a forgery fabricated in the 15th century.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges]], issued on July 7, 1438 by King [[Charles VII of France]], limited the authority of the pope over the Church within France.
*The German [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1439]], issued by German ruling princes March 26, 1439, accepted some of the decrees of the [[Council of Basel]] with modifications. It has been argued that the name ''Pragmatic Sanction'' is not properly applied to this document, as it was issued by princes subordinate to the emperor without the emperor's endorsement.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], established the [[Seventeen Provinces]] as an entity. 
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] issued by Emperor Charles VI on April 19, 1713, by which the Habsburg hereditary possessions (Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, and various other smaller lands) were allowed to pass to a woman (specifically [[Maria Theresa]]) if [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] had no male heirs.
**The Croatian [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1712]], passed by the [[Sabor|Diet]] of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and predating the Austrian decree, allowing the Croatian throne to pass to the female line of the House of Habsburg.
**The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1723]] passed by the Hungarian Parliament, accepting female inheritance in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Charles VI had permitted Hungary to revert to elective monarchy should he die without a male heir; this instrument signalled the Hungarian parliament's acceptance of his choice of successor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt R. W. SETON -WATSON: The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Naples]], issued October 6, 1759, by King [[Charles III of Spain]], governed the succession to the thrones of Naples, Sicily, and Spain, and forbade the union of Spain and the Two Sicilies.
*The Spanish [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830]], issued March 29, 1830 by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], ratified a Decree of 1789 by [[Charles IV of Spain]], which had replaced the semi-[[Salic law|Salic]] system established by Philip V with the [[male-preference primogeniture]] system that had historically characterized the Castilian monarchy (upon which the Spanish monarchy draws its traditions), as exemplified by the inheritance by queens regnant [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]], and [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]]. (See also [[Carlism]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15949">The [[Russian language]] is among the top fifteen most spoken [[languages in the United States]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], many Russians have migrated to the United States and brought the language with them. Most Russian speakers in the United States today are [[Russian Jews]]. According to the [[2010 United States Census]] the number of Russian speakers was 854,955, which made Russian the 12th most spoken language in the country.&lt;ref name="factfinder2"/&gt;

|}The first Russians to land on the [[New World]] were explorers who reached [[Alaska]] in 1648. More than 200 years later, in 1867, Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] sold Alaska to the United States. Many Russian settlers returned to Russia, but a small number of them remained. In 1882 16,918 Russian speakers lived in the US, and that number gradually increased to 387,416 by 1899.{{sfn|Potowski|2010|p=180}}

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries many [[Russian Jews]] migrated to the United States, fleeing [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|persecution at home]]. Though many spoke [[Yiddish]], most knew Russian.{{sfn|Potowski|2010|p=181}} Millions also left Russia after the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Bolshevik Revolution]]. The 1920 US Census identified 392,049 United States citizens born in Russia; the statistics from a decade before that showed only 57,926 Russian-born Americans. Most of the newcomers were [[White émigré]]s.{{sfn|Potowski|2010|p=181}} Russian immigration slowed in the 1930s and 1940s due to restrictions imposed by the [[Stalinism|Stalin government]] in the Soviet Union. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service listed 14,016 Russian immigrants entering the country from 1930 to 1944.{{sfn| Potowski |2010|p=181}} Most of those people were citizens of the USSR who refused to return to their country from trips abroad, so-called ''[[nevozvrashchentsy]]'' (non-returners).

The next big wave of immigration started in the 1970s. If they were allowed to leave, Soviet Jews had little difficulty entering the U.S., and many did so.{{sfn|Potowski|2010|p=181}} Russian-speaking [[Jews]] constitute about 80% of all immigrants from the former Soviet states.{{sfn|Potowski|2010|p=183}}

Since 2012, New York State institutions provide free interpretations from/into Russian. Also, some state and elections documents are translated into it.

==Demographics==

===Education===
Russian speakers are more likely to have a [[higher education]] degree than the national average. 92% of them have a [[high school diploma]] and 51% a [[bachelor's degree]]. 75% of Russian-speakers speak English "well" or "very well" according to the 2007 data of the U.S. Census Bureau.{{sfn|Potowski|2010|p=185}}

===Viability===
[[File:Voting Instructions in Russian.jpg|thumb|400 px|Voting instructions to recent immigrants from the Secretary of State for Minnesota [[Mike Holm]], issued between 1920-1930]]
In terms of viability, the state of the  language in the United States is much better compared to some other European languages, although a considerable minority of the children born to Russian-speaking parents are raised as monolingual English speakers. According to the 2010 Census data, 14.7% of the Russian speakers in the United States are aged between 5 and 17. This is significantly lower than the English speakers (18.8% aged 5–17), but much higher when compared to speakers of Polish (11.3%) and Hungarian (6.8%). The Russian-speaking population is younger in states with large [[Old Believers|Old Believer]] or former-USSR Evangelical concentrations, such as Alaska and Oregon.

'''Sarah Anne Coakley''' (born 10 September 1951) is an English [[Anglican]] [[systematic theologian]] and [[philosopher of religion]] with interdisciplinary interests. She is the [[Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and professorial fellow of [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge]].

==Early life and education==
Born on 10 September 1951 into a wealthy family of lawyers in [[London]], Coakley attended [[Blackheath High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2714 |title=Sarah Coakley Reconstructs Feminism |publisher=Religion-online.org |date=2003-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, she spent a gap year teaching English and Latin in Lesotho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humbleapproach.templeton.org/faith/chair.html |title=Faith, Rationality, and the Passions - Chair |publisher=Humbleapproach.templeton.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her education continued at [[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]] (now [[Murray Edwards College]]), University of Cambridge (BA, First Class Honours, 1973) and at [[Harvard Divinity School]] (ThM, 1975), to which she went as a Harkness Fellow.  Her PhD on [[Ernst Troeltsch]] is also from the [[University of Cambridge]] (1983).

==Career==
===Academic career===
Coakley has taught at [[Lancaster University]] (1976–1991), at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] (1991–1993) and at [[Harvard University]] in the divinity school (1993–2007; as Mallinckrodt Professor of Divinity, 1995–2007). She was a visiting professor of religion at [[Princeton University]] (2003–2004). In 2006, she was elected the [[Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity]] at the University of Cambridge (the first woman appointed to this chair) and took up the position in 2007. In 2011, she became Deputy Chair of the School of Arts and Humanities with a four-year appointment on the General Board of the university.

Coakley's teaching and research interests cover a number of disciplines cognate to [[systematic theology]], including the [[philosophy of religion]], the [[philosophy of science]], [[patristics]], [[feminist theory]] and the intersections of law and medicine with religion.  Her contributions to these areas have generally been by way of co-ordinating research projects and editing or co-editing collections of papers. It was through these collaborative projects that her profile gained a level of international prominence. Indeed, at the time of her appointment to the Norris-Hulse chair in Cambridge, Coakley had not published a monograph subsequent to the 1988 publication of her doctoral thesis. She has been working on a four-volume systematic theology, the first volume of which was published in 2013 as ''God, Sexuality and the Self: An Essay 'On the Trinity'''.

From 2005 to 2008, Coakley co-directed, with [[Martin A. Nowak]], the "Evolution and Theology of Cooperation" project at Harvard University, sponsored by the [[Templeton Foundation]], out of which has come a co-edited volume, ''Evolution, Games, and God: The Principle of Cooperation''.  An earlier interdisciplinary project on "Pain and Its Transformations" undertaken with [[Arthur Kleinman]] at Harvard (as part of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative), produced ''Pain and Its Transformations: The Interface of Biology and Culture'' (co-ed. with Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Harvard UP, 2007).

Coakley delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/gifford/about/|title=Gifford Lecture Series 2012/|publisher=[[University of Aberdeen]]|accessdate=1 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020122043/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/gifford/about/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordained ministry===
Coakley was [[ordained]] in the [[Church of England]] as a [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] in 2000 and as a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = COAKLEY (née FURBER) | forenames = Sarah Anne | id = 2133 | accessed = 11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has assisted in parishes in Waban, Massachusetts, and at [[Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore]], Oxford, England (where she served her title).  Her training for the priesthood included periods working in a hospital and a prison.  In 2011 she was appointed an honorary canon of [[Ely Cathedral]] where she assists with the morning office and Eucharist.

In 2012, she was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to change Church of England rules to allow women to become bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/11/23/3639111.htm |title=Has the Church of England finally lost its reason?

In [[English law]], the term '''''state trials''''' primarily denotes trials relating to offences against the [[State (polity)|state]]. In practice it is a term often used of cases illustrative of the law relating to state officers or of [[international law|international]] or [[constitutional law]].

==Bibliographical history==
The first collection of accounts of state trials was published in 1719 in four volumes. Although without an editor's name, it appears that [[Thomas Salmon (historian)|Thomas Salmon]] (1679&amp;ndash;1767), an historical and geographical writer, was responsible for the collection. A second edition, increased to six volumes, under the editorship of [[Sollom Emlyn]] (1697&amp;ndash;1754), appeared in 1730. This edition contained a lengthy preface critically surveying the condition of English law at the time.

A third edition appeared in 1742, in eight volumes, the seventh and eighth volumes having been added in 1835. Ninth and tenth volumes were added in 1766, and a fourth edition, comprising ten volumes, with the trials arranged chronologically, was published the same year. A fifth edition, originated by [[William Cobbett]], but edited by [[Thomas Bayly Howell]] (1768&amp;ndash;1815) and known as ''Cobbett's Complete Collection of State Trials'', was published between 1809 and 1826. This edition is in thirty-three volumes; twenty-one of them, giving the more important state trials down to 1781, were edited by TB Howell, and the remaining volumes, bringing the trials down to 1820, by his son [[Thomas Jones Howell]] (d. 1858).

A new series, under the direction of a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|parliamentary committee]], was projected in 1885, with the object of bringing the trials down to a later date. Eight volumes were published in 1888&amp;ndash;1898, bringing the work down to 1858. The first three of these were edited by [[John Macdonell (jurist)|Sir John Macdonell]], the remaining five by [[John Edward Power Wallis]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|title=State Trials|volume=25|page=806|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri25chisrich#page/806/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of [[Case citation|citation]], their name may be abbreviated to '''St Tr (NS)'''.&lt;ref&gt;O.

'''Forced Sterilization of Indigenous women''' is an issue affecting both [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] women. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous women]] have been sterilized without informed consent, or coerced into consenting to medical procedures;&lt;ref name=Volscho&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volscho|first1=Thomas|title=Sterilization Racism and Pan-Ethnic Disparities of the Past Decade: The Continued Encroachment on Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=17–31|doi=10.1353/wic.0.0053}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has been done when they were unconscious from sedation, or during the stress of childbirth.&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-13-2018-1.4902679/indigenous-women-kept-from-seeing-their-newborn-babies-until-agreeing-to-sterilization-says-lawyer-1.4902693|title=Indigenous women kept from seeing their newborn babies until agreeing to sterilization, says lawyerlast=|first=|date=|website=[[CBC Radio]]|archive-url=|archive-date=13 Nov 2018|dead-url=|access-date=14 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), through the federally-funded [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS), covertly imposed a policy of involuntary surgical sterilization upon Native American women in the United States.&lt;ref name=ForcedSterilization&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6242/Forced-Sterilization-of-Native-Americans.html|title=Forced Sterilization of Native Americans|last=|first=|date=|website=Encylopedia JRank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was only revealed when members of the [[American Indian Movement]] occupied the offices of the BIA in 1972.&lt;ref name=ForcedSterilization/&gt;&lt;ref name=Volscho /&gt; The U.S. General Accounting Office found that the Indian Health Service sterilized 3,406 Native American women between 1973 and 1976. The study showed that 36 women under age 21 were forcibly sterilized regardless of a court-ordered moratorium on sterilizations of women younger than 21.&lt;ref name=NV&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/543.html|title=Native Voices|last=|first=|date=|website=NLM|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] | title= Investigation of Allegations Concerning Indian Health Service | url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/120/117355.pdf | access-date=May 29, 2015 | date=November 4, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; One out of four Native American women were involuntarily sterilized through [[tubal ligation]] or [[hysterectomy]].&lt;ref name=MRL&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure was often done under the pretense of a check up or abortion and most individuals were not aware they had been sterilized. In the 1970s, the average [[birth rate]] of Native American women was 3.7 however, in 1980 it fell to 1.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=24|issue=3|page=402|date = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, forced and coerced sterilizations are alleged to have happened as recently as 2017. In November, 2018, it was announced that over 60 Indigenous women are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging they underwent forced or coerced sterilizations over the past 20 to 25 years in [[Saskatchewan]], in which they were not allowed contact with their newborns until they signed forms "consenting" to tubal ligations.&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18 /&gt;

== Types of sterilization ==
In the 1970s, after being forced onto [[Indian reservation|reservations]] by the United States government, or [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|relocated into urban areas]] without adequate support, many Native Americans were struggling with [[poverty]]. The [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS) was their main health provider. A common sterilization procedure was the [[hysterectomy]], a form of permanent sterilization in which the [[uterus]] is removed through the patient's [[abdomen]] or [[vagina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sterilization Abuse: A Proposed Regulatory Scheme|journal=DePaul Law Review|volume=28|issue=3|page=734|last1=Kelly|first1=Mary E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hysterectomies were often performed on Native American women by [[Residency (medicine)|residents]] without the patient's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peal|first1=Tiesha|title=The Continuing Sterilization of Undesirables in America|journal=Rutgers Race and the Law Review|date=2004|volume=6|issue=1|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common form of sterilization was tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure in which a woman's [[fallopian tubes]] are tied, blocked, or cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpio|first1=Myla |title=The Lost Generation: American Indian and Sterilization Abuse|journal=Social Justice|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quinacrine]] was also used to sterilize Native American women.  Quinacrine is commonly used to treat [[malaria]], but can also be used for non-surgical sterilization. Capsules inserted into the uterus spread and destroy the lining of the Fallopian tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggles against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-permanent forms of sterilization were also used including [[Depo-Provera]] and [[Norplant]]. Depo-Provera was used mainly on [[intellectually disabled]] Native American women before it gained clearance from the FDA in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4140251|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|last=Ralston-Lewis|first=D. Marie|date=|publisher=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norplant, promoted by the IHS, was marketed by [[Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]] (who were sued over insufficient disclosure of side effects including irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression). Side effects of these two types of sterilization included the cessation of the menstrual cycle and excessive bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralstin-Lewis|first1=D. Marie|title=The Continuing Struggle against Genocide: Indigenous Women's Reproductive Rights|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date=2005|volume=20|issue=1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using 2002 data from the [[National Survey of Family Growth]], the Urban Indian Health Institute found that among women using contraception, the most common methods used by urban American Indian and Alaskan Native women age 15–44 years were female sterilization (34%), oral contraceptive pills (21%), and male condoms (21%). However among the urban Non-Hispanic Whites, the most common methods were oral contraceptive pills 36%),  female sterilization (20%) and male condoms (18%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Urban Indian Health Institute, Seattle Indian Health Board.| title=Reproductive Health of Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Women: Examining Unintended Pregnancy, Contraception, Sexual History and Behavior, and Non-Voluntary Sexual Intercourse. | date=2010| access-date=June 14, 2016 |page=23 | url=http://mchb.hrsa.gov/research/documents/finalreports/forquera_r40_mc_08954_final_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excuses for sterilization ==
[[Racism]] and harmful [[stereotypes]] of the Native American population, held by members of the dominant culture, were factors that made Native American women targets for sterilization. The media commonly referred to Native American women by misogynist, racist [[Pejorative|slurs]] such as "[[squaw]]",&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; defined as a "dirty, subservient, abused, alcoholic and ugly woman who loves to torture white men."&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; Negative racial stereotypes propagated the belief among the dominant culture that Native American women were unfit to raise or to have children in comparison to white women.&lt;ref name=Volscho/&gt; First Nations women who have given birth in white hospitals have been coerced into being sterilized against their will; often being told it was mandatory before seeing their babies,&lt;ref name=CBC-11-13-18 /&gt; or being lied to that it was a requirement of the delivery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Mary E.|title=Sterilization Abuse: A Proposed Regulatory Scheme|journal=De Paul Law Review|date=1979|volume=28|issue=3|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not agreeing to the sterilization procedure would result in the withdrawal of [[welfare]] benefits. Consent forms presented to them failed to indicate that the decision would affect their ability to bear children in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=2000|volume=24|issue=3|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies by the [[Health Research Group]] in 1973 and [[Doctor Bernard Rosenfeld]]'s interviews in 1974 and 1975 show that this action was driven by social and economic factors.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jane|title=The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=2000|volume=24|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the white physicians performing this procedure viewed sterilization as the best alternative for these women. They claimed it would improve their financial situation and their family's quality of life.&lt;ref name="Carpio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpio|first1=Myla|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian and Sterilization Abuse|journal=Social Justice|date=2004|volume=31|issue=4|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicians were paid more for performing hysterectomies and tubal ligations than for prescribing other forms of birth control.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt; The influx of surgical procedures was seen as a training for physicians and as a practice for resident physicians. In 1971, Dr. James Ryan stated that he favored hysterectomies over tubal ligations because "it's more of a challenge...and it's good experience for the junior resident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peal|first1=Tiesha|title=The Continuing Sterilization of the Undesirables in America|journal=Rutgers Race and the Law Review|volume=6|issue=1|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; With fewer people applying for Medicaid and welfare, the federal government could decrease spending on welfare programs.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt;

In the 1970s, the negative stereotypes of Native American women held by members of the dominant culture, along with racist beliefs of white superiority, contributed to the belief among white physicians that these women would not be able to limit the number of children or use birth control effectively. These factors all contributed to the sterilization policy.&lt;ref name="Lawrence" /&gt;

==IHS regulations==
The [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS) continues to offer sterilization as a method of family planning.  Tubal ligation and vasectomy are the only procedures which may be performed for the primary purpose of sterilization. Legally, the IHS requires for the patient to give informed consent to the operation, be 21 years of age or older, and not be institutionalized in a correctional or mental health facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Indian Health Service  | title=Indian Health Manual § 3-13.12(F)(5) | url=http://www.ihs.gov/IHM/index.cfm?module=dsp_ihm_pc_p3c13#3-13.12F5 | access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11687">'''Stunt''' (or as usually stylized '''STUNT''') is a new and growing sport that is very similar to [[cheerleading]] in terms of athletic skills. In spring 2011, USA Cheer announced that 21 universities are now committed to this sport.  STUNT requires high athletic skills and its competition format and scoring systems are unique. The maximum number of players on each team can reach 30 athletes. STUNT athletes are engaged from multiple backgrounds, including traditional cheerleading schools, “All Stars” who are non-school cheerleaders and acrobatics and/or gymnastics athletes. STUNT is being considered for NCAA Emerging Sport status and has been designed to meet Title IX's requirements for intercollegiate sports.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cheerleading.about.com/od/cheerleadingnews/a/Cheers-New-Sport-Stunt-Reaches-Major-Milestone-For-Ncaa-Emerging-Sport-Status.htm Cheer's New Sport "Stunt" Reaches Major Milestone For NCAA Emerging Sport Status]" by Valerie Ninemier, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:OCU Stunter Brittani Hanna.jpg|thumb|right|167px|[[Oklahoma City University]] Athlete Brittani Hanna, performing a STUNT practice on campus]] --&gt;

== STUNT History ==

In 2011–2013 University of Louisville have kept the title of Champions for Division I Stunt. Oklahoma State University broke their streak in 2014 and have remained as the Division One champions every year since. As for Division II, University of Central Oklahoma have been the champions for three years since 2012 until Davenport University won in 2015 and kept the title the remaining year.

Not only is STUNT a college sport but starting in 2014, high school teams adopted the new sport as well. In 2014, more than 160 girls from 11 high schools from New York's Public School Athletic League (PSAL), competed in NY's first STUNT competition. The competition was held at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. Many other teams have been practicing and competing in this sport across the nation.

==The four Quarters of Play, Competition Formats and Routines==

===The four quarters of play===

There are four quarters in Stunt:
1.Partner Stunts
2.Pyramids and Tosses
3.Group Jumps and Tumbling
4.Team Performance.      
There are four rounds in the first three quarters, and three rounds in the fourth quarter. The order of competition is determined each round by the team who has control of possession. The two teams will play on opposite sides of the floor and perform routines against each other in all four quarters. Each quarter has its own level of difficulty to demonstrate.

===Competition format===

There are two formats for the STUNT game&lt;br /&gt;
1.'''Head to Head'''  Includes two teams playing and competing against one another.Usually the game takes about 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;    
2.'''STUNT tournaments'''  tournaments where multiple teams compete head to head. A regular three-team tournament game finishes in 1 hour, and a four-team tournament game takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

===STUNT routines&gt;===

Every year the USA Cheer STUNT Competition Committee develops STUNT routines and publishes them. They are responsible for determining the number of athletes and the skills needed in each routine. There are only six different plays for each quarter. The difficulty in skill of each stunt is ranged from one to six. Play one has the least difficult skill to six having the highest difficulty skill.

==General STUNT framework==

===Staff===

•One head coach, and maximum of three assistants.

•Game play can consist of a maximum of 20 athletes, and 30 on a team roster per team.

===Season/Post-season===

•Spring sport season commences play in January.

•Teams participate in competitions among national regions.

•During the 2012 season, it is mandatory for each participating team in STUNT to attend at least three regular season games/tournaments. However, it will be increased to a minimum of 12 regular season games/tournaments upon the establishment of STUNT as an NCCA Emerging Sport.

•Postseason play: Regional winners and top ranking “at-large” teams are invited to the National Championship Tournament.

•National rankings are based on each team’s win-loss record, strength of schedule, and a coach/judge’s poll.

===Field of play===

•A completion floor with a size of 54&amp;nbsp;ft × 42&amp;nbsp;ft consists of nine non-spring, carpet bonded, foam mat panels with a minimum 1-3/8 in. Thickness. Each mat panel, 6&amp;nbsp;ft × 42&amp;nbsp;ft in size, will be connected along its seams using 4 in. Widen Velcro strip.

•Each side of the mat will be used for teams’ seating and two mat panels for team warm-ups.

•In a two team game, each team will have the entire surface of the 2 mat panels as a team practice area.

•In a three or four team tournament, the 2 mat panels will be divided in half using white Velcro strips, or white athletic tape. Each team will use a practice area that is 12 x 21 feet size.

===Equipment===

•Competition floor and additional mat panels for team practice area

•Scoreboard

•Audio and public address sound system

•Team branches

•Necessary table and chairs for staff

•Water stations

===Event staffing===

The host team or event producer is expected to supply the following:

•A minimum of three judges

•One game official

•Scoreboard operator

•Music/Audio operator

•Announcer

•Appropriate medical personnel (EMT, medical doctor and / or certified athletic trainer)

===Skill rules===

STUNT teams are required to comply with the College STUNT Safety Rules published by AACCA.

===Game/ tournament timeline===

•Team Warm up: Before the game begins, each team will be given 15 minutes for warm up skills on the performance area completion floor. Teams may continue to warm-up on their practice mats as needed.

•Team Introductions: The visiting teams(s) will be introduced first followed by the home team.

•Coin Toss or Draw for Possession:  Before the play begins, the team head coaches will determine the initial possession for any game or tournament through a random drawing which is administered by the game official.

•National Anthem

==Game rules==

===Scoring===

Quarters 1, 2 and 3

There are three scoring officials who individually rank the teams according to the number of execution mistakes and the degree of those mistakes. For instance, a minor deduction (marked as a slash “/”) is counted for a slight balance error or a timing error between players or groups that does not result in a fall. A major deduction (marked as an “X”) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A double major deduction (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground. Two minor errors equal one major error.
The decision of the final ranking for the round is based on combining the individual scoring official’s rankings. Points are determined by the number of teams competing. The team with the highest final rank obtains the same amount of points as there are teams competing.

Quarter 4

In the fourth quarter, teams make their own routines based on their unique skill level and talents. The routine performed in the fourth quarter is a combination of elements of the first three quarters and necessitates that each of the preceding categories must be represented so as to get full points.
The scoring officials individually score the elements based on the team’s performance by category, considering the difficulty of skills executed. The points from each category are accumulated to obtain a combined score for the routine.
In order to obtain equal balance between quarters, the round score is multiplied by three because there is only one round in the fourth quarter.
At any time does one of the players who are not in the specific play steps onto the mat then they will receive a minor deduction.

===Timeouts===

•Each team gets sixty seconds timeout per half.&lt;br /&gt;
 
•Timeouts are signaled by displaying the hands in a “T” figuration.

•During timeouts all teams are allowed to use their warm-up area.

===Possession===
•'''Start of the Game''' A random drawing by the team head coaches, overseen by the game official, determines the team that will start the game.

•'''Quarter Change''' The initial possession in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters is given to the team with the lowest overall game score.

•'''Second and Third Rounds of Each Quarter''' The team winning the preceding round gets possession for the following round.

•'''Forfeits''' If a team forfeits the round, it will automatically obtain possession for the following round.

•'''Ties''' If there is a tie between two teams, the team that did not have possession in the tie round will get possession.

•'''Quarter Change''' If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the highest point total at that time. If a tie persists, possession is determined by the pre-game drawing results.

•'''Second and Third Rounds of each Quarter''' If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the pre-game drawing results.

===Playoff for final score tiebreaker===
If a tie for 1st place occurs at the end of regulation, a playoff will determine the winner of the game/tournament. The playoff period consists only of quarters 1, 2 and 3. Judges will, at the end, rank the tying teams.

===Final score===
Points are given and declared at the end of each quarter with the game total being displayed on the event scoreboard. The game/tournament winner is the team that has accumulated the most total points for the game.

==Other definitions==

'''Game'''
Two teams will compete Head to head, involving four quarters and halftime. Halftime is in between quarters 2+3.  &lt;br /&gt;

'''Neutral Zone'''
It is a midpoint or borderline. The neutral zone is where the officials stand and is defined by 4”extensive white Velcro strips which distinguish the area from proximity mat sections.&lt;br /&gt; 
'''Practice Mats'''
Practice mats consist of two mat sections and their extent is 6 feet by 42 feet appropriate to teams for warm- up areas in juxtaposition to their team bench.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Quarter Break'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">The discourses in philosophy regarding [[social relation]]. What [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] call "the principle of '''superficiality''' versus depth"&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 18-9&lt;/ref&gt; has pervaded [[Western culture]] since at least the time of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 71 and p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical sketch==

[[Socrates]] sought to convince his debaters to turn from the superficiality of a worldview based on the acceptance of convention to the examined life of philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Morgan, ''Myth and Philosophy from the pre-Socratics to Plato'' (2000) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; founded (as [[Plato]] at least considered) upon the underlying [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]]. For more than two millennia, there was in the Platonic wake a general valorisation of critical thought over the superficial subjectivity that refused deep analysis.&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Gladstein/C. M. Sicabarra, ''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand'' (1999) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The salon style of the [[Précieuses]] might for a time affect superficiality, and play with the possibility of treating serious topics in a light-hearted fashion;&lt;ref&gt;A. De Riencout, ''Sex and Power in History'' (1974) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; but the prevailing western consensus firmly rejected elements such as everyday chatter&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cusset, ''No Tomorrow'' (1996) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; or the changing vagaries of fashion&lt;ref&gt;G. D. McCracken, ''Transformations'' (2008) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; as superficial distractions from a deeper reality.

==Modernist cross-currents==

By contrast, [[Nietzsche]] opened the modernist era with a self-conscious praise of superficiality: "What is required is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – ''out of profundity''!".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory Castle, ''The Blackwell Guide to Theory'' (OxfordLiteraryironic 2007) p.&lt;/ref&gt;

His (still) preference for superficiality was however over-shadowed for most of the 20th century by [[modernism]]'s full subscription to the depth/surface model, and to the privileging of the former over the latter. [[Frederic Jameson]] has highlighted four main modernist versions of the belief in a ''deeper'' reality - Marxist, psychoanalytic, existential, and semiotic -  in each of which reality is understood to be concealed behind an inauthentic surface or façade.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bennett/N. Royle, ''An Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory'' (2004) p. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson contrast these models sharply with the lack of depth, the ahistoricity, the surface-focus and flatness of the postmodern consciousness, with its new [[cult]] of the image and the [[simulacrum]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 17 and p 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodernism==

In the last third of the 20th century, [[Lyotard]] began challenging the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface as a ''theatrical'' world-view, insisting instead that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the purely verbal order of intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;K. Chrome/J. Williams ed., ''The Lyotard Reader and Guide'' (2006) p. 24-8&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[deconstruction]] has increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth.&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The result has been the call to abandon the idea that behind appearances there is any ultimate truth to be found;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; and in consequence the growing postmodern replacement of depth by surface, or by multiple surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991) p. 2 and p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

That process of substitution was well under way by the 1990s, when notoriously "surface was depth",&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bracewell, ''The Nineties: when surface was depth'' (London 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the new millennium has led to a state of what has been called hypervisibility: everything is on view.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Toffoletti, ''Baudrillard Reframed'' (London 2011) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In this new era of exposure&lt;ref&gt;L. Magid/A. Collier, ''Myspace'' (2007) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; we are all submerged in what the psychoanalyst Michael Parsons has called "the totalist world where there is a horror of inwardness; everything must be revealed".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

If postmodernism's proponents welcomed the way a new transcendence of the surface /depth dichotomy allowed a fuller appreciation of the possibilities of the superficial&lt;ref&gt;Russell De Manning, ''Theology at the End of Culture'' (2005) p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; - the surface consciousness of the now, as opposed to the depths of historical time&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; - critics like [[J. G. Ballard]] object that the end-product is a world of "laws without penalties, events without significance, a sun without shadows":&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Ballard, ''Millennium People'' (London 2003) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; of surface without depth. They see postmodern superficiality as a by-product of the [[false consciousness]] of global capitalism, where surface distractions, news, and entertainment supersaturate the [[zapping]] mind in such a way as to foreclose the possibility of envisioning any critical alternative.&lt;ref&gt;David Edwards, ''Burning All Illusions'' (1996) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==

Almost all [[Depth psychology|depth psychologies]] defy the postmodern to value depth over surface - to aim, in [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]]'s words, for "change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance".&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Debates may rage over whether to ''begin'' analysis at the surface or by way of  deep interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; but this is essentially a question of timing. Thus for example [[Jung]]ians would highlight at the start of therapy what they call the ''[[Persona (psychology)|persona-restoring]]'' phase as an effort to preserve superficiality, but would later optimally see the client moving from the surface to deeper emotion and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;David Sedgwick, ''Introduction to Jungian Psychotherapy'' (2006) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Perls]] by contrast maintained that "the simplicity of the [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] approach is that we pay attention to the obvious, to the utmost surface. We don't delve into a region which we don't know anything about, into the so-called 'unconscious{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (1972) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; A similar focus on the superficial has fuelled much of the [[Freud Wars]] of [[late modernity]], in which, according to [[Jonathan Lear]], "the real object of attack - for which Freud is only a stalking-horse - is the very idea that humans have unconscious motivation".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lear, in Parsons, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Given a choice of surface or depth—"are we to see humans as having depth, layers of meaning which lie beneath the surface of their own understanding?"—he asks: "Or are we to take ourselves as transparent to ourselves...to ignore the complexity, depth and darkness of human life";&lt;ref&gt;Lear, in Parsons, p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; the postmodern bias remains towards superficiality.

==Social processing==

[[Social psychology]] considers that in everyday life social processing veers between superficiality, where we rely on [[First impression (psychology)|first impressions]] and immediate judgements, and a deeper form of processing in which we seek to understand the other person more fully.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 18 and p. 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the ordinary course of life, we necessarily take others at face-value,&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade''  (London 1972) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; and use [[ideal type]]s/[[stereotypes]] to guide our daily activities; while institutions too can rely on the superficial consensus of [[groupthink]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; to preclude deeper investigation.

Some circumstances however necessitate a shift from superficial to extensive processing. When things become serious, we must put more and deeper thought into understanding, leaving superficial judgements to cases where the stakes are low, not high.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
* Entertainer [[Bill Hicks]] often criticized [[consumerism]], superficiality, mediocrity, and banality within the media and [[popular culture]], describing them as oppressive tools of the ruling class, meant to "keep people stupid and apathetic."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8409129199157823217 "Bill Hicks on Austin Public Access"], October 24, 1993, via Vide.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Web 2.0#Criticism|Web 2.0]] in particular is often seen as specifically fostering superficiality, replacing deep, measured analysis by noisy but unfiltered observation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Keen, ''The Cult of the Amateur'' (2008) p. 16 and p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' is his examination of American culture, particularly what he saw as its [[narcissism]], superficiality, and obsession with youth. [[Freud]] had similarly explored what was at the start of the 20th century a conventional contrast between the (historical) depth of Europe and the superficiality of America;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; but towards the century's close, another European, [[Baudrillard]], would return to the image of America as a shallow, cultureless desert, only to praise it in postmodern terms "because you are delivered from all depths there – a brilliant, mobile, superficial neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stuart Sim ed., ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'' (London 2001) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' has been analysed in terms of the movement from the superficiality of [[Elizabeth Bennet]]'s initially favourable appraisal of Whickham – her first impressions – to her deeper realisation of the value of Mr Darcy.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Tanner, 'Introduction', Jane Austen, ''Pride and Prejudice'' (Penguin 1972) p. 11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''VFX creative director''' is a position common in [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, and [[computer game]]s using a large amount of [[visual effects]].

For movies which are fully or partly [[computer-generated imagery|computer generated]], a VFX creative director works closely with the [[film director|director]]. On smaller VFX-intensive productions such as [[music video]]s or some [[television commercial]]s, a VFX creative director may also assume the responsibilities of the director. They are charged with making creative and aesthetic choices for visual effects. Although the role is generally more creative in nature, most VFX creative directors have a technical background and may exert a strong practical hand in production.

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of a VFX creative director are very much like those of an [[art director]], [[production designer]], or [[chief creative officer]], though with a particular focus on the computer-generated imagery of their projects. They are primarily responsible for directing and supervising the creative and technical execution of visual effects sequences, from concept to completion, including:
* [[Set extension]]s and matte painting
* [[Chroma key|Bluescreen]]ing
* [[Computer animation|Digital animation]]
* Digital effects
* [[Compositing]]

The VFX creative director may delegate responsibilities to [[visual effects supervisor]]s, visual effects editors, film [[compositing|compositors]], [[rotoscoping|rotoscope artists]], [[matte painting|matte painters]], and [[3D computer graphics|3D animators]].

VFX creative directors may therefore have input on various aspects of production, including:
* Story development and [[storyboarding]]
* Blocking, staging, locations
* Advising the director on actor movement
* [[Cinematography]]
* [[Costume]], [[makeup]], and [[Film prop|props]], particularly when there are [[special effects]] considerations

==Educational requirements==
As with much of the film industry, merit is awarded on the quality of work produced and not on academic qualifications. Bachelor's or master's degrees in film and television, digital media, design, or animation may be beneficial. There are a suite of skills and conditions that predispose an individual to successful operation as a VFX creative director:
* Experience from at least 5–10 years in the industry
* An understanding of the production process from concept to completion
* A deep familiarity with post-production pipelines, techniques, and software
* A strong balance of both creative and practical / technical skills
* Excellent communication and people-management skills
* Ability to guide and lead a team to extract their best work according to a predefined vision
* A strong grasp of all aspects of film theory

'''''What Happened to Burger's Daughter or How South African Censorship Works''''' is a 1980 collection of essays by South African novelist [[Nadine Gordimer]] and others. The book is about the South African government's banning and subsequent unbanning of Gordimer's 1979 novel ''[[Burger's Daughter]]''.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;

The book was published in [[Johannesburg]] by Taurus Publications, a small [[Underground press|underground]] publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of censorship. Its publications were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops to be given to customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.&lt;ref name="jstor3818653"/&gt;&lt;ref name=achievement-int1/&gt;

==Essays==
*"What Happened to Burger's Daughter" by [[Nadine Gordimer]]
*"Reasons for the Ban" by Richard Smith (Director of Publications)
*"What the Book is About" by Nadine Gordimer
*"Reasons for Lifting the Ban" by Publications Appeal Board
*"What the Literary Press Thought of the Novel"
*"Censorship in South Africa: The Legal Framework" by [[John Dugard]]
*"A Short List of Recently Banned Books"

==Synopsis==
In the book's titular essay, Gordimer documents the publication history and fate of ''[[Burger's Daughter]]'', and investigates the implications of the banning and unbanning of works in South Africa.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt; The official communiqué by the Director of Publications, Richard Smith stating his reason for banning the book a month after publication is reproduced here in full. These charges include "propagating Communist opinions", "creating a psychosis of revolution and rebellion", and "making several unbridled attacks against the authority entrusted with the maintenance of law and order and the safety of the state".&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; In another essay by Gordimer, "What the Book is About", she responds to each of the charges, showing how, by extensively quoting out of context, the Publications Control Board displayed their "inability ... to pass qualified judgment" on the book.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt;

The reasons for lifting the ban by the Publications Appeal Board three months later, on the recommendation of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, are also reproduced here. The state security specialist had reported that the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that "[i]t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [sic]."&lt;ref name="Karolides2006"/&gt; In the final essay in the book [[University of the Witwatersrand]] law professor [[John Dugard]] examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt;

==Reception==
In a review published in ''[[World Literature Today]]'', Carrol Lasker wrote that in ''What Happened to Burger's Daughter'',  Gordimer investigates the "sinister implications of the practice of banning and unbanning", and described the book as "a dramatic, detailed and useful model" of the workings of censorship in South Africa.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt; Writing in ''Research in African Literatures'', Sheila Roberts said that the book "exposes in a thorough and unprecedented way the bungling and ignorance of a censorship committee" and its "pathetic face-saving efforts" to undo the damage it had done.&lt;ref name="jstor3818653"/&gt;

{{Rights}}

'''Wind rights''' are rights relating to [[windmill]]s, [[wind turbine]]s and [[wind power]]. Historically in [[Continental Europe]] wind rights were manorial rights and obligations relating to the operation and profitability of windmills. In modern times, as wind becomes a more important source of power, rights relating to wind turbines and windmills are sometimes referred to as "wind rights".

== Low Countries ==

Historically, "wind rights" (Dutch: ''windrecht'') referred to a tax paid by [[miller]]s in large parts of the [[Low Countries]] before around 1800. The tax was paid on the "wind catch" (''windvang'') needed to turn a [[windmill]], but it was often based on the windmill's output.&lt;ref&gt; In the northern provinces, however, ancient wind rights were lacking. Government regulations only dated from the 17th century.

Prof. S. J. Fockema Andreae at Leiden University wrote an interesting article on this subject, entitled "Recht van den wind en molendwang", Tijdschrift voor rechtsgeschiedenis, Part 1, Issue 4, 1919, pp. 431-442, Haarlem.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|

This part of the article is an adapted translation of the article on ''windrecht'' at the Dutch version of Wikipedia.|group="N"}}

Since a windmill in a ''[[heerlijkheid]]'' was primarily the property of the lord (although leased out to a miller), wind rights were one way for a lord to discourage competition. In consideration for payment of this tax, the lord ensured that there were no wind obstructions around the mill by imposing a prohibition on buildings and high trees in the area. Another obligation imposed on residents was the "mill obligation" (''molendwang''), which required them to have their grain ground at the lord's mill. To a certain extent, this was another way for a lord to safeguard the income received from the mill.

Because of these rights and obligations, windmills had to be identifiable. They each had a name, traditionally the name of an animal. An image of the animal was placed on the mill so that even the [[Literacy|illiterate]] would know which mill was which.

In the Netherlands, wind rights and the mill obligations were ended around 1800 when a new constitution was introduced in the [[Batavian Republic]]. Similar concepts still exist in modern times. Since around 1973 the wind needed to turn a mill has been referred to as the "windmill [[biotope]]" (''molenbiotoop''). An area of {{convert|375|m|ft}} around a windmill is maintained as a "free zone" so that the windmill can have enough wind. For [[polder]] windmills, ensuring that windmills have enough wind is the responsibility of the [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]] (''waterschap'' or ''hoogheemraadschap''). However, this seldom takes priority over the desire of municipalities to build new housing.

== United States ==

In the United States, as a result of the increased interest in wind energy, developers or utilities purchase “wind rights" from landowners to allow the installation of one or more wind generators and an access road to the equipment in exchange for a payment to the landowner.&lt;ref&gt;
