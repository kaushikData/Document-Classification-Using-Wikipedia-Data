Violence continued in the early 1980s due to the armed [[Punjab insurgency|Sikh separatist]] [[Khalistan movement]] which sought independence from India.

==Background==
{{See also|List of terrorist incidents in Punjab (India)|Punjab insurgency}}
In 1972 Punjab state elections, Congress won and [[Akali Dal]] was defeated. In 1973 Akali Dal put forward the [[Anandpur Sahib Resolution]] resolution to demand more autonomy to Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=The Anandpur Sahib Resolution and Other Akali Demands|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195673098.001.0001/acprof-9780195673098-chapter-20|work=oxfordscholarship.com/|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It demanded that power be generally devoluted from the Central to state governments.&lt;ref name="Jayanta484"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ray |first1=Jayanta Kumar |title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World |date=2007 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131708347 |page=484 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nyk6oA2nOlgC&amp;q=khalistan#v=snippet&amp;q=khalistan&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Congress government considered the resolution a secessionist document and rejected it.&lt;ref name="Giorgio2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani | title=Sikh nationalism and identity in a global age | year=2008 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-42190-4 | pages=51–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhindranwale then joined the Akali Dal to launch the [[Dharam Yudh Morcha]] in 1982, to implement Anandpur Sahib resolution. Bhindranwale had risen to prominence in the Sikh political circle with his policy of getting the [[Anandpur Resolution]] passed, failing which he wanted to declare a separate country of [[Khalistan]] as a [[homeland]] for Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Chand, Bhindranwale: Myth and Reality (New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House, 1984), p. 129. &lt;/ref&gt; Others demanded an autonomous state in India, based on the [[Anandpur Sahib Resolution]]. Many Sikhs condemned the militants' actions.&lt;ref name="JCSP1992"&gt;{{cite book | author1=J. C. Aggarwal | author2=S. P.

He also increased the level of rhetoric on the perceived "assault" on Sikh values from the Hindu community.&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal77"/&gt; Bhindranwale and his followers started carrying firearms at all times.&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal77"/&gt; In 1983, to escape arrest, he along with his militant cadre occupied and fortified the sikh shrine [[Akal Takht]].&lt;ref name="MuniTerrorism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muni |first1=S.

By 1983, the situation in Punjab was volatile. In October, Sikh militants stopped a bus and shot six passengers. On the same day, another group killed two officials on a train.&lt;ref name="Robert2008"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Robert L. Hardgrave | author2=Stanley A.

During the five months before Operation Blue Star, from 1 January to 3 June 1984, 298 people were killed in violent incidents across Punjab. In the five days preceding the operation, 48 people were killed by violence.&lt;ref name="Robert2008"/&gt;{{rp|175}} In the violent events leading up to the Operation Blue Star since the inception of [[Akali Dharm Yudh Morcha]], the militants had killed 165 Hindus and Nirankaris, even 39 Sikhs opposed to Bhindranwale were killed.

After the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]] on 31 October 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards, anti-Sikh riots erupted the following day. They continued in some areas for several days, killing more than 3,000 Sikhs in New Delhi and an estimated 8,000 or more in 40 cities across India by the anti-Sikh mobs.&lt;ref name="2009BBCremember"/&gt; Sultanpuri, [[Mangol Puri (Delhi Assembly constituency)|Mangolpuri]], [[Trilokpuri (Delhi Assembly constituency)|Trilokpuri]], and other [[East Delhi|Trans-Yamuna]] areas of Delhi were the worst affected. Perpetrators carried iron rods, knives, clubs, and combustible material (including kerosene and petrol). They entered Sikh neighbourhoods, killing Sikhs indiscriminately and destroying shops and houses. Armed mobs stopped buses and trains in and near Delhi, pulling off Sikh passengers for lynching; some were burnt alive. Others were dragged from their homes and hacked to death, and Sikh women were reportedly gang-raped and Sikhs also had acid thrown on them.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Jaspreet, "India's pogrom, 1984", ''[[International New York Times]]'', 31 October 2014, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20141102/pers.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Perspective|website=www.tribuneindia.com|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night of 31 October, before the massacres began, assailants used the lists to mark Sikh houses with an "S".&lt;ref name="Citizens for Democracy"/&gt; Because most mob members were illiterate, Congress Party officials provided help reading the lists and leading the mobs to Sikh homes and businesses in other neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; With the lists, the mobs could pinpoint the location of Sikhs they otherwise would have missed.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

Sikh men not at home were easily identified by their turbans and beards, and Sikh women were identified by their dress. In some cases, the mobs returned to locations where they knew Sikhs were hiding because of the lists. Amar Singh escaped the initial attack on his house by having a Hindu neighbour drag him into the neighbour's house and announce that he was dead. A group of 18 assailants later came looking for his body; when his neighbour said that his body had been taken away, an assailant showed him a list and said: "Look, Amar Singh's name has not been struck off from the list, so his body has not been taken away."&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

The government allegedly destroyed evidence and shielded the guilty. ''[[Asian Age]]'', an Indian daily newspaper, ran a front-page story calling the government actions "the mother of all cover-ups".&lt;ref name=coverup-1&gt;{{cite web|last=Mustafa |first=Seema |title=1984 Sikh Massacres: Mother of All Cover-ups |url=http://www.sikhtimes.com/news_080905b.html |work=The Sikh Times |publisher=The Asian Age |accessdate=29 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307223021/http://www.sikhtimes.com/news_080905b.html |archivedate=7 March 2013 |deadurl=no |date=9 August 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice delayed, justice denied |date=11 August 2005 |first=Renu |last=Agal |accessdate=29 May 2014 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4141524.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426040021/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4141524.stm |archive-date=26 April 2011 |deadurl=no |publisher=BBC News |location=Delhi |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 31 October 1984 to 10 November 1984 the [[People's Union for Democratic Rights]] and the [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] conducted an inquiry into the riots, interviewing victims, police officers, neighbours of the victims, army personnel and political leaders. In their joint report, "[[Who Are The Guilty]]", the groups concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt; The attacks on members of the Sikh Community in Delhi and its suburbs during the period, far from being a spontaneous expression of "madness" and of popular "grief and anger" at Mrs. Gandhi's assassination as made out to be by the authorities, were the outcome of a well organised plan marked by acts of both deliberate commissions and omissions by important politicians of the Congress (I) at the top and by authorities in the administration.&lt;ref name="Mukhoty 1984"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to eyewitness accounts obtained by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, [[Department of Police, Delhi|Delhi police]] looked on as "rioters murdered and raped, having gotten access to voter records that allowed them to mark Sikh homes with large Xs, and large mobs being bused in to large Sikh settlements".&lt;ref name="Mridu Khullar"&gt;{{cite news |title=India's 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots: Waiting for Justice |author= Mridu Khullar |newspaper=Time |date=28 October 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1931635-2,00.html | accessdate=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' reported that the riots led to only minor arrests, with no major politicians or police officers convicted. The magazine quoted Ensaaf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensaaf.org/about/|title=Ensaaf › About Us|publisher=ensaaf.org|access-date=8 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117181133/http://www.ensaaf.org/about/#|archive-date=17 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Indian human-rights organisation, as saying that the government attempted to destroy evidence of its involvement by refusing to record [[First Information Report]]s.&lt;ref name="Mridu Khullar"/&gt;

A 1991 Human Rights Watch report on violence between [[Khalistan movement|Sikh separatists]] and the [[Government of India]] traced part of the problem to government response to the violence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite numerous credible eye-witness accounts that identified many of those involved in the violence,  including police and politicians, in the months following the killings, the government sought no prosecutions or indictments of any persons, including officials, accused in any case of murder, rape or arson.&lt;ref name="Patricia Gossman 1991"&gt;{{Citation |title=Punjab in Crisis |url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA918.PDF |author=Patricia Gossman |year=1991 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] | accessdate=4 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The violence was allegedly led (and often perpetrated) by Indian National Congress activists and sympathizers. The Congress-led government was widely criticised for doing little at the time and possibly conspiring in the riots, since voter lists were used to identify Sikh families.&lt;ref name="Swadesh Bahadur Singh 1996"/&gt;

A few days after the massacre, many surviving Sikh youths in Delhi had joined or created Sikh militant groups. This led to more violence in the Punjab, including the assassination of several senior Congress Party members. The [[Khalistan Commando Force]] and [[Khalistan Liberation Force]] claimed responsibility for the retaliation, and an underground network was established.

On 31 July 1985, [[Harjinder Singh Jinda]], [[Sukhdev Singh Sukha]] and Ranjit Singh Gill of the Khalistan Commando Force assassinated Congress Party leader and MP [[Lalit Maken]] in retaliation for the riots. The 31-page report, "Who Are The Guilty?", listed 227 people who led the mobs; Maken was third on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl2007/stories/20030411002004500.htm |title=A life sentence |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |accessdate=23 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429183514/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl2007/stories/20030411002004500.htm |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harjinder Singh Jinda and Sukhdev Singh Sukha assassinated Congress Party leader Arjan Dass because of his involvement in the riots. Dass' name appeared in affidavits submitted by Sikh victims to the [[Nanavati Commission]], headed by retired [[Supreme Court of India]] judge [[G.&amp;nbsp;T. Nanavati]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mha.nic.in/Nanavati-I.pdf mha.nic.in] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411105427/http://www.mha.nic.in/Nanavati-I.pdf |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convictions ===

In Delhi, 442 rioters were convicted. Forty-nine were sentenced to the [[life imprisonment]], and another three to more than 10 years' imprisonment. Six Delhi police officers were sanctioned for negligence during the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/442-convicted-in-various-anti-Sikh-riots-cases-Delhi-Police/Article1-875466.aspx | title = 442 convicted in various anti-Sikh riots cases: Delhi Police | date = 20 June 2012 | accessdate = 29 August 2012 | newspaper = Hindustan Times | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120908154651/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/442-convicted-in-various-anti-Sikh-riots-cases-Delhi-Police/Article1-875466.aspx | archive-date = 8 September 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the appeal of three people who had challenged their life sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/325083/apex-court-upholds-life-term.html | title = Apex court upholds life term for 3 in anti-Sikh riots | date = 9 April 2013 | accessdate = 9 April 2013 | newspaper = Deccan Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, the Karkardooma district court in Delhi convicted five people – Balwan Khokkar (former councillor), Mahender Yadav (former [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]]), Kishan Khokkar, Girdhari Lal and Captain Bhagmal – for inciting a mob against Sikhs in [[Delhi Cantonment]]. The court acquitted Congress leader [[Sajjan Kumar]], which led to protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/court-to-pronounce-verdict-on-sajjan-kumar-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots-case/1/268419.html | title = Sajjan Kumar acquitted in anti-Sikh riots case | date = 30 April 2013 | accessdate = 30 April 2013 | newspaper = The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first ever case of capital punishment in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case death sentence was awarded to Yashpal Singh convicted for murdering two persons, 24-year old Hardev Singh and 26-year old Avtar Singh, in Mahipal Pur area of Delhi on November 1, 1984. Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Pandey pronounced the Judgement on  November 20, 34 years after the crime was committed. The second convict in the case, Naresh Sehrawat was awarded life imprisonment. The Court considered the failing health of 68-year old Sehrawat while giving him a lighter sentence. The conviction followed a complaint by the deceased Hardev Singh's elder brother Santokh Singh. Though an FIR was filed on the same day of the crime nothing came of the case as a Congress leader, JP Singh, who led the mob was acquitted in the case. A fresh FIR was filed on April 29, 1993, following recommendations of the Ranganath Commission of inquiry. The police closed the matter as untraced despite witness testimonies of the deceased's four brothers who were witness to the crime. The case was reopened by the Special Investigation Team constituted by the BJP-led NDA government on February 12, 2015. The SIT completed the investigation in record time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/second-death-sentence-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots/686578.html/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/delhi-court-awards-death-penalty-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots-case-chronology-of-events-1394041&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==

Ten commissions or committees have been formed to investigate the riots. The most recent, headed by Justice G. T. Nanavati, submitted its 185-page report to Home Minister [[Shivraj Patil]] on 9 February 2005; the report was tabled in Parliament on 8 August of that year. The commissions below are listed in chronological order. Many of the accused were acquitted or never formally charged.

===Marwah Commission===

The Marwah Commission was appointed in November 1984. [[Ved Marwah]], Additional Commissioner of Police, was tasked with enquiring into the role of the police during the riots. Many of the accused Delhi Police officers were tried in the [[Delhi High Court]]. As Marwah was completing his inquiry in mid-1985, he was abruptly directed by the [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Home Ministry]] not to proceed further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20071103/delhi.htm#1 |title=Police didn't help victims |work=The Tribune |location=India |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marwah Commission records were appropriated by the government, and most (except for Marwah's handwritten notes) were later given to the Misra Commission.

===Misra Commission===
The Misra Commission was appointed in May 1985; Justice Rangnath Misra was a judge on the Supreme Court of India. Misra submitted his report in August 1986, and the report was made public in February 1987. In his report, he said that it was not part of his [[terms of reference]] to identify any individual and recommended the formation of three committees.

The commission and its report was criticised as biased by the People's Union for Civil Liberties and [[Human Rights Watch]]. According to a Human Rights Watch report on the commission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It recommended no criminal prosecution of any individual,  and it cleared all high-level officials of directing the pogroms. In its findings, the commission did acknowledge that many of the victims testifying before it had received threats from local police.   While the commission noted that there had been "widespread lapses" on the part of the police, it concluded that "the allegations before the commission about the conduct of the police are more of indifference and negligence during the riots than of any wrongful overt act."&lt;ref name="Patricia Gossman 1991"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The People's Union for Civil Liberties criticised the Misra Commission for concealing information on the accused while disclosing the names and addresses of victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Justice Denied|year=1987 |publisher=People's Union for Civil Liberties and People's Union for Democratic Right }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kapur Mittal Committee===

The Kapur Mittal Committee was appointed in February 1987 at the recommendation of the Misra Commission to enquire into the role of the police; the Marwah Commission had almost completed a police inquiry in 1985 when the government asked that committee not to continue. This committee consisted of Justice Dalip Kapur and Kusum Mittal, retired Secretary of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It submitted its report in 1990, and 72 police officers were cited for conspiracy or gross negligence. Although the committee recommended the dismissal of 30 of the 72 officers, none have been punished.

===Jain Banerjee Committee===
The Jain Banerjee Committee was recommended by the Misra Commission for the registration of cases. The committee consisted of former Delhi High Court judge M. L. Jain and retired [[Inspector General of Police]] A. K. Banerjee.

In its report, the Misra Commission stated that many cases (particularly those involving political leaders or police officers) had not been registered. Although the Jain Banerjee Committee recommended the registration of cases against Sajjan Kumar in August 1987, no case was registered.

In November 1987, press reports criticised the government for not registering cases despite the  committee's recommendation. The following month, Brahmanand Gupta (accused with Sajjan Kumar) filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court and obtained a [[stay of proceedings]] against the committee which was not opposed by the government. The [[Citizen's Justice Committee]] filed an application to [[Vacated judgment|vacate]] the stay. The writ petition was decided in August 1989 and the high court abolished the committee. An appeal was filed by the Citizen's Justice Committee in the Supreme Court of India.

===Potti Rosha Committee===

The Potti Rosha Committee was appointed in March 1990 by the [[V. P. Singh]] government as a successor to the Jain Banerjee Committee. In August 1990, the committee issued recommendations for filing cases based on affidavits submitted by victims of the violence; there was one against Sajjan Kumar. When a [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] team went to Kumar's home to file the charges, his supporters held and threatened them if they persisted in pursuing Kumar. When the committee's term expired in September 1990, Potti and Rosha&lt;!-- First names would be helpful. --&gt; decided to end their inquiry.

===Jain Aggarwal Committee===

The Jain Aggarwal Committee was appointed in December 1990 as a successor to the Potti Rosha Committee. It consisted of Justice J. D. Jain and retired Uttar Pradesh [[director general of police]] D. K. Aggarwal. The committee recommended the registration of cases against [[H. K. L. Bhagat]], Sajjan Kumar, [[Dharamdas Shastri]] and [[Jagdish Tytler]].

It suggested establishing two or three special investigating teams in the [[Delhi Police]] under a [[Superintendent of police (India)|deputy commissioner of police]], supervised by an [[Deputy inspector general of police|additional commissioner of police]] answerable to the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|CID]], and a review of the work-load of the three special courts set up to deal with the riot cases. The appointment of special prosecutors to deal the cases was also discussed. The committee was wound up in August 1993, but the cases it recommended were not registered by the police.

===Ahuja Committee===

The Ahuja Committee was the third committee recommended by the Misra Commission to determine the total number of deaths in Delhi. According to the committee, which submitted its report in August 1987, 2,733 Sikhs were killed in the city.

===Dhillon Committee===

The Dhillon Committee, headed by [[Gurdial Singh Dhillon]], was appointed in 1985 to recommend measures for the rehabilitation of victims. The committee submitted its report by the end of the year.{{vague|date=August 2017}} One major recommendation was that businesses with insurance coverage whose claims were denied should receive compensation as directed by the government. Although the committee recommended ordering the (nationalised) insurance companies to pay the claims, the government did not accept its recommendation and the claims were not paid.

===Narula Committee===
The Narula Committee was appointed in December 1993 by the [[Madan Lal Khurana]]-led BJP government in [[Delhi]]. One recommendation of the committee was to convince the central government to impose sanctions.

Khurana took up the matter with the central government, which in the middle of 1994, the Central Government decided that the matter did not fall within its purview and sent the case to the lieutenant governor of Delhi. It took two years for the [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] government to decide that it did not fall within its purview.

The Narasimha Rao Government further delayed the case. The committee submitted its report in January 1994, recommending the registration of cases against H. K. L. Bhagat and Sajjan Kumar. Despite the central-government delay, the CBI filed the charge sheet in December 1994.

===The Nanavati Commission===
The [[Nanavati Commission]] was established in 2000 after some dissatisfaction was expressed with previous reports.&lt;ref name="bbc_incited"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4130962.stm|title=Leaders 'incited' anti-Sikh riots|publisher=[[BBC]]| date = 8 August 2005 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nanavati Commission was appointed by a unanimous resolution passed in the [[Rajya Sabha]]. This commission was headed by [[G.T. Nanavati|Justice G.T. Nanavati]], retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India. The commission submitted its report in February 2004. The commission reported that recorded accounts from victims and witnesses "indicate that local Congress leaders and workers had either incited or helped the mobs in attacking the Sikhs".&lt;ref name="bbc_incited"/&gt; Its report also found evidence against Jagdish Tytler "to the effect that very probably he had a hand in organising attacks on Sikhs".&lt;ref name="bbc_incited"/&gt; It also recommended that Sajjan Kumar's involvement in the rioting required a closer look. The commission's report also cleared [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and other high ranking [[Congress (I)]] party members of any involvement in organising riots against Sikhs. It did find, however, that the [[Delhi Police]] fired about 392 rounds of bullets, arrested approximately 372 persons, and "remained passive and did not provide protection to the people" throughout the rioting.&lt;ref name="bbc_incited"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nanavati"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report:Justice Nanavati Commission of Inquiry|url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/Nanavati-I_eng.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=27 April 2012|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217234430/http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/Nanavati-I_eng.pdf|archive-date=17 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Jagdish Tytler===
[[File:Jagdish Tytler.jpg|thumb|alt=A smiling Jagdish Tytler|216px|Tytler in 2010]]
The Central Bureau of Investigation closed all cases against [[Jagdish Tytler]] in November 2007 for his alleged criminal conspiracy to engineer riots against Sikhs in the aftermath of [[Indira Gandhi]]'s assassination. The bureau submitted a report to the Delhi court that no evidence or witness was found to corroborate allegations that Tytler led murderous mobs during 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7149322.stm |title=Fresh probe into India politician |publisher=BBC News |date=18 December 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged in court that Tytler – then an MP – complained to his supporters about the relatively-"small" number of Sikhs killed in his constituency ([[Delhi Sadar (Lok Sabha constituency)|Delhi Sadar]]), which he thought had undermined his position in the Congress Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20071219/main1.htm |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India – Main News |work=The Tribune |location=India |accessdate=23 September 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090207115707/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20071219/main1.htm |archivedate = 7 February 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007 a witness, Dushyant Singh (then living in [[California]]), appeared on several private television news channels in India saying that he was never contacted by the CBI. The opposition [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) demanded an explanation in [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] from Minister of State for Personnel [[Suresh Pachouri]], who was in charge of the CBI. Pachouri, who was present, refused to make a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-11-30/india/27986032_1_anti-sikh-riots-bjp-members-key-witness |title=BJP to govt: Clear stand on anti-Sikh riots' witness |work=The Times of India |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of the Delhi Court Sanjeev Jain, who had dismissed the case against Tytler after the CBI submitted a misleading report, ordered the CBI to reopen cases against Tytler related to the riots on 18 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-12-18/india/27992363_1_case-against-congress-leader-riots-case-jagdish-tytler |title=1984 riots: CBI to re-investigate Tytler's role |work=The Times of India |date=18 December 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008 a two-member CBI team went to New York to record statements from Jasbir Singh and Surinder Singh, two eyewitnesses. The witnesses said that they saw Tytler lead a mob during the riot, but did not want to return to India because they feared for their safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/anti-sikh-riots-witness-to-give-statement-to-cbi-in-us/81216-3.html |title=Anti Sikh riots witness to give statement to CBI in US |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They blamed the CBI for not conducting a fair trial, accusing the bureau of protecting Tytler.

In March 2009, the CBI cleared Tytler amidst protests from Sikhs and the opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/cbi-gives-tytler-clean-chit-in-1984-riots-case/442552/ |title=CBI gives Tytler clean chit in 1984 riots case |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=3 April 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April, Sikh ''[[Dainik Jagran]]'' reporter [[Jarnail Singh (journalist)|Jarnail Singh]] threw his shoe at [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Home Minister]] [[P. Chidambaram]] to protest the clearing of Tytler and Sajjan Kumar. Because of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Chidambaram did not press charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/C40A9A14F90E819A6525759100479796?OpenDocument:Chidambaram faces shoe missile from scribe]{{Dead link|date=June 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, over 500 protesters from Sikh organisations throughout India gathered outside the court which was scheduled to hear the CBI's plea to close the case against Tytler. Later in the day, Tytler announced that he was withdrawing from the Lok Sabha elections to avoid embarrassing his party. This forced the Congress Party to cut the Tytler and Sajjan Kumar Lok Sabha tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Smriti Singh |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-09/india/28035281_1_gurudwara-pulbangash-anti-sikh-riots-case-sikhs-protest |title=Sikhs protest outside court hearing Tytler case |work=The Times of India  |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2013, the Delhi court ordered the CBI to reopen the 1984 case against Tytler. The court ordered the bureau to investigate the killing of three people in the riot case, of which Tytler had been cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Anti-Sikh-riots-case-against-Jagdish-Tytler-reopened/Article1-1040274.aspx|title= Anti-Sikh riots case against Jagdish Tytler reopened|access-date= 10 April 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130410170210/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Anti-Sikh-riots-case-against-Jagdish-Tytler-reopened/Article1-1040274.aspx|archive-date= 10 April 2013|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The [[Delhi]] riots have been the subject of several films and novels:
* The 2005 English film ''[[Amu (film)|Amu]]'', by [[Shonali Bose]] and starring [[Konkona Sen Sharma]] and [[Brinda Karat]], is based on [[Shonali Bose]]'s novel of the same name. The film tells the story of a girl, orphaned during the riots, who reconciles with her adoption years later. Although it won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in English]], it was censored in India but was released on DVD without the cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bilkis Bano: 'I Want Justice, Not Revenge, I Want My Daughters to Grow Up in a Safe India'|url=https://thewire.in/133493/i-want-justice-not-revenge-bilkis-bano-expresses-gratitude-to-mumbai-high-court/|accessdate=10 May 2017|publisher=The Wire|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The 2004 Hindi film ''[[Kaya Taran]]'' (''Chrysalis''), directed by Shashi Kumar and starring [[Seema Biswas]], is based on the [[Malayalam]] short story "[[When Big Tree Falls]]" by [[N.S. Madhavan]]. The film revolves around a Sikh woman and her young son, who took shelter in a  Meerut nunnery during the riots.
* The 2003 Bollywood film ''[[Hawayein]]'', a project of [[Babbu Maan]] and [[Ammtoje Mann]], is based on the aftermath of Indira Gandhi's assassination, the 1984 riots and the subsequent victimisation of the Punjabi people.

* [[Khushwant Singh]] and [[Kuldip Nayar]]'s book, ''Tragedy of Punjab: Operation Bluestar &amp; After'', focuses on the events surrounding the riots.
* Jarnail Singh's non-fiction book, ''I Accuse'', describes incidents which occurred during the riots.
* Uma Chakravarthi and Nandita Hakser's book, ''The Delhi Riots: Three Days in the Life of a Nation'', has interviews with victims of the Delhi riots.
*[[H. S. Phoolka]] and human-rights activist and journalist Manoj Mitta wrote the first account of the riots, ''When a Tree Shook Delhi''.
*The 2014 Punjabi film, ''[[Punjab 1984]]'' with [[Diljit Dosanjh]], is based on the aftermath of Indira Gandhi's assassination, the riots and the subsequent victimisation of the Punjabi people.
*The 2016 Bollywood film, ''[[31st October (film)|31st October]]'' with [[Vir Das]], is based on the riots.
*The 2016 [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] film, ''[[Dharam Yudh Morcha (film)|Dharam Yudh Morcha]]'', is based on the riots.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}{{wiktionary|adultcentrism}}
'''Adultcentrism''' is the [[exaggerated]] [[egocentrism]] of adults,&lt;ref&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994). Convention on the rights of the child: Background, motivation, strategies, main themes. Leuven/Apeldoorn: Garant.&lt;/ref&gt; including the belief that an adult perspective is inherently better (when compared to children). It is used to describe the conditions facing [[children]] and [[youth]] in [[school]]s, [[home]]s, and [[community]] settings; however, adultcentrism is not always based on a notion of being [[Good and evil|good or bad]],&lt;ref&gt;Petyr, C. (1992) "Adultcentrism to practice with children," ''Families in Society. 73''(3) p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[adultism]].

==Definition==
In [[social work]], adultcentrism has been recognized as the potential bias adults have in understanding and responding to children.&lt;ref&gt;Goode, D. (1986) "Kids, culture and innocents." ''Journal of Human Studies. 9''(1) pp83-106.&lt;/ref&gt; This bias is said to extend from the difference in age between the child and the adult. The differences—including [[language]], [[Interpersonal communication|communication styles]] and world view—can create a hurdle to overcome.  Rather than allowing the adult to simply share their view, adultcentrism acknowledges the powerlessness and inability of young people to actually affect the systems of authority adults have created.&lt;ref&gt;http://commonaction.blogspot.ca/2007/08/adultcentrism-in-schools.html&lt;/ref&gt; This creates barriers to effective practice with children;&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1993-11298-001&lt;/ref&gt; adultcentrism is said to be akin to [[egocentrism]], where one puts their personal perspectives, needs and beliefs ahead of all others, as well as [[ethnocentrism]], which places a person's cultural and social beliefs ahead of all others.&lt;ref&gt;Petr, C. (1992). "Adultcentrism in practice with children," ''Families in Society. 73'', pp408-416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petr, C. (2003) ''Social Work with Children and Their Families: Pragmatic Foundations.'' Oxford University Press. p13&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining adultcentrism, one author reports,

{{blockquote|Adultcentrism contributes to the ongoing difficulty which agencies experience in incorporating into their modus operandi the practice of routine consultation with children about decisions that affect their lives—even after training and policy development about children's rights and participation has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Kiraly, M (n.d.) [http://www.childrenuk.co.uk/chnov2001/chnov2001/kiraly.html "What's wrong with child welfare? An examination of current practices that harm children"], ''Children Webmag.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Areas of usage==
In the field of [[occupational therapy]] adultcentrism has been said to "lead researchers to underestimate children's abilities."&lt;ref&gt;Royeen, C.B. (2004) ''Pediatric Issues in Occupational Therapy: A Compendium of Leading Scholarship'' American Occupational Therapy Association. p38.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one researcher, "This stance can be seen when researchers assume they know everything they need to know about children because they have been children." Research has also shown this leads adults to stay within their own perspective, thus discriminating against children through [[adultism]].&lt;ref&gt;Fine, M. (1987) "Why urban adolescents drop into and out of public high school." In ''School Dropouts: Patterns and Policies,'' G. Natriello, ed. New York: Teachers College Press, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt; In respect to occupational therapy, "Adultcentrism has emerged in the [[family therapy]] literature to describe the tendency by adults to view the world from an adult perspective and in so doing not understand or appreciate how children and young people are viewing things."&lt;ref&gt;(1996) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050617113915/http://acys.utas.edu.au/nyars/pdfs/pdfs-homelessness/h-ch2.pdf "Chapter 2, Homelessness and Early Home Leaving: Prevention and early intervention]," in ''Homelessness among young people in Australia.'' Hobart, Australia: National Clearinghouse for Youth Studies. p8&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultcentrism is also growing in importance in the fields of [[school|education]],&lt;ref&gt;Martino, W. and Pallotta-Chiarolli, M. (2003) ''So What’s A Boy? Addressing Issues of Masculinity and Schooling.'' Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental health]],&lt;ref&gt;Helton, L., Kotake, M (2004) ''Mental Health Practice with Children and Youth: A Strengths and Well-Being Model.'' Hayworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[community sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. (2001) ''Research in Community Sociology: Supplement 1 - the Community of the Streets'' Elsevier Limited. p60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[empowerment|children's empowerment]]&lt;ref&gt;Howe, B. &amp; Covell, K. (2005) ''Empowering Children: Children's Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship.'' University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One [[international relations|international affairs]] specialist reflects that,

{{blockquote|Children, according to the pillar of adultcentrism, are seen as "the future" and are therefore not yet full human beings capable of making choices. The elderly are considered "past their prime" and are often seen as a burden on society.&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, T. (2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070825202111/http://www.escueladeformacion.org/timjun06.htm Dominican Republic] Justicia Global.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this notion "education leaders, teachers, school board members and reform advocates... call for the same improvements, the same tasks, and the same accountabilities that have been always called for; increased standardization, decreased student motivation, and increased teacher attrition."&lt;ref&gt;http://commonaction.blogspot.ca/2007/08/adultcentrism-in-schools.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing number of [[List of youth empowerment organizations|youth empowerment organizations]] and [[:Category:Youth-led organizations|youth-led organizations]] identify adultcentrism as central to their analysis, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) ''Washington Youth Voice Handbook.'' Olympia, WA: CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt; One such organization, the [[National Youth Rights Association]], identifies that adultcentrism causes society to,

{{blockquote|...The word "human" evokes the mental image of an adult -- you need to specify if you are talking about a youth. ...The field of "psychology" deals with adults; the study of young people is qualified as "developmental" psychology. ...Stairs, light switches, buses, toilets, the international symbols for "men" and "women" on bathroom doors -- are all designed with adults in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnichsen, S. (n.d.) ''[http://www.youthrights.org/threetypes.php Three types of youth liberation.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201231951/http://www.youthrights.org/threetypes.php |date=February 1, 2011 }}'' Washington, DC: National Youth Rights Association.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Afrapix''' was a collective agency of amateur and professional [[photographer]]s who opposed [[Apartheid in South Africa]] and documented South Africa in the 1980s. The group was established in 1982 and dissolved itself in 1991.

== About Afrapix ==
Afrapix was independently funded by its members, who were both black and white. The group received both national and international feedback, as their photographs were used across the world. Oxfam used photographs by a number of Afrapix members to illustrate their 1990 publication 'We Cry for our Land: Farmworkers in South Africa', and some Afrapix pictures were also used in Oxfam's 'Front Line Africa: The Right to a Future' (1990). Afrapix members photographed their own projects and also conducted [[workshop]]s in black communities that focused on photography and literacy through artwork. Afrapix members shared their technical knowledge while mentoring individuals in these areas.

As the period was known as the “struggle years,” the photographs and projects produced through Afrapix were labeled as “struggle photography.” Many of the photographers considered themselves political activists or had a [[political agenda]], and worked to raise awareness about the evils of apartheid. The various artists of Afrapix agreed that they were a team working against apartheid, but that their inspirations came from different places.

Many of the images were of rallies or protests, instances of [[Police brutality|authority brutality]], and impoverished areas. Kylie Thomas suggests that the history of social documentary photography in the Afrapix period is probably more complex and heterogenous than often suggested, especially when analysing the work of women photographers such as Gille De Vlieg&lt;ref&gt;Kylie Thomas, "[http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0259-01902012000100010&amp;script=sci_arttext Wounding apertures: Violence, affect and photography during and after apartheid]", ''Kronos'' 38 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and Gisèle Wulfsohn.&lt;ref&gt;Annabelle Wienand, "[http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0259-01902012000100009&amp;script=sci_arttext Portraits, publics and politics: Gisele Wulfsohn's photographs of HIV/AIDS, 1987–2007]", ''Kronos'' 38 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/afrapix-timeline-1978-1991 Afrapix timeline 1978–1991]", South Africa History Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed timeline of Afrapix is accessible at the SA History Online website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/afrapix-timeline-1978-1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles and Objectives ==
Paul Weinberg, one of the co-founders of Afrapix, said that Afrapix aimed to be "an agency and a picture library and to stimulate documentary photography" (see 'Art and the End of Apartheid', Peffer, 2009, p.254) and also set this in the context of the day:
&lt;blockquote&gt;photography can't be divorced from the political, social issues that surround us daily. As photographers we are inextricably caught up in those processes-we are not objective instruments but play a part in the way we choose to make our statements.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Paul Weinberg, ''South Africa through the Lens: Social Documentary Photography'', Braamfontein, S. A.: Ravan Press 1983. via Krantz, David L.  Politics and Photography in Apartheid South Africa. ''History of Photography'', Volume 32, Number 4. Winter 2008. Retrieved 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conflicts ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
The photographers put themselves at risk each time they worked, given that authority figures might beat or even shoot them. 

While working in [[Township (South Africa)|townships]], their works were confiscated at times. The facilities of some Afrapix members were [[pillage]]d. Surveillance by Security Police made situations difficult. Photographers could also be detained extralegally.

Since there was no single person or persons in charge of Afrapix, there were contrasts of perspectives and ideas amongst the members. Due to this, disagreements occurred and the eventual split between the more political side and the individual documentary side, which would later be called [[Southlight]].

There were also many criticisms of the Afrapix movement. It was viewed negatively by some who thought the group only showed black Africans as powerless. Various Afrapix photographers themselves said they felt pressured to fulfill [[stereotype]]s through their images.

The '''Antigonish Movement''' blended [[adult education]], [[co-operatives]], [[microfinance]] and [[rural community development]] to help small, resource-based communities around Canada’s [[Maritimes]] improve their economic and social circumstances. A group of priests and educators, including Father [[Jimmy Tompkins (priest)|Jimmy Tompkins]], Father [[Moses Coady]], Rev. Hugh MacPherson and A.B. MacDonald led this movement from a base at the ''Extension Department'' at [[St. Francis Xavier University]] (St. F.X.) in [[Antigonish]], [[Nova Scotia]].

The [[credit union]] systems of Nova Scotia, [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island|PEI]] owe their origins to the Antigonish Movement, which also had an important influence on other provincial systems across Canada. The  [[Coady International Institute]] at St. F.X. has been instrumental in developing credit unions and in [[asset-based community development]] initiatives in developing countries ever since.

==Goals==
As educators and priests, the leaders of the Antigonish Movement were primarily concerned with human and spiritual development.  The title of Moses Coady’s only book – ''Masters of Their Own Destiny''&lt;ref&gt;[http://coady.stfx.ca/coady-library/MOD.pdf Coady, ''Masters of Their Own Destiny'']&lt;/ref&gt; – encapsulates this desire to see ordinary Nova Scotians achieve economic and social freedom.

However Coady argued that for practical reasons "we consider it good pedagogy and good psychology to begin with the economic phase ... that we may more readily attain the spiritual and cultural towards which all our efforts are directed."&lt;ref&gt;Moses Coady.  ''Masters of Their Own Destiny:  The Story of the Antigonish Movement of Adult Education Through Economic Cooperation.''  Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, New York, 1939, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary Nova Scotians he argued, had only themselves to blame for their [[poverty]] and vulnerability. They had permitted money and business to become mysterious forces outside of their control. Fishers and farmers for example, were exploited by marketing middlemen.  Everyone was exploited by moneylenders. If they took the time to understand their circumstances and took the risks of co-operative action, they could achieve economic security and on that foundation greater freedom and self-realization. In a vision that has been renewed today in digital forms of [[mass collaboration]], Coady argued that "the only hope of democracy is that enough noble, independent, energetic souls may be found who are prepared to work overtime, without pay" in order to shape a free and prosperous society.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Coady.  ''Masters of Their Own Destiny'', 1939, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of [[co-operatives]] in [[Nova Scotia]] go back to a cooperative store in [[Stellarton]], founded in 1861. Co-operative creameries and fruit-growers co-ops were established by farmers to free them from exploitative middleman in the 1890s. Many early co-ops failed due to "poor management, domination by a few individuals and a lack of ongoing education."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Lotz.  ''The Humble Giant: Moses Coady, Canada's Rural Revolutionary.'' Novalis, Ottawa, 2005, pp. 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ''British Canadian Co-operative Society'', a co-op store in [[Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia]], set an example of sound co-operation. By 1917 it has 1,220 members and over $500,000 in sales.  That year, it organized a conference on co-ops. The conference, which featured Ontario co-operative pioneer [[George Keen]] as keynote speaker, renewed local energy and enthusiasm for the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Ian MacPherson.  ''Building and Protecting the Co-operative Movement:  A Brief History of the Co-operative Union of Canada, 1909-84''.  Co-operative Union of Canada, Ottawa, 1984, pp. 46–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult education was the spirit of the movement, and Coady credits Dr. Hugh MacPherson and Rev. Jimmy Tompkins at St. F.X. with their early roles as "pioneer extension workers at the University interested in both adult education and economic cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;Moses Coady.  ''Masters of Their Own Destiny'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jimmy Tompkins==
{{main|Jimmy Tompkins (priest)}}

Father Jimmy Tompkins played a key role in concocting the "intellectual dynamite" that was later set off in almost every village in the Maritimes.

Tompkins began teaching at St. F.X. in 1902. As vice-president of the university he attended the ''Conference of British Empire Universities'' in London, England in 1912, and returned filled with ideas for ways that the university could become more involved in solving rural economic problems through adult education. British [[Workers Educational Association]]s, the Danish [[Folk High School]]s, and Swedish [[Study circle|Study Circles]] particularly interested him. And in Canada, the [[University of Saskatchewan]]'s agricultural program, and [[Quebec|Quebec's]] agricultural colleges and [[credit unions]], caught his attention.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Alexander.  ''The Antigonish Movement:  Moses Coady and Adult Education Today.''  Thompson Educational Publishing, Toronto, 1997; pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tompkins had trouble making his case with the university’s administration, and in 1922, St. F.X. sent Tompkins into "exile" as village priest in [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]], Nova Scotia. This did not slow the determined priest down, however.  His approach to [[adult education]] in Canso triggered local action and a series of articles in ''The Halifax Chronicle'' which helped trigger a federal commission into the problems of the Maritime fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Welton, ''A new and disturbing presence:  Father Moses Michael Coady and the United Maritime Fishermen''.  In ''Canadian Co-operatives in the Year 2000'', Centre for the Study of Co-operatives, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, 2000, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1924 Tompkins organized the first of a series of annual conferences bringing together farmers, educators, students, priests and rural development experts. In 1928, seeking a more permanent organization, some of the leaders in this group launched a campaign that raised $100,000. This initiative, combined with the report of federal commission on the fisheries in 1928, prompted St. F.X. to support the formation of an Extension Department in 1928.

==Moses Coady==
{{main|Moses Coady}}

Moses Coady is generally credited with transforming the vision of his cousin Tompkins into an effective program capable of spreading across the Maritimes.

The defining moment in Coady's career came when he testified before a Canadian government commission in 1927. Drawing on his own experience and that of other movement leaders he maintained that the local economy could be revitalized if the right type of learning was cultivated in ordinary people: especially critical thinking, scientific methods of planning and production, and co-operative entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;Welton, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report of the [[MacLean Commission]] was catalytic:  in late 1928 St. F.X. organized an Extension Department to carry adult education to the people of the province, appointing Coady as its first director. The Canadian Department of Fisheries asked Coady to help the government "organize the fishermen".

Coady also invested considerable energy in catalyzing and strengthening wholesale co-operatives around the Maritimes:  including the ''United Maritime Fishermen'', the ''United Fruit Companies'' and the ''Canadian Livestock Co-operatives'' (Maritimes).

==Adult education in action==
The Antigonish program of adult education employed three main components:
* the mass meeting,
* the study club, and
* the school for leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanson, Brenda Gail.  ''Adult educators in co-operative development:  agents of change.''  Centre for the Study of Co-operatives, University of Saskatchewan, p. 21-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass meetings===
The field staff of the Extension Department worked with local people to organize meetings in schools, churches, and community centres.

People who heard Coady speak at these meetings described his speeches as "fiery" and "energizing". Coady challenged his audience not to accept their poverty but to take action to understand their situation, and then to think and to plan to change it. As he said many times, "You can get the good life.  You’re poor enough to want it and smart enough to get it."  He would propose that they set up study clubs, and that those who could read help those who could not.

===Study clubs===
Study clubs typically met in members' homes, with the goal of understanding the factors keeping the members poor, to identify solutions, make plans, and take action.  The Extension Department provided pamphlets and technical material on matters like agricultural methods, business organization, economics, and co-operative principles. The clubs studied local newspaper articles and any other materials that could help them understand their situation better.

The leaders and ideas emerging from this process often carried it into the next stage – organizing co-operatives and taking other initiatives to solve local problems.

The Extension Department linked the study clubs together through a network called the ''Associated Study Clubs'', which facilitated information sharing and capitalized on the building momentum.

===School for leaders===
Once the first co-operatives began, the Extension Department organized a six-week program at the university with courses in co-operative business, book-keeping, mathematics, economics, public speaking, and citizenship.

The program was taught by successful co-operative leaders from around the province. The goal was to reduce the risks of business failure, and to invigorate the momentum in each community with fresh ideas.

The program was taken to the villages by Coady and A.B. MacDonald.  [[Roy Bergengren]], director of [[Credit Union National Association|Credit Union National of America]], dedicated his book, ''Credit Union North America'' to A.B. MacDonald, who he describes as "an extraordinary organizer and an inspired leader who is known in every city, town and fishing hamlet throughout the length and breadth of the province".  MacDonald went on to direct the Nova Scotia Credit Union League and then the [[Co-operative Union of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy F. Bergengren, ''Credit Union North America''.  Southern Publishers Inc., New York, 1940, pp. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-operative development==
Coady's biographer Jim Lotz gives an example of how the link between the Antigonish approach, community development and co-operatives worked in the village of [[Judique, Nova Scotia]].

{{quote|In 1932, the people of Judique formed 12 study clubs. Two years later they built a lobster factory.  Canned lobsters brought better returns than fresh groundfish that had to be sold to buyers on the wharf for any price they cared to offer. The 30 members of the Judique lobster co-op paid off the cost of their factory in two years. They built another one, then opened a credit union and co-op shop. The residents of the community told Coady’s staff that they were "much richer than we were a decade ago, both economically and spiritually. We have gained much confidence in ourselves through directing and managing our own affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1932 the Extension Department had sparked the formation of 179 study clubs with 1,500 members in Nova Scotia. Over the next six years, during the height of Coady and MacDonald's work in the villages, the number of study clubs rose to 1,110 with 10,000 participants.

By 1938 these study clubs had formed 142 credit unions, 39 co-operative stores, 17 co-operative lobster factories, 11 co-operative fish plants, and 11 other co-ops.&lt;ref&gt;Anne M. Alexander.  ''The Antigonish Movement'', 1997, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most important reason why the Antigonish movement was able to have a significant, lasting impact was its promotion of credit unions." &lt;ref&gt;MacPherson, 1979, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  The farmers, fishers, and miners who formed the backbone of the movement had little access to credit before the [[Great Depression]], and lost what little they had as the downturn started to bite. With the help of Roy Bergengren and the American credit union movement, Nova Scotia passed the first sound credit union legislation in English Canada in 1932.

==From Nova Scotia to the world==
[[File:Conférence de 1947 à Chéticamp.jpg|thumb|The conference of the [[cooperative movement]] in [[Chéticamp]], [[Nova Scotia]] ([[Canada]])]]

From its start in 1928, the Extension Department at St. Francis Xavier University was concerned with spreading its message well beyond Nova Scotia. It was particularly concerned about the other provinces in the [[Maritimes]].

For example, by 1936 there were 200 study clubs operating in [[New Brunswick]], and the legislature passed a credit union law that year. Wilfred Keohan, the New Brunswick Registrar of Credit Unions, wrote in 1939 that "There can be no doubt but that the experience in Nova Scotia had a marked influence as credit union enthusiasm knows no frontiers. The crystallized demand came from such bodies as the ''New Brunswick Council of Labour'', the ''Trades &amp; Labour Council'', the ''Farmer's and Dairyman's Association'', fishermen's organizations and members of the clergy who saw in credit unions an economic regeneration of their flocks." By 1939 ten thousand members were participating in 95 credit unions (including caisses populaires) in the province.&lt;ref&gt;Roy F. Bergengren, p. 250-51&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936 Coady and MacDonald were increasingly traveling beyond the Maritimes to [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[British Columbia]], where their speeches and ideas helped ignite local credit union movements. After Nova Scotia passed a credit union law in 1932, New Brunswick and PEI were the next to pass legislation (1936). By 1939 every province in Canada had a credit union movement and a legal framework to guide it.

Bergengren wrote in 1940 that "out of the Nova Scotia experience has come a new and most valuable study club technique that will have a far reaching effect on the whole future of the credit union movement." He credited the rapid expansion of credit unions to other provinces across Canada to the Antigonish movement.&lt;ref&gt;Bergengren, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Governors of St. Francis Xavier University established [[St. Francis Xavier University#The Coady International Institute|The Coady International Institute]] to honour Moses Coady less than six months after his death. The institute has played a role in the emergence of credit unions throughout the world, especially in Africa. Since then, over 7,000 community development practitioners from over 120 countries have studied at the campus in Antigonish.

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Moses Coady#Criticisms|}}
By the end of World War II the credit unions and co-operatives of the Maritimes were an acknowledged success, gaining international recognition. The study clubs for which the movement was noted declined however, and attention had shifted from human emancipation towards building stronger, more professional institutions. "Most of the educational attainment in the war and its aftermath focused on training elite managers for the co-operative institutions. Evidence from the co-operative reports of the 1940s indicates clearly that the common people were not participating very much in the life of their institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Welton.  ''Beyond Coady:  adult education and the end of utopian modernism''.  Proceedings of the AERC, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many of the [[integrated rural development program]]s in the developing world today, the Antigonish Movement encountered a grass-roots challenge to its vision in the implementation stage. In the end, the grand vision of fishers and miners appreciating Shakespeare and grand opera seemed to usually lead to one community project: co-operative [[microfinance]] through [[credit unions]].

Dr. [[Ian MacPherson (historian)|Ian MacPherson]], a co-operative historian and theorist, argues that most co-operative movements are dependent for their early impetus on the support of networks of external players like church groups, government departments or wealthy patrons.  As the movement begins to transform into a credit union system, "... necessary managerial and technical changes may be inhibited by the "founders":  revered individuals who have made great contributions but who, as they age and the institution they helped found develops, may hold back necessary change and new generations of leadership." &lt;ref&gt;Ian MacPherson.  ''Hands Around the Globe:  A History of the International Credit Union Movement and the Role and Development of World Council of Credit Unions, Inc.''  Horsdal &amp; Schubart Publishers &amp; WOCCU, Victoria, Canada 1999, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nova Scotia's credit union system, springing from the centre of the Antigonish Movement, today has a far lower penetration of members (18%) than the systems in neighbouring New Brunswick (41%) and Prince Edward Island (45%).&lt;ref&gt;Brett Matthews.  ''Compounding community capital:  Canada’s credit unions and the untapped assets of poor communities.''  Canadian Co-operative Association, 2006, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coady acknowledged that the credit unions were promoting thrift and household budgeting, and showing members by example how much money they could bring to bear on their communities’ problems through co-operative action.  But to him, the main purpose of credit unions was moral.  The credit union "makes people honest".  "There have been a few instances of dishonest managers and some slow borrowers, but the credit union organization takes care of these cases."&lt;ref&gt;Moses Coady.  ''Masters of Their Own Destiny.''  p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other parts of Canada, most notably [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] where some of the strongest credit union systems emerged, the movement's early leaders recognized the need to address the practical problems that emerged from the demand for credit unions.  Innovations like the [[Saskatchewan Mutual Aid Board]] – the first private sector [[deposit insurance]] scheme in Canada – focused on protecting the savings of members.  These practical innovations, grounded in addressing the practical needs of members, led to stronger and more sustained institutional growth.

==Legacy==
The study club successfully addressed one of the enduring challenges of co-operative development.  Co-operative enterprises address the [[principal–agent problem]] by making all users of an enterprise into owners.  When users accept the duties of owners, this structure results in strong governance and control systems.  However, the assets in co-operative enterprises are vulnerable when the users aren’t prepared to accept the duties of ownership.  In a paper for the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] in 1962, Alexander Laidlaw, a co-operative leader who served as a director at the Extension Department, wrote that:

{{quote|... such concepts as group responsibility, reaching decisions by majority vote, delegating authority to responsible officers, observing rules agreed upon by the group, exerting self-discipline for the welfare of the group cannot be taught or learned in the abstract.  They must become part of the personality of the individual and the experience of the group through actual situations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Laidlaw.  ''Training and extension in the co-operative movement:  a guide for fieldmen and extension workers.''  Agricultural Development Paper #74, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, Rome, 1962, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Antigonish-style study clubs, unlike traditional seminars or workshops, require all members to collectively manage a group process even before they launch a co-operative.  Members can take a hard look at each other’s capabilities and weigh their collective prospects with a clear head while they learn the skills they need to launch community ventures.

By the end of World War II a series of leaders from [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]] to [[Edward Filene]] to [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] to [[Moses Coady]] had shown that cooperative movements could reach and empower poor populations in a way that deepened the economic gains of capitalism while alleviating some of its undesirable social effects.  This prepared the way for a wave of ‘anti-communist’ co-operative development led by the US government in the developing world in the 1940-60s.  For precisely the reasons just noted, however, the results of this 'state-led' credit union development were mixed at best.

The philosophy and techniques of Antigonish anticipated some of the key ideas of rural development, including the emancipatory pedagogy of [[Paulo Freire]], and the philosophy of [[Robert Chambers (development scholar)|Robert Chambers]]/[[participatory rural appraisal|participatory rural assessment]].  However, the Antigonish approach runs into significant problems in [[oral tradition|oral communities]] and those with anti-democratic traditions.  This has limited the replicability of the movement, and led to significant offshoots, such as the [[self-help group movement]] in India, [[village banking]] and the [[ROSCA|ASCA]] movement in parts of Africa.

In our current times, Coady International Institute has continued to promote and support people owned institutions around the world through its leadership programs.  The idea of 'collectives' managing their finances or enterprises have taken many new shapes in modern times. Self-Help Groups (SHGs)  - small group of 10-20 members, mostly women, have become very popular and wide spread particularly in India but also elsewhere with an estimated 110 million members; while another similar small group managed system called Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLAs) have become popular particularly across the continent of Africa with over 10 million members. These small groups managed and governed financial services are similar in idea to the Study Clubs of Antigonish movement, and avoid the possible negative outcomes of Credit Unions becoming more corporate and moving away from members' active participation and control. These small group models are particularly popular among women, perhaps as they face barriers in joining even the local cooperatives with men as dominant members. These informal groups have become immensely popular, often coming together to form 'federations' for greater collective bargaining power and reaching economies of scale, essentially becoming and behaving like formal cooperative.

Non-financial cooperatives - such as fishermen coop or farmers coops of the Antigonish movement, continue to provide an alternative economic model the world over despite rise of private sector led economic growth, especially for small producers and farmers in accessing markets and negotiating prices collectively. Within Maritimes though, such cooperatives seem to have given way to more individual enterprises that operate more as 'association' rather than collective business, but continuing to have a very close sense of 'community' and collective identity - be it lobster fishers or dairy farmers. Newer form of economic enterprises of recent times are also generally termed as 'social enterprises' - with dual objective of profit and socially responsible and positive outcomes. Such enterprises don't always have collective ownership, but almost always have a sense of 'community' well-being. Investment Cooperatives are yet another form of collective enterprise, often getting formed to finance a community based enterprise such as alternative energy coop or local-food marketing coop. Shared-economy is yet another form of new wave idea that borrows from same coop principle of community sharing an economy more inclusively; though the potential conflict between the private and corporate profit v/s community benefiting collectively continues to be an ongoing debate; a debate that Antigonish Movement challenged in 1920 and 1930s, and seem to go through in cyclical fashion ever-since. Societies are once again at cross-roads for balancing between individual and corporate wealth, group / cooperative enterprises, and more shared-economies where everyone can share benefits. Legacy and lessons from the Antigonish Movement continue to be relevant in our modern times.

The '''Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now''' ('''ACORN''') was a collection of [[community organizing|community]]-based organizations in the United States and internationally that advocated for low- and moderate-income families by working on neighborhood safety, [[voter registration]], [[health care]], affordable housing, and other social issues.  At its peak ACORN had over 500,000 members and more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in over 100 cities across the U.S.,&lt;ref name=csm&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|title=What is the ACORN controversy about?|author=Michael B.

ACORN conducted voter registration drives, and worked to remove systemic barriers to registration of low and working-class voters.  The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] regularly alleged that it committed voter fraud, but few cases have been found or prosecuted.  The organization conducted its own audits and cooperated with investigations of employees, referring some cases to law enforcement.

ACORN suffered an extremely damaging [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|nationwide controversy]] beginning in the fall of 2009 after two [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] activists, [[James O'Keefe]] and Hannah Giles, secretly made and released videos of interactions with low-level ACORN personnel in several of their offices, portraying the personnel as encouraging criminal behavior. Multiple investigations on the federal, state, and county level found that the released tapes were selectively edited to portray ACORN as negatively as possible, and that nothing in the videos warranted criminal charges against ACORN or its employees, though the confidential recording of the tapes violated privacy laws in Maryland and California.&lt;ref name="CA AG Report"/&gt;  In the meantime, however, the organization suffered an immediate loss of funding from government agencies with which it had contracts, and from private donors.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Urbina |date=March 19, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/us/politics/20acorn.html |title=Acorn on Brink of Bankruptcy, Officials Say |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2010-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323024816/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/us/politics/20acorn.html| archivedate= 23 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnewsvideo&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,549241,00.html|title=Second Video Shows ACORN Officials Helping 'Pimp,' 'Prostitute' in Washington Office|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/27/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4483168.shtml|title=ACORN Issue Fueling Bailout Opposition|accessdate=|author=[[Ryan Grim]]|date=September 27, 2008|work=CBS News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of funds had been too damaging, and by March 2010, 15 of ACORN's 30 state chapters had already closed.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt;  ACORN announced it was closing its remaining state chapters and disbanding.&lt;ref name=acornfolds&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589768,00.html|title=ACORN Closing in Wake of Scandal|accessdate=March 22, 2010|date=March 22, 2010|work=FOX News|publisher=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100325063906/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589768,00.html| archivedate= 25 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 2, 2010 its U.S. offices filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] liquidation  effectively closing the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-acorn-bankruptcy-20101103,0,549666.story ACORN filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy]; Los Angeles Times; November 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

ACORN members and organizers formed new organizations in at least three states.&lt;ref name=ACCE/&gt;&lt;ref name="jsonline.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/97339544.html |title=Milwaukee chosen to pilot program aimed at foreclosures |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=2010-06-28 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt;

== Organization ==
ACORN was composed of a number of legally distinct [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] entities and affiliates including a nationwide [[umbrella organization]] established as a [[501(c)(4)]] that performed [[lobbying]]; local chapters established as [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonpartisan (American organizations)|nonpartisan]] charities; and the national nonprofit and nonstock organization, ACORN Housing Corporation.
ACORN's priorities included: better housing and wages for the poor, more community development investment from banks and governments, better public schools, [[Labor union|labor-oriented]] causes and social justice issues. ACORN pursued these goals through demonstration, negotiation, lobbying for legislation, and voter participation.&lt;ref name=r8144&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=1139&amp;L=0%3Fid%3D8144|publisher=ACORN (press release)|title=New Report Finds Widespread Local Use of Affordable Housing Program Being Currently Debated in Congress|date=2002-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues and actions ==

===Predatory lending and affordable housing===
ACORN investigated complaints against companies accused of [[predatory lending]] practices. ACORN also worked to support strict state laws against predatory practices, organized against [[foreclosure rescue scheme|foreclosure rescue scams]], and steered borrowers toward loan counseling;&lt;ref name="ACORN_2003"/&gt; Following a three-year campaign, Household International (now owned by [[HSBC|HSBC Holdings]] and renamed [[HSBC Finance|HSBC Finance Corporation]]), one of the largest [[subprime lending|subprime lenders]] in the country, and ACORN announced on November 25, 2003 a proposed settlement of a 2002 national [[class-action lawsuit]] brought by ACORN. The settlement created a $72 million foreclosure avoidance program to provide relief to household borrowers who were at risk of losing their homes.&lt;ref name="ACORN_2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=8500|title=ACORN Annual Report 2003|publisher=ACORN|year=2003|accessdate=2007-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928100304/http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=8500| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement came on the heels of an earlier $484 million settlement between Household, Attorneys General, and bank regulators from all 50 U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atg.wa.gov/householdfinance/facts.shtml|title=Household Finance Settlement|publisher = Washington State Office of the Attorney General|date=2003-12-05|accessdate=2007-11-12|archivedate=2006-09-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927065346/http://www.atg.wa.gov/householdfinance/facts.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACORN and its affiliates advocated for affordable housing by urging the development, rehabilitation and establishment of housing [[trust (law)|trust funds]] at the local, state, and federal levels.&lt;ref name=a44&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=44|publisher=ACORN|title=Affordable Housing|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also pushed for enforcement of affordable-housing requirements for developers and promoted programs to help homeowners repair their homes and organize tenant demands.&lt;ref name=a44/&gt; An ACORN official voiced support for a proposal [[Hillary Clinton]] made during the 2008 presidential primary election to create a federal fund for distressed homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/104/story/31441.html |title=Clinton calls for $30 billion in mortgage aid to home-owners |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living wages===
[[Image:RoyalAcornSignL9W10Dec07.jpg|right|thumb|ACORN volunteers were among those making street and traffic signs in [[New Orleans]] to replace signage lost in the [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] disaster.]]

[[Living wage]] ordinances require private businesses that do business with the government to pay their workers a wage that enables them to afford basic necessities. ACORN has helped pass local living wage laws in 15 cities including [[Chicago]], [[New Westminster, British Columbia]], [[Oakland]], [[Denver]], and [[New York City]]. ACORN maintained a website that provides strategic and logistical assistance on this issue to organizations nationwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Hurricane Katrina relief===
ACORN members across the country, particularly in the [[Gulf Coast|Gulf]] region, organized fund-raising and organizing drives to ensure that victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] received assistance and will be able to return to affected areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} ACORN's home clean-out demonstration program has gutted and rebuilt over 1,850 homes with the help of volunteers. The ACORN Katrina Survivors Association formed in the aftermath of the storm is the first nationwide organization for Katrina survivors and has been working for equitable treatment for victims. Displaced citizens were bused into the city for the [[New Orleans]] primary and general elections. By October 2007, ACORN said its Housing Services had helped more than 2,000 homeowners affected by the storm. The non-profit was officially working with the city on reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=9703|title=Two years after Katrina, still fighting and winning|year=2005|publisher=ACORN|accessdate=2007-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071027035623/http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=9703| archivedate= 27 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
ACORN supported [[education reform]], usually in the form of organizing neighborhood groups and "community" or "ACORN schools". In [[Chicago]], ACORN has advocated for a certified teacher to be in every classroom. In [[California]], ACORN has documented the need for textbooks and school repairs. ACORN works with teachers unions to gain funding for school construction and more funding for schools.&lt;ref name="ACORN_school_overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=2660|title=School Overview |publisher=ACORN|accessdate=2007-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071027035434/http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=2660| archivedate= 27 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACORN also supports school reform and the "creation of alternative public schools" such as [[charter school]]s.&lt;ref name="ACORN_school_overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name=a735&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=735|publisher=ACORN|title=Detailed History of ACORN:New Victories, 1995–2002|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACORN opposed the privatization of some NYC schools, favoring its own Charter School plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2001/03/14/26edison.h20.html|date=2001-03-14|title=N.Y.C. Parents To Vote on Edison Charter Plan|author=Mark Walsh|publisher=Education Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACORN model for schools emphasizes small classes, parent involvement, qualified teachers and "community-oriented curricula".&lt;ref name=a735/&gt;

===Voter registration===
Since the 1980s, ACORN has conducted large-scale voter registration drives,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hayes, ''[[The Nation]]'', September 1, 2008, [http://www.thenation.com/article/obamas-voter-registration-drive Obama's Voter-registration Drive]&lt;/ref&gt; focusing primarily on registering poor and minority citizens.&lt;ref name="APMud"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-10-18-3995453887_x.htm| title=ACORN controversy: Voter fraud or mudslinging?| agency=Associated Press| date=2008-10-18 | first=Deborah | last=Hastings | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MiamiFuror"&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/campaign-2008/story/739642.html "Furor over ACORN allegations gaining momentum"] ''[[Miami Herald]],'' 2008-10-24. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2008 election season, ACORN gathered over 1.3 million voter registration forms in 21 states. Some of these registration forms were flagged by ACORN's internal auditors for review by election officials. [[Project Vote]] estimated that 400,000 registrations collected by ACORN were ultimately rejected, the vast majority for being duplicate registrations submitted by citizens. (This is also a common problem at government voter registration services, according to reports on the [[National Voter Registration Act]] by the U.S. [[Election Assistance Commission]]). An unknown number of registrations were fraudulent, but Project Vote estimated that only a few percent were, based on past years and samples from some drives in 2008.&lt;ref name="NYTTally"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/us/politics/24acorn.html |title=Groups Tally of New Voters Was Vastly Overstated |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2008-10-23 |first1=Michael |last1=Falcone |first2=Michael |last2=Moss |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official in states where voter registration drives were conducted has documented substantial numbers of fraudulent registrations. Project Vote estimated that 450,000 of the registrations collected by ACORN represented first-time voters, while the remainder were address changes submitted by citizens updating their addresses.&lt;ref name="NYTTally"/&gt;

As required by law in most states, ACORN must submit all registration forms collected by its workers, including those flagged by ACORN as incomplete or suspicious. Fraudulent voter registrations are investigated at local, state, and federal levels, and have sometimes resulted in criminal convictions for ACORN employees. ACORN has fired employees for fraudulent registration practices and turned them over to authorities. As of 2006, ACORN was improving its fraud detection and reporting procedures, and cooperating with authorities in efforts to prosecute violators.&lt;ref name="KC_MO"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=KMBC=TV|url=http://www.thekansascitychannel.com/politics/10214492/detail.html|title=ACORN Workers Indicted For Alleged Voter Fraud|date=2006-11-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625215229/http://www.thekansascitychannel.com/politics/10214492/detail.html|archivedate=2007-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003806904_webvotefraud26m.html|title=Felony charges filed against 7 in state's biggest case of voter-registration fraud| newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=2007-07-28 |first=Keith|last=Ervin|accessdate=2007-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071117153636/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003806904_webvotefraud26m.html| archivedate= 17 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIssues"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/us/22acorn.html?_r=1&amp;sq=ACORN |title=Acorn Report Raises Issues of Legality |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2008-10-22 |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield, Reggie.

In a 2007 case in [[Washington state]], in which seven temporary employees of ACORN were charged with submitting fraudulent voter registrations, ACORN agreed to pay [[King County]] $25,000 for its investigative costs and acknowledged that the national organization could be subject to criminal prosecution if fraud occurs again.

In addition to conducting voter registration drives, ACORN has worked to remove systemic obstacles to voter registration. In 2006, it brought a lawsuit in federal court in [[Ohio]] against the [[Ohio Secretary of State]], at that time [[Ken Blackwell]], and the Director of the [[Ohio Department of Job and Family Services]]. ACORN alleged that, during the period that included the [[2004 United States election voting controversies]], the defendants had committed multiple violations of the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]]. The district court dismissed the case, but that decision was reversed in 2008 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

===Home Defender Program===
In 2009, ACORN advocated allowing homeowners delinquent in their mortgage payments to remain in their homes pending a government solution to the housing [[foreclosure]] crisis. ACORN introduced a program called the Home Defender Program, intended to mobilize people to congregate at homes faced with foreclosure to "defend a family's right to stay in their homes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACORN Home Defender Program|url=http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/2749/t/3071/signUp.jsp?key=2134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nwi.com/articles/2009/02/19/news/lake/doc853b6aa5c26aca0286257561007d5737.txt|publisher=The Times Media Company|title=ACORN plans local action to stem NWI mortgage foreclosures|author=Bill Dolan|date=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One ACORN Web page advocated [[civil disobedience]] against foreclosure evictions stating that people in foreclosed homes should refuse to leave, and in some cases, move back in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Refusing to Leave: ACORN Members Step up Fight to Stay in Homes|date=2009-02-13|url=http://acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=22521&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=12387&amp;cHash=5ef36d5092|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217233834/http://acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=22521&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=12387&amp;cHash=5ef36d5092|archivedate=2009-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Squatting in the United States}}

===1970–1975===
[[Wade Rathke]] founded ACORN in 1970, after the [[National Welfare Rights Organization]] (NWRO) sent him to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], as an organizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sol|last=Stern|journal=City Journal|title=ACORN's Nutty Regime for Cities|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_2_acorns_nutty_regime.html|date=Spring 2003|accessdate=2007-01-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070127062301/http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_2_acorns_nutty_regime.html| archivedate= 27 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rathke had previously dropped out of [[Williams College]] to promote [[draft resistance]] for [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. Gary Delgado and [[George Wiley]] were also instrumental in its founding. ACORN's first campaign was to help welfare recipients attain their basic needs, such as [[clothing]] and [[furniture]]. This drive, inspired by a clause in the [[Arkansas]] [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] laws, began their effort to create and sustain a movement to assist welfare and lower-income working individuals; they developed the Arkansas Community Organizations for Reform Now, the beginnings of ACORN.&lt;ref name=Delgado&gt;{{cite book|last=Delgado|first=Gary|title=Organizing the Movement: The Roots and Growth of ACORN|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|year=1986|isbn=0-87722-393-9|oclc=12134922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACORN's goal was to "unite welfare recipients with [[Working poor|needy working people]] around issues such as [[National School Lunch Act|school lunches]], [[unemployment]], [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam veterans']] rights, and emergency room care."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12447&amp;L=1%2Findex.php%3Fid%3Dhttp%3A%2F ACORN History] acorn.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975–1980===
In 1975, ACORN created branches in [[Texas]] and [[South Dakota]]. On December 13, 1975, sixty leaders from the three ACORN states elected the first associate Executive Board and the first ACORN president, Steve McDonald, to deal with matters beyond the scope of the individual city and state boards. Each year thereafter ACORN chapters were established in three or more states, building to a total of 20 states represented by 1980. This expansion led to multi-state campaigns, beginning with a mass meeting of 1,000 members in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in 1978. At the end of the conference, ACORN convention delegates marched on the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] conference with the outline of a nine-point "People's Platform." When ratified in 1979, this became the foundation of ACORN's platform.

ACORN was active in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 Election]] with the "People's Platform" serving as its standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umsl.edu/~whmc/guides/whm0040.htm |title=Western Historical Manuscript Collection |publisher=[[University of Missouri]] – St. Louis |date=June 1980 |accessdate=2007-11-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111858/http://www.umsl.edu/~whmc/guides/whm0040.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It led [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] aimed at both major party candidates; demanded to meet with [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]]; marched on the president's campaign finance committee chair's home; and presented its platform to the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] platform committee.

===1981–1989===
By 1980, ACORN's staff was stretched thin by the demands of meeting its expansion goals. Much of its resources and energy had been dedicated to the presidential primaries and national party conventions. ACORN launched [[squatting]] campaigns in an attempt to obtain affordable housing, and encouraged [[squatter]]s to refit the premises for comfortable living.{{Citation needed| date=September 2009}}

In June 1982, ACORN sponsored "[[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Ranches" in Washington, DC and more than 35 other cities, in reaction to its belief that the president was focused on military as opposed to social spending. These [[tent city|tent cities]] were erected for two days on national park grounds; they were resisted by the [[National Park Service]], which tried repeatedly to evict the tenters. The protesters remained; they marched on the [[White House]] and members testified before a [[United States Congress|Congressional committee]] about what they described as the housing crisis in America. The last Reagan Ranch was held at the Republican Convention in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] in 1984. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In addition to protesting, ACORN also developed and strengthened its [[political action committee]]s and encouraged its members to run for office. For the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 election]] ACORN wanted to endorse a candidate, setting a 75% support in polls among members as its requirement. No candidate reached that level, though there was strong support for [[Jesse Jackson]]. ACORN also established a legislative office that year in [[Washington, DC]]. During this period ACORN also focused on local election reform in a number of cities, including [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Columbia, South Carolina]], and [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. They encouraged cities to change legislative bodies whose members were elected [[at-large]] to electing members by [[single-member district]], which resulted in more participation by minorities, including women. At-large voting tends to favor candidates who can appeal to the majority and who can command more campaign funding, reducing participation by a wider variety of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/439052] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906001132/http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/439052|date=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of Reagan's first term, ACORN operated in 27 states, adding chapters in [[New York City]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Delgado /&gt; During the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 Election]], ACORN held its National Convention in the same city as the Democratic Convention — [[Atlanta]].

ACORN's membership grew to more than 70,000 in 28 states during this time. It increased its legislative lobbying efforts in Washington, DC, and strengthened its [[Political Action Committee]]s (PACs). It also developed what it called the [[Affiliated Media Foundation Movement]] (AM/FM). Starting with station [[KNON]] in Dallas, AM/FM established radio stations, [[UHF]] television and [[cable television]] programming. It also sought and received appointments to the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]] (RTC), which was formed to dissolve the assets of failed [[Savings and loan|Savings and Loans]] resulting from the [[Savings and Loan crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===1988–1998===
[[Image:Acorn pred lend.jpg|thumbnail|ACORN member demonstrating against [[predatory lending]]]]
While some of ACORN's most notable efforts were in the area of housing, it has counted health, public safety, education, representation, work and workers' rights and communications concerns among its victories.  The 1990 ACORN convention in Chicago focused on the fast-breaking housing campaign.  It featured a squatting demonstration at an RTC house.  ACORN members demanded that banks provide loan data on low- and moderate-income communities and comply with the 1977 [[Community Reinvestment Act]] (CRA).  ACORN fought weakening of the CRA in 1991, staging a two-day takeover of the [[House Banking Committee]] hearing room.  It established ACORN Housing Corporation to assist people in moving into homes under the housing campaign, and to rehabilitate hundreds of houses addressed by the CRA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35877491/ns/us_news-life/ ACORN affiliates rebrand after video scandal]; MSNBC; March 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACORN convention in New York in 1992, called the "ACORN-Bank Summit", was organized to make deals with giant banks.  When [[Citibank]], the nation's largest bank, did not participate, conventioneers protested at its downtown [[Manhattan]] headquarters, and won a meeting to negotiate for similar programs.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

ACORN supported and lobbied for the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993|"Motor Voter" Act]], which provided for voter registration at motor vehicle bureaus.  After its passage, ACORN members attended [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] signing ceremony.  ACORN worked for new voter registration laws in Arkansas and [[Massachusetts]] and filed suit in [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[Michigan]], [[Missouri]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] against certain state practices as a result of the act.&lt;!-- Results? --&gt;

In 1993, ACORN also began a national campaign to fight [[insurance]] [[redlining]], a practice that put the gains made in other housing campaigns at risk.  The campaign targeted [[Allstate]], hitting sales offices in 14 cities and a stockholders meeting.   Allstate agreed to negotiate and signed an agreement in 1994 for a $10 million partnership with ACORN and [[NationsBank]] for below-market mortgages to low-income home-buyers.  [[Travelers Insurance]] agreed to a Neighborhood and Home Safety Program, linking access to insurance and lower rates to public safety programs.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===1998–2009===
ACORN has worked on supporting a "Living Wage" programs, voter registration, and [[Grassroots democracy|grassroots political organization]].{{When|date=October 2018}}

In 1998, ACORN helped form the [[Working Families Party]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], which had made increasing the [[minimum wage]] as its centerpiece issue.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A March 27, 2003 decision of the [[National Labor Relations Board]] found that ACORN tried to thwart [[Labor union|union organizing]] efforts within its own organization by laying off two workers who were trying to organize.&lt;ref name=nlrb&gt;{{cite web| title = Decisions of the NLRB, 338–129| publisher = National Labor Relations Board| date = 2003-03-27| url = http://www.nlrb.gov/shared_files/Board%20Decisions/338/338-129.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2006-10-12| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129114622/http://www.nlrb.gov/shared_files/Board%20Decisions/338/338-129.pdf| archivedate = 2007-11-29| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two workers, both field organizers with ACORN, began discussions with the [[Service Employees International Union]] and later sought to organize under [[Industrial Workers of the World]], seeking to improve their $20,200 annual salary for a 54-hour work week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wweek.com/editorial/2818/2532/ Willamette Week | "The ACORN that imploded"|March 6th, 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016165739/http://wweek.com/editorial/2818/2532/ |date=2008-10-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The NLRB ordered the two employees be reinstated in their former jobs and that ACORN cease from interrogating employees about organizing activity.&lt;ref name=nlrb /&gt;

In 2004, Florida ACORN helped to raise Florida's minimum wage by $1.00 per hour, by lobbying for a minimum wage amendment to be placed on the ballot. Over 1 million Florida employees were affected by the raise, which is adjusted annually for [[inflation]]. That year, ACORN became an international organization, opening offices in Canada, [[Peru]], and beginning work in [[Dominican Republic]]. Offices have subsequently been opened in Mexico and Argentina.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[ACORN International]] was created in 2004 by members and staff of the organizations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Budget==
Until the controversies of 2008 and 2009, ACORN had an annual budget of approximately US$25 million, with approximately 10% of those funds coming from federal sources, a smaller figure from state sources, and the rest coming from supporters and membership.  [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] estimated that ACORN received $42 million in federal funds since the 2000 budget year; the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee estimated that ACORN received $53 million since 1994.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[MSNBC]]|title=Did ACORN get too big for its own good?|date=2009-09-19|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32925682/ns/politics-more_politics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACORN was a [[nonpartisan]] organization, but its legally separate political action arm frequently endorsed causes and candidates, including the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="about-acorn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12342|title=Who is ACORN?

During the debate on the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], some commentators claimed that a draft provision (omitted in the adopted bill) to give money to funds run by the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]] could potentially lead to money flowing to groups like ACORN.&lt;ref name=wsj0731&gt;{{cite news | last =Williamson | first =Elizabeth |author2=Mullins, Brody | title =Democratic Ally Mobilizes In Housing Crunch | work =[[The Wall Street Journal]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =July 31, 2008 | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121745181676698197 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_ayo08b28.html|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|title=Draft bill|accessdate=2010-12-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101108022913/http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_ayo08b28.html| archivedate= 8 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how much money ACORN or other community groups would get, a spokesman for [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Financial Services Committee]] [[chairman]] [[Barney Frank]], said, "Absolutely none.

===2008===
ACORN was among groups conducting voter registration drives prior to the 2008 presidential election; Republicans alleged they were responsible for voter registration fraud and had a conflict of interest. During the [[2008 Democratic Presidential Primary]], ACORN's national [[political action committee]], ACORN Votes, endorsed Barack Obama.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.factcheck.org/2008/10/acorn-accusations/&lt;/ref&gt; Obama, with several other attorneys, had served as local counsel for ACORN more than a decade earlier in a 1995 voting rights lawsuit joined by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and the [[League of Women Voters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/us/politics/11acorn.html |title=On Obama, Acorn and Voter Registration |author=Stephanie Strom |date=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-debate16-2008oct16,0,5385470.story|title=McCain, Obama duel in caustic debate finale |last=Barabak |first=Mark Z. |author2=Seema Mehta |date=2008-10-16 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2008-10-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081019125354/http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-debate16-2008oct16,0,5385470.story| archivedate= 19 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama's campaign hired an ACORN affiliate for $800,000 to conduct a get-out-the-vote effort during that primary,&lt;ref name=davidbrown&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune Review |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/election/s_584284.html |title=Obama to amend report on $800,000 in spending |author=David M.

Throughout the election season, supporters of Republican candidates alleged that ACORN was responsible for widespread vote fraud. In October 2008, the campaign for Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] released a Web-based advertisement claiming ACORN was responsible for "massive voter fraud," a point that Sen. McCain repeated in the final presidential debate. [[FactCheck.org]] called this claim "breathtakingly inaccurate," but acknowledged that ACORN had problems with phony registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Novak |first=Viveca |title=The Whoppers of 2008 – The Sequel |publisher=factcheck.org|url=http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/the_whoppers_of_2008_--_the_sequel.html |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2009-01-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122213409/http://factcheck.org/elections-2008/the_whoppers_of_2008_--_the_sequel.html| archivedate= 22 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ads also claimed that home loan programs ACORN promoted were partly responsible for the sub-prime mortgage crisis.

A poll released in November 2009 by the [[Public Policy Polling]] organization found that 52% of Republican Party members it surveyed, and 26% of respondents overall, believed in a [[conspiracy theory]] that ACORN "stole" the election for [[Barack Obama]].  The Democratic polling organization commented that this was somewhat higher than belief in the [[birther]] conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2009/11/acorn.html |title=Public Policy Polling: ACORN |publisher=Publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com |date=2009-11-19 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In a follow-poll in 2012, PPP found that 49% of Republicans, nearly the same percentage as in 2009, believed that ACORN had stolen the 2012 election for Obama.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on July 9, 2008, that Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN's founder Wade Rathke, was found to have [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] $948,607.50 from the group and affiliated charitable organizations in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref name="nytstrom"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/us/09embezzle.html |title=Funds Misappropriated at 2 Nonprofit Groups |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |date=July 9, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110709004152/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/us/09embezzle.html| archivedate=July 9, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACORN executives decided to handle it as an internal matter, and did not inform most of the board members or law enforcement, and instead signed an enforceable restitution agreement with the Rathke family to repay the amount of the embezzlement. $210,000 has already been repaid, and a donor, [[Drummond Pike]], has offered to pay the remaining debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/us/17acorn.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Stephanie | last=Strom | title=Head of Foundation Bailed Out Nonprofit Group After Its Funds Were Embezzled | date=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' reported that, according to Wade Rathke, "the decision to keep the matter secret was not made to protect his brother but because word of the embezzlement would have put a 'weapon' into the hands of enemies of ACORN, a liberal group that is a frequent target of conservatives who object to ACORN's often strident advocacy on behalf of low- and moderate-income families and workers." A whistleblower revealed the embezzlement in 2008. On June 2, 2008, Dale Rathke was dismissed, and Wade stepped down as ACORN's chief organizer, but he remains chief organizer for [[ACORN International|Acorn International L.L.C.]]&lt;ref name=nytstrom/&gt;

In September 2008, following revelations of Dale Rathke's embezzlement, two members of ACORN's national board of directors filed a lawsuit seeking to obtain financial documents and to force the organization to sever ties with Wade Rathke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strom |first=Stephanie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/us/10acorn.html |title=Lawsuit Adds to Turmoil for Community Group |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2008-09-12 |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACORN's executive committee voted unanimously to remove the two, "because their actions—such as releasing a confidential legal memo to the press—were damaging the organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_606173.html |title=Ousted ACORN members seek federal criminal investigation – Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |publisher=Pittsburghlive.com |date=2009-01-08 |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329151006/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_606173.html |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, [[Louisiana]] Attorney General [[Buddy Caldwell]] claimed in a subpoena that ACORN's board of directors found that a larger amount—$5 million—had been embezzled from the organization.

President Obama signed the bill into law on October 1.&lt;ref name=Barron&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/us/politics/28acorn.html |title=Justice Department Says Acorn Can Be Paid for Pre-Ban Contracts |accessdate=2009-12-03 |author=Charlie Savage |date=2009-11-27 |newspaper=The New York Times| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714102738/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/us/politics/28acorn.html| archivedate=July 14, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACORN sued the United States Government in the United States District Court in Brooklyn over the measure, known as the "Defund ACORN Act," claiming it was a [[bill of attainder]], and therefore unconstitutional. Experts varied on the merit of the case, which was styled ''ACORN v. United States''. One argument was that while government funding choices do not generally qualify as bills of attainder, the lack of a non-punitive regulatory purpose for the legislation may give a court "sufficient basis to overcome the presumption of constitutionality."&lt;ref name=suit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/nyregion/13acorn.html?_r=1 |title=Acorn Sues Over Funding Vote in House |accessdate=2009-11-13 |author=Kareem Fahim |date=November 12, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/files/acornattainder.pdf |title=The proposed "Defund ACORN Act": Is it a "Bill of Attainder?" |accessdate=2009-11-14 |author=Kenneth R.

In response to an inquiry from a [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Housing and Urban Development Department]] lawyer, David Barron, the acting assistant attorney general for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], wrote a five-page memorandum concluding that the law does not prohibit the government from paying ACORN for services already performed.&lt;ref name=Barron/&gt; On December 11, U.S. District Judge [[Nina Gershon]] issued a preliminary injunction blocking the government from enforcing its temporary spending ban, a week before it was set to expire.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news |first=Nomaan |last=Merchant |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126057881607388239 |title=Judge Blocks U.S. Ban on Funding for Acorn |accessdate=2009-12-12 |date=December 12, 2009 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215213228/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126057881607388239.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) opened an investigation of ACORN in December 2009.&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30742.html |title=GAO Opens ACORN Investigation |accessdate=2009-12-17 |author=Jake Sherman |date=December 17, 2009 |work=[[Politico.com]] |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the GAO released a preliminary report stating the investigation has found no sign the group or related organizations mishandled the $40 million in federal money they received from nine federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/06/14/congress.acorn/index.html Preliminary report clears ACORN on funds], CNN; June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Gershon's decision.&lt;ref name=AP-08-13-10&gt;Hays, Tom. [http://www.ktuu.com/Global/story.asp?S=12975806 "Federal appeals court in NY rules against ACORN"].

===2010===
On March 19, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that ACORN was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy; 15 of the group's 30 state chapters had disbanded over the previous six months, and other chapters (including the largest, in New York and California) renamed themselves and severed all ties to the national organization.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt;  Two unnamed ACORN officials told the ''Times'' that the following weekend, a teleconference was planned to discuss a bankruptcy filing; "private donations from foundations to Acorn [had] all but evaporated," and the federal government had distanced itself from the group.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt; "[L]ong before the activist videos delivered what may become the final blow, the organization was dogged for years by financial problems and accusations of fraud."&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt; "That 20-minute video ruined 40 years of good work," said Sonja Merchant-Jones, former co-chairwoman of ACORN's recently closed Maryland chapter. "But if the organization had confronted its own internal problems, it might not have been taken down so easily."&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt;

On March 22, 2010, National ACORN spokesman Kevin Whelan says the organization's board decided to close remaining state affiliates and field offices by April 1 because of falling revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Smith |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Acorn_folds.html?showall |title=ACORN Folds |publisher=[[Politico.com]] |date=March 22, 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100325012201/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Acorn_folds.html?showall| archivedate= 25 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national operations continued operating for another several weeks before shutting for good.&lt;ref name=Politico /&gt; On April 20, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis reported that ACORN was "still alive.

==ACORN-affiliated groups==
Some chapters continued operations by severing ties with the national organization:

'''Bertha Mkhize''' (6 June 1889 – 3 October 1981) was a South African teacher, who gained legal emancipation as a ''[[feme sole]]'' operating a business in her own right. As the government began implementing [[Apartheid]] in the late 1940s and early 1950s, she joined labor unions and women's organizations, leading demonstrations against the policies of the government. She was arrested twice for these activities and charged in the second incident with treason, but found not guilty of the allegations. When she was forced to give up her business, she became a [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], embracing its doctrine of equality for all people. She worked to establish twenty-eight Bahá'í communities in [[KwaZulu-Natal]].

==Early life==
Nhlumba Bertha Mkhize was born on 6 June 1889 in Embo, near [[Umkomaas]] in the southern province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]], South Africa to Mashobane Mkhize, an oxcart driver.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}}{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} Around the age of four, Mkhize's father died and the family relocated to [[Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal|Inanda]], where she enrolled in the [[Inanda Seminary School]]. She was one of the first students of the all-girls school. After completion of her studies at the seminary, she went on to graduate from [[Ohlange High School]].{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}}{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}}

==Career==
In 1907, Mkhize began teaching at Inanda Seminary and remained there for the next four years. While she was teaching, she took [[Tailor|tailoring]] classes to learn the skill.{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}} In 1909, she was legally [[emancipated]]. The process required her to appear before a magistrate with a signed document from her guardians granting her the right to conduct her affairs without her male family members' approval. This was an unusual procedure for Zulu women at the time and gave her the right to [[kraal|homestead]] or open her own business.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}} In 1911, she left the teaching profession{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}} and moved to [[Durban]] where she went into tailoring with her brother.{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} She continued with her interest in literacy, working in a children's center for twenty-five years. She also spoke out against oppressive measures used to undermine people's rights, like [[culling]] their cattle or forcing them and their owners to be [[Plunge dip|plunged in pesticide]] under the guise of controlling [[typhus]].{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}}

At its organization, Mkhize joined the [[African National Congress Women's League]] (ANCWL) and became involved in women's rights issues, participating in marches in 1931 and 1936 against requirements for women to have travel passes. She also joined the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union]], campaigning against curfews, low wages, and other working restrictions.{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} In the early 1950s a series of restrictive laws were passed by the [[Apartheid legislation|Apartheid legislature]] which required women to vacate urban areas within 72 hours or live with a man who had a permanent permit of residence. As early as 1950, protests of the new laws which curtailed free movement were held in urban areas throughout the country. Mkhize led the demonstrations in Durban in March 1950.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}} In 1952, she joined around 500 other women to march on the Durban City Council. Known as the [[Defiance Campaign]], at issue was a law that required women to obtain permission to travel. Mkhize spoke in favor of retracting the restriction,{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}}{{#tag:ref|The source states that the Defiance Campaign happened in 1925,{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} but this is clearly a typographical error as numerous other sources indicate the campaign originated in June, 1952.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}}{{sfn|Mandela|1990|p=34}}{{sfn|''Newport Daily News''|1952|p=1}}|group="Notes"}} and for her defiance spent several months in prison.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}}{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}}

Because the women were successful in exerting pressure on the government, Mkhize and others recognized that further organization would further their cause. To that end, they created the [[Federation of South African Women]] (FEDSAW). She was one of the women who attended the founding conference in 1954 and was selected as one of the national vice presidents{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} along with [[Florence Matomela]], [[Lillian Ngoyi]], and Gladys Smith. They drafted Women's Charter, which called for universal [[enfranchisement]] regardless of race, and equal opportunity in the areas of civil liberties, domestic rights, employment and pay.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}} Two years later, Mkhize had become President of ANCWL,{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} which held a mass demonstration in August 1956 to show the strength of women's opposition to a new implementation of women's pass laws. Along with other leaders of the women's movement, Mkhize was arrested for treason in the middle of the night in December 1956. The women, which included other activists like [[Frances Baard]], [[Helen Joseph]], Lillian Ngoyi, and [[Annie Silinga]] were accused of plotting to overthrow the government. The trial lasted for four and a half years, resulting in not guilty verdicts for all 156 women arrested on that night raid.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}} 

In 1958, Mkhize was introduced to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and joined the organization on 1 January 1959. The message of unity for all people was in line with her own convictions and she became active in the church.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}} She had continued running her business in Durban, but in 1965 the Durban City Council forced the closure of all African businesses and removed their owners of the area.{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} She worked actively in Natal and [[Zululand District Municipality|Zululand]] for five years on behalf of the Bahá'í Faith and then settled in Gezinsila in [[Eshowe]] as a [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]]. Along with other Bahá'í teachers, Mkhize was responsible for founding twenty-eight congregations in the area. In 1968, she was elected to serve as a delegate to the [[Bahá'í Faith in South Africa|National Spiritual Assembly of South and West Africa]] and served for one year. She translated many texts of the faith into [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. After nine years, her health began to fail in 1975, but she remained in her post until 1978, when she bequeathed her home to the faith and returned to Inanda.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|pp=773–774}}{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}}

==Death and legacy==
Mkhize died on 3 October 1981 in Inanda and is remembered for her pioneering role in women's rights. A street in Durban was renamed in her honor in 2010.{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}} A life-sized sculpture of Mkhize created by Cristina Salvoldi was installed at the [[National Heritage Monument]] in [[Tshwane]] near [[Johannesburg]] in 2017.{{sfn|National Heritage Project|2017}}

The '''British Democratic Party''' (BDP) was a short-lived [[far right|far-right]] political party in the [[United Kingdom]]. A breakaway group from the [[British National Front|National Front]] the BDP was severely damaged after it became involved in a gun-running sting and was absorbed by the [[British National Party]].&lt;ref name="Boothroyd"/&gt;

==Formation and naming controversy==
The BDP emerged following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] in which the National Front (NF) had put up the greatest number of candidates in its history. However, despite this results fell way below the party's expectations. The recriminations that followed this financially costly defeat saw [[Andrew Brons]] replace [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] as chairman whilst a number of groups broke away from the NF, notably the [[New National Front]] and the [[Constitutional Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hill &amp; A. Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror - Inside Europe’s Neo-Nazi Network'', London: Collins, 1988, pp.90-91&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the NF, the [[Leicester]] branch had become one of the most active in the country and, since 1972, this group had been led by [[Anthony Reed Herbert]], a local solicitor whose talent for organisation had made Leicester a model branch.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; Reed Herbert took the opportunity provided by the 1979 collapse of the NF to launch his own group, initially selecting the name British Peoples Party. However, the name was quickly changed in order to avoid association with the [[British People's Party (1939)|earlier British People's Party]], a splinter group from the [[National Socialist League]], organised either side of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Taylor, ''The National Front in English Politics'', London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The name was thus changed to British Democratic Party even though a British Democratic Party, a minor right wing anti-communist group, had also previously existed in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Benewick, ''Political Violence and Public Order'', Allan Lane: 1969, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

The BDP shared with the Constitutional Movement a desire to move away from open [[neo-Nazism]] in general and Tyndall and [[Martin Webster]] in particular, with Reed Herbert reasoning that a stream of press exposures of the more extreme views of both men had hit the NF's election chances hard.&lt;ref name="Hill92"&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively therefore the BDP sought to present a more "respectable" public image in contrast to that of the NF.&lt;ref name="Org"&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The BDP quickly gained a following within Leicester, capturing 11% of the vote in the first local elections it contested, a highly respectable score for a new and virtually unknown party.&lt;ref name="Hill92"/&gt; However the [[British Movement]]'s [[Ray Hill]] also became involved and, after giving a copy of the party's membership list to [[Searchlight magazine|''Searchlight'' magazine]], soon began secretly working for the anti-fascist publication full-time.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Although never formally a member of the BDP Hill, on instructions from ''Searchlight'', took a leading role in helping Reed Herbert to organise the new party.&lt;ref name="Hill99"/&gt; Hill also took over production of the party's newspaper ''British News''.&lt;ref name="Hill99"&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Hill's association with both the BDP and BM was not unusual as BDP members Dave Gagin, Chris Newman, Jack Munton and Chris Harrison all held simultaneous membership of the BM.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of Hill with the BDP meant that many of its activities were exposed in the press. Thus a celebration for [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birthday held in 1980 in an illegal bar in the basement of the party's headquarters was reported in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name="Hill99"/&gt; Hill also fomented a plan to take over the British Movement, suggesting to Reed Herbert that the two groups could unite once it was successful, although this idea too was driven by a ''Searchlight'' plan to bring about divisions within the BM.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Hill further informed the magazine on BDP plans to obtain weapons and to set up an illegal television transmitter, although information about both schemes was initially vague.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World in Action'' incident==
The BDP became embroiled in a 1981 scheme developed by the ''[[World in Action]]'' documentary series in which an American claiming to be a neo-Nazi gunrunner (but who was actually working for the programme) was put in touch with the BDP. Before long, Hill became involved in order to facilitate the sting.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; 'Bob Matthews', as the American claimed to be called, told Reed Herbert that he needed a gun in order to raid a US Army armoury, and Reed Herbert agreed to supply a single weapon for £200.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; BDP member John Grand Scrutton was chosen to ferry the weapon, a luger pistol, to a secret location arranged in advance with 'Matthews' before phoning the American to let him know more details. The resulting phone call, in which Scrutton suggested that the BDP could get hold of six more guns and told 'Matthews' to send payments to Reed Herbert's address, was recorded by ''World in Action'' and broadcast on the show.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed Herbert learned of the ruse from a journalist immediately prior to the broadcast of the episode as did Scrutton, whose finger prints were on the luger which by that point was in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 102-104&lt;/ref&gt; Reed Herbert sent Scrutton, under Hill's care, to a hideout in the [[Republic of Ireland]] but before long Scrutton returned to Britain and had to be brought back to Ireland by Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 109-111&lt;/ref&gt; Reed Herbert eventually told Scrutton to go to [[South Africa]] and Scrutton, along with Hill, was put on a plane that stopped over at [[Paris-Orly Airport]]. However Hill had informed ''Searchlight'' about the plan and they in turn had tipped off the [[France|French]] authorities who arrested Scrutton and Hill before sending them back to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 111-113&lt;/ref&gt; Under Hill's prompting, Scrutton contacted the show's producer Geoffrey Seed and, after three days of interviews, they convinced him to return to Leicester and give himself up to police.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', pp. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; Scrutton eventually returned and made a full statement, but despite this statement, no charges were ever brought against Scrutton or any member of the BDP in regards to the weapons offences.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Despite the incident Hill, who had moved on to a new plan to work with and undermine John Tyndall, remained close to the BDP and sought to continue working to damage the party.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the party also enjoyed the support of influential publisher [[Anthony Hancock (publisher)|Anthony Hancock]], although he too was close to the BM and was less sure about Tyndall.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the gun-running incident forced the BDP to cease almost all operations, and it came as little surprise when it was brought to a conclusion in 1982 by re-joining Tyndall and Hill as founder members of the [[British National Party]].&lt;ref name="Boothroyd"&gt;David Boothroyd, ''The History of British Political Parties'', Politico's Publishing, 2001, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlotism''' was a political movement that took place in the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] between 1808 and 1812; it intended to make [[Carlota Joaquina of Spain|Carlota Joaquina]], [[Infanta]] of Spain and [[List of Portuguese consorts|Queen Consort of Portugal]], its monarch.

After [[Napoleon's invasion of Spain]], [[Fernando VII]], Carlota's younger brother, was forced to abdicate and give the throne to [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. Most Spanish did not consider him a legitimate king and Carlota, an ambitious woman, seemed like a possible option to keep the royal line safe. 

Carlota was living in [[Brazil]] by then, after the nobility of [[Portugal]] moved from Portugal to the Americas because of [[Napoleón's invasion of Portugal]]. 

Carlotism found strong resistance from many parties involved: the viceroys, other Spanish authorities in the Americas, part of the [[Criollo people|Criollos]], and the British. The plans were never applied, and supporters of it would later turn to independence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5232">The '''Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons''' is an international [[treaty]] regulating the [[extradition]] and social rehabilitation of imprisoned persons. The convention was concluded in [[Strasbourg]] on 21 March 1983 and entered into force on 1 July 1985. It has been ratified by 66 countries, including every country of the [[Council of Europe]] except [[Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=112&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG| title = Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons|publisher =Council of Europe| accessdate = 3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been ratified by 19 states outside the Council of Europe, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]],the [[United States]] and India. The latest accession to the convention was India in January 2018. The convention, in particular, gives foreigners convicted of a criminal offence the possibility of serving their sentences in their home countries.

==Terms==
According to convention, the extradition (transfer) may be requested by either the state in which the sentence was imposed (the "sentencing State") or the state of which the sentenced person is a national (the "administering State").

Article 12 lets each party of the convention grant pardon or commutation of the sentence in accordance with its constitution or other laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/112.htm|publisher=Council of Europe|date= 21 March 1983|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8461">The term '''Cookie Pusher''' has been applied as a reference to [[diplomat]]s in general and members of the [[United States Foreign Service]] specifically.

==Origin==
The Listserv of the [[American Dialect Society]] documents "cookie pusher" as being coined by US diplomat [[Hugh S. Gibson]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;No "Cookie Pushers" For Diplomatic Corps; The Washington Post (1877-1954), Washington, D.C.; Jan 18, 1924; pg. 1, 1 pgs
POST-SCRIPTS; By GEORGE ROTHWELL BROWN
"Hugh Gibson, our minister to Finland, advocates chasing the tea hounds and cookie pushers out of the diplomatic service, but who, then would compete in the matrimonial market with foreign noblemen for our heiresses?" [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0305b&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=2109 Listserv of the American Dialect Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage mid-century==
The term has been used a number of times throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, sometimes in derogatory form but at other times in the spirit of a pseudonym for American [[Foreign Service Officer]]s.  A series of articles in the [[Christian Science Monitor]] that ran in February 1950 were subtitled "Alias Cookie Pushers."  The articles were very laudatory towards the US Foreign Service, talking about the conditions encountered at the time, versus stereotypes of diplomats being "striped pants Cookie Pushers from Harvard."&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/results.html?st=advanced&amp;QryTxt=%22Cookie+Pushers%22&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=6&amp;frommonth=02&amp;fromday=13&amp;fromyear=1950&amp;tomonth=03&amp;today=02&amp;toyear=1950&amp;By=&amp;Title=&amp;restrict=articles Christian Science Monitor, February 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Ivor Evans in ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' uses the term denoting a junior diplomat who functions as a roving waiter at an official reception, presumably "pushing" appetizers on people who don't really want them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OqIe3YFwsFkC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22cookie+pusher%22+diplomat&amp;ei=NUkLR91GjvTqArSGrdQJ&amp;sig=lLEwwZPa3rnPJ4cr9ziMuH2ZOhE Food: A Dictionary of Literal and Nonliteral Terms]  (NY: Harper and Row, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in US Department of State speeches==
* Former [[Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]] in his remarks to the House Appropriations Committee delivered on April 9, 1946, during hearings on the State Department's 1947 supply bill.
{{quote|As to these 'striped-pants' fellows, I have to take off my hat to them. I have found that through the years they have been step-children in the (diplomatic) service, so far as compensation goes... I see in the service no inducement to a young fellow to leave home, enter the service, be sent all over the world... Perhaps he rarely gets a chance to see his family or friends. Because we never see him, we reward him by calling him a '''cookie pusher'''. And the fellow himself never has a chance to say anything."&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor - 9 April 1946 pg.1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Former Ambassador [[R. Nicholas Burns]]:
{{quote|…We are also the victims of an unfortunate caricature of our profession. That is, a lot of people think we are pin-striped '''cookie pushers'''. I know that because I am a regular guest, for better or worse, on the [[Oliver North|Ollie North]] Show. His listeners often tell me that I'm a pin-striped '''cookie pusher'''. So we have got to find a way to communicate to the public what it is we do and who we are and why we're worth supporting. …&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/www/policy_remarks/970509.burns.html Remarks on Foreign Service Day, May 12, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* State Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary [[Wendy Chamberlin]]:
{{quote|…It is quite clear then that the challenge to those who are responsible for protecting our citizens is to become as global and coordinated in our response as the criminals are in their operations. We must respond internationally. And who then are among the players on this international field — the diplomats. What a frightening thought! The American press, not known for its gentle touch, refers to diplomats as '''cookie pushers''', or more charitably, as the stripe pants set. My mission today is to make a plausible case that the newest gladiators in the international crime arena are the diplomats…&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/p/inl/rls/rm/jan_apr/1078.htm Intensifying the Fight Against Transnational Organized Crime], January 23, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Former Deputy Secretary of State [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]]:
{{quote|…Now, I realize that when most people in this country and around the world think of the State Department, they probably think of [[Colin Powell|Secretary Powell]], not the men and women standing behind him and beside him with wires coming out of their ears. Or they think of polite '''cookie-pushers''' in pinstripes, not the fraud investigators who kick down doors to arrest career criminals or the trainers who are teaching Colombians how to foil the epidemic of kidnappings in that country. And while I would be the first to say we are fortunate, indeed, that people associate US diplomacy with Secretary Powell, we all know the other stereotype, about '''cookie-pushers''', just isn’t true, in the sense that our colleagues, regardless of what “cone” or office they may be in are putting their lives on the line for the American people every day, just like all of you are. In this Department of State family, we have the privilege of working with some of the most talented and dedicated people in this nation and we are all in this together.

The pinstriped stereotype is also untrue in another sense. The people who actually execute the diplomacy, the ones who negotiate treaties and write reporting cables, they are actually a very small part of our overall workforce. Approximately 11 percent, I believe. Moreover, they could not accomplish their duties without the other 89 percent. … And you can see clear illustration of this in our top foreign policy priorities of the day: the war on terrorism in general and [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] in particular. …&lt;ref&gt;[[Bureau of Diplomatic Security|Diplomatic Security's]] Worldwide Management Conference, March 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Former US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] to the [[U.S. Global Leadership Campaign]]:
{{quote|…I get annoyed when someone says, "Oh, they're pin-striped '''cookie pushers'''." You tell that to [[Zalmay Khalilzad|Ambassador Khalilzad]] in [[Kabul]], who spent all of last week and all of last Saturday criss-crossing the country, personal risk to himself, in order to encourage the Afghan people to vote.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">The '''Declaration of the Four Nations''' or the '''Four Power Declaration''' was signed on October 30, 1943 at the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|Moscow Conference]] by the [[Four Policemen|Big Four]]: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China. The declaration formally established the four power framework that would later influence the international order of the postwar world.{{sfn|Garver|1988|p=194}} It was [[Moscow Declarations|one of four declarations]] signed at the conference; the other three were the Declaration on Italy, the Declaration on Austria, and the Declarations on Atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United Nations Documents 1941–1945|date=1946|publisher=Oxford University Press for the Royal Institute Of International Affairs|url=https://archive.org/stream/unitednationsdoc031889mbp/unitednationsdoc031889mbp_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Four Power Declaration was drafted by State Department advisers such as [[Cordell Hull]] and [[Sumner Welles]], who presented it to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on August 10. Their proposal eschewed the regional councils preferred by Churchill in favor of establishing an international postwar organization. It omitted any discussion of the potentially controversial establishment of a permanent peacekeeping force after the war. Instead, its stated aim was simply the creation "at the earliest possible date of a general international organization."{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=420}}  

Roosevelt revealed the proposal to Churchill and [[Anthony Eden]] when they met at Quebec. The President stressed that the declaration would "in no way prejudice final decisions as to world order" and that the declaration was only an interim agreement. Churchill and Roosevelt reached a consensus that the Four Power Declaration should be given high priority at the Moscow Conference, whereas Stalin wanted the conference to focus on the ongoing war against Germany. The Russians also objected to the inclusion of the Republic of China as the fourth [[Great Power]] of the declaration; officially on the grounds that the Moscow Conference was planned as a meeting between three Great Powers (the US, UK, and the Soviet Union). Roosevelt suspected that Stalin's true motivations were to avoid antagonizing the Japanese, with whom they had signed a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|non-aggression pact]] in 1941. Churchill's view was that Stalin had a similar reluctance to recognize China as a Great Power.{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=420}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34081">'''Decree 900''' ({{lang-es|Decreto 900}}), also called the '''Agrarian Reform Law''', was a [[Guatemala]]n land reform law passed on June 17, 1952, during the [[Guatemalan Revolution]]. The law was introduced by [[President of Guatemala|President]] [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]] and passed by the Guatemalan Congress. It redistributed unused lands of sizes greater than 224 acres (0.902&amp;nbsp;km²) to local peasants, compensating landowners with [[government bonds]]. Land from at most 1,700 estates was redistributed to about 500,000 families—one sixth of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gleijeses|first1=Pietro|title=Shattered Hope|date=1991|isbn=9780691025568|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the legislation was to move Guatemala's economy from pseudo-[[feudalism]] into [[capitalism]]. Although in force for only eighteen months, the law had a major effect on the Guatemalan [[land reform]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), pp. 1, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous groups, deprived of land since the Spanish conquest, were major beneficiaries of the decree. In addition to raising agricultural output by increasing the cultivation of land, the reform is credited with helping many Guatemalans find dignity and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 470. "What an anthropologist wrote of Guatemala in the early 1930s still held true in the fifties: 'The land is for the Indian the symbol of his right to live, the connecting link between the material life with the divine existence.' For the first time since the Spanish conquest, the government returned land to the Indians. For the first time, also, the rural workers and small peasants participated in trade union activities, even though their role was confined to the local level."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, "Case History of U. S. Subversion" (1971), p. 138. "The most striking feature of the Arévalo-Arbenz period was the organization and activity of the working class and peasantry, resulting in the development of new and powerful political groups—political parties, peasants' associations, agrarian committees for land allotment, labor unions, women's organizations."&lt;/ref&gt; Decree 900 did create some conflicts in practice, but these were not major, and the law is described as one of the most potentially successful land reforms in history. However, redistribution angered major landowners—including the [[United Fruit Company]]—and the United States, which construed Guatemala's land reform as a communist threat. Decree 900 was thus a direct impetus for the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|1954 coup d'état]] which deposed Árbenz and instigated decades of [[Guatemalan Civil War|Civil War]].

==Background==
When Árbenz was elected in 1951, Guatemala had a high GDP but extremely unequal distribution of land: 2% of the population controlled 72% of the arable land. Only 12% of this land was under cultivation. Much of the population without land was [[Poverty|poor]], and had associated [[Diseases of poverty|health problems]].&lt;ref name=Trefzger&gt;Douglas W. Trefzger, "[http://www.ditext.com/trefzger/agrarian.html Guatemala's 1952 Agrarian Reform Law: A Critical Reassessment]", ''International Social Science Review'', 22 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous people had been treated as subordinate for hundreds of years, and had become increasingly impoverished and dependent on wages from plantation work. Indigenous people were also required to serve as migrant laborers through legal coercion, as Guatemala's coffee industry expanded rapidly from the 1870s through the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Wittman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), pp. 8–9. "The 1879 Constitution excluded the indigenous population, the primary workforce in Guatemala, from citizenship (Reeves 159).  Spanish and mestizo rights to land were restricted through the nationalization of land for the increased emphasis on coffee production."&lt;/ref&gt;

After Juan Jose Arévalo won the 1944 election, Guatemala created a reformist constitution in 1945. This constitution explicitly stated that the government should protect communal land and create policies that would lead to equitable distribution of wealth.&lt;ref name=Wittman/&gt; Article 88 of the [[Constitution of Guatemala|1945 Guatemalan Constitution]], which served as the legal basis for Decree 900, stipulates: "It is a primary function of the State to develop agricultural activities and industry in general, toward the end that the fruits of labor shall preferentially benefit those who produce them and that the wealth shall reach the greatest number of inhabitants of the Republic."&lt;ref name=Trefzger/&gt; Article 90 recognizes the existence of private property, but suggests that rights to property could be waived in the social interest.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theo R. G. Van Banning, ''The Human Right to Property'', ''Intersentia'' (2001), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This constitution marked the beginning of the Ten Years of Spring, also known as the [[Guatemalan Revolution (1944-1954)|Guatemalan Revolution]]: a period of democratization and liberal reforms.

Árbenz sought to transform Guatemala from a [[Feudalism|feudalist]] to a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] economy by distributing capital and creating infrastructure to increase production.&lt;ref&gt;McCleary, ''Dictating Democracy'' (1999), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UFHS&gt;Marcelo Bucheli and Ian Read, "Jacobo Arbenz (1913–1971)", ''United Fruit Historical Society'', 2001-2006; accessed 19 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David McCreery, "'An Odious Feudalism' : Mandamiento Labor and Commercial Agriculture in Guatemala, 1858-1920", ''Latin American Perspectives'' 13; accessed [http://lap.sagepub.com/content/13/1/99%20 via Sage], DOI: 10.1177/0094582X8601300105. "The shift of the North Atlantic economy in the nineteenth century from a predominance of mercantile to industrial capitalism, far from undermining the productive system or inducing and diffusing with in Guatemala modern capitalist relations, had the effect of strengthening precapitalist forms of exploitation and extending these to previously unaffected areas of the country."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) pp. 683–684.&lt;/ref&gt; The wish to transform Guatemala into a competitive capitalist nation led Árbenz to push for the construction of a national highway, a new port, a hydroelectric power plant—and for increased cultivation of unused lands.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, "Case History of U. S. Subversion" (1971), p. 137. "Arbenz was determined to transform Guatemala into a modern capitalist state, to free it economically from dependence on world coffee prices and to wrest control of the economy from the US corporations dominating it. He launched four major projects to these ends: a highway to the Atlantic Coast to undercut the transport monopoly of the International Railways of Central America; an Atlantic port to compete with the one controlled by the Railway and the United Fruit Company; a national hydroelectric plant to lessen dependence on the Electric Bond and Share subsidiary; and an agrarian reform program which would greatly increase land and labor utilization and hence expand agricultural production, particularly of domestically-consumed foodstuffs."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Árbenz  began promoting [[agrarian reform]] soon after becoming President. He was aided politically by a renewed [[Guatemalan Party of Labour|Communist Party of Guatemala]] (PGT), which believed that some amount of capitalist development necessarily preceded a communist revolution. Árbenz accepted help from the PGT and its leaders were among his personal friends; however, he rejected some of their proposals, including a mandate for the organization of producer cooperatives.&lt;ref name=Handy682&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 682. "There were substantial differences, however, between Gutiérrez's suggestion and the law proposed by Arbenz, which came only after two weeks of discussion among his full cabinet, in which many moderates as well as radical activists were represented. Most important of the differences was that Gutiérrez's proposal had favored the organization of full producer cooperatives on the expropriated land. Arbenz's draft did not even mention the formation of cooperatives, while the law passed by congress allowed for, but did not stress, cooperatives."&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed law gained widespread support among peoples' organizations and in the national press, but was opposed by the Asociación General de Agricultores (AGA), which represented the existing landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 455–458.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 682. "During the month that the proposed law was debated in congress, agrarian reform dominated the national dialogue. The revolutionary organizations, political parties, unions, and CNCG gave it their full support. Even the cautious and extremely influential newspaper ''El Imparcial'' gave agrarian reform limited support. The landowners' association attacked it vehemently, however."&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented with a draft by the President, the Guatemalan Congress met on Saturdays and Sundays for five weeks.&lt;ref name=Harbour13&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress introduced some changes to Árbenz's version, most notably restoring the idea of cooperatives (although not to the degree proposed by the PGT).&lt;ref name=Handy682/&gt; Decree 900—''Decreto Número 900 El Congreso De La República De Guatemala''—was passed on 17 June 1952 at 1:45 AM and signed into law by Árbenz on the same day.&lt;ref name=Harbour13/&gt; It called for 603,704 hectares of farmland to be redistributed to 100,000 families.&lt;ref name=Trefzger/&gt; Specifically, it authorized the redistribution of all uncultivated land on estates larger than 672 acres, and of land on estates sized from 224–672 acres, on which less than two-thirds of the land was cultivated. It also specified total redistribution of the government owned ''fincas nacionales'', which contributed a quarter of the nation's coffee production.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 459–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1 of the law reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Agrarian Reform of the October Revolution intends to eliminate the feudal  property structure in the countryside and develop relations of production that originate to develop the land to the form of operational and capitalist methods of production in agriculture and to prepare the way for the industrialization of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of the law stated that it was intended to “eliminate all feudal type property...especially work-servitude and the remnant of slavery.”&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber, ''Inevitable Revolutions'' (1993), p. 118; citing [[Blanche Wiesen Cook]], ''The Declassified Eisenhower'' (Garden City, N.Y., 1981), page 224; Neale J. Pearson, "Guatemala: The Peasant Union Movement, 1944-1954," in ''Latin American Peasant Movements'' ed. Henry A. Landsberger (Ithaca, 1969), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Decree 900 specifically abolished slavery, unpaid labor, work as payment of rent, and relocation of indigenous workers.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanisms===

The law did not redistribute land automatically. It created a National Agrarian Department (DAN), and required people without land to file requests with Local Agrarian Committees (CALs). CALs would then make decisions about how to reappropriate the land of major owners. Landowners could dispute these decisions, with an appeals process going all the way up to the President.&lt;ref name=Trefzger/&gt; The committees were formed from local groups, and intended to foster the spirit of community control and local political power. As suggested by the PGT, the law also gave new landowners the option of choosing lifetime tenure instead of private ownership, with the goal of preventing large landowners from simply buying back the land. The ''Fincas Nationales'' were available only through the lifetime tenure option.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 460–461. "Moreover, through the Departmental Agrarian Committees and the Local Agrarian Committees, Decree 900 sought to stimulate the participation of the peasants and the labour organizations, rather than to impose the reform from the top alone.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[José Manuel Fortuny]], a PGT leader who helped draft the legislation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We [the PGT] proposed the creation of peasant committees [CALs] in order to lay the groundwork for the eventual radicalization of the peasantry. We talked to Arbenz about this, and he agreed with us. What we wanted was to foster the control of the reform from below. This would give the peasants a strong sense of their common needs. And if, from the system of lifetime tenure, cooperatives developed, the seeds of a more collective society would have been sown.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the law established a system for using bonds to compensate people who lost acres to peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; The property owners were paid in bonds which matured in 25 years; value of the land was based on claims made on the previous year's tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land, literacy and credit===
Credit for those receiving land was mandated by additional legislation in 1953, which also established a National Agrarian Bank (BNA). The government dispensed $3,371,185 in loans during 1953; $3,049,092 had been paid back by July 1954—a historically unusual success in lending.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 466–467. "In view of Guatemala's history, and of the severe economic and technical constraints faced by the government, the amount of credit provided by the CHN and the BNA in one year is remarkable. A 1965 report of the Organization of American States—not a radical group—concluded, 'The success of the agrarian credit policy was no less impressive than that of the land redistribution policy'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1954, land and credit were supplemented by literacy programs—the third major plank of the reform program.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 470–471. "Literacy, land, and credit were, they stressed, intimately connected: the peasants needed to read and write in order to "present their demands [for land], transact their business with the agrarian authorities, and deal with other problems such as writing to the Agrarian Committees, asking for credit from the Agrarian Bank, buying and selling their crops, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on Guatemala==

===Land and farming===
By 1954, 1.4 million acres had been reappropriated. 100,000 families (about 500,000 people, one sixth of the population) had received land as well as bank credit and technical aid.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 465–466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The law affected about 1,700 estates of the country's richest and most conservative people and groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karabell|first=Zachary|title=Architects of intervention: the United States, the Third World, and the Cold War|pages=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFqVhFSGcTMC&amp;pg=PA98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of corn, coffee, and bananas increased while the law was in effect in 1953 and 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 468–469. "Contrary to the hopes of the government's detractors, Decree 900 did not result in the collapse of agricultural output. Rather, notes an Amiercan scholar, the existing data, 'seem to indicate that agrarian reform...unleashed new productive energies from which both the peasants and those ''finqueros'' whose previously idle land was put to use."&lt;/ref&gt; High coffee prices bolstered the national economy and offset the flight of foreign capital.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the U.S. Embassy in 1954, "A preliminary analysis of the President's report left little doubt, as long as coffee prices are at their present high level, that the Guatemalan economy was basically prosperous."&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), pp. 476–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decree 900 led to the expropriation of 1700 acres of Árbenz's own land and 1,200 acres belonging to foreign minister Guillermo Toriello.&lt;ref name=UFHS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Argueta, ''Living Abroad in Guatemala'' (Moon), Avalon Travel (2009), p.41. {{ISBN|9781598802078}}. "Arbenz himself was not immune from land expropriation, giving up 1,700 acres of his own land in the process."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, "Case History of U. S. Subversion" (1971), p. 138. "Among the lands expropriated were 1700 acres owned by President Arbenz and 1200 acres owned by Foreign Minister Guillermo Toriello."&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Agriculture Nicolás Brol also had some of his land redistributed.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts over implementation===
Various sources (including Árbenz and the government) reported conflicts over implementing the law. Decree 900 triggered domestic opposition from landowners and some elements within the military.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, "U.S. Foreign Policy toward Radical Change" (1993), p. 91. "Domestic resistance to the Arbenz regime became more violent after Decree 900 became law, with incidents of antigovernment violence tripling between the first and third quarters of 1952. While nearly all violent antigovernment incidents (bombings, assassinations, etc.) before the reform occurred in the capital, two-thirds of the incidents after the reform were outside the capital.&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms were also opposed by the Catholic Church and the business class.&lt;ref name=Wittman&gt;Hannah Wittman with Laura Saldivar-Tanaka, "[http://ruta.org:8180/xmlui/handle/123456789/708 The Agrarian Question in Guatemala]"; in ''Promised Land: Competing Visions of Agrarian Reform'', ed. Peter Rosset, Rajeev Charles Patel, Michael Courville, New York: Food First Books (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

Landowners complained of unfair practices, but so did others who felt excluded or as though they were getting a bad deal. Some peasants seized land without going through the legal channels, believing that the law provided them with a mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handy, ''Revolution in the Countryside'' (1994), p. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the expropriators fought each other over who would get a certain piece of land.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt; Other violent incidents among peasants were self-defense or retaliation against landowners who sought to disobey the law or intimidate them. In some places, peasants organized groups for self-defense and requested (usually without success) arms permits from the government.&lt;ref name="Handy 1988 p. 693"&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Neale Pearson, there were instances where "peasants illegally occupied lands and a few in which they burned pastures or crops in order to have land declared uncultivated and subject to expropriation. But these cases were isolated and limited to number".&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, "Confederación Nacional Campesina'', p.180; quoted in Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes legal councils had difficulty measuring land, or determining how much land on an estate was really unused.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

Union representatives began to travel through the countryside, informing people of the new law. Landowners closed private roads going through their property in order to prevent peasants from becoming informed of the changes. The government announced that all road would become public.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; Some local police forces (and other government officials) initially sanctioned some landowner retaliation. These groups, too, responded to government pressure to implement the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in political power===
By 1954, more than 3000 CALs had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations, which controlled the distribution of land at a local level, represented a substantial increase in political power for ordinary people and people's organizations such as unions. However, the law also increased the power of the President and of the new national council, the DAN.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the Supreme Court ruled that the lack of judicial oversight for the reform was unconstitutional, and it blocked any further implementation. Congress, with Árbenz's urging, voted to impeach four judges.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 464–465.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision provoked anti-government demonstrations, in the course of which one person was killed.&lt;ref name="Handy 1988 p. 693"/&gt;

Historian Douglas Trefzger has reported that the land reform disproportionately benefited [[Ladino people|Ladinos]], relative to [[Amerindian|Indians]].&lt;ref name=Trefzger/&gt; It seems that although the short-lived policies of Decree 900 had a positive effect on indigenous Guatemalans—particularly on their political consciousness—poverty and associated problems persisted.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Shelton H. Davis, "The Mayan Movement and National Culture in Guatemala"; in ''Culture and Public Action'', ed. Vijayendra Rao and Michael Walton, Stanford University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CNCG peasant league, founded in 1950 by activists and members of the teachers' union, grew rapidly during this time and by 1945 was the largest peoples' organization in the country. The second largest was the CGTG, a rural labor union.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) pp. 694–695.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts were made to win military support for Decree 900. These included the provision of incentives for peasants to join the army, as well as attempts to foster ties between the armed forces and the DAN. Some conflicts did emerge around the country as military leaders and peasant organizers competed for local power. These were ameliorated by new appointments to military positions. But these changes in military structure further upset some officers and contributed to the desertions and defections that allowed the coup to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, "The Most Precious Fruit of the Revolution" (1988) p. 701–704. "The increasing strength of the peasant league and workers' federation in rural areas, coupled with the disarray apparent in the military's rural apparatus, raised grave fears among many officers over their ability to control these organizations. The support they received from the president and the apparent impunity with which local affiliates of these organizations broke the law, invaded property not affected by Decree 900, and provoked escalating unrest in the army's traditional domain prompted much bitterness."&lt;/ref&gt;

==International response and 1954 coup==

===Expropriation of United Fruit===

In 1953 Árbenz announced that under the Agrarian Reform Law—specifically, because of an order made by the DAN—Guatemala was expropriating approximately&lt;ref name=BowenUFCO/&gt; 234,000 acres (947&amp;nbsp;km²) of uncultivated land from the [[United Fruit Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; United Fruit owned {{convert|550000|acre|km2}} in Guatemala, 42% of the nation’s (arable) land.&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber, ''Inevitable Revolutions'' (1993), p. 120; citing Graham H. Stuart, and James L. Tigner, ''Latin America and the United States'', 6th ed. (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1975), pp. 519-520; Blanche Wiesen Cook, ''The Declassified Eisenhower'' (Garden City, N.Y., 1981), pp. 221-225.&lt;/ref&gt; The company was compensated with $627,572 in bonds for the expropriation of their holdings, the amount United Fruit had claimed the land was worth for tax purposes. However, United Fruit proceeded to claim that its land was worth more. It had close ties to U.S. officials and lobbied the U.S. for intervention. The US State Department, on behalf of the United Fruit Company, claimed to Guatemala that the land was worth $15,854,849.&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber, ''Inevitable Revolutions'' (1993), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States opposition===
A report written by the U.S. State Department's Office of Intelligence Research suggested that the reform itself would only affect 1,710 landowners, but expressed fear that the law would strengthen the position of communists in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, ''The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz" (1989), p. 461–462.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. opposition to the Árbenz government certainly resulted from his reformist policies, but historians differ on the relative importance of expropriating United Fruit versus the apparent communist threat implied by land reform.&lt;ref name=Streeter&gt;Stephen M. Streeter, "Interpreting the 1954 U.S. Intervention in Guatemala: Realist, Revisionist, and Postrevisionist Perspectives", ''The History Teacher'' 34(1), November 2000; accessed [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3054375 via JStor].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the Agrarian Reform Law, the [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company]] in August 1952 announced that it would no longer purchase Guatemalan [[chicle]]. Since [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company]] had been the sole buyer of the product, the Árbenz government suddenly had to provide a massive aid program for [[chicle]] harvesters.&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber, ''Inevitable Revolutions'' (1993), p. 119; citing Donald Dozer, ''Are We Good Neighbors? Inter-American Relations 1930–1960'', Gainesville FL, 1959, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

After aborting a coup attempt called [[Operation PBFORTUNE]], the United States—through its [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)—renewed efforts to unseat Árbenz with [[Operation PBSUCCESS]] (1953–1954). It sought to develop relationships with members of Guatemalan military, and instituted an arms blockade that caused the military to fear a security crisis or even US invasion. The key agent for a possible coup was the exiled colonel [[Castillo Armas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, "U.S. Foreign Policy toward Radical Change" (1993), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA also intensified propaganda campaigns to isolate Guatemala among Central American nations,&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, "U.S. Foreign Policy toward Radical Change" (1993), pp. 92–94. "At the same time, the United States sold new weapons to Guatemala's neighbors, promising future weapons purchases to the Guatemalan high command should Arbenz be removed from office. Already partners with the United States in a regionwide, mutual defense treaty(the Rio Treaty), Nicaragua and Honduras each signed supplementary military assistance pacts on a bilateral basis with the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; and to convince the Guatemalan people that the Árbenz regime was on the brink of collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, "U.S. Foreign Policy toward Radical Change" (1993), p. 94. "In May and June 1954, CIA radio transmitters broadcast pro-Castillo Armas propaganda designed to neutralize the army. Nonexistent civilian uprisings, military defections and bogus incidents of sabotage were reported over CIA-manned Radio Liberation located outside Guatemala. When official Guatemalan radio stations attempted to counteract these erroneous rumors, Radio Liberation copied the identifying music and bells of the government station, enabling it to impose its own broadcast as the official government program, while jamming equipment in the U.S. embassy was blocking reception of the official station."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military coup===
In June 1954, Árbenz Guzmán was overthrown by a [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|multi-faceted coup operation]] involving a small army led by Castillo Armas, scattered right-wing violence in the countryside, a U.S. Navy blockade (called [[Operation Hardrock Baker]]), bombardment by CIA planes, and a sophisticated CIA strategy of [[psychological warfare]] intended to demoralize Árbenz and provoke military defections.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Cullather, ''Secret History, Second Edition: The CIA’s Classified Account of Its Operations in Guatemala, 1952-1954'', Stanford University Press, 2006; particularly Appendix A ("PBSUCCESS Timeline")&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although Armas's ground invasion was quickly defeated, Árbenz resigned his post and Armas won control from the  vacuum of power.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, "Case History of U. S. Subversion" (1971), p. 146–147. "Apparently unnverved by his isolation from the army and unwilling to face a large-scale civil war, he capitulated. Communists made vain, intensive efforts to persuade him to organize civilian resistance, but with his resignation they and other leading government backers became demoralized and fled to foreign embassies."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal==
Armas became President on 8 July. He quickly repealed Decree 900 and reversed 95% of the redistribution that had occurred.&lt;ref name=Wittman/&gt; (All of the land formerly owned by United Fruit was restored.)&lt;ref name=BowenUFCO&gt;Bowen, "U.S. Foreign Policy toward Radical Change" (1993), p. 90. "It seems that ultimately UFCO was the largest loser of land, but the extent of their losses is in dispute." [Estimates range from 178,000–653,000 acres.] "Whatever the actual amount, no one disputes that these lands were returned to UFCO by Castillo."&lt;/ref&gt; Government documents pertaining to Decree 900 were also destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Armas created a new Agrarian Commission and passed two new laws, which restored control over land policy to government officials. Some land changed hands as a result of these laws, but the scope of reform was substantially reduced. Armas also abolished government support for labor unions and denounced their members as communists.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A long period of civil war followed, with indigenous and poor Guatemalans pitted against landowners and the military. Peace accords reached in 1996 repudiate Armas's policy, and those that followed, calling for a return to the idea of land as a social good.&lt;ref&gt;Harbour, ''Creating a New Guatemala'' (2008), p. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has been predominantly represented in public since July 2012 by [[Cody Wilson]], who is described as a founder and spokesperson.&lt;ref name=reason20121212/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Rich |url=https://news.yahoo.com/you-don-t-bring-a-3d-printer-to-a-gun-fight----yet.html |title=You don't bring a 3D printer to a gun fight - yet - Yahoo!

===Purpose===
According to the Defense Distributed website, the nonprofit is organized and operated for charitable and literary purposes, specifically "to defend the [[civil liberty]] of popular access to arms as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and affirmed by the Supreme Court, through facilitating global access to, and the collaborative production of, information and knowledge related to the 3D printing of arms; and to publish and distribute... such information and knowledge in promotion of the public interest."&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2/&gt; The website's “Manifesto” link directs users to an online version of John Milton's essay ''[[Areopagitica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/video-want-a-free-download-of-a-semi-automatic-rifle-print-one/|title=Want a Free Download of a Semi-Automatic Rifle? Print One!|publisher=thelibertarianrepublic.com |date=March 3, 2013|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization’s motivations have been described as "less about [a] gun... than about democratizing manufacturing technology,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Rich|title=You don't bring a 3D printer to a gun fight -- yet|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57499326-76/you-dont-bring-a-3d-printer-to-a-gun-fight-yet/|accessdate=September 21, 2012|newspaper=CNET|date=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview with ''[[Slashdot]]'', [[Cody Wilson]] described the Wiki Weapon project as a chance to  "experiment with Enlightenment ideas… to literally materialize freedom.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/09/04/1837209/should-we-print-guns-cody-r-wilson-says-yes-video|title=Should We Print Guns? Cody R. Wilson Says "Yes" (Video) -Slashdot |publisher=Hardware.slashdot.org |date=|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Bitcoin 2012 in [[London]], Wilson explained the organization as interested in inspiring libertarian forms of social organization and technologically driven inversions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bitcoin2012.com/ |title=Bitcoin2012 London |publisher=Bitcoin2012.com |date= |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratasys confiscation===
Learning of Defense Distributed's plans in 2012, manufacturer [[Stratasys|Stratasys, Ltd]] threatened legal action and demanded the return of the 3D printer it had leased to Wilson.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; On September 26, before the printer was assembled for use, Wilson received an email from Stratasys suggesting that he might use the printer "for illegal purposes".&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/3d-gun-blocked/|title=3-D Printer Company Seizes Machine From Desktop Gunsmith|first=Robert|last=Beckhusen|publisher=[[Wired News]]|date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stratasys immediately canceled its lease with Wilson and sent a team to confiscate the printer the next day.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes3"/&gt;

Defense Distributed's efforts have prompted renewed discussion and examination of the [[Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988|Undetectable Firearms Act]].&lt;ref name=reason20121212&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=Brian|title=Disruptions: With a 3-D Printer, Building a Gun With the Push of a Button|url=http://reason.com/archives/2012/12/12/what-3-d-printing-means-for-gun-rights|newspaper=Reason.com|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBT2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mashable&gt;{{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|title=3D-Printable Guns Face Federal Ban|url=http://mashable.com/2012/12/10/3d-printed-guns-ban/|newspaper=Mashable|date=December 10, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNET2&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Rich|title=The Undetectable Firearms Act and 3D-printed guns (FAQ)|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57558213-76/the-undetectable-firearms-act-and-3d-printed-guns-faq/|newspaper=CNET|date=December 10, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberator pistol was cited in White House and Congressional calls to renew the Act in 2013.&lt;ref name="CNNUFA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pérez|first=Evan|title=ATF tests show 3-D guns lethal as metal detection law expires|website=CNN.com|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/14/politics/3d-guns/|date=November 15, 2013|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTUFA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Michael|title=Law Limiting Plastic Guns Set to Expire|website=The New York Times|url=http://nyti.ms/1n28WTJ|date=November 28, 2013|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Defense Distributed has been obliquely endorsed by the [[Gun Owners of America]] (GOA).&lt;ref name=WaPo2&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenwald|first=Michael|title=Weapons made with 3-D printers could test gun-control efforts|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-18/local/37160880_1_gun-control-gun-range-gun-owners|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in citation|date=August 2017}} However, the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) has offered - to date - no public comment on the organization or its activities.

[[Open source software]] advocate [[Eric S Raymond|Eric S. Raymond]] has endorsed the organization and its efforts, calling Defense Distributed "friends of freedom" and writing "I approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force. As 3D printers become less expensive and more ubiquitous, this could be a major step in the right direction."&lt;ref name="ESR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4521|title=Defense Distributed|first=Eric|last=Raymond|publisher=Armed and Dangerous|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verge3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kopfstein|first=Janus|title=Guns want to be free: what happens when 3D printing and crypto-anarchy collide?|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4209364/guns-want-to-be-free-what-happens-when-3d-printing-and-crypto-anarchy|journal=[[The Verge]]|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron Timms of Blouin News has written Defense Distributed has performed “the greatest piece of political performance art of [the 21st] century.”,&lt;ref name=Blouin1&gt;{{cite news|last=Timms|first=Aaron|title=The future of 3D printing might be scarier than you thought

For its activities, Defense Distributed has been accused of endangering public safety and attempting to frustrate and alter the US system of government.&lt;ref name="WiredD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/12/most-dangerous-people/?pid=1696|title=The 15 Most Dangerous People in the World|publisher=[[Wired Danger Room]]|date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTDC&gt;{{cite news|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=Open and Closed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/opinion/sunday/morozov-open-and-closed.html?_r=0|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2013|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics have also noted that Defense Distributed has merely offered the means of production back to the masses in a way not too dissimilar from the effect the printing press had on the spread of information and the decentralization of power in societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/02/_3d_printed_gun_wiki_weapon_on_hold_after_stratasys_revokes_lease_on_printer.html|title=Designer of 3-D Printable Gun Has His 3-D Printer Seized|last=Oremus|first=Will|date=2012-10-02|work=Slate|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">A '''deputy governor''' is a gubernatorial official who is subordinated to a [[governor]], rather like a [[lieutenant governor]].

==British colonial cases==
In the British Empire, there were such colonial offices in:
* The two divisions of [[New Jersey]] ([[East Jersey]] and [[West Jersey]]) from 1664 to 1702 as many of the colonies' proprietors and governors remained in England and delegated administrative authority to deputies who resided in the colony. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
*[[Delaware]], while it was part of the province of Pennsylvania (lower counties; till 22 November 1704), the sole incumbent (only 1691–1693) being William Markham (1635?–1704)
*[[Montserrat]] since the start in 1632, first under the Governor of Antigua, then 1667–1816 while the island was part of the [[Leeward Islands colony]] (governed till 1696 from [[Nevis]], then from Saint John's on [[Antigua]])
* [[Province of Pennsylvania]] and [[Delaware counties]], where the position was a deputy to the proprietors, namely [[William Penn]] and his heirs, who were often absent.
*[[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] (January 1671 – 1816) while the Antillian islands (who had their own governor before and after) were part of the above Leeward Islands Colony.
*[[Massachusetts]], while known as the Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Humphrey served as deputy governor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.town.swampscott.ma.us/Public_Documents/SwampscottMA_WebDocs/about Swampscott, MA - About Swampscott&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rhode Island]] had a position of deputy governor, dating back to when it was still a colony, until 1799, when it was renamed [[lieutenant governor]].
* Though these cases are not truly British colonial cases, as these positions were established well after the two states have attained independence, the [[States of Nigeria]] and the [[Counties of Kenya]] have Deputy Governors elected under a running-mate system alongside the elected, executive Governors.

==Governor's deputy==
This variation was used once, in [[British Kaffraria]] (a separate Crown colony since 1860, first under a lieutenant governor; native inhabitants [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]), for its last own gubernatorial official before its final (re)incorporation into the [[Cape Colony]]: 24 December 1864 – 17 April 1866 (Robert Graham)

After getting her [[General Equivalency Diploma]], in 1979, Amaya-Bonilla received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] with high honors in Education from [[Medgar Evers College]] in [[New York City]]. She also has a [[Master's degree|M.A.]] and Advanced Certificate in Guidance and Counseling from [[Brooklyn College]].&lt;ref name=CongressionalRecord-Towns-2003 /&gt;

== Career ==
After moving to New York City, Amaya-Bonilla worked in many different jobs, one of which was with [[Franciscan monk|Franciscan monks]], who gave her a recommendation that led to a job at [[World Book Encyclopedia]], where she worked for five years.&lt;ref name=BeingGarifuna-Interview-1-2012 /&gt;

Amaya-Bonilla worked at the [[NYC Board of Education]] in various positions as a teacher until eventually working as a guidance counselor. She worked in these positions for over 22 years.&lt;ref name=CongressionalRecord-Towns-2003 /&gt;

Outside of her education and counseling work, Amaya-Bonilla worked with her church, St. Mathews Catholic Church, to provide fundraising and support to her community. Notable relief efforts included the 1974 [[Hurricane Fifi]] that hit Honduras and the 1990 [[Happy Land Fire]].&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews-HappyLandFire-1991&gt;{{cite news|last1=Negron|first1=Edna|title=Club Tragedy an Awakening for Garifuna|url=http://garifunaworld.blogspot.com/2008/04/club-tragedy-awakening-for-garifuna.html|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=[[Newsday (New York)|Newsday]]|date=18 August 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the Mugama organization created a scholarship fund in honor of a [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] who died in the fire.&lt;ref name=CongressionalRecord-Towns-2003 /&gt; From 1989 until her death, Amaya-Bonilla was a [[Eucharistic Minister]] at Lady of Mercy Church in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref name=SourcebookEminent-2001 /&gt;

Amaya-Bonilla helped to organize Committee for Development in Honduras (COPRODH) in the mid-1970s in direct response of helping Hondurans affected by Hurricane Fifi, and Hondurans in the United States.&lt;ref name=SourcebookEminent-2001 /&gt; Amaya-Bonilla was a strong supporter of the value of education in helping her community, so she worked to support recent [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] immigrants in their effort to learn English and get an education to advance themselves.&lt;ref name=SourcebookEminent-2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CityLimits-Garifuna-2000&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=Laura|title=Points of Entry: New York's Garifuna|url=http://citylimits.org/2000/04/01/points-of-entry-new-yorks-garifuna/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=[[City Limits (New York magazine)|City Limits]]|date=1 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, Amaya-Bonilla, Mirtha Sabio, and Lydia Sacasa-Hill, and others founded an organization called MUGAMA, to recognize the contributions of Garifunan women's accomplishments. The organization was inspired by [[International Women's Day]], in an effort to honor women in the Garifuna community.&lt;ref name=BeingGarifuna-Interview-1-2012 /&gt; MUGAMA held conferences and provided recognition within the community, gained non-profit status, and worked to help people get their [[General Equivalency Diploma]] and [[English as a second or foreign language]], and U.S. citizenship. The name MUGAMA came from Garifuna Women Marching in Action aka Women on the Move Pro-Education=Mujeres Garifunas en Marcha Pro-Educación,&lt;ref name=CrossingBoundaries-2013 /&gt; with Garinagu the plural word for Garifuna people.&lt;ref name=SourcebookEminent-2001 /&gt; MUGAMA was based out of the Riverdale Osborne Towers in East New York.&lt;ref name=CityLimits-Garifuna-2000 /&gt;

In 1991, MUGAMA was a sponsor of the First Intercontinental Garifuna Summit Meeting conference that was held at [[Medgar Evers College]] in Brooklyn, New York. The event was the first of its kind to bring  [[Garifuna]] people from the United States together to have a political and cultural exchange of resources and establish a large community gathering.&lt;ref name=SourcebookEminent-2001 /&gt;

Amaya-Bonilla was a founding member of the Federation of Honduran Organizations of New York (FEDOHNY).&lt;ref name=CrossingBoundaries-2013 /&gt;

:''This article is about a defunct political party. For the antisemitic stereotype, see [[Jewish Bolshevism]].''

The '''Hebrew Communists''' ({{lang-he|קומוניסטים עברים}}, ''Komunistim Ivrim'') were a short-lived [[List of political parties in Israel|political party]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] and [[Israel]]. The Hebrew Communists were founded in 1945 by some former members of the [[Palestine Communist Party]] (PCP), which had split in 1943. The party operated until after [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli independence]] in 1948, at which point it merged with the [[National Liberation League in Palestine|National Liberation League]] and [[Palestine Communist Party|MAKEI]] to form [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]].

The party was resurrected during the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first Knesset]] when several of Maki's leaders, including [[Knesset]] member [[Eliezer Preminger]], were purged soon after the elections in 1949. Rather than vacate his seat for another Maki member, Preminger remained in the [[Knesset]] and reformed the Hebrew Communists on 8 June 1949. The party ceased to exist for a second time on 15 August 1949 when Preminger joined [[Mapam]].

The '''Higher Institute of National Defence''' was an organ of the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]], then of the [[Khmer Rouge]] remnants in 1990s, with an advisory role on military issues. It was established in 1985.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

When [[Pol Pot]] left the leadership of the [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]] and of the [[National Army of Democratic Kampuchea]] in 1985 for age limits, he was appointed Director of the newly established Higher Institute of National Defence, apparently a ''facade'' position, but actually a very powerful one, since the Institute's role was to sum up the experiences of the guerrilla resistance and to advise the Government and the Army on the new course of actions. Moreover, since Pol Pot was the recognised communist leader of [[Cambodia]] his influence did not vanish, and for instance, he was able to order the arrest and execution of former NADK Supreme Commander [[Son Sen]] in 1997.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Higher Institute ceased to exist with the dissolution of the [[Khmer Rouge]] in 1998, but probably its functions were over since Pol Pot's arrest and [[show trial]] in 1997.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although current modes and technologies of [[surveillance]] seem to suggest that surveillance is a product of the 21st century, there are countless examples of surveillance activities occurring throughout history.  

As Keith Laidler proposes in his book Surveillance Unlimited: How We’ve Become the Most Watched People on Earth, “spying and surveillance are at least as old as civilization itself. The rise of city states and empires […] meant that each needed to know not only the disposition and morale of their enemy, but also the loyalty and general sentiment of their own population.”&lt;ref name="Laidler"&gt;Laidler, Keith ''Surveillance Unlimited: How We’ve Become the Most Watched People on Earth'' Cambridge ; Crows Nest [Australia] : Icon Books Ltd., 2008. page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In history, surveillance is often referred to as spying or [[espionage]]. Most often, surveillance historically occurred as a means to gather and collect information, supervise the actions of other people (usually enemies), and to use this information to increase ones understanding of the party being spncient times, surveillance occurred most often through the use of an individual spy, or a small group of spies. As technology such as spyglasses, [[telescopes]] and [[Invention of radio|radios]] developed, surveillance technologies continually effected the way in which surveillance occurred. Modern surveillance technologies such [[CCTV]], [[RFID]] and [[GPS]] help to highlight the extent to which surveillance practices have evolved throughout history.

==Biblical surveillance==

There are many possible examples of surveillance found in the [[Bible]]. One example found in [[2 Samuel]], is that of [[David]] and [[Bathsheba]] found in the second book of Samuel. David, while walking on the roof of his palace, noticed Bathsheba bathing and as he continued to watch her his desire grew, even though she was already the wife of Uriah. In this example, surveillance was used for David’s own personal gains and pleasure rather than for a greater good.

Another example, as noted by Kieith Laidler, can be found in the [[Book of Numbers]]. Here, “details of the information that the spies were required to collect” mostly regarding the land, how many people live on the land, the layout of the towns, the quality of the soil and the presence of trees (Numbers 13: 17-20).&lt;ref name="Laidler"/&gt;  Unlike the story of David and Bathsheba, here surveillance is being used for very different means. By collecting information regarding the people and the land, the spies would have been able to determine the strengths and weaknesses of their enemies. This use of surveillance satisfies one of the most basic characteristics of surveillance historically as well as modernly.

==Espionage in ancient Egypt==

According to Terry Crowdy in his book ''The Enemy Within: A History of Espionage'':
:::"the earliest surviving record of espionage dates from the time of [[Ramesses II|Pharaoh Rameses]]’ war with the [[Hittites]] and the [[battle of Kadesh]]. (c.1274 BC)…The Hittite [[Muwatalli II|king Muwatallis]] sent two spies into the Egyptian camp posing as deserters to convince pharaoh that the Hittite army was still quite distant. Rameses believed their story and unwittingly allowed part of his army to march into a Hittite ambush. Fortunately for the [[pharaoh]], he captured two more Hittite spies and had his officers interrogate them…the Hittites spies revealed that an ambush had been set…Ramses was therefore able to bring up reserves and avert disaster at what became known as the battle of Kadesh.”&lt;ref name="Crowdy"&gt;Terry Crowdy ''The Enemy Within: A History of Espionage'' Oxford ; New York : Osprey, 2006. page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdy makes an important point by recognizing the fact that the precedent for altering general surveillance practices occurred very early on in History. Although most often spies are "known as collectors of information, they are often used to disseminate false information in order to deliberately mislead opponents.”&lt;ref name="Crowdy"/&gt;

'''Home of Truth''' is a [[ghost town]] located in [[San Juan County, Utah|San Juan County]] in southeastern [[Utah]], United States. The settlement was a short-lived [[utopia]]n religious [[intentional community]] in the 1930s, led by a [[spiritualist]] named Marie Ogden. The Home of Truth started in 1933 with an initial population of 22 people, but grew to around 100 at its peak.

During its brief history the town was isolated from the surrounding community socially as well as physically, its residents keeping to themselves in a strict, simple lifestyle. Ogden took over the local newspaper and used it to introduce outsiders to her beliefs. The crisis that led to the downfall of the Home of Truth resulted from her writings about efforts to raise a woman from the dead. The investigations by local authorities and the intense media attention that followed drove most of the members to abandon the group by the end of 1937. A handful of residents continued to occupy Home of Truth until 1977.

Today the empty buildings at Home of Truth, lying on fenced private land, are little-noticed curiosities along [[Utah State Route 211]], seen mainly by visitors to the Needles district of [[Canyonlands National Park]].

==Location==
[[File:Photograph Gap Utah.jpeg|thumb|left|Photograph Gap. The "Inner Portal" is on the horizon just to the right of the road.]]
The site of Home of Truth lies about {{convert|15|mi}} north of [[Monticello, Utah]], and some {{convert|3|mi}} west of [[Church Rock (Utah)|Church Rock]]. The settlement was spread out along Dry Valley, bounded on the north and south by irregular mountain ridges that come close together at the western end, in a place called Photograph Gap. [[Utah State Route 211]], the road to [[Newspaper Rock]] and the entrance to the Needles district of [[Canyonlands National Park]], passes through the site.

==History==

===Foundation===
[[File:Unfinished Chapel at the Middle Portal.jpg|thumb|left|Unfinished chapel at the Middle Portal]]
Marie Ogden (May 31, 1883 &amp;ndash; March 4, 1975)&lt;ref name=burial/&gt; was a wealthy, well-educated widow from [[Newark, New Jersey]]. She was prominent and active in community affairs, working for the welfare of the poor&lt;ref name=west/&gt; and rising to the presidency of the New Jersey State Federation of Women's Clubs. After the death of her husband, Harry Ogden, in 1929, she sought comfort in [[spiritualism]],&lt;ref name=record/&gt; soon forming an [[occult]] group called the School of Truth. Ogden was attracted to the idea that spiritualism could allow her to communicate with her dead husband and learn why he died, as well as to find the answers to life for herself.&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Joel Jay|title=Finding a Home of Truth in Utah’s Unforgiving Land The story of Marie M. Ogden and her metaphysical world|url=https://www.academia.edu/7277211/Finding_a_Home_of_Truth_in_Utahs_Unforgiving_Land_The_story_of_Marie_M._Ogden_and_her_metaphysical_world|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She briefly joined the early "League of the Liberators" organization of spiritualist [[William Dudley Pelley]], whose esoteric spiritual experiences and [[millennialism|millennialist]] teachings resonated with her. In 1932 she became the largest single financial contributor to Pelley's movement,&lt;ref name=hcua/&gt; but she parted ways with him over his developing political extremism. Claiming to receive divine [[revelation]]s through [[automatic writing]] on her [[typewriter]], Ogden toured the country lecturing and gathering followers.&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt;

While on her lecture tour in [[Boise, Idaho]], Ogden announced a revelation directing her to establish a religious colony dedicated to "the truth".&lt;ref name=zephyr/&gt; She returned to New Jersey with no idea of a location for the project, but was convinced it must be in a wilderness area far from city life. Ogden explained that she had received ‘a description and a mental picture of the place and knew it was on virgin soil, far removed from city life,’ as well as in the ‘intermountain country.’ &lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Through friends she learned of available land in [[San Juan County, Utah]], and after visiting the area she made up her mind. She claimed that the location of their commune matched her vision.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; A group of 21 disciples,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; mostly from the Boise area, followed her to Dry Valley in southeastern Utah in September 1933.&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt; Intending to start a [[collective farm]], the group first tried to buy some [[irrigation|irrigated]] ranch land on Indian Creek, but they could not pay the asking price. Ogden offered the owner membership in the colony and a guarantee of eternal life, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=zephyr/&gt; They settled on a tract of barren desert near [[Church Rock (Utah)|Church Rock]]&amp;mdash;the site, according to Ogden, of Christ's [[Second Coming]]&amp;mdash;and began to build the ''Home of Truth''.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The Home of Truth was constructed in three sections spread a few miles apart from east to west. The Outer Portal was made up of several buildings, including a communal house and dormitory. The Middle Portal, largest of the three,&lt;ref name=record/&gt; was planned to include a [[chapel]] made of [[cobblestone]]s,&lt;ref name=dreams/&gt; although the foundation was never even finished.&lt;ref name=stegner/&gt; The Inner Portal contained barracks and six houses.&lt;ref name=dreams/&gt; Marie Ogden taught that the Inner Portal, where she lived with her daughter Roberta,&lt;ref name=record/&gt; was located on the exact center of the Earth's axis, and that only those who lived here would be spared the coming calamities of the [[end time|last days]].&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt; There were at least 23 buildings scattered throughout Home of Truth, most with simple exteriors of unpainted board and [[batten]] or [[tar paper]] shingles.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

===Colony life===
Residents agreed to a strict code of conduct. They surrendered all personal possessions to the group, which provided food, clothing, and shelter.&lt;ref name=dreams/&gt; The rules also forbade consumption of alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref name=zephyr/&gt; Although the colony raised chickens in the beginning, eating any meat except fish was later prohibited. Ogden even said they must stop planting gardens, but they were still permitted to hire out as laborers to local farmers.&lt;ref name=stegner/&gt; Ogden received instructions for the settlement through her typewriter as well as in revelatory trips to the top of nearby [[Shay Mountain]].&lt;ref name=dreams/&gt; She taught from the [[Aquarian Gospel]] and other [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] works.&lt;ref name=stegner/&gt; Her doctrines included [[reincarnation]], communication with the dead, and [[asceticism]]. It is said that she claimed to be the reincarnated [[Virgin Mary]], identifying other group members as reincarnations of [[Brigham Young]] and the prophet [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]]. However, this was only reported by newspapers and never verified by credible sources from within the commune.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Ogden also handled the colony's financial matters.&lt;ref name=zephyr/&gt; In 1934, she purchased the local newspaper, the ''San Juan Record'', made herself editor,&lt;ref name=record/&gt; and added a [[column (newspaper)|column]] in which she promoted her [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas.&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt; In her first column of “Metaphysical Truths”, printed May 24, 1934, she describes metaphysics as "that division of philosophy which relates to the science of being and to the hidden, or unseen things, which pertain to our spiritual rather than our material, or physical being which we KNOW because we are more conscious of the physical senses we have allowed to predominate. It also embraces that which tells you how the Universe came to being, what composes the Universe, and how life started to manifest on it. As one writer states: 'It's the science of exploring the Universe outside of the Finite.'" &lt;ref name=metaphysical&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ogden|first1=Marie M.|title=Metaphysical Truths|url=http://udn.lib.utah.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/sjr/id/21573/rec/16|accessdate=14 October 2014|work=San Juan Record|date=24 May 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a column called the “Dry Valley News” gave a summary of the goings-on at Home of Truth. She used the press to print pamphlets about her beliefs to distribute out as well.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt;

All group members were expected to work in common for the settlement. The women did domestic chores, while the men worked the farm&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; and did some [[prospecting]] for [[gold]], on a small scale and without much success.&lt;ref name=stegner/&gt; Water was scarce, but they installed a [[windmill]]-driven water pump and concrete [[cistern]]s for irrigating their fields. Members constructed the buildings themselves. There was no electricity or indoor plumbing, consistent with their belief in material simplicity.&lt;ref name=zephyr/&gt; They also made their own furniture and household goods by hand,&lt;ref name=west/&gt; supplemented by Ogden's occasional shopping trips to Monticello.&lt;ref name=record/&gt; Despite this spartan existence, the colony continually added new members, the population growing to around 100 at its height in 1934&amp;ndash;5.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

===Raising the dead===
In the beginning, the sect's mostly [[Mormon]] neighbors took little notice of the newcomers, generally tolerant of their unorthodox beliefs. Then on February 11, 1935 a member of the group named Edith Peshak died of cancer. She and her husband had joined in search of a promised spiritual cure for her disease.&lt;ref name=stegner/&gt; Marie Ogden claimed that Peshak was in a state of purification and could soon be brought back to life. On April 4, 1935, her newspaper column included a section entitled "The Rebirth of a Soul", which detailed Ogden's conversations with the dead woman and her beliefs about raising her from the dead. Ogden still had the corpse, which was being washed three times a day in a salt solution&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt; and "fed" milk and eggs by [[injection (medicine)|injection]].&lt;ref name=record/&gt; Rumors spread through the Monticello area, and at last the county [[sheriff]] came to Home of Truth in June 1935 to investigate the stories.&lt;ref name=stegner/&gt; The authorities found Peshak's body well preserved. They decided to allow the colony to keep it, as they determined it was no health threat, and since a number of people in the area had old Indian [[mummy|mummies]] found in dry caves.&lt;ref name=zephyr/&gt;

===Decline and closure===
Over the next two years, as the press continued to publish sensationalized accounts of the events depicting the Home of Truth as a dangerous [[cult]],&lt;ref name=record/&gt; more than half of the colonists left, disillusioned. In February 1937, Marie Ogden made another announcement that Edith Peshak was about to be restored to life. The investigators returned, insisting that a [[death certificate]] must be signed. Ogden continued to claim the woman was not actually dead.&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt; After being arrested,&lt;ref name=dreams/&gt; Ogden consented to sign the certificate on May 4, 1937, but the authorities still could not find the body.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; Finally, a former member came forward and confessed to having helped her [[cremation|cremate]] the corpse shortly after the original investigation,&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt; in August 1935.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; All but seven of Ogden's remaining followers abandoned Home of Truth.&lt;ref name=stegner/&gt;

Left nearly alone, Marie Ogden continued to support herself by publishing the newspaper and by teaching [[piano lesson]]s to the children of Monticello.&lt;ref name=record/&gt; In 1949, Ogden sold The San Juan Record.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; She eventually moved into the San Juan Nursing Home in [[Blanding, Utah|Blanding]], where she died in 1975.&lt;ref name=names/&gt; The Home of Truth property was privately sold in the 1970s to prevent the government from seizing it to pay for Ogden's care. Her personal papers and [[guest register]] were destroyed just before the sale.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; A few of her followers continued to live at Home of Truth&lt;ref name=blazer/&gt; until September 30, 1977, when the new owners sold the remaining contents of the Inner Portal at [[auction]].&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; All three Portals still held locked, dusty buildings, maintained by a caretaker and surrounded by "No Trespassing" signs.&lt;ref name=dreams/&gt;

As of 2008 there is nothing left of the Outer Portal, but buildings still stand at the other two. The property owner has worked to preserve the Inner Portal,&lt;ref name=record/&gt; and has announced plans to allow public tours once the site is restored.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; Both remaining Portals are fenced off from the road, and a sign reading "Marie's Place" hangs over the gate to the Inner Portal, on a ridge just north of State Route 211. A small cemetery holds five graves.&lt;ref name=cem/&gt;

'''Housing segregation''' is the practice of denying [[African American]] or other minority groups equal access to housing through the process of misinformation, denial of realty and financing services, and [[racial steering]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Housing policy in the United States has influenced housing segregation trends throughout history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Key legislation include the National Housing Act of 1934, the GI Bill, and the Fair Housing Act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="segregation" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Factors such as socioeconomic status, spatial assimilation, and immigration contribute to perpetuating housing segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The effects of housing segregation include relocation, unequal living standards, and poverty.&lt;ref name="segregation" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; However, there have been initiatives to combat housing segregation, such as the [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] housing program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==History of housing discrimination==

=== Legislation. ===

====The National Housing Act of 1934====

In 1934 the practice of [[redlining]] neighborhoods came into existence through the [[National Housing Act of 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;see: [[redlining]]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice, also known as [[mortgage discrimination]], began when the federal government and the newly formed Federal Housing Administration allowed the Home Owners' Loan Corporation to create "residential security maps", outlining the level of security for real-estate investments in 239 cities around the United States. On these maps, high-risk areas were outlined in red. Many minority neighborhoods were redlined in these maps, meaning that banks would deny all mortgage capital to people living within them. This contributed to the decay of many of these neighborhoods because the lack of loans for buying or making repairs on the homes made it difficult for these neighborhoods to attract and keep families. Many urban historians point to redlining as one of the main factors for urban disinvestment and the decline of central cities in the middle decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="redlining"&gt;''Redlining in Philadelphia'' Hiller, Amy. http://cml.upenn.edu/redlining/&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Housing Act of 1937====
This piece of legislation occurred during the New Deal era and provided the basis for future public housing programs. This act allowed for the creation of around 160,000 units of public housing. Most of these units were made to alleviate the housing difficulties of the poor and working class suffering from the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Urban Housing Segregation of Minorities in Western Europe and the United States|last = Huttman|first = Elizabeth D.|publisher = Duke University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Durham and London|pages = |last2 = Blauw|first2 = Wim|last3 = Saltman|first3 = Juliet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this public housing program allowed for the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) to provide various monetary funds to local housing authorities to aid with the building and development of these units. Despite providing low budget housing options, this act created greater racial segregation in housing because the majority of the poor population at the time consisted of minorities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Race, ethnicity, and minority housing in the United States|last = Momeni|first = Jamshid A.|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1986|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The GI Bill (1944)====

At the end of [[World War II]], the [[G.I. Bill|GI Bill]] furthered segregation practices by keeping [[African Americans]] out of [[European American]] neighborhoods, showing another side to African American housing discrimination. When millions of GIs returned home from overseas, they took advantage of the "Servicemen's Readjustment Act," or the GI Bill.&lt;ref&gt;see: [[GI Bill]]&lt;/ref&gt; This important document was signed in 1944 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, and gave veterans education and training opportunities, guaranteed loans for home, farm, or business, job finding assistance, and unemployment pay of $20 a week for up to 52 weeks if a veteran could not find a job.&lt;ref&gt;The GI Bill http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/life_20.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This law allowed millions of U.S. soldiers to purchase their first homes with inexpensive mortgages, which meant the huge growth of suburbs and the birth of the ideal of a suburban lifestyle.

African Americans were met with discrimination when trying to purchase a home in the overwhelmingly European American neighborhoods. The realtors would not show these houses to African Americans, and when they did, they would try and talk them out of buying the home. This discrimination was based on the fact that realtors believed they would be losing future business by dealing or listing with African Americans, and that it would be unethical to sell a house in a European American neighborhood to African Americans because it would drive the property values of the surrounding houses down.&lt;ref name="Albina"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gibson | first1 = Karen J | year = 2007 | title = Bleeding Albina: A History of Community Disinvestment, 1940-2000 | url = | journal = Transforming Anthropology | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 3–25 | doi=10.1525/tran.2007.15.1.03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both redlining and discrimination through the GI Bill relegated most African Americans to a concentrated area within the city, so the declining property values and the higher crime rates could be kept in a contained area. The relegation of African Americans to the neighborhoods that were receiving no support due to redlining practices was a self-fulfilling prophecy that created the high crime slums that the city was afraid of.&lt;ref name= segregation&gt;''The Continuing Causes of Segregation'' Massey, Douglas, and Nancy Denton. ''American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Fair Housing Act (1968)====

The overt discriminatory practices of refusal of sale and loans continued unabated until at least 1968, when the [[Fair Housing Act (United States)|Fair Housing Act]] was passed. After this act was passed, outright refusal to sell property to African Americans became rare, given that that behavior could lead to prosecution under the Fair Housing Law.&lt;ref name="segregation"/&gt; The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] is charged with administering and enforcing fair housing laws.  Any person who believes that they have faced housing discrimination based on their race can file a fair housing complaint.

The most comprehensive federal fair housing act of its time, this piece of legislation mandated fair housing as a national policy and restricted discriminatory practices. Specifically, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was prohibited in the rental, sale, financing, and brokerage of housing or housing services. However, this act did not give the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) a lot of enforcing power. HUD was only allowed to mediate housing discrimination disputes between parties. It did not have the power to file lawsuits or take definitive legal action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Housing Segregation in Suburban America since 1960|last = Lamb|first = Charles M.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NixonAndRomneyInOffice.jpg|thumb|President Nixon and HUD secretary George Romney talk]]

====Nixon's Fair Housing Policy (1971)====

During his presidential term, Nixon's federal housing policy undermined the Fair Housing Act. His policy acknowledged that federal law requires nondiscriminatory practices in federal housing matters but did not provide presidential support. Nixon declared that government could not force suburban desegregation or economic/racial integration. In doing so, he secured many suburban votes but further exacerbated the issue of housing inequality by not supporting subsidized housing programs to help desegregation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====The Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974====

The [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] provided protection against discrimination from creditors. It stated that creditors could not discriminate against applicants based on race, sex, marital status, religion, ethnicity or age. Designed to supplement the Fair Housing Act in specific forms of housing discrimination, this piece of legislation offered more protection against discrimination in lending practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975====

Like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, this piece of legislation was also designed to supplement the Fair Housing Act in specific areas of housing discrimination. This act protected applicants from discrimination through lending institutions by requiring that any financial institution providing federally related mortgage loan disclose data annually. This included reports of the amount and location of loans related to federal housing (by census tract or ZIP code). The purpose of this was to prevent lending discrimination in certain localities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977====

The [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977 required banks to apply the same anti-discriminatory guidelines to their lending criteria in all circumstances. These acts did not completely stop discriminatory practices, however. The discrimination moved into more subtle techniques, including racial steering and misinformation given to African American prospective buyers. Although these laws exist in theory, they have not accomplished their goal of eradicating discrimination based on race in the housing market. Audits of the housing market in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and many other major metropolitan areas have shown discrimination toward African Americans continuing into the 80s, long after the anti-discrimination laws were passed.&lt;ref name="segregation" /&gt;

=== Trends by minority group ===
Residential segregation is typically measured by evenness and exposure. Evenness is defined as the relative dispersion of a certain racial group in a metropolitan area whereas exposure is defined as how much a member of a certain racial group is exposed to a member of another racial group.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Where We Live Now: Immigration and Race in the United States|last = Iceland|first = John|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Geography of Opportunity|last = Briggs|first = Xavier de Souza|publisher = Brookings Institution Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Washington, D.C.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the number of integrated neighborhoods have continued to increase since the passing of the Fair Housing Act in 1968. In addition, the number of exclusively white neighborhoods have been decreasing.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Although there has been an increase of a minority population presence in suburbs, residential segregation continues to persist. On average, it is more likely for minority groups to be exposed to mixed neighborhoods than white populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Residential segregation is not limited to the private housing market. Discriminatory practices also take place within the federal public housing system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====African American====

Overall, in the period from 1980–2000, residential segregation between the black and white population has decreased at a greater rate than other minority groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the African American population, currently the second largest minority group in the United States, still experiences the greatest residential segregation compared to other minority groups.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The older industrial cities of the Midwest and Northeast, experience the highest levels of black-white residential segregation, while the newer metropolitan areas of the South are experiences lesser levels of black-white residential segregation. The presence of a black population in the suburbs continues to increase with 40% of African Americans currently living in the suburbs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Latino====

Due to [[Immigration to the United States]] over the past decades, the Latino population has grown exponentially, making Latinos the largest minority group in the United States. After African Americans, Latinos experience the second highest level of residential segregation. From 1980–2000, the level of neighborhood dissimilarity and isolation increased between the Latino population and the white population. Although around 50% of Latinos live in the suburban area, it is projected that with increasing immigration, the divide between Latino and white populations will continue to persist in residential areas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Asian====

Asians in the United States are a diverse group with a complex historical background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Michael J.|title=The segregation of Asian-origin groups in the United States and Canada|journal=Social Science Research|date=2003|volume=32|issue=1|pages=148–167|doi=10.1016/S0049-089X(02)00023-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Americans first came to the United States in the mid-1800s during the [[California Gold Rush]], and Japanese Americans emigrated to the United States in the late 1800s as indentured servants. These populations faced systemic discrimination forcing them to live close together, particularly segregating in national origin-specific groups in major cities. Asian immigration to the US then increased in the 1960s after reform and passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]]. Due to [[immigration to the United States]] over the past decades, the Asian population has grown considerably, making Asians the third largest minority group in the United States.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Similar to the Latino and Black minority groups, the Asian minority group experiences high levels of isolation and dissimilarity to their white counterparts. From 1980–2000, these levels have only increased. Currently 55% of Asians live in the suburban area, but their levels of isolation from their White counterparts have increased over time despite residential mobility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several factors can contribute to residential isolation including recent immigration status, level of English language proficiency, and level of acculturation to American society. Socioeconomic status can also contribute to residential segregation, and Chinatowns in the United States continue to represent a large concentration of Asian poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asian American Federation Census Information Center|title=Neighborhood Profile: Manhattan's Chinatown|url=http://www.aafny.org/cic/briefs/chinatownbrief.pdf|website=Asian American Federation|publisher=Asian American Federation of New York|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senior====

The [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] and the [[Housing for Older Persons Act]] of 1995 allow residential communities to [[Age-restricted community|restrict residency to the senior]]. These communities are set up to accommodate older individuals who dislike having young residents as neighbors.

== Causes==

=== Neighborhood disinvestment ===
The relegation of African Americans to certain contained neighborhoods continues today. The cycle of neighborhood disinvestment followed by gentrification and dislocation of the minority has made it difficult for African Americans to establish themselves, build equity, and try to break out into suburban neighborhoods. If they have the means to relocate, the neighborhoods they relocate to are most likely populated by European American people who support open housing laws in theory, but become uncomfortable and relocate if they are faced with a rising Black population in their own neighborhood. This [[white flight]] creates an overwhelmingly African American neighborhood, and then disinvestment begins anew. All of these subtle discriminatory practices leave the metropolitan African American population with few options, forcing them to remain in disinvested neighborhoods with rising crime, gang activity, and dilapidated housing.&lt;ref name="segregation"/&gt;

Neighborhood disinvestment is a systematic withdrawal of capital and neglect of public services by the city. Public services may include schools; building, street, and park maintenance; garbage collection and transportation. Absentee landlordism and mortgage redlining also characterize disinvestment. As redlining prevents households from owning, they have no choice but to rent from landlords that neglect property and charge high rent.&lt;ref name="Albina"/&gt; These factors allow the devalorization cycle to occur in a neighborhood, eventually leading to the reclamation and transformation of the neighborhood, uprooting the poor residents who have no equity to use for relocation.&lt;ref name="Albina"/&gt;

A deeper look into disinvestment in the community can be termed devalorization. This is when neighborhood decline is analyzed by emphasizing the profit taking of realtors, bankers, and speculators which systematically reduces the worth or value of housing.&lt;ref name="Albina" /&gt; The devalorization of a neighborhood begins to occur when the city decides to begin disinvesting in it, and the disproportionate influx of minorities shift the neighborhood from mostly live-in owners to absentee landlords. These landlords buy up the houses during white flight from the neighborhood and rent them to the minorities moving in for a high price. In Albina, this process was shown through intensive white flight from the neighborhood, and large redevelopment projects that destroyed the heart of the African American community for the remodeling of a veteran's hospital. This project relocated many African Americans into an even smaller area, creating an overcrowded, volatile environment. Most of the community that survived did not own their homes, and the absentee landlords neglected to make repairs on their properties. The relocation of so many African Americans from southern Albina because of the hospital project caused more white flight on the northern side of Albina, creating more opportunities for landlords use the tactic of [[blockbusting]], or using the fear of racial turnover and property value decline to convince homeowners to sell at below-market prices, allowing the landlords to then inflate the cost of the property and extort the new African American home buyers.&lt;ref name="Albina" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Blockbusting]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real-estate discrimination ===
There is an existence of a dual housing market that results in unequal housing opportunities for different populations of people. The basis of the dual housing market model is that similar housing opportunities are available to different racial groups at different prices. There are many explanations for the existence of a dual housing market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Racial Discrimination, Segregation, and the Price of Housing|last = King|first = A. Thomas|date = 1973|journal = Journal of Political Economy|doi = 10.1086/260060|pmid = |first2 = Peter|last2 = Mieszkowski |jstor=1831027 |volume=81 |issue = 3|pages=590–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Racial Structuring of the Housing Market and Segregation in Suburban Areas|last = Stearns|first = Linda Brewster|date = 1986|journal = Social Forces|doi = 10.1093/sf/65.1.28|pmid = |first2 = John R.|last2 = Logan |jstor=2578934 |volume=65 |pages=28–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory explains the dual housing market through [[racial steering]]. This occurs when real estate brokers steer their clients to specific geographic locations of available housing based on race.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although racial discrimination in housing market processes is outlawed by several court decisions and legislation, there is evidence that it still occurs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For example, an HUD Housing Market Practice survey found that African Americans felt discriminated against in the renting and/or buying process of housing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Institutional factors, such as realtor agencies withholding housing information or financial institutions denying mortgages, further perpetuate the effects of the dual housing market model.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Another explanation of the existence of a dual housing market is the availability of housing units, either for sale or for rent, for minority groups. Oftentimes, price discriminations results from price fluctuations of property based on the existing demographic of residence in a neighborhood. Racial preference affects the available geographic spaces open to certain minority groups.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, African Americans are disproportionately found in a small distribution of suburban communities.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Socioeconomic status ===
One theory of the cause of residential segregation is the difference in income between minority groups and their white counterparts. The basis of this theory stems from purchasing power: the higher the income, the more likely minority groups are to move to better neighborhoods which in turn results in more integrated neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In other words, there seems to be an inverse relationship between a minority group's socioeconomic status and the minority group's level of residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Race, ethnicity, and minority housing in the United States|last = Momeni|first = Jamshid A.|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1986|isbn = |location = |pages = 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many argue that residential segregation occurs because minority groups, particularly immigrants, do not have the wealth or income to purchase homes in more affluent and predominantly white neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although there is a definite relationship between socioeconomic status and residential segregation, the effect of this relationship is different among minority groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In terms of location, poverty-stricken communities tend to reside in the inner cities while affluent communities tend to reside in the suburbs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, better neighborhoods contain better educational services and easier access to various occupations. This spatial and economic segregation further perpetuates residential segregation.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Across all minority groups, there is a residential gap based on income. Residential segregation between the rich and the poor, occurring at different rates, takes place across the board.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

African Americans and Latinos, compared to their white counterpart, experience a greater difference in income, education, and occupation levels. On the other hand, Asians experience a lesser difference in terms of income, education, and occupation levels when compared to their white counterpart.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These factors, education and occupation, influence income and purchasing power of an individual. For African Americans, Asians, and Latinos, higher income resulted in less segregation from their white counterpart whereas lower income resulted in greater segregation from their white counterpart. However, that an increase in socioeconomic status resulted in a greater decrease in segregation for Latinos and Asians and a lesser decrease in segregation for African Americans suggests that socioeconomic status alone cannot explain residential segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Spatial assimilation and immigration  ===
Recent reforms and policies on [[Immigration to the United States]] have caused an influx of immigrants from Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The spatial assimilation theory states that immigrants are more likely to experience residential segregation because of a variety of factors such as social networks, family, income, and cultural preference. Upon moving to a new country, immigrants are more likely to relocate to an area where they have feel comfortable and accepted. In addition, their income may only allow them to occupy spaces that are more ethnically diverse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The three generation model is a theory that attempts to explain assimilation across generations. It states that over time, as the children of immigrants become more acculturated, they begin to disperse geographically and assimilate themselves in suburban neighborhoods. Therefore, there is a correlation between residential segregation and the intergenerational process of assimilation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethnicity and Housing|last = Boal|first = Frederick W.|publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acculturation of immigrant children also relates to the socioeconomic status of the parent or parents. As the children become more acculturated to the customs of the host country, they become more comfortable with the cultural norms and improve their speaking abilities. A higher socioeconomic status allows them to disperse from the ethnically concentrated community and move into neighborhoods with better services and quality housing. This process across generations eventually results in the continued desegregation of more affluent, predominantly white, suburban neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Among all minority groups, foreign-born immigrants experience greater segregation from whites than native-born groups. However, assimilation varies among minority groups. Overall, Latino-white segregation is higher than Asian-white segregation. Black-white segregation is the highest when comparing all minority groups. New immigrants tend to experience higher levels of segregation than immigrants that have lived in the host country for a while.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Relocation ===
Once their old neighborhood has been gentrified, many of the residents are forced to relocate, if they have not already done so. When hunting for a new residence, African Americans will more than likely encounter discrimination on some level.  Audits performed by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and a later Housing Development Study suggest that if realtors have a chance to discriminate, they usually do.&lt;ref name="segregation"/&gt; These studies analyzed the amount of cases where whites were given more information about available units or financing options or shown extra units in proportion to African Americans.  The results showed that whites were systematically favored for both rental and sales units throughout metropolitan areas in the United States. Racial steering was also taken into account during these audits, and it was shown through the results that African Americans were shown homes in areas that had more minorities, lower home values, or lower median incomes that the homes that were shown to European Americans, even if their economic position was the same. It was shown that about one in every three encounters, African Americans were systematically steered to these non-European American neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="segregation"/&gt;

This segregation is not self-imposed. That is, African Americans do not prefer to live in neighborhoods that are overwhelmingly Black.&lt;ref name="segregation"/&gt;  Survey evidence from a Detroit Area Survey from 1976 shows that African Americans strongly favor the desegregation of the United States, with the overall ideal neighborhood being 50% black and 50% white. Whites, on the other hand, favor neighborhood composition that is dominated by whites. In the same survey, about one-quarter of the whites surveyed said they would feel uncomfortable if their neighborhood exceeded 8% Black. Once the neighborhood reached 21% Black, almost half of the whites surveyed said they would feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="segregation"/&gt;

=== Unequal living standards ===

===Behavioral effects===

One of the important social effects on the individual that results from residential segregation is the influence on behavior. Segregated communities tend to slow the rate of assimilation, especially in the ability to speak English, which is considered a primary aspect of assimilating in the United States.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ability to speak English has been shown to result in the increased rate of desegregation in communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another behavioral influence of residential segregation is the effect on social networks created. Friendships and marriages tend to occur at a higher probability among people living in close proximities. In other words, people who are spatially separate are less likely to form lasting relationships.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A negative behavioral influence of residential segregation is the perpetuation of violence. Specifically with gang activity, the higher the level of segregation, the greater the density of altercations between rival gangs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Health===

Many studies have shown that racial or ethnic minority neighborhoods are disproportionally affected by health issues related to the environment, such as a lack of healthy food options, a lack of available pharmacies, and an increased number of advertisements for alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Disparities and Access to Healthy Food in the United States: A Review of Food Deserts Literature|last = Walker|first = Renee|date = 2010|journal = Health and Place|doi = 10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.04.013|pmid = 20462784|access-date = |last2 = Keane|first2 = Christopher|last3 = Burke|first3 = Jessica |volume=16 |issue = 5|pages=876–884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = In Poor Health: Supermarket Redlining and Urban Nutrition|last = Eisenhaur|first = Elizabeth|date = December 10, 2001|journal = GeoJournal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there has been a trend over the past few years of a concentration of ethnic minorities in low-income urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One of the factors associated with this rise in urban, low-income neighborhoods is residential segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of these urban, low-income neighborhoods experience unequal accessibility to services compared to their sub-urban counterparts, which often results in an unhealthy food environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

One of the main reasons for the increasing presence of unhealthy food environments in these neighborhoods is the emergence of [[food desert]]s. Several theories regarding the rise of food deserts in low-income neighborhoods are circulating in the literature. One of the prevailing theories states that food deserts resulted from the development of larger supermarkets in affluent areas and the closure of small, independent groceries stores that could not compete economically. Another theory states that supermarket development shifted spatially with the rise of income segregation. As more the more affluent middle-class moved to the suburbs, many inner city grocery stores closed from lack of business.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another prevailing theory is the idea of supermarket redlining, the unwillingness of supermarkets to open stores in the inner city due to various economic reasons.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

This overall development of unhealthy food environments in low-income urban neighborhoods affects the development of health in the community members.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The lack of healthy food options forces these residents to purchase and consume energy dense food options such as meals from fast-food restaurants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These residents are also forced to purchase highly processed foods because of the lack of fresh food options. In addition, food at independently owned grocery stores are often 10-60% more expensive than food offered at large chain supermarkets.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Education===
Housing segregation has an effect on the quality of education received by community members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are Ghettos Good or Bad?|last = Cutler|first = David|date = 1997|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|doi = 10.1162/003355397555361|pmid = |first2 = Edward|last2 = Glaeser |jstor=2951257 |volume=112 |issue = 3|pages=827–872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the spatial separation of specific populations due to housing segregation leads to geographic concentrations of quality education. For example, public schools in suburban areas are usually more equipped with resources, have a higher percentage quality teachers, and produce a larger amount of successful students.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The negative effects of housing segregation on quality of education is demonstrated by the lack of integration and diversity in schools. The Equality of Educational Opportunity study in 1966 found that racial composition of schools impacted student success more than the resources available to schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED012275.pdf|title = Equality of Educational Opportunity|last = Coleman|first = James|date = 1966|journal = U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle of unequal educational opportunities is perpetuated by the real estate market. Areas with quality school systems usually contain higher housing prices and higher property taxes. In addition, these areas are typically racially and economically homogenous.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

One of the primary reasons of unequal educational opportunities is the low accessibility to the suburbs by minority groups due to lack of income. The suburban areas, containing higher quality education, are less accessible to low-income minority groups.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Another reason of unequal education opportunities is the rise in options of schooling for parents. In addition to public schools, parents with enough purchasing power can opt to send their children to private schools, magnet schools and even home school. Other options include charter schools. These various educational options contribute to the relationship between school quality and school enrollment demographics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Quality of education also affects the outcomes of community members. In other words, the kind of education children receive plays a major role in economic opportunities in their future.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Students surrounded by other educated members of the community often experience more success with school.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Furthermore, community environment and housing quality affect the drop-out rate of students.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Poverty ===
Housing segregation affects the development of concentrated areas of poverty, especially among racial minorities groups.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy|last = Massey|first = Douglas|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = New Haven|pages = 173–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Poverty|last = Danzinger|first = Sheldon H.|publisher = Russell Sage Foundation|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haveman|first2 = Robert H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housing segregation interacts with existing poverty rates among minority groups, especially African Americans and Latinos, to perpetuate the cycle of poor people moving into concentrated areas of poverty. These concentrated areas of poverty often experience a lack of public services and infrastructure. Studies have shown that these residential areas often have less employment opportunities, unequal schooling environments, and increased health risks. These factors combine to perpetuate poverty and prevent social and spatial mobility. The lack of employment opportunities come in many different forms such as decreased accessibility to jobs because of transportation or unavailability of jobs due to location. The result of unequal economic opportunities is the increase in income segregation. This further perpetuates poverty because low-income residents experience higher rent burden which forces them to accept low quality housing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This cycle of poverty also extends between generations. This means that children living in low-income neighborhoods are more likely to experience poverty and the same living standards as their parents' generation.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stuck in Place: Urban Neighborhoods and the End of Progress Toward Racial Equality|last = Sharkey|first = Patrick|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to income segregation, the effects of housing segregation on the development of concentrated areas of poverty are also associated with class and racial segregation. Class segregation plays a role in the concentration of poverty areas in that affluent classes of society have a desire to spatially separate themselves from the less fortune, poverty-stricken class. As a result, they move towards more affluent neighborhoods leaving the poor concentrated in a certain area. Racial segregation also plays a role in the concentration of poverty areas. In fact, the degree of housing segregation due to racial differences is greater than the degree of housing segregation due to class differences. The three factors of income, class, and racial segregation can explain the increasing concentration of poverty in certain areas.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; All three of these factors can be associated with the causes and effects of housing segregation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Initiatives against housing segregation ==

The use of green symbolizes open space, land, growth and prosperity. The blue in the Seal alludes to the quality of life and environment in America's cities.]]

===Community building strategies===

The relationship of community members is often affected by their physical surroundings. Diverse neighborhoods containing various racial and ethnic groups experience many barriers to community collectivism, such as culture, economic background, and fundamental values. However, having a strong community building strategy can help break down barriers of segregation. Leaders of community strong pro-diversity organizations stress the need for a sense of community among members. Creating a diverse and stable neighborhood requires focusing on economic development, community safety, and education.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Focusing on economic development means creating a market in the existing neighborhood. This not only creates jobs for community members but also inhibits disinvestment, a common cause of housing segregation, in neighborhoods. Community safety strongly influences the perception of the stability of a neighborhood. Active participation of community members in the safety of their neighborhood increases community efficacy because there is a perception of controlled crime which, in turn, gives people a sense of control over their quality of life. Education is also related to the positive, or negative, perception of a neighborhood. Schools not only foster safe environments for cross-cultural cooperation but also influence community attitudes towards race, ethnicity, and diversity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development===

Traditionally, public housing programs perpetuate housing segregation by forcing minority populations in low-income neighborhoods containing lower quality housing options. However, the Section 8 housing program combats this problem by providing households with housing certificates/vouchers that can be used to rent units anywhere in the private market at a moderate price. In other words, low-income families have the chance to move into affordable and higher quality housing. This option of choice and mobility offers a solution to the social and economic isolation of minority populations. In addition, families using these housing vouchers are more likely than public housing residents to live in racially and economically integrated neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] federal housing assistance program is the nations largest housing assistance program. Recipients of the voucher/certificate contribute 30% of their income to paying the rent and the government subsidizes the difference. The program is not only less costly because it relies on the existing housing market, but also more likely to offer affordable and quality housing to participants. This program contrasts previous housing programs which often clumped federally funded families into low-income urban neighborhoods. This program is extremely effective, with the majority of participants living in areas that are less than 20% poor.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Affordable Housing Reader|last = Tighe|first = J. Rosie|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = 289–291|last2 = Mueller|first2 = Elizabeth J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this effectiveness, there is still a racial disparity among participant success. Overall, participants across all races are more likely to live in low-poverty, racially heterogenous neighborhoods compared to their counterparts in public housing. However, African American and Latino recipients are much more likely to live in high poverty areas compared to white recipients.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

{{Politics of Iran}}

The state of '''human rights in Iran''' has been criticized both by [[Iran]]ians and international [[human rights]] activists, writers, and NGOs since long before the formation of the current state of [[Iran]]. The United Nations [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] and the [[UN Human Rights Commission|Human Rights Commission]]&lt;ref name=rejects&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net//news/middleeast/2011/10/201110205193213355.html Iran rejects UN report on 'rights abuses'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625021149/http://english.aljazeera.net/ |date=25 June 2008 }} aljazeera.net 20 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; have condemned prior and ongoing abuses in Iran in published critiques and several resolutions. The [[Politics of Iran|government of Iran]] is criticized both for restrictions and punishments that follow the Islamic Republic's constitution and law, and for actions that do not, such as the torture, rape, and killing of political prisoners, and the beatings and killings of dissidents and other civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Ehsan Zarrokh (Ehsan and Gaeini, M. Rahman). "Iranian Legal System and Human Rights Protection" The Islamic Law and Law of the Muslim World e-journal, New York law school 3.2 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the monarchy under the rule of the shahs had a generally abysmal human rights record according to most Western watchdog organizations, the current Islamic Republic does not have a positive reputation either, with its human rights record under the administration of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] considered to have "deteriorated markedly," according to [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="ICHRIescalates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2008/09/irancrackdown/ |title=Rights Crisis Escalates Faces and Cases from Ahmadinejad’s Crackdown, 20 September 2008 |publisher=Iranhumanrights.org |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2009 Iranian election protests|2009 election protests]] there were reports of killing of demonstrators, the torture, rape and killing of detained protesters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSDAH93169320090819 |title=Iran reformer says he wants to present rape evidence |publisher=Reuters.com |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTWorth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/world/middleeast/29iran.html|title=Reports of Prison Abuse and Deaths Anger Iranians|first=Robert F.|last=Worth|date=28 July 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the arrest and publicized mass trials of dozens of prominent opposition figures in which defendants "read confessions that bore every sign of being coerced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/09/21/iran-appoint-special-un-envoy-investigate-rights-crisis |title=Iran: Appoint Special UN Envoy to Investigate Rights Crisis |publisher=Hrw.org |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=detained&gt;{{cite news |author1=Robert F.

Restrictions and punishments in the Islamic Republic of Iran which violate international human rights norms include harsh penalties for crimes, punishment of "[[victimless crimes]]" such as [[fornication]] and homosexuality, execution of offenders under 18 years of age, restrictions on [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|the press]] (including the imprisonment of journalists and [[Hadi Heidari|political cartoonists]]), and restrictions on [[freedom of religion]] and gender equality in the [[Constitution of Iran|Islamic Republic's Constitution]] (especially attacks on members of the [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|Bahá'í]] religion).

== Background ==
The [[Imperial State of Iran]], the government of Iran during the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], lasted from 1925 to 1979. During that time two monarchs{{snd}} [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] and his son [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]]{{snd}} employed [[secret police]], [[torture]], and [[executions]] to stifle political dissent.

The Pahlavi dynasty has sometimes been described as a "royal dictatorship".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Pahlavi+royal+dictatorship&amp;btnG=&amp;surl=1 Google search, Pahlavi royal dictatorship].&lt;/ref&gt; or "one man rule".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jRZ227eqm4sC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Pahlavi+dynasty+%22ours+is+a+one+man+system%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v-mCUdHoIueEygHA8IDYCg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pahlavi%20dynasty%20%22ours%20is%20a%20one%20man%20system%22&amp;f=false Pahlavi Dynasty: An Entry from Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam] By (ed.) Gholamali Haddad Adel, Mohammad Jafar Elmi, Hassan Taromi-Rad, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to one history of the use of torture by the state in Iran, abuse of prisoners varied at times during the Pahlavi reign.&lt;ref&gt;Ervand Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran'', (University of California), 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reza Shah era ===
The reign of Reza Shah was authoritarian and dictatorial at a time when authoritarian governments and dictatorships were common in the region and the world and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] was some years away.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of the Dictators: A Study of the European Dictatorships, 1918–53'', D. G. Williamson.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of the press, workers' rights, and political freedoms were restricted under Reza Shah. Independent newspapers were closed down, political parties{{snd}}even the loyal Revival party were banned. The government banned all trade unions in 1927, and arrested 150 labor organizers between 1927 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ervand Abrahamian, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'', (Princeton University Press), 1982, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical force was used against some kinds of prisoners{{snd}} common criminals, suspected spies, and those accused of plotting regicide. Burglars in particular were subjected to the [[Foot whipping|bastinado]] (beating the soles of the feet), and the [[strappado]] (suspended in the air by means of a rope tied around the victims arms) to "reveal their hidden loot". Suspected spies and assassins were "beaten, deprived of sleep, and subjected to the qapani" (the binding of arms tightly behind the back) which sometimes caused a joint to crack. But for political prisoners{{snd}} who were primarily [[Communists#Marxist Communism|Communists]]{{snd}} there was a "conspicuous absence of torture" under Reza Shah's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' 1999, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The main form of pressure was solitary confinement and the withholding of "books, newspapers, visitors, food packages, and proper medical care". While often threatened with the qapani, political prisoners "were rarely subjected to it."&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' 1999, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mohammad Reza Shah era ===
Mohammad Reza became monarch after his father was deposed by Soviets and Americans in 1941. Political prisoners (mostly Communists) were released by the occupying powers, and the shah (crown prince at the time) no longer had control of the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qh_QotrY7RkC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22Gone+were+the+days+when+the+shah+could+arrange+the+return+of+his+faithful+deputies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rWuFUYezEuKFywH0s4H4Dg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gone%20were%20the%20days%20when%20the%20shah%20could%20arrange%20the%20return%20of%20his%20faithful%20deputies%22&amp;f=false Iran between two revolutions] By Ervand Abrahamian, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; But after an attempted assassination of the Shah in 1949, he was able to declare martial law, imprison communists and other opponents, and restrict criticism of the royal family in the press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qmVUg_qHr2AC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=crack+down+on+religious+militants,+communists,+and+other+opponents&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QlaAUbbQDsK6yQH3voHICg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=crack%20down%20on%20religious%20militants%2C%20communists%2C%20and%20other%20opponents&amp;f=false The History of Iran] By Elton L.

Following the pro-Shah coup d'état that overthrew the Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] in 1953, the Shah again cracked down on his opponents, and political freedom waned. He outlawed Mosaddegh's political group the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]], and arrested most of its leaders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Iran in Revolution: The Opposition Forces'' by E Abrahamian – MERIP Reports&lt;/ref&gt; Over 4000 political activists of the Tudeh party were arrested,&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Ervand 1999, p.89"&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'', (University of California), 1999, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; (including 477 in the armed forces), forty were executed, another 14 died under torture and over 200 were sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, 1999, p.92"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abrahamian |first=Ervand |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mnrYNIVfCgC&amp;pg=PA92 |title=Tortured Confessions |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |page=92|isbn=978-0-520-21866-6| accessdate=18 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, 1999, p.84"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian |first=Ervand |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_mnrYNIVfCgC&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Tortured Confessions |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |page=84 |isbn=978-0-520-21866-6| accessdate=18 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1971–77 ====
In 1971, a guerrilla attack on a [[gendarmerie]] post (where three police were killed and two guerrillas freed, known as the "[[Siahkal incident]]") sparked "an intense guerrilla struggle" against the government, and harsh government countermeasures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-QJgbEeoLfEC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=torture+Siahkal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M52BUf3MNaK1ywHdnIDwAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=torture%20Siahkal&amp;f=false Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions''], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leftist guerrilla groups of Iran|Guerrillas]] embracing "[[Guerrilla warfare|armed struggle]]" to overthrow the Shah, and inspired by international Third World anti-imperialist revolutionaries ([[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Che Guevara]]), were quite active in the first half of the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, Charles, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', Harvard University Press, 2004, p.145–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the two and half years from mid 1973 through 1975, three United States colonels, an Iranian general, sergeant, and a Persian translator of the United States Embassy were all assassinated by guerrilla groups (source: Fischer, Michael M.J., ''Iran, From Religious Dispute to Revolution'', Harvard University Press, 1980 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; when hundreds of them died in clashes with government forces and dozens of Iranians were executed.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, 1999 p.135-6"&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' (1999), pp. 135–36, 167, 169&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], the Shah carried out at least 300 political executions.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'', 23 March 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture was used to locate arms caches, safe houses and accomplices of the guerrillas, in addition to its possible ability to persuade enemies of the state to become supporters, instead.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', 1999 p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the human rights group [[Amnesty International]]{{snd}} whose membership and international influence grew greatly during the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International's membership increased from 15,000 in 1969 to 200,000 by 1979.

==== Islamic Revolution ====
During the [[Iranian Revolution|1978–79 overthrow]] of the Pahlavi government, protestors were fired upon by troops and prisoners were executed. The real and imaginary human rights violations contributed directly to the Shah's demise,&lt;ref&gt;A Persian-speaking British diplomat noted that the gulf between shah and public was now unbridgeable – both because of Black Friday and because of the Abadan fire. (source: D. Harney, ''The Priest and the King: An Eyewitness Account of the Iranian Revolution'', (London: Turis, 1999), p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; (although some have argued so did his scruples in not violating human rights more as urged by his generals&lt;ref&gt;see [[Casualties of the Iranian Revolution#Explanation]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The 1977 deaths of the popular and influential modernist Islamist leader [[Ali Shariati]] and the Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s son Mostafa were believed to be assassinations perpetrated by SAVAK by many Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), pp. 184–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Taheri 1985 182-3"&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'', (1985), pp. 182–83.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 1978, ([[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]]) troops fired on religious demonstrators in Zhaleh (or Jaleh) Square. The clerical leadership announced that "thousands have been massacred by Zionist troops" (i.e. rumored Israel troops aiding the Shah),&lt;ref name="Taheri, 1985 p. 223"&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'', (1985), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] reported 4000 had been killed,&lt;ref name="E.

Gueyras, `Liberalization is the Main Casualty,` ''The Guardian'', 17 September 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-revolution ==
The Islamic revolution is thought to have a significantly worse human rights record than the Pahlavi Dynasty it overthrew. According to political historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]], “whereas less than 100 [[political prisoner]]s had been executed between 1971 and 1979, more than 7900 were executed between 1981 and 1985. ... the prison system was centralized and drastically expanded ... Prison life was drastically worse under the Islamic Republic than under the Pahlavis. One who survived both writes that four months under [warden] [[Asadollah Lajevardi|Ladjevardi]] took the toll of four years under [[SAVAK]].&lt;ref&gt;source: Anonymous "Prison and Imprisonment", ''Mojahed'', 174–256 (20 October 1983{{snd}}8 August 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; In the prison literature of the Pahlavi era, the recurring words had been ‘boredom’ and ‘monotony’. In that of the Islamic Republic, they were ‘fear’, ‘death’, ‘terror’, ‘horror’, and most frequent of all ‘nightmare’ (‘kabos’).”&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, 1999 p.135-6"/&gt;

[[File:Dariush Forouhar.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Dariush Forouhar]], leader of [[Nation Party of Iran|Nation Party]] was one of the victims of [[Chain murders of Iran]].]]
However, the vast majority of killings of political prisoners occurred in the first decade of the Islamic Republic, after which violent repression lessened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64606/akbar-ganji/the-latter-day-sultan "The Latter-Day Sultan, Power and Politics in Iran"] By Akbar Ganji
From ''Foreign Affairs'', November/December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of the Iranian reform movement and the election of moderate Iranian president [[Mohammad Khatami]] in 1997 numerous moves were made to modify the Iranian civil and penal codes in order to improve the human rights situation. The predominantly reformist parliament drafted several bills allowing increased freedom of speech, gender equality, and the banning of torture. These were all dismissed or significantly watered down by the [[Guardian Council]] and leading conservative figures in the Iranian government at the time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

According to ''The Economist'' magazine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Iranian reform movement|Tehran spring]] of ten years ago has now given way to a bleak political winter. The new government continues to close down newspapers, silence dissenting voices and ban or censor books and websites. The peaceful demonstrations and protests of the [[Khatami]] era are no longer tolerated: in January 2007 security forces attacked striking bus drivers in [[Tehran]] and arrested hundreds of them. In March police beat hundreds of men and women who had assembled to commemorate [[International Women's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;"Men of principle", ''The Economist''. London: 21 July 2007.

=== International criticism ===
Since the founding of the Islamic Republic, human rights violations of religious minorities have been the subject of resolutions and decisions by the United Nations and its human rights bodies, the [[Council of Europe]], [[European Parliament]] and [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="affolter"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Friedrich W. |last=Affolter |title=The Specter of Ideological Genocide: The Bahá'ís of Iran |journal=War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=59–89 |year=2005 |url=http://www.aa.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mz5WPhzF?url=http://www.aa.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/articles/V1/v1n1a3.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Minority Rights Group International|The Minority Rights Group]], in 1985 Iran became "the fourth country ever in the history of the United Nations" to be placed on the agenda of the General Assembly because of "the severity and the extent of this human rights record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = R. | last = Cooper | title = The Bahá'ís of Iran: The Minority Rights Group Report 51 | publisher = The Minority Rights Group LTD |location=London, UK |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1984 to 2001, [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR) passed resolutions about human rights violations against Iran's religious minorities especially the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="affolter"/&gt; The UNCHR did not pass such a resolution in 2002, when the government of Iran extended an invitation to the UN "Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression" to visit the country and investigate complaints. However, according to the organization [[Human Rights Watch]], when these officials did visit the country, found human rights conditions wanting and issued reports critical of the Islamic government, not only did the government not implement their recommendations", it retaliated "against witnesses who testified to the experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/iran9803.htm |title=Human Rights Overview 2005 |publisher=Hrw.org |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the resolutions began again with [[Canada]] sponsoring a resolution criticizing Iran's "confirmed instances of torture, stoning as a method of execution and punishment such as flogging and amputations," following the death of an Iranian-born Canadian citizen, [[Zahra Kazemi]], in an Iranian prison.&lt;ref name=cbcnov07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/11/20/iran-canada.html?ref=rss|title=Canadian-sponsored human rights resolution against Iran passes |publisher= CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/un-assembly-chides-iran-on-human-rights/66828/ |title=U.N.

Late November 2018, a group of UN human rights experts including [[Javid Rehman]] U.N.

=== Relative openness ===
One observation made by non-governmental sources of the state of human rights in the Islamic Republic is that it is not so severe that the Iranian public is afraid to criticize its government publicly to strangers. In [[Syria]] "taxi driver[s] rarely talk politics; the Iranian[s] will talk of nothing else."&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory of why human rights abuses in the Islamic Republic are not as severe as Syria, Afghanistan (under [[the Taliban]]), or Iraq (under [[Saddam Hussein]]) comes from the American journalist [[Elaine Sciolino]] who speculated that &lt;blockquote&gt;[[Shiite]] Islam thrives on debate and discussion ... So freedom of thought and expression is essential to the system, at least within the top circles of religious leadership. And if the [[mullah]]s can behave that way among themselves in places like the holy city of [[Qom]], how can the rest of a modern-day society be told it cannot think and explore the world of experience for itself?&lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors : the Elusive Face of Iran'', Free Press, 2000, 2005, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Perspective of the Islamic Republic ====
Iranian officials have not always agreed on the state of human rights in Iran. In April 2004, reformist president [[Mohammad Khatami]] stated "we certainly have political prisoners [in Iran] and ... people who are in prison for their ideas." Two days later, however, he was contradicted by Judiciary chief Ayatollah [[Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi]], saying "we have no political prisoners in Iran" because Iranian law does not mention such offenses, ... "The world may consider certain cases, by their nature, political crimes, but because we do not have a law in this regard, these are considered ordinary offenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2004/16-030504.htm |title=Iran Report, A Weekly Review of Developments in and Pertaining to Iran, 3 May 2004 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=3 May 2004 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's president President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other government officials have compared Iran's human rights record favorably to other countries, particularly countries that have criticized Iran's record.&lt;ref name="Mottaki"&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=164534 Tehran Times. Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki has criticized discrimination against Muslim minorities in Western countries. 6 March 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 speech, he replied to a question about human rights by stating that Iran has fewer prisoners than America and that "the human rights situation in Iran is relatively a good one, when compared ... with some European countries and the United States."&lt;ref name="democracynow.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/9/25/iranian_president_mahmoud_ahmadinejad_on_the|title=Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the Threat of US Attack and International Criticism of Iran’s Human Rights Record|author=|date=|website=democracynow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 speech to the United Nations, he commented on human rights only to say "certain powers" (unnamed) were guilty of violating it, "setting up secret prisons, abducting persons, trials and secret punishments without any regard to due process, .... "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/25/un.iran/index.html#cnnSTCVideo cnn.com, Iran's leader slams 'arrogant' powers in U.N. address, 25 September 2007]. This was seen as "a veiled but unmistakable criticism of the United States" [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] and domestic surveillance under the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]:&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic Republic officials have also attacked Israeli violations of Palestinian human rights.&lt;ref name="Mottaki"/&gt;

=== Explanations for violations ===
Among the explanations for violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic are:

==== Theological differences ====
The legal and governing principles upon which the Islamic Republic of Iran is based differ in some respects from the principles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].
{{Further information|Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam}}
* Sharia law, as interpreted in the Islamic Republic, calls for inequality of rights between genders, religions, sexual orientation, as well as for other internationally criticized practices such as stoning as a method of execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strasbourgconference.org/papers/Refah%20Revisited-%20Strasbourg's%20Construction%20of%20Islam.pdf|title=Refah Revisited: Strasbourg's Construction of Islam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827223352/http://www.strasbourgconference.org/papers/Refah%20Revisited-%20Strasbourg%27s%20Construction%20of%20Islam.pdf |archive-date=27 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |author=Christian Moe |publisher=Norwegian Institute of Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Iran's representative to the United Nations, Sai Rajaie-Khorassani, declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be representing a "secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims and did not "accord with the system of values recognized by the Islamic Republic of Iran" which would "therefore not hesitate to violate its provisions."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly. 39th Session.

* According to scholar Ervand Abrahamian, in the eyes of Iranian officials, "the survival of the Islamic Republic{{snd}} and therefore of Islam itself{{snd}} justified the means used," and trumped any right of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions", 1999, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[fatwa]] issued by [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] in early 1988, he declared Iran's Islamic government "a branch of the absolute governance of the Prophet of God" and "among the primary ordinances of Islam," having "precedence over all secondary ordinances such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage."&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Algar, `Development of the Concept of velayat-i faqih since the Islamic Revolution in Iran,` paper presented at London Conference on ''wilayat al-faqih'', in June 1988 [pp. 135–38]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also ''Ressalat'', Tehran, 7 January 1988,

=== Rights under the constitution===
The [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|Iranian fundamental law]] or constitution calls for equal rights among races, ethnic groups (article 19).&lt;ref name="Leclerc ULaval"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/asie/iran.htm L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014082518/http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/asie/iran.htm |date=14 October 2006 }}, Jacques Leclerc, ''CIRAL (Centre international de recherche en aménagement linguistique)'', [[Université Laval]]&lt;/ref&gt; It calls for gender equality (article 20), and protection of the rights of women (article 21); freedom of expression (article 23); freedom of press and communication (article 24) and freedom of association (article 27). Three recognized religious minorities "are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies."&lt;ref&gt;Iranian constitution Article 13 "Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians are the only recognized religious minorities, who, within the limits of the law, are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies, and to act according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, along with these guarantees the constitution includes what one scholar calls "ominous [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22s]]", such as “All laws and regulations must conform to the principles of Islam.”&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''History of Modern Iran'', Columbia University Press, 2008, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of women, of expression, of communication and association, of the press&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/iran/Iran99o-03.htm |title=The Iranian Legal Framework And International Law |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} are followed by modifiers such as "within the limits of the law", "within the precepts of Islam", "unless they attack the principles of Islam", "unless the Law states otherwise", "as long as it does not interfere with the precepts of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Dr. Axel Tschentscher, LL.M. |url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html |title=Iran – Constitution |publisher=Servat.unibe.ch |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provisions in violation of Human Rights ===
The Iranian penal code is derived from the [[Shari'a]] and is not always in compliance with international norms of human rights.

The Iranian penal code distinguishes two types of punishments: ''[[Hudud]]'' (fixed punishment) and the ''[[Qisas]]'' ([[retributive justice|retribution]]) or ''[[Diyya]]'' ([[Blood money (term)|Blood money]] or [[An eye for an eye|Talion Law]]). Punishments falling within the category of Hududs are applied to people committing offenses against the State, such as [[adultery]], alcohol consumption, burglary or [[petty theft]], [[rebellions]] against [[Islamic authority]], [[apostasy]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual intercourse]] (considered contrary to the spirit of Islam).&lt;ref&gt;`The Complete Text of the Retribution Law` ''Iran Times'', 6 March 1981. see also: 22 May 1981, 15 October 1982. quoted in ''Tortured Confessions'' by Ervand Abrahamian, University of California Press, 1999, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments include death by [[hanging]], [[stoning]]&lt;ref name="AmIntStoning"&gt;{{cite web |author=15 January 2008 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115 |title=Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty. 15 January 2008 |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115 |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[decapitation]], [[amputation]] or [[flagellation]]. Victims of private crimes, such as murder or rape, can exercise a right to retribution (Qisas) or decide to accept "blood money" (Diyyah or Talion Law).&lt;ref name="NATLEX"&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/natlex_browse.details?p_lang=en&amp;p_country=IRN&amp;p_classification=01.04&amp;p_origin=COUNTRY&amp;p_sortby=SORTBY_COUNTRY Iranian Civil Code], NATLEX .

==== Harsh punishments ====
{{See also|Stoning #Iran}}
[[File:Firing Squad in Iran.jpg|thumb|A revolutionary firing squad in 1979]]
Following traditional [[shariah]] punishment for thieves, courts in Iran have sometimes sentenced offenders to amputation of both "the right hand and left foot cut off, making it difficult, if not impossible, for the condemned to walk, even with a cane or crutches." This was the fate, for example, of five convicted robbers in the Sistan-Baluchistan Province in January 2008 according to the news agency ISNA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/world/middleeast/11iran.html Spate of Executions and Amputations in Iran by Nazila Fathi, 11 January 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shariah]] also includes stoning and explicitly states that stones used must be small enough to not kill instantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4166137.stm BBC article "Iran denies execution by stoning"], which includes the statement "Iranian law specifies exactly how stoning should be carried out, saying stones must be small enough not to kill instantly".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6264257-iranian-women-escapes-death-penalty-by-stoning |title=Iranian women escapes death penalty by stoning (which includes the statement "Stoning is part of Sharia Law that mandates that a stone not be too big to kill too soon, or too small to unnecessarily prolong the death) |publisher=Allvoices.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306102715/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6264257-iranian-women-escapes-death-penalty-by-stoning |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book title: Death defying: dismantling the execution machinery in 21st century, Author: Pam McAllister, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2010, the Iranian penal code authorizes stoning as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Global Campaign to Stop Killing and Stoning Women |publisher=Stop-killing.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128142135/http://stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mehr.org/Islamic_Penal_Code_of_Iran.pdf |title=Mission for Establishment of Human Rights in Iran |format=PDF |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Iran says a new draft of the penal code that has removed stoning is currently under review by the Iranian parliament and has yet to be ratified.&lt;ref name="amnesty2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/iran-must-not-execute-woman-spared-stoning-death-any-means-2010-07-09 |title=Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of stoning as a punishment may be declining or banned altogether. In December 2002, [[Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi|Ayatollah Shahroudi]], head of the judicial system, reportedly sent judges a memorandum requesting the suspension of stoning and asking them to choose other forms of sanctions. In 2005, Amnesty International reported that Iran was about to execute a woman by stoning for adultery. Amnesty urged Tehran to give reprieve to the woman. Her sentence is currently on hold pending "consideration by the pardons commission." According to the Iranian officials "Stoning has been dropped from the penal code for a long time, and in the Islamic Republic, we do not see such punishments being carried out", said judiciary spokesman Jamal Karimirad. He added that if stoning sentences were passed by lower courts, they were overruled by higher courts and "no such verdicts have been carried out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4166137.stm |title=BBC: Iran denies execution by stoning |publisher=BBC News |date=11 January 2005 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International, in July 2010, the Iranian parliament began considering a revision to its penal code that would ban stoning as a punishment.&lt;ref name="amnesty2"/&gt;

==== Gender issues ====
{{Main article|Women's rights in Iran}}
The Iranian legislation does not accord the same rights to women as to men in all areas of the law.&lt;ref name="mehr2007"&gt;[http://mehr.org/HumanRightsinIran07.pdf Human Rights in Iran 2007 MEHR.org] pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inheritance law of the Islamic Republic there are several instances where the woman is entitled to half the inheritance of the man.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}{{cite web|title=Iran (République islamique d') Assemblée générale: Rapport du Représentant spécial |trans-title=Report by the special UN envoy |url=http://www.hri.ca/fortherecord2001/bilan2001/vol3/iranga.htm |accessdate=24 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116012016/http://www.hri.ca/fortherecord2001/bilan2001/vol3/iranga.htm |archivedate=16 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

* If a man dies without offspring, his estate is inherited by his parents. If both the parents are alive, the mother receives 1/3 and the father 2/3 of the inheritance, unless the mother has a hojab (relative who reduces her part, such as brothers and sisters of the deceased (article 886)), in which case she shall receive 1/6, and the father 5/6. (Article 906)
* If the dead man's closest heirs are aunts and uncles, the part of the inheritance belonging to the uncle is twice that belonging to the aunt. (Article 920)&lt;ref name="zarrokh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal-articles.deysot.com/civil-rights/analyses-private-relations-in-iranian-civil-code.html |title=Analyses Private Relations in Iranian Civil Code by ehsan zarrokh |publisher=Legal-articles.deysot.com |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927093415/http://legal-articles.deysot.com/civil-rights/analyses-private-relations-in-iranian-civil-code.html |archive-date=27 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When the heirs are children, the inheritance of the sons is twice that of the daughters. (Article 907)&lt;ref name="zarrokh"/&gt;
* If the deceased leaves ancestors and brothers and sisters (''kalaleh''), 2/3s of the estate goes to the heirs which have relationship on the side of the father; and in dividing up this portion the males take twice the portion of the females; however, the 1/3 going to the heirs on the mother’s side is divided equally. (Article 924)&lt;ref name="zarrokh"/&gt;
According to Zahra Eshraghi, granddaughter of Ayatollah Khomeini, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Discrimination here [in Iran] is not just in the constitution. As a woman, if I want to get a passport to leave the country, have surgery, even to breathe almost, I must have permission from my husband."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 19 June 2005, "If I want to breathe I must have permission of my husband", by Colin Freeman quoted in http://mehr.org/HumanRightsinIran07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Freedom of expression and media ====
The 1985 press law prohibits "discourse harmful to the principles of Islam" and "public interest", as referred to in Article 24 of the constitution, which according to [[Human Rights Watch]] provides "officials with ample opportunity to [[Censorship|censor]], restrict, and find offense."&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] released a report about [[Iran]]'s violation of human rights. The Iranian authorities have arrested and detained Shahnaz Karimbeigi whose son, Mostafa, was shot and killed during protests on December 27, 2009, linked to the disputed 2009 presidential election. Accordingly,  Karimbeigi participated in many gatherings with the mothers of other victims of the 2009 crackdown to demand justice for their loved ones; she organized public support for the families of imprisoned activists; and she was one of several advocates using social media campaigns to support Arash Sadeghi, a human rights defender sentenced to a 15-year jail term. On the morning of January 25, she was arrested at her workplace and then denied access to a lawyer. The authorities searched her apartment and seized all her electronic devices, including her laptop as well as threatened Karimbeigi’s daughter and husband over the phone and summoned them for several hours of interrogation at the ministry's" Follow-Up Office".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/16/iran-slain-protesters-mother-arrested|title=Iran: Slain Protester’s Mother Arrested|date=2017-02-16|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Freedom and equality of religion ====
{{Main article|Status of religious freedom in Iran}}
The constitution recognizes the freedom of [[Zoroastrian]], Jewish, and Christian [[Demographics of Iran|Iranians]] to perform their religious rites and ceremonies, and accords non-Shia Muslims "full respect" (article 12).

''[[Hudud]]'' statutes grant different punishments to Muslims and non-Muslims for the same crime. In the case of adultery, for example, a Muslim man who is convicted of committing adultery with a Muslim woman receives 100 lashes; the sentence for a non-Muslim man convicted of adultery with a Muslim woman is death.&lt;ref name="framework"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/iran/Iran-04.htm |title=hrw.org, Iran – The Legal Framework  |publisher=Hrw.org |date=22 May 1992 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, inequality of "blood money" (diyeh) was eliminated, and the amount paid by a perpetrator for the death or wounding a Christian, Jew, or Zoroastrian man, was made the same as that for a Muslim. However, the International Religious Freedom Report reports that Baha'is were not included in the provision and their blood is considered ''Mobah'', (i.e. it can be spilled with impunity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35497.htm |title=Iran.

Freedom to [[Apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam to another religion]] (apostasy) is prohibited, and may be punishable by death. Article 23 of the constitution states, "the investigation of individuals' beliefs is forbidden, and no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief." But another article, 167, gives judges the discretion "to deliver his judgment on the basis of authoritative Islamic sources and authentic fatwa (rulings issued by qualified clerical jurists)." The founder of the Islamic Republic, Islamic cleric Ruhollah Khomeini, who was a grand [[Ayatollah]], ruled "that the penalty for conversion from Islam, or apostasy, is death."&lt;ref name="framework"/&gt;

At least two Iranians{{snd}} [[Hashem Aghajari]] and [[Hasan Yousefi Eshkevari]]{{snd}} have been arrested and charged with apostasy (though not executed), not for converting to another faith but for statements and/or activities deemed by courts of the Islamic Republic to be in violation of Islam, but which appear to outsiders to be simply expressions of political/religious reformism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2415751.stm Iranian academic sentenced to death]| bbc.co.uk| 7 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hashem Aghajari]], was found guilty of apostasy for a speech urging Iranians to "not blindly follow" Islamic clerics;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2002/11/iranacademic.htm |title=hrw.org, 9 November 2002 Iran: Academic’s Death Sentence Condemned |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan Youssefi Eshkevari was charged with apostasy for attending the reformist-oriented [['Iran After the Elections' Conference]] in Berlin Germany which was disrupted by anti-government demonstrators.&lt;ref name="ITFCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2000/11/02/iran610.htm |title=Iran: Trial for Conference Attendees |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2 November 2000 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small Protestant Christian minority in Iran have been subject to Islamic "government suspicion and hostility" according to Human Rights Watch at least in part because of their "readiness to accept and even seek out Muslim converts" as well as their Western origins.

==== Political freedom ====
In a 2008 report, the organization [[Human Rights Watch]] complained that "broadly worded `security laws`" in Iran are used to ”to arbitrarily suppress and punish individuals for peaceful political expression, association, and assembly, in breach of international human rights treaties to which Iran is party." For example, "connections to foreign institutions, persons, or sources of funding" are enough to bring criminal charges such as "undermining national security" against individuals.&lt;ref name="hrw" /&gt;

[[Ahmad Batebi]], a demonstrator in the [[Iran student riots, July 1999|July 1999 Student demonstrations]] in Iran, was given a death sentence for "propaganda against the Islamic Republic System." (His sentence was later reduced to 15, and then ten years imprisonment.) A photograph of Batebi holding a bloody shirt aloft was printed on the cover of ''The Economist'' magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranmania.com/news/currentaffairs/features/dissidentmurders/default.asp The Dissident Murders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223165134/http://www.iranmania.com/news/currentaffairs/features/dissidentmurders/default.asp |date=23 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spam filter notice:The following link has triggered a protection filter: http://www.iranmania.com

== Extralegal violations of human rights ==
[[File:Nobel Peace Laureate Shirin Ebadi at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Barcelona, 2015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Shirin Ebadi]], winner of 2003 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]]]
A 2005 [[Human Rights Watch]] document, criticizes "Parallel Institutions" (''nahad-e movazi'') in the Islamic Republic, "the quasi-official organs of repression that have become increasingly open in crushing student protests, detaining activists, writers, and journalists in secret prisons, and threatening pro-democracy speakers and audiences at public events." Under the control of the Office of the [[Supreme Leader]], these groups set up arbitrary checkpoints around Tehran, uniformed police often refraining from directly confronting these plainclothes agents. "Illegal prisons, which are outside of the oversight of the National Prisons Office, are sites where political prisoners are abused, intimidated, and tortured with impunity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/iran9803.htm Overview of human rights issues in Iran], hrw.org 31 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to dissident [[Akbar Ganji]], what might appear to be "extra-legal" killings in Iran are actually not outside the penal code of the Islamic Republic since the code "authorises a citizen to assassinate another if he is judged to be ‘impious’,"&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Akbar Ganji]], ''Le Monde'', 6 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some widely condemned punishments issued by the Islamic Republic{{snd}} the torture of prisoners and the [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988]] have been reported to follow at least some form of Islamic law and legal procedures, though they have also not been publicly acknowledged by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 209–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Extra-legal acts may work in tandem with official actions, such as in the case of the newsweekly ''Tamadone Hormozgan'' in Bandar Abbas, where authorities arrested seven journalists in 2007 for “insulting Ayatollah [[Khomeini]],” while government organizations and [[Quran]]ic schools organized vigilantes to "ransacked and set fire" to the paper's offices.&lt;ref name="RSF, Iran - Annual Report 2007"&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/country-43.php3?id_mot=92 RSF, Iran – Annual Report 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430062746/http://www.rsf.org/country-43.php3?id_mot=92 |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Torture and mistreatment of prisoners ===
Article 38 of the constitution of the Islamic Republic forbids "all forms of [[torture]] for the purpose of extracting confession or acquiring information" and the "compulsion of individuals to testify, confess, or take an oath." It also states that "any testimony, confession, or oath obtained under duress is devoid of value and credence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_mnrYNIVfCgC&amp;dq=tortured+confessions+ervand+abrahamian&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=npYYcU-_Ae&amp;sig=IouKxlCqAN3OD-r5Quo2AmEb9Kg&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Tortured+confessions,+Ervand+Abrahamian&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPA2,M1 Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manou &amp; Associates Inc. |url=http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-3.html |title=3-The Rights of the People |publisher=Iranonline.com |accessdate=26 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927204024/http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-3.html |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless human rights groups and observers have complained that torture is frequently used on political prisoners in Iran. In a study of torture in Iran published in 1999, Iranian-born political historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]] included Iran along with "[[Stalinism|Stalinist Russia]], [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|Maoist China]], and early modern Europe" of the [[Inquisition]] and [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch hunts]], as societies that "can be considered to be in a league of their own" in the systematic use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' 1999, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture techniques used in the Islamic Republic include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;whipping, sometimes of the back but most often of the feet with the body tied on an iron bed; the qapani; deprivation of sleep; suspension from ceiling and high walls; twisting of forearms until they broke; crushing of hands and fingers between metal presses; insertion of sharp instruments under the fingernails; cigarette burns; submersion under water; standing in one place for hours on end; mock executions; and physical threats against family members. Of these, the most prevalent was the whipping of soles, obviously because it was explicitly sanctioned by the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' 1999, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two "innovations" in torture not borrowed from the Shah's regime were:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the ‘coffin’, and compulsory watching of{{snd}} and even participation in{{snd}} executions. Some were placed in small cubicles, [50cm x 80cm x 140cm (20&amp;nbsp;inches x 31.5&amp;nbsp;inches x 55&amp;nbsp;inches)] blindfolded and in absolute silence, for 17-hour stretches with two 15-minute breaks for eating and going to the toilet. These stints could last months{{snd}} until the prisoner agreed to the interview. Few avoided the interview and also remained sane. Others were forced to join firing squads and remove dead bodies. When they returned to their cells with blood dripping from their hands, Their roommates surmised what had transpired. ....&lt;ref&gt;Democratic Society of Iranians in France, ''Dar Rahruha-ye Khon: Yazdah Gozaresh'' (''In the Labyrinth of Blood: Eleven Eyewitness Accounts'') (Paris, 1984), p. 12 (p. 139)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Abrahamian, torture became commonly used in the Islamic Republic because of its effectiveness in inducing political prisoners to make public confessions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/062/2012/en/ Amnesty International document – ''Iran TV “confessions” breach suspects’ rights'' 10 September 2012] &lt;/ref&gt; Recorded and edited on videotape, the standard statements by prisoners included not only confessions to subversion and treason, but praise of the Islamic Revolution and denunciation or recantation of their former beliefs, former organization, former co-members, i.e. their life. These recantations served as powerful propaganda for both the Iranian public at large{{snd}} who by the 1980s almost all had access to television and could watch prime time programs devoted to the taped confessions{{snd}} and the recanters' former colleagues, for whom the denunciations were demoralizing and confusing.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', 1999, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment they arrived in prison, through their interrogation prisoners were asked if they were willing to give an "interview." (''mosahebah'') "Some remained incarcerated even after serving their sentences simply because they declined the honor of being interviewed."&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' 1999, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars disagree over whether at least some forms of torture have been made legal according to the ''Qanon-e Ta'zir'' (Discretionary Punishment Law) of the Islamic Republic. Abrahamian argues statutes forbidding ‘lying to the authorities’ and ability of clerics to be both interrogators and judges, applying an "indefinite series of 74 lashings until they obtain `honest answers`" without the delay of a trial, make this a legal form of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions,'' 1999, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, Christoph Werner, claims he could find no Ta'zir law mentioning lying to authorities but did find one specifically banning torture in order to obtain confessions.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Christoph Werner of ''Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran'', in ''British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies'' 2000, pp.239–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahamian also argues that a strong incentive to produce a confession by a defendant (and thus to pressure the defendant to confess) is the Islamic Republic's allowing of a defendant’s confession plus judges "reasoning" to constitute sufficient proof of guilt. He also states this is an innovation from the traditional sharia standard for (some) capital crimes of `two honest and righteous male witnesses`.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', 1999, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bills passed the [[Majlis of Iran|Iranian Parliament]] that would have had Iran joining the international convention on banning torture in 2003 when [[Iranian reform movement|reformists]] controlled Parliament, but were rejected by the [[Guardian Council]].&lt;ref name=PayvandGuarCou&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/03/aug/1073.html Iran: Guardian Council turns down Majlis bills on women's rights, torture ban], ''Payvand's Iran News'', 13 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2003-01-10"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4DF1F3EF933A25752C0A9659C8B63 Iran: Ban on Torture Rejected], ''[[New York Times]]'', 10 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] International, reports that the widespread practice of [[rape|raping]] women imprisoned for engaging in political protest has been effective in keeping female college students "less outspoken and less likely to take part" in political demonstrations. The journal quotes an Iranian college student as saying, "most of the girls arrested are raped in jail. Families can't cope with that."&lt;ref&gt;1 August 2008, "Among Scholars, Resistance and Resilience in Iran, Tradition of dissent survives despite government pressure" By Aisha LabiI, ''Chronicle of Higher Education International''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Human Rights charity [[Freedom from Torture]] produced a report outlining cases of torture in Iran, including incommunicado detention, blindfolding, and forcing prisoners to sign confessions.&lt;ref&gt;Freedom From Torture Iran report: http://www.freedomfromtorture.org/feature/iran_report/7204&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable issues concerning human rights ==

=== Extrajudicial killings ===
In the 1990s there were a number of unsolved murders and disappearances of intellectuals and political activists who had been critical of the Islamic Republic system in some way. In 1998 these complaints came to a head with the killing of three dissident writers ([[Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh]], [[Mohammad Mokhtari (protester)|Mohammad Mokhtari]], [[Majid Sharif]]), a political leader ([[Dariush Forouhar]]) and his wife in the span of two months, in what became known as the [[Chain murders of Iran|Chain murders]] or 1998 Serial Murders of Iran.&lt;ref name=NYTJehl&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E2DE173DF937A25751C1A96E958260 "Killing of three rebel writers turns hope into fear in Iran"], Douglas Jehl, ''New York Times'', 14 December 1998 p.

The attempted murder and serious crippling of [[Saeed Hajjarian]], a Ministry of Intelligence operative-turned-journalist and reformer, is believed to be in retaliation for his help in uncovering the chain murders of Iran and his help to the Iranian reform movement in general.

At the international level, a German court ordered the arrest of a standing minister of the Islamic Republic{{snd}} [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Minister of Intelligence]] [[Ali Fallahian]]{{snd}} in 1997 for directing the 1992 murder of three Iranian-Kurdish dissidents and their translator at a Berlin restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;Ebadi, ''Iran Awakening'', 2006, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/11/world/berlin-court-says-top-iran-leaders-ordered-killings.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm BERLIN COURT SAYS TOP IRAN LEADERS ORDERED KILLINGS], ''New York Times'' 11 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Mykonos restaurant assassinations]].

Two minority religious figures killed during this era were Protestant Christians Reverend [[Mehdi Dibaj]], and Bishop [[Haik Hovsepian Mehr]]. On 16 January 1994, Rev. Mehdi, a [[Apostasy in Islam|convert to Christianity]] was released from prison after more than ten years of confinement, "apparently as a result of the international pressure." About six months later he disappeared after leaving a Christian conference in [[Karaj]] and his body was found 5 July 1994 in a forest West of [[Tehran]]. Six months earlier the man responsible for leading a campaign to free him, Bishop [[Haik Hovsepian Mehr]], had met a similar end, disappearing on 19 January 1994. His body was found in the street in Shahr-e Rey, a Tehran suburb.&lt;ref name=hrw97Minorities/&gt;

=== Capital punishment ===
{{Main article|Capital punishment in Iran}}
Iran retains the death penalty for a large number of offenses, among them cursing the Prophet, certain drug offenses, murder, and certain hadd crimes, including adultery, incest, rape, fornication, drinking alcohol, “[[sodomy]]”, same-sex sexual conduct between men without penetration, lesbianism, “being at enmity with God” ([[moharebeh|mohareb]]), and “corruption on earth” (''[[Mofsed-e-filarz]]'').&lt;ref name=hrwchild&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2008/crd0908/2.htm#_Toc208305498 Iran and Saudi Arabia: Laws that Treat Children as Adults] hrw.org&lt;/ref&gt; Drug offenses accounted for 58% of confirmed executions in Iran in 2016, but only 40% in 2017, a decrease that may reflect legislative reforms.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT5057402017ENGLISH.PDF|title=Death Sentences And Executions 2016|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=April 2017|accessdate=2018-07-16|pp=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT5079552018ENGLISH.PDF|title=Death Sentences And Executions 2017|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=April 2018|accessdate=2018-07-16|pp=8–9, 30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a signatory to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which states that "[the] sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm#part3 International Convention on Civil and Political Rights: Article 6], ''Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212043919/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm#part3 |date=12 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran continues to execute minors for various offenses: At least four individuals were executed in Iran in 2017 for offenses committed before the age of eighteen.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2017"/&gt;

the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the UN Secretary General to the General Assembly highlighting the [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners]] of political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In her report, Special Rapporteur Asma Jahangir stated that “families of the victims have the right to a remedy, which includes the right to an effective investigation of the facts and public disclosure of the truth; and the right to reparation. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls on the Government to ensure that a thorough and independent investigation into these events is carried out.” International civil society and NGOs urged the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a fact—finding mission to investigate the months-long 1988 massacre during which Iran’s government executed an estimated 30,000 political prisoners, mostly activists of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI / MEK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/042/97/PDF/G1804297.pdf?OpenElement|title=ODS HOME PAGE|first=ODS|last=Team|date=|website=documents-dds-ny.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is one of seven countries in the world that apply the death penalty for homosexual acts; all of them justify this punishment with Islamic law. The Judiciary does not recognize the concept of [[sexual orientation]], and thus from a legal standpoint there are no homosexuals or bisexuals, only persons committing homosexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/24/us.iran/index.html Ahmadinejad speaks; outrage and controversy follow], [[CNN|CNN.com]], 24 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some years after the [[Iranian Revolution]], [[transgender]] people were classified by the Judiciary as being homosexual and were thus subject to the same laws. However, in the mid-1980s, the Judiciary began changing this policy and classifying transgender individuals as a distinct group, separate from homosexuals, granting them legal rights. [[Gender dysphoria]] is officially recognized in Iran today, and the Judiciary permits [[sexual reassignment surgery]] for those who can afford it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TSsuccesses/Maryam/Maryam.html |title=The story of Maryam Hatoon Molkara (Iran) |publisher=Ai.eecs.umich.edu |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] had issued a ruling permitting gender reassignment, which has since been reconfirmed by [[Ayatollah Khamenei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/4115535.stm Iran's sex-change operations], ''[[BBC]] [[Newsnight]]'', 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, Iran has between 15,000 and 20,000 transsexuals, according to official statistics, although unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 150,000. Iran carries out more gender change operations than any country in the world besides [[Thailand]]. Sex changes have been legal since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution, passed a fatwa authorising them nearly 25 years ago. Whereas homosexuality is considered a sin, transsexuality is categorized as an illness subject to cure. While the government seeks to keep its approval quiet, state support has increased since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005. His government has begun providing grants of [[Pound sterling|£]]2,250 for operations and further funding for hormone therapy. It is also proposing loans of up to £2,750 to allow those undergoing surgery to start their own businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,2177277,00.html Sex change funding undermines no gays claim], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jewish issues ====
{{Main article|Persian Jews|History of the Jews in Iran}}
Jews have lived in Iran for nearly 3,000 years and Iran is host to the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of [[Israel]]. An estimated 25,000 Jews remain in the country, although approximately 75% of Iran's Jewish population has emigrated during and since the Islamic revolution of 1979 and Iran-Iraq war&lt;ref name="VirtLib"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/iranjews.html The Jews of Iran], ''Jewish Virtual Library''&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days after the Islamic revolution in 1979, several Jews were executed on charges of Zionism and relations with Israel.&lt;ref name="forward.com"&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/9834/ Iranian-Jews reject calls to leave Iran], ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews in Iran have constitutional rights equal to other Iranians, although they may not hold government jobs or become army officers. They have freedom to follow their religion, but are not granted the freedom to proselytize. Despite their small numbers, Jews are allotted one representative in parliament.

Iran's official government-controlled media published the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] in 1994 and 1999. Jewish children still attend Jewish schools where Hebrew and religious studies are taught, but Jewish principals have been replaced by Muslim ones, the curricula are government-supervised, and [[Shabbat|the Jewish Sabbath]] is no longer recognized.&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt; According to Jewish journalist [[Roger Cohen]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps I have a bias toward facts over words, but I say the reality of Iranian civility toward Jews tells us more about Iran{{snd}} its sophistication and culture{{snd}} than all the inflammatory rhetoric. That may be because I'm a Jew and have seldom been treated with such consistent warmth as in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Goldberg |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2009/02/roger-cohen-apos-s-very-happy-visit-with-iran-apos-s-jews/9629/ |title=Roger Cohen's Very Happy Visit with Iran's Jews (February 2009) |publisher=The Atlantic |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cohen's depiction of Jewish life in Iran sparked criticism from columnists and activists such as [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/roger_cohens_very_happy_visit.php "Roger Cohen's Very Happy Visit with Iran's Jews]. Jeffrey Goldberg's ''Atlantic Blog''. Published 26 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rafael Medoff]], director of the [[David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies]]. In his ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' [[op-ed]], Medoff criticized Cohen for being "misled by the existence of synagogues" and further argued that Iranian Jews "are captives of the regime, and whatever they say is carefully calibrated not to get themselves into trouble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rafael |last=Medoff |title=Don't turn Iran's Jews into a political football |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2009 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1235410717966&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706010617/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1235410717966&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Jewish Committee]] also criticized Cohen's articles. Dr. Eran Lerman, director of the group's Middle East directory, argued that "Cohen’s need to argue away an unpleasant reality thus gives rise to systematic denial".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=849241&amp;ct=6903267 AJC Responds to Roger Cohen Columns on Iran] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324052126/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=849241&amp;ct=6903267 |date=24 March 2014 }}. By Dr. Eran Lerman. [[American Jewish Committee]]. Published 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen responded on 2 March, defending his observations and further elaborating that "Iran’s Islamic Republic is no [[Third Reich]] redux. Nor is it a totalitarian state." He also stated that "life is more difficult for them [the Jews] than for Muslims, but to suggest they [Jews] inhabit a totalitarian hell is self-serving nonsense."&lt;ref name="NYT302"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times |title=Iran, the Jews and Germany |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=4 May 2009 |last=Cohen|first=Roger|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02cohen.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, many Jews complain to foreign reporters of "discrimination, much of it of a social or bureaucratic nature." The Islamic government appoints the officials who run Jewish schools, most of these being Muslims and requires that those schools must open on Saturdays, the [[Jewish Sabbath]]. (This has apparently been changed as of February 4, 2015.&lt;ref name ="al-monitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/iran-hassan-rouhani-iranian-jews.html|title=Rouhani accommodates Iran's Jewish students – Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Criticism of this policy was the downfall of the last remaining newspaper of the Iranian Jewish community which was closed in 1991 after it criticized government control of Jewish schools. Instead of expelling Jews en masse like in Libya, Iraq, Egypt, and Yemen, the Iranians have adopted a policy of keeping Jews in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors'', Touchstone, (2000), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Non-government Muslim Shia issues ====
Muslim clerical opponents of the Islamic Republic's political system have not been spared imprisonment. According to an analyst quoted by [[Iran Press Service]], "hundreds of clerics have been arrested, some defrocked, other left the ranks of the religion on their own, but most of them, including some popular political or intellectual figures such as Hojjatoleslam [[Abdollah Noori]], a former Interior Minister or Hojjatoleslam [[Yousefi Eshkevari]], an intellectual, or Hojjatoleslam [[Mohsen Kadivar]]", are "middle rank clerics."&lt;ref&gt;
The Grand Ayatullah Shirazi family is a Shia clergy entity mostly affected by Iran's human rights violations. Clergies and followers of this entity have been arrested, tortured,killed and put under house arrest since the revolution. The government of Iran cannot stand this entity because they are one of the most powerful groups with international representation. Although Shirazis do not directly and publicly show opposition to the government, they do not approve the violations carried in Iran under the umbrella of Islam.

=== Ethnic minorities ===
Iran is a signatory to the convention to the elimination of racism. UNHCR found several positive aspects in the conduct of the Islamic republic with regards to ethnic minorities, positively citing its agreement to absorb Afghan refugees and participation from mixed ethnicities. However, the committee while acknowledging that teaching of minority languages and literature in schools is permitted, requested that Iran include more information in its next periodic report concerning the measures it has adopted to enable persons belonging to minorities to have adequate opportunities to learn their mother tongue and to have it used as a medium of instruction.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CERD.C.63.CO.6.En?Opendocument |title=United Nations Human Rights Website –  Treaty Bodies Database –  Document –  Concluding Observations/Comments –  Iran (Islamic Republic of) |publisher=Unhchr.ch |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deaths in custody ===

In the past several years many people have died in custody in the Islamic Republic, raising fears that "prisoners in the country are being denied medical treatment, possibly as an extra punishment." Two prisoners who died, allegedly after having "committed suicide" while in jail in northwestern Iran{{snd}} but whose families reported no signs of behavior consistent with suicidal tendencies{{snd}} are:

* [[Zahra Bani Yaghoub]], (aka Zahra Bani-Ameri), a 27-year-old female physician died in October 2007, while in custody in the town of [[Hamedan]].
* [[Ebrahim Lotfallahi]], also 27, died in a detention center in the town of [[Sanandaj]] in January 2008. "On January 15, officials from the detention center contacted Lotfallahi’s parents and informed them that they had buried their son in a local cemetery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/01/18/iran17819.htm |title=Iran: Investigate Detention Deaths |publisher=Hrw.org |date=18 January 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political prisoners who recently died in prison under "suspicious circumstances" include:

Due to these actions, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on 20 March 2006 that she "also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bahá'í faith, in violation of international standards. … The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating."&lt;ref name="unhchr" /&gt;

In March and in May 2008, "senior members" forming the leadership of the Bahá'í community in Iran were arrested by officers from the Ministry of Intelligence and taken to [[Evin prison]].&lt;ref name="cnn2008-05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==== Muslim Shia issues ====
One opponent of theocracy, [[Ayatollah]] [[Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi]] and many of his followers were arrested in Tehran on 8 October 2006. According to mardaninews website, judicial authorities have reportedly released no information concerning Boroujerdi's prosecution and “associates” of Ayatollah Boroujerdi have told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran “that his heart and kidney conditions are grave but he has had no access to specialist care.”
&lt;blockquote&gt;He only receives painkillers for his diseases inside prison. In addition to his physical health, his psychological well-being has also deteriorated due to ill-treatment and lengthy solitary confinement episodes. He has lost 30 kilograms in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mardaninews.de/Deutsch/?p=178 News/Imprisoned Cleric’s Life in Danger/Ayatollah Boroujerdi in need of urgent medical care] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boroujerdi is not the only clergy facing violations in Iran. Ayatullah Shirazi and his followers are continuously arrested, tortured and even killed due to their disapproval of the Iran's policies. Although this family does not openly critique the government, they are the most powerful and internationally known for their freedom of religion for all minorities.  
Seyed Hussain Shirazi is the last clergy arrested on March 6th, 2018 after he advocated for the rights of minorities in his speech.

=== Ethnic issues ===
According to Amnesty International's 2007 report, "Ethnic and religious minorities" in the Islamic Republic "remained subject to discriminatory laws and practices which continued to be a source of social and political unrest".&lt;ref name=AI&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/east-gulf/iran#report Iran Human Rights | Reports, News Articles &amp; Campaigns | Amnesty International] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012075943/http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/east-gulf/iran#report |date=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender inequality ===
{{Main article|Women's rights in Iran}}

In 2003, Iran elected not to become a member of the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ([[CEDAW]]) since the convention contradicted the Islamic [[Sharia]] law in Clause A of its single article.&lt;ref name=PayvandGuarCou/&gt;

In a report released 20 October 2008, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] called "discriminatory provisions" against women in criminal and civil laws in Iran "in urgent need of reform," and said gender-based violence was "widespread."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre49j8fg-us-iran-rights-un/ U.N. concerned on Iran human rights] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Women in Iran#Women's clothing}}

In Spring 2007, Iranian police launched a crackdown against women accused of not covering up enough, arresting hundreds of women, some for wearing too tight an overcoat or letting too much hair peek out from under their veil. The campaign in the streets of major cities is the toughest such crackdown since the Islamic revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3069312 Iran Cracks Down on Women's Dress], ''[[Associated Press]]'' (''[[ABC News]]''), 23 April 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721025527/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3069312 |date=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than one million Iranians (mostly women) were arrested in a 12-month period (May 2007{{snd}} May 2008) for violating the state dress code, according to a May 2008 [[NBC]] Today Show report by Matt Lauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztDPcAKcUKA&amp;feature=related |title=YouTube, Matt Lauer in Tehran 1 of 4 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Guidance Patrols" (''gasht-e ershâd''){{snd}} often referred to as "religious police" in Western media{{snd}} enforce Islamic moral values and dress codes. Reformist politicians have criticized the unpopular patrols but the patrols ‘interminable’ according to Iranian judicial authorities who have pointed out that in the Islamic Republic the president does not have control over the enforcement of dress codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuminet.blogs.ku.dk/2009/04/19/too-late-for-a-reformist-momentum/ |title=Too late for a reformist momentum? 19 April 2009 by Rasmus Christian Elling |publisher=Cuminet.blogs.ku.dk |date=19 April 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alleged banning of women from universities ====
{{POV|date=June 2016}}
{{Main article|Women's education in Iran|Women in Iran#Education}}

In August 2012, following years in which Iranian women students have outperformed Iranian male students, 36 universities announced that 77 BA and BSc courses would be "single gender" and not co-ed.&lt;ref name="Ynet banned"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4270873,00.html |title=Report: Women banned from Iranian university programs | publisher=Yedioth Ahronot |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this policy, undergraduate women are excluded from a wide variety of studies in leading institutions, including English literature, English translation, hotel management, archaeology, nuclear physics, computer science, electrical engineering, industrial engineering, and business management. Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian Nobel laureate and human rights lawyer exiled in the United Kingdom, wrote to United Nations Secretary General [[Ban ki-Moon]] and High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] over the move, saying that Iran's true agenda was to lower the proportion of female students from 65% to below 50%, which would weaken Iran's feminist movement in its campaign against discriminatory Islamic laws.&lt;ref name="HuffPo ban women"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/iran-universities-women-ban_n_1819281.html | title=Iran Universities Reportedly Ban Women | publisher=The Huffington Post |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |author1=Bennett-Smith, Meredith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Iranian parliamentarians have also criticized the new policy.&lt;ref name="Anger as Iran"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9487761/Anger-as-Iran-bans-women-from-universities.html |title=Anger as Iran bans women from universities |publisher=The Telegraph |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |author1=Tait, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executions of minors in Iran ===
Iran "leads the world in executing juvenile offenders{{snd}} persons under 18 at the time of the crime" according to [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/20/iran16211.htm |title=Iran: Prevent Execution of Juvenile Offender |publisher=Hrw.org |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran states that of the 32 executions of juvenile offenders that have taken place in the world since January 2005, 26 occurred in Iran.&lt;ref name="ICHRIescalates"/&gt; In 2007, Iran executed eight juvenile offenders.&lt;ref name="hrwchild"/&gt;
In July of that year, [[Amnesty International]] issued a comprehensive 46-page report titled ''Iran: The last executioner of children'' noting Iran had executed more children between 1990 and 2005 than any other state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/059/2007 |title=Iran: The last executioner of children |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021004228/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/059/2007 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Article 6.5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) declares: “Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age” and the article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides that: “Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/the_row.aspx The Row{{snd}} Minors on Death Row in Iran], StopChildExecutions.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427034903/http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/the_row.aspx |date=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which monitors states' compliance with the CRC, urged Iran to immediately stay all executions of child offenders and to abolish the use of the death penalty in such cases. In the summer of 2006, the Iranian Parliament reportedly passed a bill establishing special courts for children and adolescents. However, it has not yet been approved by the Council of Guardians, which supervises Iran's legislation to ensure conformity with Islamic principles. During the past four years, the Iranian authorities have reportedly been considering legislation to ban the death penalty for child offenders. Recent comments by a judiciary spokesperson indicates that the proposed law would only prohibit the death penalty for certain crimes, and not all crimes committed by children.

In spite of these efforts, the number of child offenders executed in Iran has risen during the past two years. As of July 2008, [[Stop Child Executions Campaign]] has recorded over 130 minors facing executions in Iran.

In late 2007, Iranian authorities hanged Makwan Mouludzadeh in Kermanshah prison for crimes he is alleged to have committed when he was 13 years of age. According to Human Rights Watch, this was despite the fact that his accusers had recanted their statements and Mouladzadeh had repudiated his confession as being coerced by the police, and despite the fact that the head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Shahrudi, had ordered a unit of the Judiciary to investigate the case and refer it back to the Penal Court of Kermanshah, before any final decision on an execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/12/05/iran17482.htm |title=Iran: Prevent Execution of Juvenile Offender |publisher=Hrw.org |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 case, that gained international attention was the hanging of 16-year-old schoolgirl [[Atefah Sahaaleh]].&lt;ref name=Sahaaleh&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5217424.stm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; Execution of a teenage girl |publisher=BBC News |date=27 July 2006 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Execution of a teenage girl |url=http://web.peykeiran.com/net_iran/irnewsbody.aspx?ID=18928 |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618072501/http://web.peykeiran.com/net_iran/irnewsbody.aspx?ID=18928 |archivedate=18 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

16 February 2018, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein asked Iran to halt all executions of people sentenced to death for crimes committed when they were under eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Zeid urges Iran to stop violating international law by executing juvenile offenders[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22664&amp;LangID=E Zeid urges Iran to stop violating international law by executing juvenile offenders]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44224">'''Innovation leadership''' is a philosophy and technique that combines different leadership styles to influence employees to produce creative ideas, products, and services. The key role in the practice of innovation leadership is the innovation leader.&lt;ref&gt;Gliddon, D. G. (2006).

Forecasting a competency model for innovation leaders using a modified [[delphi technique]]. (Doctoral dissertation)&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. David Gliddon (2006) developed the competency model of innovation leaders and established the concept of innovation leadership at [[Penn State University]].

As an approach to organization development, innovation leadership can support achievement of the mission or the vision of an organization or group. With new technologies and processes, it is necessary for organizations to think innovatively to ensure continued success and stay competitive.&lt;ref name="Dess &amp; Pickens (2000)"&gt;Dess, G.

The Leadership Quarterly, 15, 163-171&lt;/ref&gt;” Without innovation leadership, organizations are likely to struggle.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)"/&gt; This new call for innovation represents the shift from the 20th century, traditional view of organizational practices, which discouraged employee innovative behaviors, to the 21st-century view of valuing innovative thinking as a “potentially powerful influence on organizational performance.”&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange"&gt;Mumford, M.

== Overview ==

To have a clear understanding of what innovation leadership involves, one must first understand the concept of [[innovation]]. Although there is some controversy over how it can be defined, through general consensus in the literature, it can be described as novel ideas of viable products that are put into operation.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery"&gt;Hunter, S.T., Cushenbery, L. (2011). Leading for innovation: Direct and indirect influences. Advances in Developing Human Resource, 13, 248-265&lt;/ref&gt; It includes three different stages, which are all dynamic and iterative (constant):

# Idea Generation
# Evaluation
# Implementation

The two types of innovation include exploratory innovation, which involves generating brand new ideas, and value-added innovation, which involves modifying and improving ideas that already exist.&lt;ref name="Benner, Tushman"&gt;Benner, M. J., &amp; [[Michael L. Tushman|Tushman, M. L.]] (2003). Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited. The Academy of Management Review, 238-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda"&gt;Jansen, J. J. P., Van den Bosch, F. A. J., &amp; [[Volberda, H. W.]] (2006). Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Effects of organizational antecedents and environmental :moderators. Management Science, 52, 1661−1674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March"&gt;March, J. G. (1991). Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. Organization Science, 2, 71−87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch"&gt;Rosing, K., Frese, M., &amp; Bausch, A. (2011). Explaining the heterogeneity of the leadership-innovation relationship: Ambidextrous leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 22, 956-974&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas generated must be useful to be considered innovative. Innovation should also not be confused with [[creativity]], which is merely the generation of a novel idea that may not necessarily be put into operation—though these words are sometimes used interchangeably in research literature when speaking about innovation leadership. Innovation leadership is a complex concept, as there is no single explanation or formula for a leader to follow to increase innovation. As a result, innovation leadership encompasses a variety of different activities, actions, and behaviors that interact to produce an innovative outcome.

=== Value-added Innovation ===

Exploratory and value-added innovation require different leadership styles and behaviors to succeed.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Vera, &amp; Corssan" /&gt; Value-added innovation (PwC, 2010) involves refining and revising an existing product or service and typically requires minimal risk taking (compared to exploratory innovation, which often involves taking a large risk); in this case, it is most appropriate for a leader for innovation to adopt a transactional form of leadership.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oke et al"&gt;Oke, A., Munshi, N., Walumbwa, F. O. (2009). The influence of leadership on innovation processes and activities. Organizational Dynamics, 38, 64-72&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a transactional leadership style does not use open leadership behaviors such as encouraging employees to experiment and take risks, but rather uses closed leadership behaviors that do not condone or reward risk-taking. Companies whose innovation leaders use transactional leadership for value-added innovation purposes include Toyota Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and Ford Motor Co.;&lt;ref name="Oke et al" /&gt; examples of these companies’ value-added innovations such as making improvements on existing cars by making them faster, more comfortable, and getting better gas mileage. 
 
Occasionally a value-added innovation may require a completely new way of thinking and possibly taking new risks. An example of this scenario can be illustrated through Aspirin; this was an existing product, traditionally used as an analgesic to alleviate aches and pains, but has been introduced into a new and different market by extending its uses to help prevent heart attack and reduce blot clot formation. In this example, the usage of an existing product was re-worked and introduced into a new market. While an existing product is being changed and/or improved upon, characterizing it as a value-added innovation, outside-the-box thinking, research, and risk-taking are now required since it is being introduced into a new market. In this case, a transformational leadership style is a more appropriate style to use.
 
The innovation leader must gauge if (and how much) risk and radical thinking are involved in the value-added innovation to determine which leadership style to use in a situation. The leader must be flexible—able to switch leadership behaviors when necessary.

=== Exploratory Innovation ===

Exploratory innovation refers to the generation of novel ideas, strategies, and solutions through the use of strictly open behaviors exhibited most often by transformational leaders. The foundation of exploratory innovation is characterized by search, discovery, experimentation, and risk taking. It is the organization's focus on generating new ideas, products and strategies; in contrast to exploitative innovation, which focuses on building and extending already existing ideas. Some studies have shown that explorative and exploitative innovation require different structures, strategies, processes, capabilities, and cultures.&lt;ref name="He, Wong"&gt;He, Z., Wong, P. (2004). Exploration vs. Exploitation: An empirical test of the ambidexterity hypothesis. Organization Science, 15, (4), 481-494&lt;/ref&gt; See Innovative Organizational Climate/Culture. Exploratory innovation requires flexibility, opportunism, adaptability, and for leaders to provide intellectual stimulation to their subordinates.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt; In this approach to innovation, the leadership style that is primarily used is transformational. The behaviors exhibited are believed to achieve the desired creative outcome from employees through the application of individualized consideration, charisma, and inspirational motivation.

For example, in one study of the innovation practices at AXA Insurance in Ireland, the CEO John O’Neil engaged in transformational leadership behaviors and introduced the “MadHouse” program that combined workers from different departments and levels of the organization to work together in a creative way. The result of this experiment after six months was 150 new business ideas for products and services.&lt;ref name="Oke 2002"&gt;Oke, A. (2002). Improving the innovative capability of a service company. Journal of Change Management, 2, (3), 272-281&lt;/ref&gt; Explorative and Value-added innovation are often referenced together, but surprisingly little research shows an interaction between the two. However, there is an understanding that in some circumstances a ‘balance’ must be attained to achieve superior employee performance.&lt;ref name="Tushman &amp; O'Rielly (1996)" /&gt; For example, not all novel ideas are implemented, and may be resurrected later. The organization may need to switch gears and adopt exploitative strategies to revise and refine the idea to match present needs.

== Foundations of Innovation Leadership ==

Innovation leadership has roots in [[path-goal theory]] and [[leader-member exchange theory]]. Certain elements within an organization are also needed for innovation leadership to succeeded. Wolfe (1994),&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;Wolfe, R. (1994). Organizational innovation: Review, critique and suggested research directions. Journal of Management Studies, 31, 405-431&lt;/ref&gt; as cited by Sarros, Cooper, &amp; Santora, (2008)&lt;ref name="Sarros, Cooper, &amp; Santora (2008)" /&gt; has pointed out that one antecedent factor for innovation is [[organizational culture]]. Likewise, Isaksen, Laver, Ekvail &amp; Britz (2001) &lt;ref name="Isaksen, Lauer, Ekvail, &amp; Britz"&gt;Isaksen, S. G., Lauer, K. J., Ekvail, G., Britz, A., (2001). Perceptions of the best and worst climate for creativity: Preliminary validation evidence for the Situational Outlook Questionnaire. Creativity Research Journal, 13, (2), 171-184&lt;/ref&gt; concur that innovative endeavors fail without a supportive climate. This antecedent of a supportive organizational culture/climate encompasses encouragement of creativity, [[autonomy]], resources, and pressures. Additional foundational elements for innovation leadership include creative work, a creative workforce, and certain leader attributes.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange"/&gt;

=== Roots in Path-Goal Theory ===

The basis of [[path-goal theory]] uses a similar view of leadership, in that it advocates different types of leadership (e.g., participative, supportive) behaviors, much like innovation leadership does. However, it is contingent on employee and environmental factor to be effective.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;House, R. J., (1996). Path-Goal theory of leadership: Lessons, legacy, and a reformulated theory. Leadership Quarterly, 7, (3), 323-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, M. G., (1996). R. J. House’s “A Path-Goal Theory of Leader Effectiveness”. Leadership Quarterly, 7, (3), 305-309&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a single leader using different leadership behaviors originated in path-goal theory, and has been associated with the framework underlying innovation leadership, which also allows the creation of a work environment conducive to innovative thinking—which is the cognitive process of generating novel and useful ideas.

Creating this type of work environment through innovation leadership involves open leadership behaviors that resemble some leader behaviors proposed by Path-goal theory—for example, upward influence and supportive/considerate behaviors.&lt;ref name=House /&gt; In innovation leadership, these behaviors encourage the creative team to generate as many novel ideas as possible and lead to evaluation and implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt;

=== Roots in Leader-Member Exchange Theory ===

[[Leader-member exchange theory]] (LMX theory) is another one of the building blocks of innovation leadership. It follows the same idea as Path-goal theory and innovation leadership, that multiple leadership styles are necessary in managing multiple subordinates but takes it a step further. LMX involves adopting a unique leadership style for each employee. Past studies indicate that LMX theory has been shown to have an effect on innovation.&lt;ref name="Basu, Green"&gt;Basu, R., Green, S.G. (1997) Leader-member exchange and transformational leadership: An empirical examination of innovative behaviours in leader-member dyads. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 27, 477-99.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tierney, Farmer, &amp; Graen"&gt;Tierney, P., Farmer, S.M. and Graen, G.B. (1999), An examination of leadership and employee creativity: the relevance of traits and relationships, Personnel Psychology, 52, 591-620&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that leader-member exchange relationships can predict significant organizational and attitudinal variables including higher job satisfaction and higher job performance.

Basu and Green (1997)&lt;ref name="Basu, Green" /&gt; found that innovative behavior is related to the quality of the leader-member exchange where high quality exchanges include contributions from both the leader and the follower. However, in a study by Jean Lee (2008),&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, J. (2008), Effects of leadership and leader-member exchange on innovativeness. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 23, (6), 670 – 6873&lt;/ref&gt; only the loyalty aspect of LMX (LMXL) was shown to be related to innovativeness. Leadership styles, transformational (positively related) and transactional (negatively related), were found to have an effect on innovativeness.

=== Innovative Organizational Culture/Climate ===

Some studies have shown evidence of organizational culture as the mediator of the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational innovation &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"&gt;Amabile, T. M., Conti, R., Coon, H., Lazenby, J., Herron, M. (1996) Assessing the work environment for creativity. The Academy of Management Journal, 39, (5), 1154-1184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deshpande, Farley, Webster"&gt;Deshpande, R., Farley, J., &amp; Webster, F. (1993). Corporate culture, customer orientation, and innovativeness in Japanese firms: A quadrad analysis. Journal of Marketing, 57, 23–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jassawalla, Sashittal"&gt;Jassawalla, A. R., &amp; Sashittal, H. C. (2002). Cultures that support product innovation processes. Academy of Management Executive, 16, 42-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prather, Turrell"&gt;Prather, C. W., &amp; Turrell, M. C. (2002). Involve everyone in the innovation process. Research Technology Management,45,13-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and performance.&lt;ref name="Ogbonna &amp; Harris"&gt;Ogbonna, E., &amp; Harris, L. C. (2000). Leadership style, organizational culture and performance: Empirical evidence from UK companies. International Journal of Human Resource :Management, 11(4), 766-788&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xenikou &amp; Simosi"&gt;Xenikou, A., &amp; Simosi, M. (2006). Organizational culture and transformational leadership as predictors of business unit performance. Journal of Managerial Psychology,21(6),566-57&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for transformational leadership to affect organizational innovation, an organization must have a strong innovative culture in addition to a leader with a [[transformational leadership]] style.

Organizational culture refers to an organization's deep structure, normative beliefs, and shared behavioral expectations. This culture is fairly constant and can influence interorganizational relations. Climate refers to the way that individuals perceive the extent to which the organizational culture impacts them. The two essentially are interrelated. One proposed model for assessing a creative environment in organizations includes the following dimensions:&lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt;

==== Encouragement of Creativity ====

Encouragement of creativity is the most frequently mentioned dimension in the literature. It operates at three major levels, each level containing multiple aspects.

[[File:Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity, from Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, &amp; Heron (1996).png|thumbnail|Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron" /&gt;]]

==== Organizational Encouragement ====

The first level is Organizational Encouragement. This involves encouragement of risk-taking and idea generation from all levels of management, fair and supportive evaluation of new ideas, recognition and reward of creativity, and collaborative idea flow across an organization. Each of these are equally important aspects of organizational encouragement but the third aspect, recognition and reward of creativity, may have adverse effects if the sole purpose for engaging in an activity is to gain reward.

==== Supervisory Encouragement ====

The second level, Supervisory Encouragement, highlights the roles of supervisors and project managers in goal clarity, open interaction between supervisors and subordinates, and supervisory support of a team's work and ideas. This level of encouragement points to the concepts of transformational leadership and LMX that emphasise the importance of the interactions of supervisors and subordinates in innovative performance.

==== Work Group Encouragement ====

The third level of encouragement is Work Group Encouragement. Diversity in team members’ backgrounds and openness to ideas affects creativity because individuals are exposed to a variety of novel and unusual ideas and such exposure had been demonstrated to have a positive effect on creative thinking &lt;ref name="Parnes &amp; Noller"&gt;Parnes, S. J., &amp; Noller, R. B. (1972). Applied creativity: The creative studies project-Part II: Results of the two-year program. Journal of Creative Behavior, 6, 164-186&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Autonomy ====

Autonomy is believed to foster creativity since studies have revealed that individuals produce more creative work and experience increased intrinsic motivation when they have a sense of control and ownership over their work and ideas and they perceive themselves as having a choice in how their goals are accomplished, whether those goals are given to them by their supervisor or chosen by themselves.

==== Resources ====

Resources have been suggested to be directly related to creativity in organizations. Individuals’ perceptions of the availability of resources may lead to increased beliefs of the likelihood that the ideas they generate have a possibility of reaching the implementation stage.

==== Pressures ====

The little evidence that exists on the dimension of pressure suggests somewhat paradoxical influences. Some degree of pressure could have a positive effect if the pressure originates from the challenging and intellectual nature of the task itself, increasing intrinsic motivation. However, if the pressure experienced is perceived extreme it could counteract creativity. Amabile et al. (1996) &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt; identify two forms of pressure: excessive workload pressure and challenge. They suggest that the first should have a negative influence on creativity while the second should have a positive one.

==== Organizational Impediments to Creativity ====

Although there has been little research on the work of environment factors that undermine creativity, some research suggests that these impediments include internal strife, conservatism, and rigid, formal management structures within organizations.&lt;ref name="Kimberley"&gt;36.	Kimberley, J. R. (1981). Managerial innovation. In P. C. Nystrom &amp; W. H. Starbuck (Eds.), Hand-book of organizational design: 84-104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimberley, Evanisko"&gt;Kimberley, J. R., &amp; Evanisko, M. J. (1981). Organizational innovation: The influence of individual, organizational and contextual factors on hospital adoption of technological and administrative innovations. Academy of Management Journal, 24, 689-713&lt;/ref&gt; This dimension is seen as working against autonomy and tends to have an inverse effect as individuals may perceive a more controlling environment.&lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt;

=== Creative Work ===

Creative work can occur at any job but more specifically it can occur in jobs where there are complicated, ill-defined problems requiring innovative solutions.&lt;ref name="Besemer &amp; O’Quin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Smith, &amp; Finke" /&gt; The fact that the creative problems are ill-defined makes the creative work uncertain, and it may involve risky efforts.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; It is also resource intensive, demanding, and time consuming work&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; requiring high levels of motivation &lt;ref name="Collins, Amabile"&gt;Collins, M. A., &amp; Amabile, T. M. (1999). Motivation and creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity, 297–312. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelz &amp; Andrews"&gt;Pelz, D. C., &amp; Andrews, F. M. (1966). Autonomy, coordination, and simulation in relation to scientific achievement. Behavioral Science, 12, 89 – 97&lt;/ref&gt; and often requires collaboration.&lt;ref name="Abra"&gt;Abra, J. (1994). Collaboration in creative work: an initiative for investigation. Creativity Research Journal, 8, 205 – 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cagliano, Chiesa, &amp; Manzini"&gt;Cagliano, R., Chiesa, V., &amp; Manzini, R. (2000). Differences and similarities in managing technological collaborations in research, development, and manufacturing: a case study.

In R. J. Sternberg, &amp; J. E. Davidson (Eds.), The nature of insight (pp. 365 – 396 ). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work must also involve both novel idea generation and novel idea implementation &lt;ref name="Vincent, Decker &amp; Mumford"&gt;Vincent, A. H., Decker, B. D., &amp; Mumford, M. D. (2002). Divergent thinking, intelligence, and expertise: a test of alternative models. Creativity Research Journal, 14, 163 – 178&lt;/ref&gt; and requires expertise on the part of the workforce.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt;

=== Creative Workforce ===

A creative workforce is needed for innovation leadership to be successful. Creative people have expertise on the subject requiring innovation and tend to use work as a source of identity.&lt;ref name="Rostan"&gt;Rostan, S. M. (1998). A study of young artists: the emergence of artistic and creative identity. Journal of Creative Behavior, 32, 278-301. Creativity Research Handbook: Volume II. Cresskill, :NJ: Hampton&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, they are powerfully intrinsically motivated by professional achievement opportunities and recognition. Creative workers are also commonly characterized as highly valuing their autonomy; additional dispositional attributes include openness, flexibility, cognitive complexity, self-confidence, dominance, and [[introversion]].&lt;ref name="Fiest, 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiest &amp; Gorman"&gt;Fiest, G. J., &amp; Gorman, M. E. (1998). The psychology of science: Review and integration of a nascent discipline. Review of General Psychology, 2, 3–47&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns of characteristics creative workers exhibit typically allow them to confidently explore alternative ideas under ambiguous conditions.&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988" /&gt;

=== Leader Attributes/Characteristics ===

Successful innovation leadership requires a leader with certain characteristics. These include expertise in the domain, creativity, ability to carry out transformational leadership behaviors, planning and sense-making, and social skills.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; Innovative leaders can be recruited and hired through professional networks and referrals or alternatively found through succession planning, which involves identifying innovative leaders who are already working within the organization.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)" /&gt;

== Types of Innovation Leadership Styles ==

In addition to these foundations, various &lt;ref&gt;leadership&lt;/ref&gt; styles play an important role in innovation leadership, each of which are used at different stages of the innovation process or for different types of innovation (value-added vs. exploratory). Frequently associated leadership styles include transformational leadership,&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen, Lin, Lin, &amp; McDonough III"&gt;Chen, M. Y., Lin, C. Y., Lin, H., McDonough III, E. F. (2012). Does transformational leadership facilitate technological innovation? The moderating roles of innovative culture and incentive compensation.

== Key Activities of Innovation Leadership ==

=== Idea Generation ===

As mentioned above, different leadership styles and behaviors may be more appropriate at different stages of the innovation process. Current research supports the notion that in the idea generation process, innovation leadership requires a leader to use a more transformational style of leadership.&lt;ref name="King &amp; Anderson"&gt;King, N., &amp; Anderson, N. (1990). Innovation in working groups. In M. A. West, &amp; J. L. Farr (Eds.), Innovation and creativity at work, 81–100&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, a leader needs to promote a safe environment for employees/team members to voice novel ideas and original thinking as well as provide workers with the resources to do so effectively.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; Research has also found that leaders who engage in unconventional behaviors, associated with transformational leadership, were seen as stronger role models and, as a result, increase creative performance in their subordinates. For example, the founders of Google have been known to wear capes and jump-shoes around the office,&lt;ref name="Schmidt, 2010"&gt;Schmidt, E. (2010, May). How I did it: Google’s CEO on enduring lessons of a quirky IPO.  Harvard Business Review. Retrieved from http://hbr.org/2010/05/how-i-did-it-googles-ceo-on-the-enduring-lessons-of-a-quirky-ipo/ar/1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vise &amp; Malseed" /&gt; thus inspiring more outside-the-box thinking in their employees. These open leadership behaviors convey that unorthodox and unconventional ideas and behaviors are not only accepted but also encouraged.

=== Idea Evaluation and Implementation ===

In addition to providing a climate for idea generation, innovation leadership also requires leaders to ensure that the process of idea generation does not overshadow the evaluation and implementation processes. During these phases of leadership, leaders must support some ideas while discarding other ideas and put the supported ideas into production. The role of the leader must shift away from a transformational style to a more transactional style of leadership, which involves being more direct and critical toward the ideas generated. A leader now needs to ensure that constructive discussions of innovative ideas are taking place among their subordinates. This serves to evaluate the usefulness of each idea, eliminate those that do not appear viable to the organization or goal, and push the ones that do appear viable into the production phase. The leader must adopt what are known as closed leadership behaviors to achieve this. Instead of stimulating idea generation, the leader must shift focus from generating new ideas toward fine-tuning existing ideas to achieve progress toward the goal, and ultimately implement the idea. This challenge of balancing differing leadership styles when appropriate is called the ''generator evaluator paradox''. It is important to consider the role of ambidextrous leadership, since a leader must be able to switch between leadership roles and styles when necessary to successfully lead for innovation. Paradoxes of innovation leadership are discussed below.

== Innovation Leadership and Influence ==

Depending on the type of leadership style that is adopted by the innovation leader, the leader may have either a direct or indirect influence on your employees.

=== Direct Influences ===

Direct forms of influence in leading innovation include:
* providing creative input and idea suggestion to employees
* providing employees with clear and concrete goals
* allocating organizational resources (i.e. research and development spending; manpower) for implementing ideas

=== Indirect Influences ===

Indirect influences get the same results without providing explicit guidance to employees. These types of influences include:
* establishing a supportive climate for creativity within the organization
* acting as a role model for innovative thinking
* providing employees with rewards and recognition for innovative thinking
* hiring and team composition (i.e. putting together teams with specific skill sets needed for innovative thinking, or hiring employees with creative personalities without planning what they work on).

== Proposed Model for Innovation Leadership ==

A proposed model for innovation leadership has been a multilevel process model of innovation,&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; which uses the direct and indirect leadership on the processes of innovation mentioned in the above section to promote the innovation process. In the model, indirect leadership influences affect the individual creativity (generation phase) and team creativity (evaluation phase) process. Direct leadership influences affect the team creativity (evaluation phase) process and the organizational innovation process (implementation phase). The individual creativity (generation phase) box in the model represents the process of the individual generating the initial idea or ideas and proposing them to their team. The team creativity (evaluation phase) box represents the process of the team taking that idea, making alterations and fine-tuning it to the point of making prototypes, formalized sketches, or simulations. The organizational innovation (implementation) box represents taking those [[prototypes]], sketches, or simulations and testing, evaluating, and possibly mass-producing them.

[[File:Figure 1. Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation, from Hunter &amp; Cushenberry (2011).png|thumbnail|Figure 1. Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation &lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt;]]

Two very important key features of this model should be mentioned:
# The three stages of innovation (idea generation, evaluation, and implementation) are not independent of one another.
# The stages in the model should not be viewed in a “lock-step fashion,” meaning that there are both backward and forward influences and activities affecting each of the three stages. For example, ideas are generated, discussed, and tested only to feed information back into the system, starting the process from the beginning again.&lt;ref name="Finke, Ward, &amp; Smith, 1992"&gt;Finke, R. A., Ward, T. B., &amp; Smith, S. M. (1992). Creative cognition: Theory, research, and applications. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The forward and backward arrows between individual creativity and team creativity, the forward and backward arrows between team creativity and organizational innovation, as well as the arrow from organizational innovation to individual creativity visually represent this key feature.

== Paradoxes of Innovation Leadership ==

Innovation leadership is complex, as can be seen from the Hunter &amp; Cushenbery (2011) model,&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; and often [[paradoxes]] emerge that require leaders to strike a delicate balance between two conflicting roles (e.g. encouraging innovative ideas vs. limiting innovative ideas to include only those that are most viable and useful to the organization). A balance must be struck, not only within the leader and their behaviors, but between conflicting interests of involved parties as well. These include conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams, between leaders and situational/contextual factors, and between the employees/teams and the organization. Critical potential paradoxes that are often faced by leaders of innovation have been provided by Hunter, Thoroughgood, Meyer, &amp; Ligon (2011).&lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer" /&gt;

=== Internal/Localized Paradox ===

Internal/Localized paradoxes entail conflicting roles experienced within the leader.

=== Dual Expertise Paradox ===

The Dual Expertise Paradox postulates that a leader must have or acquire domain expertise while at the same time obtaining the necessary leadership skills to manage his/her employees and resources.

=== Generation Evaluation Paradox ===

The Generation Evaluation Paradox stipulates that a leader must encourage a supportive climate for the generation of new ideas and thinking outside-the-box while evaluating these ideas and realizing that not all creative ideas are useful and many may even fail (while not being too critical and negative of those ideas).

=== Team-level Paradox ===

Team-level paradoxes entail conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams

=== Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox ===

Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox is based on the research finding that creative workers generally highly value autonomy &lt;ref name="Fiest, 1999"&gt;Fiest, G. J. (1999). The influence of personality on artistic and scientific creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 273 – 296). Cambridge, England: Cambridge University: Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiest &amp; Gorman" /&gt; and, as a result, often prefer to work alone. This paradox illustrates the difficulty leaders have in providing their employees with the autonomy they must be creative, while fostering team cohesion (or closeness) to facilitate idea sharing. A leader must also be careful not to encourage too much cohesion, as it may discourage group members from disagreeing (even constructively disagreeing) with fellow group members in an effort not to offend them or “rock the boat.”

=== Vision Autonomy Paradox ===

The Vision Autonomy Paradox highlights the dilemma a leader faces between providing structure and guidance to a team with respect to the vision of the goal, while at the same time stepping back and providing the team with enough autonomy, especially considering the fact that creative workers highly value autonomy. When leading for innovation, providing an overabundance of structure may result in a backlash from employees who feel their autonomy is being taken away from them.

=== Restriction Freedom Paradox ===

The Restriction Freedom Paradox underscores that innovation leaders need to allow employees enough time to develop creative endeavors and provide the resources to do so. At the same time the leader must take care to provide enough pressure that they are still motivated to complete the task &lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shalley &amp; Gilson"&gt;Shalley, C. E., &amp; Gilson, L. L. (2004). What leaders need to know: A review of the social and contextual factors that can foster or hinder creativity. The Leadership Quarterly, 15, 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt; and not provide too many resources that it has a “deadening effect” on creativity.&lt;ref name="Csikszentmihalyi"&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1997). Creativity: Flow and the psychology of discovery and intervention. New York: Harper Collins Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situational Paradox ===

Situational Paradoxes entail conflicting interests between leaders and the situations they face.

=== Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox ===

The Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox holds that instead of providing more readily available extrinsic motivation tools such as bonuses and salary increases, leaders must provide intrinsic motivation, which generally comes from within the employee, to their employees. This paradox is based on findings that intrinsic motivation is a key factor in facilitating creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, 1997"&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1997). Motivating creativity in organizations: On doing what you love and loving what you do. California Management Review, 40, 39 –58., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shalley &amp; Oldham"&gt;Shalley, C. E., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1997). Competition and creative performance: Effects of competitor presence and visibility. Creativity Research Journal, 10, 337–345.&lt;/ref&gt; and extrinsic motivators may either hinder creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, 1985"&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1985). Motivation and creativity: Effects of motivational orientation on creative writers. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48, 393–399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kruglanksi, Friedman &amp; Zeeyi, 1971"&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Friedman, I., &amp; Zeeyi, G. (1971). The effects of extrinsic incentive on some qualitative aspects of task performance. Journal of Personality, 39, 606 – 617.&lt;/ref&gt; or have an unclear relationship with creativity.&lt;ref name="Baer, Oldham, &amp; Cummings, 2003"&gt;Baer, M., Oldham, G. R., &amp; Cummings, A. (2003). Rewarding creativity: When does it really matter? The Leadership Quarterly, 14, 569 –586.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Hunter, 2005"&gt;47.	Mumford, M. D., &amp; Hunter, S. T. (2005). Innovation in organizations: A multi-level perspective on creativity. In F. J. Yammarino &amp; F. Dansereau (Eds.), Research in multi-level issues, 5, 11–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local Long-Term Paradox ===

The Local Long-Term Paradox posits that leaders of innovation must maintain their innovative edge by keeping an eye out for and capitalizing on potential opportunities, even at the risk of placing those ideas above or even eliminating ideas that he or she had previously inspired in their teams. The leader must also be capable of developing teams that are flexible enough to be passionate about ideas that may have replaced their own idea that was facilitated, inspired, and supported by their leader. This is where the paradox is most clearly visible.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer"&gt;Hunter, S. T., Thoroughgood, C. N., Myer, A. T., &amp; Ligon, G. S. (2011). Paradoxes of leading innovative endeavors: Summary, Solutions, and Future Directions. Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, 5, 54-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition Collaboration Paradox ===

The [[competition collaboration paradox]] involves a leader developing open external relationships with other organizations to discover potential innovation opportunities, while ensuring the organization's emerging ideas are protected in a competitive environment.

=== Feedback Rigidity Paradox ===

The [[feedback rigidity paradox]] involves leaders seeking out and using customer and client advice and feedback towards innovative endeavors to a certain extent, while maintaining control of the vision and not letting the feedback dictate to them—as clients and customers often criticize innovations early on.

=== Failure Success Paradox ===

The Failure Success Paradox is the idea that innovation leaders must ensure a safe organizational culture that is willing to embrace risk and failure, while at the same time making sure that the organization is also producing successful products and services despite embracing risk and errors.

=== Additional Paradoxes ===

Additional paradoxes identified by Hunter et al. (2011) that do not directly involve the leader but are worth mentioning are the paradoxes that occur between teams and the organization. These include the Insularity Cohesion paradox, the Champion Evaluator paradox, and the Creativity Cost paradox.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt;

== Outcomes ==

Outcomes of innovation leadership include inspiring employees to the create and implement novel ideas for products, services, and technologies. In addition, these novel ideas can also be used to solve problems within an organization. What this illustrates is that innovation spurred by innovation leadership can be translated across various industries and can be used for a multitude of purposes.&lt;ref name="Besemer &amp; O’Quin"&gt;Besemer, S. P., O’Quin, K. (1999). Confirming the three-factor creative product analysis matrix model in an American sample. Creativity Research Journal, 12, 287 – 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;Ford, C. M. (2000). Creative developments in creativity theory. Academy of Management Review, 25, 284 – 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988"&gt;Mumford, M. D., &amp; Gustafson, S. B. (1988). Creativity syndrome: integration, application, and innovation. Psychological Bulletin, 103, 27 – 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Smith, &amp; Finke"&gt;Ward, T. B., Smith, S. M., &amp; Finke, R. A. (1999). Creative cognition. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity, 189 – 213. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, inspiring and initiating organizational innovation through innovation leadership can serve to advance the organization it to the next level.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)" /&gt;

== Real-World Examples of Innovation Leadership ==

Companies that use innovative leadership include 3M, which lets employees work on a project of their choosing for 15% of their time.&lt;ref name="Kanter, R. M., Kao, J., &amp; Wiersema, F."&gt;Kanter, R. M., Kao, J., &amp; Wiersema, F. (1997). Innovation: Breakthrough thinking at 3M, DuPont, GE, Pfizer, and Rubbermaid. New York, NY: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Google allows employees one day a week to work on their own project.&lt;ref name="Vise &amp; Malseed"&gt;Vise, D. A., &amp; Malseed, M. (2005). The Google story: Inside the hottest business, media, and technology success of our time. New York, NY: Bantam Dell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappos employees are allowed to “radically” decorate their cubicle and are encouraged to laugh and have fun at work impromptu in-office parades.&lt;ref name="Thorton"&gt;Thorton, P. B. (2010). Leadership: Off the wall. Bloomington, IN: WestBow Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

IWHC attended the 1994 United Nations [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in [[Cairo]] where they asked for the inclusion for access to contraception, safe abortion, [[Midwifery|maternity care]], better access to women's health services and comprehensive [[sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cumberland|first=Sarah|date=February 2012|title=From Population Control to Human Rights|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=72400323&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=90|issue=2|pages=86–87|doi=10.2471/blt.12.040212|pmid=|access-date=27 March 2016|subscription=yes|via=EBSCO|pmc=3302563}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the conference, Dunlop and 15 colleagues developed a set of guidelines called "Women's Declaration on Population Policies," which focused on women's rights in family planning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The "Women's Declaration" was eventually reviewed and finalized with the help of 100 different women's organizations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 1993|title=Women's Declaration on Population Policies|jstor=4028955|journal=Development in Practice|volume=3|issue=2|page=116|doi=10.1080/096145249100077121|pmid=|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Women's Declaration" was adopted by the conference in Cairo.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 2012|title=Joan Dunlop|jstor=41714995|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|volume=20|issue=40|page=197|doi=10.1016/s0968-8080(12)40650-4|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main goals of the "Women's Declaration" was to "shift the focus of population programs from goals and targets" to considering the whole of a woman's life.{{Sfn|Casterline and Sinding|2000|p=695}} Dunlop with the IWHC argued that working towards gender equality in addition to sex education would help reduce birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/13/world/women-campaign-for-new-plan-to-curb-the-world-s-population.html?pagewanted=all|title=Women Campaign for New Plan to Curb the World's Population|last=Chira|first=Susan|date=13 April 1994|work=The New York Times|access-date=27 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic goals and targets, conversely, led to programs that included forced or unwanted [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilizations]] and "inappropriate methods of family planning" for women.{{Sfn|Casterline and Sinding|2000|p=695}} Dunlop also called demographic and target methods to population control "basically racist" because she felt there was a subtext that "those black and brown people should not have more children."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

At the [[Fourth World Conference on Women|U.N.

On graduation from the Nigerian Law School, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki opted to be a private legal practitioner. Unlike other lawyers who would remain permanent at home. Barrister Kabiru Tanimu Turaki went to Kano where he became a senior counsul with Alhaji Tijjani Abdullahi and Company (Solicitors and Advocates) in 1987. Kabiru Tanimu Turaki needed only two years to established himself as a force to be reckoned with in the legal forestry of Kano and its environs. This solid resolution gave birth to K. T. Turaki and Co. In 1989.

As a lawyer, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki has practiced in virtually every court and tribunal in the country. From the Magistrate Court, High Court, the Court of Appeal, Armed Robbery Tribual, Miscellaneous Offences Tribunal, Election Petition Tribunals and even to the Apex Court, the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In all these, he has recorded successes that are certainly beyond the ordinary. He has held professional responsibilities that are too numerous to mentioned. However, it is worthy to note that Kabiru Tanimu Turaki is a retained external solicitor and legal adviser to many organizations throughout Nigeria.

As a lawyer, he has held briefs for clients free of charge. This is a testimony of his love for the down trodden and less privileged. It is a fact that the second Senior Advocate of Nigeria from Kebbi State and the first Advocate of Nigeria from Sokoto State have all passed through his tutelage.

Kabiru Tanimu Turaki is a patriotic Nigerian who is always conscious of the need to develop Nigeria and has not failed to offer his contributions. He was appointed a member of the Kano State Law Reporting Committee in 1999 and a member of the Committee for the review of current legislations in Kano State. The following year, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki served in the committee that reviewed the Northern States Penal Code Law in 1992.

When the Nigeria Bar Association was going through one of its trying moments, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki was one of those called upon to resolve its crisis in 1993.

The Danmasanin Gwandu was a member of the National Political Reform Conference in 2004, as well as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Team Nigerian Trust Fund, a body that was set up to galvanize private sector participation in the sports development and financing in Nigeria.

When the defunct Bank of the North was in murky waters, Barrister Turaki, San, was among the intervention Board that was set up by the Regulatory Agencies (CBN/ NDIC) to restore the Bank that was on the verge of collapse to profitability.

He was at various times a member of the Council of Legal Education, as well as member for the review of Investment Laws in Nigeria. He was also a member of the Ministerial Committee for the Implementation of Reforms in the Nigeria Police Force as well as the Committees set up by the Body of Benchers to review the Laws Regulating Legal Practice in Nigeria.

His contribution to the development of the Law and the Legal Practice in Nigeria led to his appointment as a Notary Public by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, and his elevation of the prestigious rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) in 2002.

After the 2003 elections, he later decamped to PDP the same year and was the Party’s Kebbi State Gubernatorial Aspirant in 2007. Following series of betrayals and numerous controversies, Kabiru decided to Join ACN in 2011. This, however, did not last as he later returned to PDP the same year. In 2014/15, looking at his tremendous achievements and wealth of experience, Kabiru was appointed Deputy Director General (North) of PDP Presidential Campaign Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsexpressngr.com/news/detail.php?news=4653|title=Special Duties Minister Kabiru Tanimu Turaki worthy of emulation —Kaduna Govt.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security Challenges ===

He was thus appointed as the Chairman of the Presidential Committee for Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North. A Committee which for more than two years engaged the insurgents in fruitful discussion that saw many key leaders of  [[Boko Haram]] accepting the Dialogue option as a means of resolving the insecurity situation in the North East geo-political zone of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.empower54.org/team/board-of-directors/|title=The Board of Directors|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Contributions ===
As part of his remarkable leadership qualities, he was several times chosen, among his colleagues at the Federal Executive Council, to lead Federal Government Delegation to Niger, Senegal, as well as Republic of Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/07/buhari-led-govt-caused-divisions-among-nigerians-former-pdp-ministers/|title=Buhari-led govt has caused divisions among Nigerians – Former PDP ministers|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in 2014 chosen by President Goodluck E. Jonathan, to serve as the Deputy Director General of his Campaign, and subsequently appointed as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itvradionigeria.com/tag/kabiru-tanimu-turaki/|title=FG Says All Constituency Projects Must be Implemented|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Dialogue with Boko Haram Sect ===
On April 24, 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan, GCFR inaugurated the Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North to be chaired by Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, SAN, a Minister of Special Duties in the Office of the President then and established its modalities in a ceremony at the Presidential Vill. The committee is to open talks with the Islamic insurgency Boko Haram within three months, and work out modalities for an amnesty for the insurgents and compensation for its victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voahausa.com/a/2262574.html|title=Shugaban Kwamitin Sulhu Da Boko Haram, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, Kan Abubuwan Da Suke Yi|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee immediately began work and was able to engage some Boko Haram larders and already repented members into dialogue.

On June 166th 2013, the committee made first public statement detailing how the federal Government planned to begin the process of disarmament and de-radicalization of Boko Haram members who surrendered their arms as well as ensuring that they are well rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voahausa.com/a/2252267.html|title=Rikici ba ya hana yin sulhu in ji SAN Kabiru Tanimu Turaki|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2013, the committee announced ceasefire deal with Boko Haram, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, stated that the ceasefire deal with Boko Haram has the blessings of the sect’s leader, Sheikh Abubakar Shekau. He further gave assurance that all Nigerians would be privy to a ceasefire agreement that would be signed in due course. In his words:

''“We’re still working on the framework where we’ll sign an agreement and we’ll make that public. Wherever and whenever we agree on the time and place, the international and local media as well as all Nigerians will be privy to it”''

On the terms of the ceasefire agreement, he said it was still being worked on and the broader framework being discussed, after which Nigerians would be duly informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelstv.com/tag/kabiru-tanimu-turaki/|title=Jonathan Sets up Committee On Granting Amnesty To Boko Haram|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2013, barely forty eight hours after Kabiru Tanimu Turaki made this statement, the leader of Boko Haram, Sheikh Abubakar Shekau, punctured the Federal Government’s claim that the Islamist extremists had agreed to a ceasefire deal in the spirit of Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueprint.ng/courts-contradict-selves-over-ifeanyi-ubahs-release/|title=Courts contradict selves over Ifeanyi Ubah’s release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2013, nine days after Shekau released his Video, Human Rights Writes’ Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) called on President Goodluck Jonathan to immediately disband the Kabiru Tanimu Turaki – led Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North. The association claimed that it would amount to grave disservice to the public for the committee to continue to exist after Shekau had Debunked Turaki’s claim that his committee has secured a ceasefire deal with Boko Haram. They further described the exercise as a  “huge scam and a scandalous contraption that ought not to have been set up in the first place”. On July 31, 2013, Another Pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere called for the immediate disbandment of the committee, saying recent events had over taken the its usefulness. They also called for an urgent probe of Turaki, who is also the Minister of Special Duties, to ascertain where his hoax of a ceasefire came from. Afenifere expressed concerns over renewed violent campaigns by the radical Islamist sect which claimed scores of lives in separate attacks in Borno and Kano States within 48 – hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wakaaboutafrica.com/tag/minister-of-labour-and-productivity-kabiru-tanimu-turaki/|title=Tag: Minister of Labour and Productivity Kabiru Tanimu Turaki Ministry of Labour and Productivity, ATSSAN, NATCA and NAMA Resolve Issues|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these calls by the two separate organization felt deaf ears as on the same day Afenifere’s call, President Goodluck Jonathan extended the timeline of the committee by two months. Kabiru Tanimu Turaki said the discordant tunes coming from the sect represent the various dynamics within them. There are people who are engaged in it on the basis of ideology or dogma. Some people are doing it on the basis of economic benefits. He added that some people are fifth columnists, who will make sure you don’t succeed in whatever you do.

At the end, after six months, Tanimu Tanimu led Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North submitted its report to President Goodluck Jonathan, GCFR.

== Gay Marriage Rejection ==
In August 2013, Nigerian Government under the Administration of President Goodluck Jonathan,GCFR, rejected gay marriage at the Federal Executive Council (FEC) despite pressure from the international community to legalize it. Being the minister who gave an insight into how the Federal Government took the decision, a form of individuals and organizations who support gay marriage channelled their grievance directly to him. In a statement directly made by him, he said:

''“When we were at the Federal Executive Council and we were discussing the issue of gay marriage, we all said that it is very unnatural. How can we explain this to Nigerians? That a man will go and marry a man and a woman will go and marry a fellow woman. Then we also discussed the aspect of the psychological and mental trauma that the children of such union, whether adopted or not, will have to go through. For example when they go to school and they are asked; who are your parents? And they have to answer that their mummy and daddy are both men or are both female. This does not fit into a highly religious society like ours. There is nowhere in the world where God is worshipped like in Nigeria. Even traditional worshippers also take their religion very seriously, we pray a lot and that is why God has not forsaken Nigeria. We have been through situations that saw many counties went into pieces but whatever happens in Nigeria, like an elephant, Nigeria will only shake its body and move on”.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informationng.com/2013/08/why-fg-rejected-gay-marriage-despite-foreign-pressure-minister.html|title=Why FG Rejected Gay Marriage Despite Foreign Pressure – Minister|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These words did not go well with those individuals and groups who support gay marriage. They attributed his words as being too religious denial of human rights.

The 15 candidates of the party in [[Kerala]], where it forms part of the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]], were decided at a CPI(M) state committee meeting held on 12 March 2014.&lt;ref name="k1"&gt;''Matrubhumi''.

==States==

===Andhra Pradesh===

No candidates from Andhra Pradesh were listed in the 'first list' of candidates released by the CPI(M) Central Committee.&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt; In the state CPI(M) and the [[Communist Party of India]] could not reach an agreement on seat-sharing. Whilst CPI supported the creation of a separate Telangana state, CPI(M) had opposed the demand.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindu''. ''[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cpi-names-60-candidates-in-first-list/article5767573.ece CPI names 60 candidates in first list]''&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 2014 the CPI(M) Telangana State Committee secretary [[Tammineni Veerabhadram]] stated at a press meet in [[Khammam]] that the party would contest the Khammam, Mahabubabad, Nalgonda and Bhongir Lok Sabha seats. However, he reiterated that the names of candidates in Telangana would be defined only after alliances with other non-BJP/non-Congress parties had been settled.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindu''.

On 26 March 2014 CPI(M) made public three names of candidates contesting Lok Sabha seats in Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Indian Express''.

By this point no alliances with other parties had been reached.&lt;ref name="pdap"&gt;''People's Democracy''. ''[http://peoplesdemocracy.in/2014/0406_pd/cpim-announces-candidates-telangana CPI(M) Announces Candidates for Telangana]''&lt;/ref&gt; A 12 April 2014 article released by the [[Press Trust of India]] named two candidates in Telangana as well as Midiam Baburao in Araku.&lt;ref name="stap"&gt;''The Statesman''.

The '''Ministry of Defence''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: '''''Kem'''enterian Perta'''han'''an'' abbreviated '''Kemhan''') of the Republic of Indonesia, formerly the '''Department of Defence''' of the Republic of Indonesia is a [[government ministry]] responsible for the defence affairs of [[Indonesia]]. The minister is currently [[Ryamizard Ryacudu]] since 27 October 2014.

The Ministry of Defence is the one of three ministries (along with [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]) explicitly mentioned in [[Constitution of Indonesia]], which means the three ministries cannot be replaced or dissolved by [[President of Indonesia|the President]].

If both the [[President of Indonesia|President]] and [[Vice President of Indonesia]] die, resign, or are unable to perform their duties, the Minister of Defence, along with [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Minister of Home Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], jointly execute presidential duties until the succeeding President and Vice President are elected by the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] within thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Indonesia]] Article 8 Paragraph 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===During the [[Soekarno]] Era===
After the Proclamation of the Independence of Indonesia on August 17 1945, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) immediately set up the first Presidential Cabinet which in the first cabinet didn't have a Minister of Defense. The function of the State Defense at that time was at the Minister of Public Security. On October 6 1945, Supriyadi was declared Minister of Public Security. However, he never appeared, and on 20 October was replaced by interim minister Imam Muhammad Suliyoadikusumo.&lt;ref&gt;Simanjuntak (2003), page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the [[First Sjahrir Cabinet]], the function of the state defense was also under the authority of the Minister of Public Security, held by Mr. [[Amir Sjarifoeddin]]. However, in the [[Second Sjahrir Cabinet]], the People's Security Minister was renamed as the '''Minister of Defense''' who still remained in office was Amir Sjarifuddin. At the time of Mr. Amir Sjarifuddin became [[Prime Minister]], the Defense Minister is held also by the Prime Minister. In the period of the [[First Hatta Cabinet]], when the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia was in an emergency state due to the pressure of the Dutch forces, the Vice President [[Mohammad Hatta]] served as interim minister of defense.

===During the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]]===
In the [[First Development Cabinet]], the Minister of Defense and Security was held by the Indonesian President Gen. [[Soeharto]]. Only later on the [[Second Development Cabinet]] and subsequently, the function of state defense was always united with the security function and was under the Ministry of Defense and Security where the Minister of Defense and Security would if needed serve concurrently as Commander of the Armed Forces (''Panglima ABRI'') (this was the case four times during Soeharto's presidency). In 1985, as part of a wide reorganization of the armed forces, military appointments to posts of ministers and below began to phased out, allowing retired officers and civilians to serve in the ministry.

===During [[Post-Suharto era|Reformation]]=== 
On the 1st of July 2000, the Ministry of Defense  reformed itself with the separation of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|TNI]] and the [[Indonesian National Police|Polri]]&lt;ref&gt;TAP MPR No. VI/MPR/2000 concerning the separation of the TNI with POLRI&lt;/ref&gt; and also separated the positions in which the Minister of Defense can be of a civilian background, and can no longer concurrently serve as the TNI Commander (Panglima). Regulation through defense is regulated through Law no. 3 of 2002 on State Defense and Law no. 34 of 2004 on the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]].

Law no. 3 of 2002 on State Defense Article 16 further stipulates the responsibilities of the Minister of Defense, as follows:
#Minister leads the Ministry of Defense.
#The Minister assists the President in formulating the general policy of state defense.
#The Minister shall stipulate a policy on the implementation of state defense based on the general policy set by the President.
#The Minister compiles the [[defense white paper]] and establishes bilateral, regional and international cooperation policies in its field.
#The Minister formulates a general policy of using the power of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] (TNI) and other defense components.
#The Minister shall determine the policy of budgeting, procurement, recruitment, management of national resources, as well as the development of technology and defense industries required by the Indonesian Armed Forces and other defense force components.
#The minister works with the heads of ministries and other government agencies and develops and implements strategic planning for the management of national resources for defense purposes.

Pursuant to Article 18 Paragraph 4, the Commander of the National Armed Forces shall be responsible to the President in the use of the state defense component and cooperate with the Minister in meeting the needs of the Indonesian National Armed Forces.

==Task and Duties==
The Ministry of Defense has the task of organizing defense affairs in the government to assist the President in organizing state administrations. In carrying out its duties, the Ministry of Defense performs the functions of:

#Formulation, determination, and implementation of policies in the field of defense
#Management of state property which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense
#Supervision on the implementation of duties within the Ministry of Defense
#Implementation of technical activities from central to regional

'''Míriam Martinho''' (born 1954) is one of the leading [[Feminism|feminists]] in Brazil and part of the  second generation of feminist journalists, who emerged in the 1980s. She was one of the first people to bring lesbianism openly into the fold of feminism and founded one of the first Lesbian-Feminist organizations in the country. She and [[Rosely Roth]] gained recognition for staging a protest, known at the "Brazilian Stonewall" at Ferro's Bar in 1983. She has written for numerous LGBT and feminist journals and has submitted expert testimony on the state of the LGBT community in Brazil.

==Biography==
Míriam Martinho  was born in 1954 in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and grew up in the city of [[São Paulo]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} She is one of the pioneering figures of [[Feminism in Brazil]]&lt;ref name="Cardoso (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cardoso|first1=Elizabeth| title=Imprensa feminista brasileira pós-1974|journal=Revista Estudos Feministas|date=September–December 2004|volume= 12|issue=Special Florianópolis|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-026X2004000300004&amp;script=sci_arttext|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Escola de Comunicações e Artes da Universidade de São Paulo|location=São Paulo, Brazil|language=Portuguese|issn=0104-026X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[LGBT history in Brazil|Brazilian Homosexual Movement]].&lt;ref name=Rosenbloom&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenbloom|first1=Rachel (editor)|title=Unspoken rules: Sexual Orientation and Women's Human Rights|date=1996|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=978-0-304-33764-4|pages=21–23|edition=[1st ed.].|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?ei=N3JbVcHwMpG4yQSU3YFY&amp;id=|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movement in Brazil, became fairly active in 1975. After the II Congress of the Paulista Women there was a split between leftist leaders and feminists. At that time, feminists were supporting the concept of gender, rather than class, as a focus for political empowerment and equality. The schism resulted in the feminists moving forward on their own and a flurry of magazines and critical thought on feminism emerged. Many feminist organizations were founded each with specific themes: education, health, political empowerment, sexuality, violence, among others.&lt;ref name="Cardoso (2004)" /&gt; Martinho was part of this movement, founding the first lesbian feminist group, ''Grupo Lésbico-Feminista'', in 1979. In 1981 the group disbanded &lt;ref name=Rosenbloom /&gt; and part of the members went on to form the ''Grupo Ação Lésbica-Feminista'' (GALF), the most active of whom were Martinho and [[Rosely Roth]]. In 1989, GALF reformed as an NGO called ''Um Outro Olhar''.&lt;ref name="Cardoso (2004)" /&gt;

In 1981, Martinho began producing an activist newspaper called ''"ChanacomChana"'' as the voice of GALF. Sometimes it was produced triannually and sometimes quarterly, but it circulated through the 1980s. It was the first journal to expand the idea of including lesbians in the feminist movement, which was seen as very radical at the time. In 1989, when GALF was formed as an NGO, the journal changed its name to coincide with that of the NGO, "Um Outro Olhar" and it primary began to focus on LGBT issues with feminism as a secondary focus.&lt;ref name="Cardoso (2004)" /&gt;

The publication ''"ChanacomChana"'' was directly responsible for the event that has been called the "Brazilian Stonewall". On 19 August 1983, a protest was held against Ferro's Bar, known for its lesbian clientele, in São Paulo, because they refused to allow ''ChanacomChana'' to be distributed. Martin and Roth staged a demonstration, calling together artists, intellectuals and lawyers, to protest.&lt;ref name='Brazilian "Stonewall"'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Franco Conde|first1=Michele Cunha|title=O Movimento Homossexual Brasileiro, Sua Trajetória e Seu Papel na Ampliação do Exercício da Cidadania|url=http://www.fchf.ufg.br/pos-sociologia/dissert/Michele.pdf|website=Faculdade de Ciências Humanas e Filosofia|publisher=Programa de Pós- Graduação em Sociologia da Faculdade de Ciências Humanas e Filosofia da Universidade Federal de Goiás|accessdate=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011194422/http://www.fchf.ufg.br/pos-sociologia/dissert/Michele.pdf|archivedate=October 11, 2006|location=Brazil|language=Portuguese|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Martin, the difficulty started almost a month earlier when the owners ejected she and Roth for trying to distribute the paper in the bar. There was a physical altercation and they were banned from distributing the paper. They planned the demonstration to protest the ban and got a lot of press coverage because their approach was pro-active and non-violent,&lt;ref name="non-violent approach"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dia do Orgulho Lésbico: entrevista com Míriam Martinho|url=https://homomento.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/19-agosto-orgulho-lesbic/|website=Homomento|publisher=Homomento|accessdate=19 May 2015|location=São Paulo, Brazil|language=Portuguese|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because they were open about fighting for their rights in a time when many lesbians were in hiding. After the protest, the bar developed an even larger lesbian following.&lt;ref name="Ferro Bar"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dimenstein|first1=Gilberto|title=Bar das lésbicas entra na história|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dimenstein/urbanidade/gd260603.htm|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Árvore da vida|date=26 June 2003|location=São Paulo, Brazil|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, Martinho has been involved in an endeavor to improve the health care provided to women, but especially lesbians. As many of them do not disclose their status to health practitioners, she feels they are extremely vulnerable. In 2003, she presented research for periodic review of the state of the LGBT population in Brazil. Her report was highlighted by the US State Department and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada in their evaluation.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada: Responses to Information Requests - Brazil|url=http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/country/canada_coi/brazil/BRA100767.E.pdf|website=Justice.gov|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=19 May 2015|location=Washington DC|date=19 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martinho works as a journalist and serves at the editor in chief of the websites Umoutroolhar and Contraocorodoscontentes two of the most important portals of Intelligentsia Lesbian in Brazil.

==Education and career==
Scheman received her bachelor's in philosophy from [[Barnard College]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She went on to receive a master's and doctorate in philosophy from [[Harvard University]], in 1971 and 1978, respectively.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Scheman is currently a professor at University of Minnesota, and a guest professor at [[Umeå University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  During her time at the University of Minnesota, she served as the chair of the Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies department from 1986-1989, and has served as the Director of Graduate Studies since 2007.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  Prior to her current positions, Scheman has held appointments at the [[University of Ottawa]],  [[Columbia University]], the [[Center for Advanced Feminist Studies]] (including serving as director from 1991-1992 and associate dean of the graduate school from 2000-2003,) and the [[University of Gothenburg]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas==

The '''''Nhân Văn-Giai Phẩm''''' '''affair''' ({{lang-vi|Phong Trào Nhân Văn-Giai Phẩm}}) was a cultural-political movement in [[North Vietnam]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Pelley ''Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past '' Page 253  2002 "... in the dissident Nhân văn–Giai phẩm Affair, Phan Khôi's involvement with the Research Committee was exceedingly brief."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thu-Hương Nguyễn-Võ ''The Ironies of Freedom: Sex, Culture, and Neoliberal Governance in Vietnam.'' (9780295988504) - Page 68  2008 "..and from 1956 to 1958 with cultural opposition in the form of the ill-fated Nhân Văn–Giai Phẩm movement ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Two periodicals were established during that time, '''Nhân Văn''' ({{IPA-vi|ɲən van|lang}}, ''Humanities'') and '''Giai Phẩm''' ({{IPA-vi|zaːj fə᷉m|lang}}, ''Masterpieces''), many issues of which were published demanding [[freedom of speech]], creativity and [[human rights]]. Following a loosening of political restrictions with some similarities to the Chinese [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], there was a hardening of attitudes. After those two major journals were closed down, their political associates were imprisoned or reeducated. Moreover, the agenda of ''Nhân Văn-Giai Phẩm'' was linked to "reactionary" political projects by North Vietnamese government.

== Historical Contexts ==

=== 1954 Geneva Accords ===
The [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] marked the end of anti-French struggle and provided the ''[[Viet Minh]]'' with prestige and authority. After the close of the Geneva Conference, the VWP faced two fundamental tasks: to reconstruct the north and to unify the south.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = China &amp; The Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975|last = Qiang Zhai|first = |publisher = The University of North Carolina Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 69, 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; To rebuild the north, the VWP leadership continued to look to China for assistance and China immediately began to offer aid to help the DRV.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; But the reconstruction efforts in the DRV following the [[First Indochina War]] underwent many trials and tribulations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The War Politburo:North Vietnam`s Diplomatic and Political Road to the Tet Offensive|last = Nguyen|first = Lien-Hang T.|date = 2006|journal = Journal of Vietnamese Studies |volume=1 |issue=1-2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1954 Geneva Accords on ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' facilitated enormous emigration from the north to the south from July 1954 to May 1955.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Nhan Van-Giai Pham and Vietnamese "Reform Communism" in the 1950s: A Revisionist Interpretation|last = Peter Zinoman|first = |date = 2011|journal = Journal of Cold War Studies |volume=13 |issue=1|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass migration added to the social disorder generated by the other contemporary political reforms in North Vietnam.

=== The Rise of de-Stalinization ===
The key global preludes of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' affair may be located in the ups and downs of reform and repression that dominated political life in the eastern bloc and China throughout the turbulent years of the 1950s. Most significant was the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, the rise of currents of [[de-Stalinization]] promoted by political elites, and the growth of agitation throughout the Eastern bloc on the part of workers, intellectuals, and students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This course was the so-called Liberalization, which accelerated in the wake of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Nikita Khrushchev`s Secret Speech]] denouncing the crimes of Stalin in Feb 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The uprisings in Eastern bloc later that year brought this era of high de-Stalinization which inspired and stimulated not only the Soviet bloc, but many intellectuals within Chinese and North Vietnamese state-party.

=== Impact of the imitation from Chinese models ===
During the Cold War, the Sino-Soviet relations greatly complicated North Vietnam`s reconstruction and the path toward reunification. By the 1950s, ''[[Hanoi|Ha Noi]]'' faced two different modes of revolution: peaceful reunification through socialist development of the North and violent reunification through liberation struggle in the South, due to the separate ideology between Moscow and Beijing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For the North Vietnam, the close connection, promoted by geographical, historical and cultural links with China was much deeper than those with the Soviet Union. In this context, Vietnamese developments in the era of de-Stalinization had more connections with China than with the USSR. However, the Soviet Union continued to be considered by the Vietnamese communists as the ideological center of the world communist movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the cancellation of 1956 nationwide election, both Beijing and Moscow encouraged ''Ho Nai'' to continue its political and economic reconstruction within the North. While Chinese influence in the North Vietnamese political reforms should be considered in a totally different light. Three in particular political movements were causing widespread discontent in North Vietnam which were all resulted from DRV`s imitation of the Chinese model,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Beyond Moscow-Centric Interpretation: An Examination of the China Connection in Eastern Europe and North Vietnam during the Era of De-Stalinization|last = Cheng|first = Yinghong|date = December 2004|journal = Journal of World History |volume=15 |issue=4|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 487–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the rectification campaign, the land reform and the correction of errors.

In 1950s, ''Ho Chi Minh'' made an official visit to China to sign a military aid agreement with the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) leadership in Beijing. With the introduction of Chinese military aid came the massive influx of Chinese-styled institutions, reforms and advisors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Renovating Politics in Contemporary Vietnam|last = Abuza|first = Zachary|publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 42–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; A massive organizational [[rectification campaign]] was launched to study the Chinese [[Yan'an Rectification Movement|1942 Yan`an campaign]], and thousands of cadres were purged.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Almost at the same time, a two-phase [[Land reform in North Vietnam|land reform]] campaign modeled on china`s was also put into action from 1953 to 1956. This alarmed many intellectuals because most had ties to the landlord classes more or less. Since many intellectuals were labeled "class enemies", a new label of "progressive personalities" was created for them if they voluntarily surrendered all their property to the state, in addition to serving the revolution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The twin notorious movements of the rectification campaign and the land reform cause serious damage not only on old structures in the village but on the party apparatus, which might have sowed chaos.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A World Transformed: The Politics of Culture in Revolutionary Vietnam, 1945-1965|last = Ninh|first = Kim N.B.|publisher = The University of Michigan Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 121–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1956, the party admitted serious problems with the land reform, and it launched a period of "[[Rectification of errors|correction of errors]]" in October the same year. Nevertheless, official acknowledgement of land reform errors could not prevent, or perhaps generated further discord in the countryside, such as a violent peasant rebellion in ''[[Nghệ An Province|Nghe An]]'' province in November 1956.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the chaos occurred in the countryside, the whole country was in disorder. Many urban intellectuals who had been mobilized by the party to participate in the campaigns stoked the atmosphere of dissent in North Vietnam. Moreover, the fact that those series of movements were inspired by Maoist that stimulated other unpopular policies of the new regime that contributed to a belief that the Vietnamese revolution was a misplaced enthusiasm for the Chinese model.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Hundred Flowers Movement in China ===
Both China and North Vietnam were influenced by the currents of de-Stalinization during that time, while the North Vietnamese case suggests a more direct influence from China. With the criticism of de-Stalinization by Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pursued a high key official campaign against independent intellectuals such as [[Hu Feng]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; But, in a stunning reversal, it launched the famous liberal Hundred Flowers movement the following year with the eulogizing of [[Mao Zedong]] himself.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Following a year during which intellectuals were encouraged to air in public grievances about the party and its policies, the CCP abruptly reversed course again. In 1957, it shut down the Hundred Flowers movement and launched an "[[Anti-Rightist Movement|anti-rightist campaign]]" designed to root out and punish intellectuals who had exposed themselves during the previous year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Same way in North Vietnam, a Vietnamese intellectual ''[[Trần Dần|Tran Dan]]'' was inspired and encouraged by Hu Feng and published ''Nhan Van'' magazine in 1955.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Then the party was aware of the close connection between ''Tran Dan'' and Hu Feng, and it should not be a surprise that when ''Tran Dan'' was purged and arrested in February 1956, six months after Hu Feng was imprisoned, the rationale for some cadres involved in the arrest was "China has Hu Feng, perhaps we also have a Hu Feng."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Tran Dan''`s arrest marked the start of ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' affair.

== ''Nhân Văn'' and ''Giai phẩm'' Journals ==

===''Nhân Văn'' journal, 1955-1956===
The official address of the ''Nhân Văn'' ("humanities") paper was 27 Hang Khay, [[Hanoi]]. Its editor was [[Phan Khôi]], and its secretary was [[Tran Duy]]. The ''Nhân Văn'' group consisted of the dissident North Vietnamese intellectuals from 1955–58. This group was led by Phan Khôi, a revolutionary from [[Quảng Nam]]. Most of these intellectuals had participated in the movement against [[French Indochina|French colonialism]]. After the first phase of [[Land reform in North Vietnam|land reform]], they became disillusioned and started a [[political movement]] demanding [[freedom (political)|political freedom]] and [[democracy]].

===''Giai phẩm Mùa xuân'' journal, 1956===
The first edition of ''Giai Pham Mùa xuân'' ("Works of Spring"), also edited by [[Phan Khôi]], was published in March, 1956.  By December 1956, they had published two issues (Fall and Spring) of ''Giai Phẩm'' and five issues of ''Nhân Văn''.

Among intellectuals that joined the group around the two journals were the lawyer [[Nguyễn Mạnh Tường]], Dr [[Đặng Văn Ngữ]], scholar [[Đào Duy Anh]], philosopher [[Trần Đức Thảo]], poets [[Trần Dần]], [[Hoàng Cầm (poet)|Hoàng Cầm]], [[Phùng Quán]], [[Quang Dũng]], [[Văn Cao]], [[Nguyễn Hữu Đang]], [[Lê Đạt]] and painter [[Bùi Xuân Phái]].

== Events of the ''Nhân Văn-''Giai phẩm Period ==

=== Prelude (late 1954-1955) ===
Prior to the founding of ''Nhân Văn'' and ''Giai Phẩm'' journals, there was an insurgent campaign waged within the army to loosen censorship imposed on military writers and artists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In February 1955, about thirty writers and artists in the army drafted a resolution to the party`s central committee "demanding the abolition of the General Political Bureau`s leadership over arts and letters in the army.", which included three demands: "1) hand over the leadership of arts and letters to the artists and writers; 2) establish an arts and letters association within the structure of army organization; 3) abolish the existing military regime insofar as it affects the artists and writers serving in the armed forces."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the same month, they proposed a political petition based on the above three requests, but the petition was rejected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The leading figure of this dissenting intellectual campaign was ''Tran Dan'', a soldier-poet who became disenchanted with Maoist cultural policy following a two-month study tour to China in late 1954.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as we can see that, however, ''Tran Dan'' was in China at the height of the Hu Feng crisis.

Hu Feng, a literary critic and longtime member of the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to the central committee in July 1954 that criticized his grievances on the party`s literary authority figures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although he had no intention of challenging party authority, Hu Feng`s action reflected a wide range of intellectuals and artists` grievances and was taken as evidence of the earliest cleavage between the party and intellectuals after the formation of the PRC.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Hu Feng was arrested in July 1955, and the campaign against him broadened into a campaign to reeducate the masses and reinforce the official line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After Hu Feng`s personal letters were published, there is no doubt that ''Tran Dan'' was exposed to the materials related to Hu Feng`s letter, and later his friends acknowledged the connection between Hu Feng and ''Tran Dan'' in a cartoon published in ''Nhan Van'', the most influential Vietnamese dissident magazine. As a result, Tran Dan was also arrested in February 1956, six month later than Hu Feng`s imprisoned.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The failure of ''Tran Dan''-led insurgent campaign significantly frustrated the intellectuals who naively believed that their contribution to the revolution had won the party`s trust, and thus prepared the ground for the intellectuals` more radical challenge to the party the following year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== The golden age of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' (Feb.1956-Nov.1956) ===
The second stage of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' was most liberal from the appearance of the first issue of ''Giai Pham'' in February 1956, although shortly after ''Tran Dan'' was arrested, and until late November 1956. In particular from August to November 1956, the movement experienced its golden age. The coincidence of the publication of the first issue of ''Giai Pham'' and Khrushchev`s Secret Speech raised the prospect that a period of liberalization was forthcoming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indeed, the international circumstances had turned favorable to the intellectuals during this stage. Both the [[Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Twentieth Congress]] and the Chinese Double-Hundred policy had immediate impact upon the relationship between Vietnamese intellectuals and the party.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and allowed Vietnamese intellectuals the space to vigorously voice their concerns. The Soviet first deputy premier went to Beijing and ''Hanoi'' in April 1956 in order to introduce the new Soviet line. In the same month ''Tran Dan'' was released from prison, mainly because of the change in international atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Domestically, a similarly liberal atmosphere dominated the Tenth Plenum of the VWP in September during which party leaders "correction of errors" of the land reform and called for a revival of "democratic rights" and the "people`s freedom."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; after that, many issues of ''Nhan Van and Giai Pham'' appeared, along with other independent journals came out intermittently, including ''Tram hoa'' (Hundred flowers), ''Noi that'' (Speak truth), ''Tap san phe binh'' (Criticism newsletter), ''Sang tao'' (Creativity), and ''Dai moi'' (New land).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the August 1956 Conference of the Vietnamese Literary Association, intellectuals openly demanded greater freedom, just as their counterparts in China and the Soviet Union were doing at that time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In September, five issues of the independent journal ''Nhan Van'' were permitted to publish, along with many other private publications that rallied dissenting intellectuals and flooded news-stands, symbolized a unique time of liberalization was represented. In an attempt to influence these publishing ventures and to stop the wave of criticism, the ''Van Hghe'', which was an official weekly newspaper for literature and the arts, published a "[[self-criticism]]" of ''Hoai Thanh''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Nevertheless, in that period, the DRV held a provisional tolerate official stance toward the directness of the writers and artists.

=== Incomplete repression (Nov.1956-early 1957) ===
After the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revolt in early November 1956 and the outbreak of rural riot in ''Quynh Luu'', the liberal stage of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' ended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead,the Viet Minh began to strike back against the intellectuals by publishing editorials and commentaries and even "letters from audiences" to condemn [[Anti-Socialist|anti-socialist]] elements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the meanwhile, government began to harass the editors of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' by accusing them of breaking the law for failing to deposit three copies of the journal with the Central Press Office prior to publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A more aggressive campaign against ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' was launched after the sixth issue of ''Nhan Van'' was seized. The campaign featured the contemporary publications to denunciate the movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The entry from ''Cuu quoc'' reflected the high degree of belligerence of the campaign:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nhan Van distorted the truth, exaggerated facts, made up stories, sowed doubts and pessimism in our regime, our party and our government, and created an atmosphere of mistrust and division within our ranks: between soldiers and the army, between the people and the authorities, between the members and non-members of the party, and even between leaders and the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The "Nhan-Van" Affair|last = Hoa Mai, ed.|first = |date = 1956|journal = The "Nhan-Van" Affair|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time, the campaign also labeled the ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' as "reactionary" political agenda. After more than a month of such campaign, on 18 December, the ''Hanoi'' Administrative Committee suspended the two journals of ''Nhan Van'' and ''Giai Pham'', closed other publishing houses and confiscated the copies of previous issues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; But the storm of political condemnation toward ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' quickly passed away by the early 1957. For the reasons that remain vague (which possibly related to the ongoing Hundred Flowers campaign in China), the party-state stopped its anti-''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' campaign, and no one arrested or fired among all those targeted in this campaign.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The second liberal period (Feb.1957-Dec.1957) ===
Same as the second stage of the movement following the ''Tran Dan''`s case, this new stage was characterized by a mixture of official moderate repression and tolerance toward the leaders of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' and their ongoing activities within the public domain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In May, a new literary weekly, ''Van'' ("literature") appeared as the organ of the newly formed Writers` Association. Under the banner of ''Van'' the authors for ''Nhan Van and Giai Pham'' quickly rallied.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Influenced by the end of the Hundred Flowers movement and the onset of the anti-rightist campaign in China during July 1957 in some way, ''Van'', was harshly criticized in an article in ''Hoc Tap'' ("studies"), but such criticism never led to an orchestrated press campaign or forced the writers to be silent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In short, the cultural atmosphere in North Vietnam for most of 1957 was mild and tolerant at least.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== The end of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' (Jan.1958) ===
This above resumed liberalization lasted for almost one year and was finally ended in early 1958. On 6 January 1958 the politburo of the party issued the "Politburo Resolution on Literary Affairs," demanding the expulsion of all "subversive elements" from literary organizations and requiring the education of intellectuals with [[Marxism–Leninism]] and physical labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This resolution was followed by suspension of the publication of Van indefinitely and assigned artists and cultural cadres to a three-stage "struggle class" that involved [[Re-education camp (Vietnam)|re-education]], ideological struggle, and hard labor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A re-education course was organized for nearly 500 writers and artists in January 1958, and from March to April 1958 the LDP Central Committee`s Subcommittee for Arts and Letters organized a "study session" for some 304 writers, poets, and other cultural cadres, each of whom was forced to make a "self-criticism."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the end, four dissenters were expelled from the Union of Arts and Literature and others, such as poets ''Tran Dan'' and ''Le Dat'', were suspended. And 300 of the 476 people reeducated in the same year were writers and artists.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Arrests==
On October 21–23, 1956, a delegation composed of 40 writers and artists discussed the questions of intellectual freedom with such prominent party cadres as [[Trường Chinh]], [[Xuân Thủy]], and [[Tố Hữu]]. Of the intellectuals present, the young poet Lê Đạt expressed particularly sharp criticism of the regime's intolerant cultural policies in general, and of To Huu and Hoai Thanh in particular. Among others, he condemned the imprisonment of the poet [[Trần Dần]], and the harassment to which [[Văn Cao]], a famous poet and composer, had been subjected. On the second day, it was the artists' turn to speak. On the third day, Truong Chinh declared that the intellectuals' complaints were justified, but he instructed the participants not to publish anything about the debate in the press. The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]] of October 23 (and particularly the Soviet invasion of November 4) put an end to North Vietnam's short-lived intellectual "thaw". The editors of ''Nhan Van'' intended to publish a special issue about the Hungarian events, whereupon the authorities banned the paper, and adopted a tougher attitude toward intellectual dissidence.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Szalontai, Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955-56. ''Cold War History'', Vol. 5, Issue 4 (November 2005), pp. 395-426. Downloadable at https://www.academia.edu/6097481/Political_and_Economic_Crisis_in_North_Vietnam_1955_-_56 .&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 1956, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]], having hesitated for two years, finally shut down the organization, closed the office, and arrested key participants. Some were imprisoned and others sent to [[Re-education camp (Vietnam)|re-education camp]] (Vietnamese: trại học tập cải tạo) and others made to undertake [[self-criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam: the politics of bureaucratic socialism - Page 165 Gareth Porter - 1993 "After hesitating for two years to act forcefully, the party closed Nhan Van in 1958, arrested the key group that published it, and compelled hundreds of writers, artists, and intellectuals to take a re-education course and undertake self-criticism regarding their "bourgeois viewpoints. "&lt;/ref&gt; The event was publicised by ''Trăm Hoa Đua Nở Trên Đất Bắc'' (''Hundreds of Flowers Blooming in the North''), published in 1959 by the [[Congress of Cultural Freedom]] in [[Saigon]], and in the West by [[Hoàng Văn Chí]] in ''The New Class in North Vietnam'' (Saigon, 1964).

==Rehabilitation==
After the [[Doi Moi]] reforms in the late 1980s, many of the imprisoned intellectuals were [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitated]].  The government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam recognized many of the writers and poets in the late 1990s and 2000s (decade) with many state awards, often posthumously.

== Significance ==
''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' affair was seems like an interlude of North Vietnamese political history, which did not last so long, but its legacy still impact on current Vietnamese society. It was the first and most formative event in political dissidence under the VCP`s rule, and the issues raised by dissidents in the 1950s remain unchanged. First, ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' is a reference point for those who want political reform, the restoration of intra-party democratization, and greater intellectual freedom. Secondly, although ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' is still sensitive to present Hanoi, it could not be neglect because it continues as a rallying point for those who demand the party reopen the matter and rehabilitate the victims.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Third, this affair also can be a bridge for the new generation of artists and intellectuals to link to their predecessors` past. Finally, how the regime responds to this event, even today, tells much about the state of [[Political Reform|political reform]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Different Interpretations ==

=== Orthodox point of view ===
From the orthodox point of view, Zachary Abuza (2001) considered that the intellectuals in ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' were a group of dissidents who were joined the ''Viet Minh'' out of patriotism, not a love of [[Communism in Vietnam|communism]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Indeed, a South Vietnamese scholar argued that the intellectuals were "encouraged by the hope that they might use the resistance organization to assemble nationalist elements and to create a force which would actually tip the scales against the communists within the ranks of the resistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Talks at the yenan Forum on Literature and Art|last = Nhu Phong|first = |date = May 1943|journal = Mao Zedong, Selected Works, vol.3 (Peking: Honai Foreign Language Publishing House, 1975)|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 69–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the dissent was originated from two disparate ideologies between the intellectuals and ''Viet Minh''.

Another feature of ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' from the orthodox interpretation is its close connection with China. Abuza (2001) stated that both the rectification campaign and the land reform campaign modeled on China, and Chinese logistical support was very necessary to ''Viet Minh'' during 1950s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Yinghong Cheng (2004) insists that ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham''`s connection with China was more obviously than with the Eastern Europe. It was looked upon China as its inspiration, and it went through a saddlelike course which at some points corresponded to the circumstances in China.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Revisionist point of view ===
Different from the orthodox viewpoint which characterizes ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' as a "dissident" movement, the revisionist viewpoint suggests that the standard view of ''Nhan Van-Giai Pham'' fails to appreciate the "reform Communist" character of its agenda. Moreover, when examined within a broader transnational context—one marked by the emergence of loosely connected reformist movements throughout the Communist world in the 1950s inspired by de-Stalinization--''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' comes off as a relatively restrained effort to "save" Vietnamese Communism by transforming it from within.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Peter Zinoman (2001) insisted that the intellectuals were all from late colonial era, during 1950s, some disenchanted intellectuals abandoned ''Viet Minh'' and others for the sake of higher career positions in cultural bureaucracy of DRV chose to become "true believers" to [[Maoism]]. Between the rejectionists and the true believers was a much larger group of Viet Minh intellectuals who came to express their disappointment during ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' period.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On the other hand, this affair has been highly related to global currents of [[reform communism]] after the death of Stalin from mid-1950 by the revisionist historians. Affinities between ''Nhan Van Giai Pham'' and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc]] reform Communism may be found in shared patterns of language and argumentation as well as in a common repertoire of political positions and cultural references. In addition, ''Nhan Van Giai Pham''`s kinship with a moderate version of reform Communism is evident in its leaders` insistent expression of fidelity to the VWP and Marxism–Leninism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Other interpretations ===
Lien-Hang T. Nguyen (2006) stated that neither totally imitated to Chinese models, nor had affinity with Eastern bloc, ''Viet Minh'' was actually intertwined with the deterioration of [[Sino-Soviet relations]] during 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The North Vietnamese intended to maintain a neutral position under the influences from both China and Soviet Union because it could not afford to alienate either Moscow or Beijing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Nevertheless, since the Vietnamese communists were geographically, culturally and historically closer to the Chinese Communist Party, and since Moscow demonstrated further inclination to avoid a confrontation with the United States after 1954 Geneva Accords, the voices within the VWP calling for a Vietnamese move closer to Beijing in its ideological orientation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Therefore, according to this interpretation, although Nhan Van Giai Pham affair was shaped by the current of de-Stalinization and the Hundred Flowers Movement from eastern bloc and China during 1950s, it still tried to find an independent way to deal with such political struggles.

The '''Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries''' ('''OPEC''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|p|ɛ|k}} {{respell|OH|pek}}) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] of {{As of|2018|June|alt=15|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm}} nations, founded in 1960 in [[Baghdad]] by the first five members ([[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Venezuela]]), and headquartered since 1965 in [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]]. {{As of|September 2018|post=,}} the 15 countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of [[List of countries by oil production|global oil production]] and 81.5 percent of [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|the world's "proven" oil reserves]], giving OPEC a major influence on [[price of oil|global oil prices]] that were previously determined by the so called "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]” grouping of multinational oil companies.

The stated mission of the organization is to "coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets, in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/23.htm |title=Our Mission |work=OPEC |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is also a significant provider of information about the international oil market. {{As of|2018|June|alt=The current OPEC members are the following|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm|post=:}} [[Algeria]], [[Angola]], [[Ecuador]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Qatar]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Saudi Arabia]] (the [[de facto]] leader), [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Venezuela]]. [[Indonesia]] is a former member. By continent, two are South American, seven African, and six are Asian (Middle East). Two-thirds of OPEC's oil production and reserves are in its six [[Middle-Eastern]] countries that surround the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]].

The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward [[Nationalization of oil supplies|national sovereignty over natural resources]], and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and [[Petroleum politics|international relations]]. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or [[civil disorders]] lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, [[1970s energy crisis|restrictions in oil production]] led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the [[global economy]]. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting [[Production quota|production targets]] for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.

Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a [[cartel]] that cooperates to reduce [[market competition]], but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of [[Sovereign immunity#International law|state immunity under international law]]. In December 2014, "OPEC and the oil men" ranked as #3 on [[Lloyd's]] list of "the top 100 most influential people in the shipping industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/top100/article453573.ece |title=Top 100 Most Influential People in the Shipping Industry: 3. OPEC and the oil men |work=[[Lloyd's List]] |date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the influence of OPEC on international trade is periodically challenged by the expansion of non-OPEC energy sources, and by the recurring temptation for individual OPEC countries to exceed production targets and pursue conflicting self-interests.

==Membership==
{{clear left}}

=== Current member countries ===
As of June 2018, OPEC has 15 member countries: six in the [[Middle East]] ([[Western Asia]]), seven in [[Africa]], and two in [[South America]]. According to the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA), OPEC's combined rate of oil production (including [[natural-gas condensate|gas condensate]]) represented 44 percent of the world's total in 2016,&lt;ref name="EIA Production"/&gt; and OPEC accounted for 81.5 percent of the world's "proven" oil reserves, including 48 percent from just the six Middle Eastern members:&lt;ref name="EIA Reserves"/&gt;.

Approval of a new member country requires agreement by three-quarters of OPEC's existing members(includes founding members also), including all five of the founders.&lt;ref name=statute/&gt; In October 2015, [[Sudan]] formally submitted an application to join,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article56814 |title=Sudan awaiting decision on its OPEC membership application: minister |work=Sudan Tribune |date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not yet a member.

Qatar intends to leave on 1 January 2019.&lt;ref name="qtrleave"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/03/business/qatar-opec-withdrawal/index.html| title=Qatar is pulling out of OPEC to focus on gas| first=Zahraa| last=Alkhalisi| date=3 December 2018| website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For countries that export petroleum at relatively low volume, their limited negotiating power as OPEC members would not necessarily justify the burdens imposed by OPEC [[production quota]]s and membership costs. [[Ecuador]] withdrew from OPEC in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2&amp;nbsp;million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under its OPEC quota at the time,&lt;ref name=Ecuador/&gt; although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted [[Gabon]] to suspend membership in January 1995;&lt;ref name=Gabon/&gt; it rejoined in July 2016. In May 2008, [[Indonesia]] announced that it would leave OPEC when its membership expired at the end of that year, having become a net importer of oil and being unable to meet its production quota.&lt;ref name=Indonesia/&gt; It rejoined the organization in January 2016,&lt;ref name="OPEC Member"/&gt; but announced another "temporary suspension" of its membership at year-end when OPEC requested a 5 percent production cut.&lt;ref name=LeavingAgain&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting-indonesia-idUSKBN13Q3M7 |title=Net oil importer Indonesia leaves producer club OPEC, again |first1=Fergus |last1=Jensen |first2=Wilda |last2=Asmarini |agency=Reuters |date=1 December 2016 |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators consider that the United States was a [[de facto]] member of OPEC during its formal [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]], due to its leadership of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] in 2003–2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2007/07/go_nopec.html |title=Go NOPEC |first=Timothy |last=Noah |authorlink=Timothy Noah |date=10 July 2007 |work=Slate |accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/09/is_bremer_a_price_fixer.html |title=Is Bremer a Price Fixer?

===Observers===
Since the 1980s, representatives from [[Egypt]], [[Mexico]], [[Norway]], [[Oman]], [[Russia]], and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers. This arrangement serves as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.&lt;ref name=observers/&gt;

===Leadership and decision-making===
[[File:158ava Reunión de países miembros de la OPEP (5251965558).jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|OPEC Conference delegates at [[Swissotel]], [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], December 2010]]
{{See also|List of Secretaries General of OPEC}}
The OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organization, and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries. The chief executive of the organization is the [[List of Secretaries General of OPEC|OPEC Secretary General]]. The Conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary. It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and "one member, one vote", with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget.&lt;ref name=statute&gt;{{cite web |work=OPEC |title=Statute |year=2012 |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/OPEC_Statute.pdf |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most-profitable oil exporter in the world, with enough capacity to function as the traditional [[swing producer]] to balance the global market, it serves as "OPEC's de facto leader".&lt;ref name=FT2015/&gt;

===International cartel===
At various times, OPEC members have displayed apparent anti-competitive [[cartel]] behavior through the organization's agreements about oil production and price levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://fmwww.bc.edu/EC-P/WP318.pdf |title=Is OPEC a Cartel? Evidence from Cointegration and Causality Tests |first=S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;International commodity agreements covering products such as coffee, sugar, tin and more recently oil (OPEC: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) are examples of ''international cartels'' which have publicly entailed agreements between different national governments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OPEC members strongly prefer to describe their organization as a modest force for market stabilization, rather than a powerful anti-competitive cartel. In its defense, the organization was founded as a counterweight against the previous "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]" cartel of multinational oil companies, and non-OPEC energy suppliers have maintained enough market share for a substantial degree of worldwide competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/OB06_072012.pdf |title=The Global Energy Scene |journal=OPEC Bulletin |volume=43 |number=5 |date=June–July 2012 |pages=24–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because of an economic "[[prisoner's dilemma]]" that encourages each member nation individually to discount its price and exceed its production quota,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.wiley.com/college/browning/0471389161/pdf/ |chapterurl=http://www.wiley.com/college/browning/0471389161/pdf/ch14 |chapter=The Prisoner's Dilemma and Cheating by Cartel Members |title=Microeconomics: Theory &amp; Applications |edition=8th |first1=Edgar K. |last1=Browning |first2=Mark A. |last2=Zupan |publisher=Wiley |date=2004 |accessdate=5 September 2016 |isbn=978-0471678717 |pages=394–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; widespread cheating within OPEC often erodes its ability to influence global oil prices through [[Collective action problem|collective action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Colgan |first=Jeff |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/06/16/opec-the-phantom-menace/ |title=OPEC, the Phantom Menace |newspaper=Washington Post |date=16 June 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van de Graaf |first=Thijs |title=Is OPEC dead?

OPEC has not been involved in any disputes related to the competition rules of the [[World Trade Organization]], even though the objectives, actions, and principles of the two organizations diverge considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=Energy Trade and the WTO: Implications for Renewable Energy and the OPEC Cartel|journal=Journal of International Economic Law|date=September 2013|volume=16|issue=3|pages=707–740|ssrn=2330416}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key US District Court decision held that OPEC consultations are protected as "governmental" acts of state by the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]], and are therefore beyond the legal reach of US [[competition law]] governing "commercial" acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Weil |date=25 November 2007 |url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/opec-cartel-illegal/2009/12/12/id/341497 |title=If OPEC Is a Cartel, Why Isn't It Illegal? |work=Newsmax |accessdate=27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Joelson | first1 = Mark R. | last2 = Griffin | first2 = Joseph P. | year = 1975 | title = The Legal Status of Nation-State Cartels Under United States Antitrust and Public International Law | journal = The International Lawyer | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 617–645 | jstor = 40704964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite popular sentiment against OPEC, legislative proposals to limit the organization's sovereign immunity, such as the [[NOPEC]] Act, have so far been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raymond-j-learsy/nopec-no-oil-producing-an_b_1869803.html |title=NOPEC ('No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act'): A Presidential Issue and a Test of Political Integrity |first=Raymond J. |last=Learsy |work=Huffington Post |date=10 September 2012 |quote=Varied forms of a NOPEC bill have been introduced some 16 times since 1999, only to be vehemently resisted by the oil industry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts===
OPEC often has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances.&lt;ref name=MEES/&gt;&lt;ref name=discordant/&gt; Indeed, over the course of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the "[[Resource curse#Political effects|natural resource curse]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/198/40112.html |title=Lifting the Natural Resource Curse |first=Thomas I. |last=Palley |journal=Foreign Service Journal |date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Michael L. |date=May 2015 |title=What Have We Learned about the Resource Curse? |journal=Annual Review of Political Science |volume=18 |pages=239–259 |doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-052213-040359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further complication is that [[Religious war|religion-linked]] [[List of conflicts in the Middle East|conflicts in the Middle East]] are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-middle-easts-conflicts-are-about-religion-15205?page=show |title=The Middle East's Conflicts Are About Religion |first=Oren |last=Kessler| journal=The National Interest |date=13 February 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/defending-the-faith-in-the-middle-east.html |title='Defending the Faith' in the Middle East |first=David |last=Motadel |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 May 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally important conflicts in OPEC's history have included the [[Six-Day War]] (1967), [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973), a [[OPEC siege|hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants]] (1975), the [[Iranian Revolution]] (1979), [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988), [[Gulf War|Iraqi occupation of Kuwait]] (1990–1991), [[September 11 attacks]] by mostly Saudi hijackers (2001), [[American occupation of Iraq]] (2003–2011), [[Conflict in the Niger Delta]] (2004–present), [[Arab Spring]] (2010–2012), [[Libyan Crisis]] (2011–present), and international [[Embargo against Iran]] (2012–2016).

==Market information==
As one area in which OPEC members have been able to cooperate productively over the decades, the organization has significantly improved the quality and quantity of information available about the international oil market. This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.

===Publications and research===
[[File:Jodi-circle-logo.png|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Logo for [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative|JODI]], in which OPEC is a founding member]]
In April 2001, OPEC collaborated with five other international organizations ([[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Eurostat]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], {{ill|Latin American Energy Organization|es|Organización Latinoamericana de Energía|lt=OLADE}}, [[United Nations Statistics Division|UNSD]]) to improve the availability and reliability of oil data. They launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 was joined by [[International Energy Forum|IEF]] and renamed the [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative]] (JODI), covering more than 90 percent of the global oil market. [[Gas Exporting Countries Forum|GECF]] joined as an eighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90 percent of the global market for natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jodidata.org/about-jodi/history.aspx |title=History of the Joint Organisations Data Initiative |work=JODI |accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, OPEC has published the "World Oil Outlook" (WOO) annually, in which it presents a comprehensive analysis of the global oil industry including medium- and long-term projections for supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/publications/340.htm |title=World Oil Outlook |work=OPEC |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPEC also produces an "Annual Statistical Bulletin" (ASB),&lt;ref name=ASB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/publications/202.htm |title=Annual Statistical Bulletin |work=OPEC |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishes more-frequent updates in its "Monthly Oil Market Report" (MOMR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/publications/338.htm |title=Monthly Oil Market Report |work=OPEC |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "OPEC Bulletin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/76.htm |title=OPEC Bulletin |work=OPEC |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crude oil benchmarks===
[[File:Crudes.PNG|thumb|alt=refer to caption|[[Sulfur]] content and [[API gravity]] of different types of crude oil]]
{{See also|Benchmark (crude oil)}}
A "crude oil benchmark" is a standardized [[Petroleum#Classification|petroleum]] product that serves as a convenient reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil, including standardized contracts in major [[futures markets]] since 1983. Benchmarks are used because oil prices differ (usually by a few dollars per barrel) based on variety, grade, delivery date and location, and other legal requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/904748.stm |title=Oil markets explained |publisher=BBC News |date=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/603911468739482147/pdf/multi-page.pdf |title=The new era of petroleum trading: spot-oil, spot-related contracts, and futures markets |first=Hossein |last=Razavi |publisher=The World Bank |date=April 1989 |isbn=0-8213-1199-9 |pages=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OPEC Reference Basket|OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes]] has been an important benchmark for oil prices since 2000. It is calculated as a [[weighted average]] of prices for petroleum blends from the OPEC member countries: Saharan Blend (Algeria), Girassol (Angola), Oriente (Ecuador),&lt;!--New Zafiro? (Equatorial Guinea),--&gt; Rabi Light (Gabon), Iran Heavy (Islamic Republic of Iran), Basra Light (Iraq), Kuwait Export (Kuwait), Es Sider (Libya), Bonny Light (Nigeria), Qatar Marine (Qatar), Arab Light (Saudi Arabia), Murban (UAE), and Merey (Venezuela).&lt;ref name=basket&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/data_graphs/40.htm |title=OPEC Basket Price |work=OPEC |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brent Crude|North Sea Brent Crude Oil]] is the leading benchmark for Atlantic basin crude oils, and is used to price approximately two-thirds of the world's traded crude oil. Other well-known benchmarks are [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI), [[Dubai Crude]], [[DME Oman Crude Oil Futures Contract|Oman Crude]], and [[Urals oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/8429184/Brent-crude-and-other-oil-price-benchmarks.html |title=Brent crude and other oil price benchmarks |agency=Reuters |date=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spare capacity===
The US Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the US Department of Energy, defines spare capacity for crude oil market management "as the volume of production that can be brought on within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days... OPEC spare capacity provides an indicator of the world oil market's ability to respond to potential crises that reduce oil supplies."&lt;ref name="EIA_2014" /&gt;

In November 2014, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that OPEC's "effective" spare capacity, adjusted for ongoing disruptions in countries like Libya and Nigeria, was {{convert|3.5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} and that this number would increase to a peak in 2017 of {{convert|4.6|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Effective' OPEC Spare Capacity: Reality-Based Data |url=http://www.iea.org/media/ieajournal/Issue7_WEB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502040956/http://www.iea.org/media/ieajournal/Issue7_WEB.pdf |deadurl=yes |journal=IEA Energy |issue=7 |page=13 |date=November 2014 |archivedate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2015, the IEA changed its assessment "with OPEC's spare production buffer stretched thin, as Saudi Arabia – which holds the lion's share of excess capacity – and its [Persian] Gulf neighbours pump at near-record rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=3 billion barrel cushion |journal=Oil Market Report |url=https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/reports/2015/1115/ |publisher=International Energy Agency |date=13 November 2015 |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and impact==

===Post-WWII situation===
In 1949, [[Venezuela]] and [[Iran]] took the earliest steps in the direction of OPEC, by inviting [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] to improve communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name="open"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/GenInfo.pdf |title=General Information |date=May 2012 |work=OPEC |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, some of the world's largest [[List of oil fields|oil fields]] were just entering production in the Middle East. The United States had established the [[Interstate Oil Compact Commission]] to join the [[Texas Railroad Commission]] in limiting overproduction. The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; and the world market was dominated by a group of [[multinational companies]] known as the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s original [[Standard Oil]] monopoly. Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and economic power.&lt;ref name="prize" /&gt;

===1959–1960 anger from exporting countries===
In February 1959, as new supplies were becoming available, the multinational oil companies (MOCs) unilaterally reduced their posted prices for Venezuelan and Middle Eastern crude oil by 10 percent. Weeks later, the [[Arab League]]'s first [[Arab Petroleum Congress]] convened in Cairo, Egypt, where the influential journalist [[Wanda Jablonski]] introduced Saudi Arabia's [[Abdullah Tariki]] to Venezuela's observer [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo]], representing the two then-largest oil-producing nations outside the United States and the Soviet Union. Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an "Oil Consultation Commission" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against "[[absentee landlord]]ism" of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence. In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their posted prices for Middle Eastern crude oil.&lt;ref name="open"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |authorlink=Daniel Yergin |title=[[The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power]] |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1991 |isbn=978-0671502485 |pages=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Painter |first=David S. |year=2012 |title= Oil and the American Century |url=http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/24.full.pdf |journal=[[The Journal of American History]] |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=32 |doi=10.1093/jahist/jas073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBvz_YxlB-AC&amp;pg=PA7 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry |first=M.S. |last=Vassiliou |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0810862883 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Opec Gebäude Wien Helferstorferstraße 17.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|OPEC headquarters in Vienna&lt;br&gt;(2009 building)]]
The following month, during 10–14 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, Pérez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], whose country had skipped the 1959 congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8U_sWfvgToQC&amp;pg=PA74 |last=Styan |first=David |title=France and Iraq: Oil, Arms and French Policy Making in the Middle East |publisher=I.B.

In October 1973, the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil [[embargo]] against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumins|first=Lawrence|date=1975|title=Oil and the Economy|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/CurrentHistory-1975nov-00189|journal=Energy Shock|volume=|pages=189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maugeri2006"/&gt; &lt;!-- OPEC raised prices in several steps --&gt;A [[1967 Oil Embargo|previous embargo attempt]] was largely ineffective in response to the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v34/d266 |publisher=US Department of State |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Vol. XXXIV: Energy Diplomacy and Global Issues, Document 266 |date=1999 |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy [[rationing]], intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations,&lt;ref name="Maugeri2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Leonardo |last=Maugeri |title=The Age of Oil: The Mythology, History, and Future of the World's Most Controversial Resource |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWmx5uKA6gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99008-4|pages=112–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute.

The 1973–1974 oil embargo had lasting effects on the United States and other industrialized nations, which established the [[International Energy Agency]] in response, as well as national [[Global strategic petroleum reserves|emergency stockpiles]] designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil [[Energy conservation|conservation]] efforts included lower [[speed limit]]s on highways, smaller and more [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] cars and appliances, year-round [[daylight saving time]], reduced usage of [[HVAC|heating and air-conditioning]], better [[building insulation|insulation]], increased support of [[mass transit]], and greater emphasis on [[coal]], [[natural gas]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and other [[alternative energy]] sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while [[real GDP]] rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil could be used as both a political and economic weapon against other nations, at least in the short term.&lt;ref name="Maugeri2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/energy-crisis |title=Energy Crisis (1970s) |publisher=[[The History Channel]] |year=2010 |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.envirothonpa.org/documents/The1973OilCrisis.pdf |title=The 1973 Oil Crisis |publisher=Pennsylvania Envirothon |first=Sarah |last=Horton |date=October 2000 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.socialismtoday.org/51/opec.html |title=Oil Shock: The role of OPEC |journal=Socialism Today |issue=51 |date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/twilight-the-petrostate-16235?page=show |title=Twilight of the Petrostate |first1=Petr |last1=Aven |first2=Vladimir |last2=Nazarov |first3=Samvel |last3=Lazaryan |journal=The National Interest |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OPEC's [[international aid]] activities date from well before the 1973–1974 oil price surge.

===1975 hostage siege===

{{Main article|OPEC siege}}
On 21 December 1975, Saudi Arabia's [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]], Iran's [[Jamshid Amuzegar]], and the other OPEC oil ministers were taken hostage at their semi-annual conference in [[Vienna, Austria]]. The attack, which killed three non-ministers, was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan militant "[[Carlos the Jackal]]", and which included [[Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann]] and [[Hans-Joachim Klein]]. The self-named "Arm of the Arab Revolution" group declared its goal to be the liberation of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and hold for ransom all eleven attending oil ministers, except for Yamani and Amuzegar who were to be executed.&lt;ref name=jackal/&gt;

Carlos arranged bus and plane travel for his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]], planning to fly eventually to [[Baghdad]], where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President [[Houari Boumédienne]], who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.&lt;ref name=jackal/&gt;

Some time after the attack, Carlos's accomplices revealed that the operation was commanded by [[Wadie Haddad]], a founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] of Libya, itself an OPEC member. Fellow militants [[Bassam Abu Sharif]] and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20&amp;nbsp;million and US$50&amp;nbsp;million from "an Arab president". Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was "diverted en route and lost by the Revolution".&lt;ref name=jackal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/jackal/12.html |title=Carlos the Jackal: Trail of Terror |publisher=truTV |first=Patrick |last=Bellamy |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107125703/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/jackal/12.html |archivedate=7 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t5jtM2faD8C&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Jackal: The Complete Story of the Legendary Terrorist, Carlos the Jackal |first=John |last=Follain |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=1998 |isbn=978-1559704663 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally captured in 1994 and is serving life sentences for at least 16 other murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/carlos-the-jackal-jailed-over-1974-paris-grenade-attack-10816476 |title='Carlos the Jackal' jailed over 1974 Paris grenade attack |first=Gary |last=Anderson |publisher=Sky News |date=28 March 2017 |accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat falling revenue from oil sales, in 1982 Saudi Arabia pressed OPEC for audited national [[production quota]]s in an attempt to limit output and boost prices. When other OPEC nations failed to comply, Saudi Arabia first slashed its own production from 10&amp;nbsp;million barrels daily in 1979–1981 to just one-third of that level in 1985.

Leading up to his August 1990 [[Invasion of Kuwait]], Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] was pushing OPEC to end overproduction and to send oil prices higher, in order to help OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/18/business/iraq-threatens-emirates-and-kuwait-on-oil-glut.html |title=Iraq Threatens Emirates and Kuwait on Oil Glut |first=Youssef M. |last=Ibrahim |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 [[September 11 attacks|Al Qaeda attacks on the US]] and the March 2003 [[US invasion of Iraq]] had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.&lt;ref name=Brent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.quandl.com/DOE/RBRTE |title=Europe Brent Crude Oil Spot Price FOB (DOE) |publisher=Quandl |accessdate=1 January 2016 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995;&lt;ref name=Gabon&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/gabon-plans-to-quit-opec.html |title=Gabon Plans To Quit OPEC |newspaper=The New York Times |date=9 January 1995 |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it rejoined in July 2016.&lt;ref name="OPEC Member"/&gt; Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was not a part of OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.&lt;ref name=ASB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Industry/2010/02/05/Iraq-heads-for-OPEC-clash-over-quota/14451265409498/ |title=Iraq heads for OPEC clash over quota |agency=UPI |date=5 February 2010 |quote=Iraq, a founding member of OPEC, has not had a production quota since 1998, when it was pegged at 1.3 million bpd to allow Saddam Hussein's regime to sell oil for food during U.N. sanctions imposed in 1990...

Lower demand triggered by the 1997–1998 [[Asian financial crisis]] saw the price of oil fall back to 1986 levels. After oil slumped to around US$10/bbl, joint diplomacy achieved a gradual slowing of oil production by OPEC, Mexico and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.energycharter.org/fileadmin/DocumentsMedia/Thematic/Oil_and_Gas_Pricing_2007_en.pdf |title=Putting a Price on Energy |publisher=Energy Charter Secretariat |year=2007 |isbn=9059480465 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After prices slumped again in Nov. 2001, OPEC, Norway, Mexico, Russia, Oman and Angola agreed to cut production on 1 Jan. 2002 for 6 months. OPEC contributed 1.5 million barrels a day (mbpd) to the approximately 2 mbpd of cuts announced.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Naimi |first1=Ali |title=Out of the Desert |date=2016 |publisher=Portfolio Penguin |location=Great Britain |isbn=9780241279250 |pages=201-210,239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) and OPEC held their first joint workshop on energy issues. They have continued to meet regularly since then, "to collectively better understand trends, analysis and viewpoints and advance market transparency and predictability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iea.org/media/ieajournal/Issue7_WEB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502040956/http://www.iea.org/media/ieajournal/Issue7_WEB.pdf |deadurl=yes |date=November 2014 |title=Dialogue replaces OPEC–IEA Mistrust |journal=IEA Energy |issue=7 |page=7 |archivedate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread insurgency and sabotage occurred during the 2003–2008 height of the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)#Sabotage|American occupation of Iraq]], coinciding with rapidly increasing oil demand from [[China]] and [[Commodity market|commodity]]-hungry investors, recurring [[Conflict in the Niger Delta|violence against the Nigerian oil industry]], and dwindling spare capacity as a cushion against [[Peak oil|potential shortages]]. This combination of forces prompted a sharp rise in oil prices to levels far higher than those previously targeted by OPEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simmons |first=Greg |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/12/07/dems-doubt-iraq-progress.html |title=Dems Doubt Iraq Progress |publisher=Fox News |date=7 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7387203.stm |title=Oil price 'may hit $200 a barrel' |publisher=BBC News |date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael W. |last=Masters |title=Testimony |url=http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/_files/052008Masters.pdf |work=[[U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] |date=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price volatility reached an extreme in 2008, as WTI crude oil surged to a record US$147/bbl in July and then plunged back to US$32/bbl in December, during the [[Great Recession|worst global recession since World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-05-09/saudi-arabian-algerian-oil-ministers-see-consumption-increasing-this-year |first1=Robert |last1=Tuttle |first2=Ola |last2=Galal |title=Oil Ministers See Demand Rising |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPEC's annual oil export revenue also set a new record in 2008, estimated around US$1&amp;nbsp;trillion, and reached similar annual rates in 2011–2014 (along with extensive [[petrodollar recycling]] activity) before plunging again.&lt;ref name=EIA2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/regions-topics.cfm?RegionTopicID=OPEC |title=OPEC Revenues Fact Sheet |publisher=US Energy Information Administration |date=15 May 2017 |accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[2011 Libyan Civil War]] and [[Arab Spring]], OPEC started issuing explicit statements to counter "excessive speculation" in oil [[futures markets]], blaming financial speculators for increasing volatility beyond market fundamentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/2071.htm |title=Opening address to the 159th Meeting of the OPEC Conference |work=OPEC |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 production dispute===
[[File:Oil Balance.png|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Countries by net oil exports (2008)]]
The differing economic needs of OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas. Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues.&lt;ref name=owen032010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2010.02.026 |first1=Nick A. |last1=Owen |first2=Oliver R. |last2=Inderwildi |first3=David A. |last3=King |title=The status of conventional world oil reserves: Hype or cause for concern? |date=August 2010 |journal=Energy Policy |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=4743–4749}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/1999News/Statements/SpeechDetail.asp?cIndex=327 |first=Ali |last=Al-Naimi |title=Saudi oil policy: stability with strength |publisher=Saudi Embassy |date=20 October 1999 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426011929/http://www.saudiembassy.net/1999News/Statements/SpeechDetail.asp?cIndex=327 |archivedate=26 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-12/saudi-arabia-s-plan-to-extend-the-age-of-oil |publisher=Bloomberg News |first=Peter |last=Waldman |title=Saudi Arabia's Plan to Extend the Age of Oil |date=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: "The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Frei |date=3 July 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7486705.stm |title=Washington diary: Oil addiction |publisher=BBC |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2008, with oil prices still near US$100/bbl, a production dispute occurred when the Saudis reportedly walked out of a negotiating session where rival members voted to reduce OPEC output. Although Saudi delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously that they would not observe them. ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted one such delegate as saying: "Saudi Arabia will meet the market's demand. We will see what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil.

During 2014–2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, US oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels and approached the world-leading "[[swing producer]]" volumes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, due to the substantial long-term improvement and spread of [[tight oil|shale]] "[[fracking]]" technology in response to the years of record oil prices. These developments led in turn to a plunge in US oil import requirements (moving closer to [[U.S. energy independence|energy independence]]), a record volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]], and a collapse in oil prices that continued into early 2016.&lt;ref name=basketprice/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=13 December 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glut/&gt;

In spite of global oversupply, on 27 November 2014 in Vienna, Saudi Oil Minister [[Ali Al-Naimi]] blocked appeals from poorer OPEC members for production cuts to support prices. Naimi argued that the oil market should be left to rebalance itself competitively at lower price levels, strategically rebuilding OPEC's long-term market share by ending the profitability of high-cost US shale oil production.&lt;ref name=PriceWar&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside OPEC room, Naimi declares price war on US shale oil |agency=Reuters |date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2016 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-opec-meeting-idUKKCN0JB0M420141128}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he explained in an interview:&lt;ref name=MEES&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://oilpro.com/post/9223/mees-interview-saudi-oil-minister-ali-naimi |title=Interview With Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi |journal=[[Middle East Economic Survey]] |volume=57 |issue=51/52 |date=22 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221021005/http://oilpro.com/post/9223/mees-interview-saudi-oil-minister-ali-naimi |archivedate=21 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it reasonable for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while the producer of poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take my share... We want to tell the world that high-efficiency producing countries are the ones that deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist countries... One thing is for sure: Current prices [roughly US$60/bbl] do not support all producers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the organization had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanctions]], hundreds of world leaders at the [[Paris Climate Agreement]] were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and [[Solar power#Economics|solar technologies]] were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016.&lt;ref name=FT2015&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1f84e444-9ceb-11e5-8ce1-f6219b685d74.html |title=OPEC discord fuels further oil price drop |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glut&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |first1=Grant |last1=Smith |first2=Angelina |last2=Rascouet |first3=Wael |last3=Mahdi |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Libya/libya.pdf |title=Country Analysis Brief: Libya |publisher=US Energy Information Administration |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html |title=Despite Climate Concerns, OPEC Plans to Keep Pumping Oil While It Can |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=1148950&amp;menu=yes |title=OPEC ceiling falls in |publisher=Argus Media |date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |title=Iran Says Post-Sanctions Crude Output Boost Won't Hurt Prices |first1=Hashem |last1=Kalantari |first2=Mohammed |last2=Sergie |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.&lt;ref name=basketprice&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |title=OPEC Basket Daily Archives |work=OPEC |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 2016 continued, the oil glut was partially trimmed with significant production offline in the US, Canada, Libya, Nigeria and China, and the basket price gradually rose back into the $40s. OPEC regained a modest percentage of market share, saw the cancellation of many competing drilling projects, maintained the status quo at its June conference, and endorsed "prices at levels that are suitable for both producers and consumers", although many producers were still experiencing serious economic difficulties.&lt;ref name=June2016&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3487.htm |title=OPEC 169th Meeting concludes |work=OPEC |date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/04/opec-is-very-much-alive-as-saudis-learn-to-tread-softly/ |title=OPEC is very much alive as Saudis learn to tread softly |first=Liam |last=Halligan |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-13/china-cuts-oil-output-by-most-in-15-years-coal-production-slows |title=OPEC Has Its Way as China Oil Output Cut by Most in 15 Years |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&amp;p=irol-reportsother |title=North America Rig Count |publisher=Baker Hughes |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017-2018 production cut===
As OPEC members grew weary of a multi-year supply contest with [[diminishing returns]] and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008. Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale sector, Libya, Nigeria, [[#Spare capacity|spare capacity]], and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another "temporary suspension" of its OPEC membership, rather than accepting the organization's requested 5 percent production cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and OPEC in May 2017 decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then.&lt;ref name=LeavingAgain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts |title=OPEC Agrees to Cut Production in Drive to End Record Glut |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |title=OPEC 171st Meeting concludes |work=OPEC |date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |title=The World's Biggest Oil Kingdom Reverses Course |first=Javier |last=Blas |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |title=OPEC agrees on need for output cut |first=Neil |last=Hume |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |title=Russian Energy Minister Says Oil Cuts to Start in January |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=May2017Vienna/&gt; Longtime oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] "described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |title=OPEC Said to Break Bread With Shale in Rare Show of Detente |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''offline private key protocol''' ('''OPKP''') is a [[cryptographic protocol]] to prevent unauthorized access to [[backup|back up]] or [[archive]] data. The protocol results in a [[public key]] that can be used to encrypt data and an [[offline private key]] that can later be used to decrypt that data.

The protocol is based on three rules regarding the key. An offline private key should:
* not be stored with the encrypted data (obviously)
* not be kept by the organisation that physically stores the encrypted data, to ensure privacy
* not be stored at the same system as the original data, to avoid the possibility that theft of only the private key would give access to all data at the storage provider; and to avoid that when the key would be needed to restore a backup, the key would be lost together with the data loss that made the restore necessary in the first place

To comply with these rules, the offline private key protocol uses a method of asymmetric [[Key Wrap|key wrapping]].

== Security  ==

As the protocol does not provide rules on the strength of the encryption methods and keys to be used, the security of the protocol depends on the actual cryptographic implementation. When used in combination with [[strong encryption]] methods, the protocol can provide extreme security.

== Operation  ==

Initially:
# a client program (program) on a system (local system) with data to back up or archive generates a random private key PRIV
# program creates a public key PUB based on PRIV
# program stores PUB on the local system 
# program presents PRIV to user who can store the key, e.g. printed as a [[trusted paper key]], or on a memory card
# program destroys PRIV on the local system

When archiving or creating a backup, for each session or file:
# program generates a one-time random key OTRK
# program encrypts data using OTRK and a [[symmetric encryption]] method
# program encrypts the (optionally [[Padding (cryptography)|padded]]) key OTRK using PUB to OTRKCR
# program stores the OTRKCR and the encrypted data to a server
# program destroys OTRK on the local system
# program destroys OTRKCR on the local system
# the server stores OTRKCR and stores the encrypted data

To restore backed up or archived data:
# user feeds PRIV into program
# program downloads data with the respective OTRKCR
# program decrypts OTRKCR using PRIV, giving OTRK
# program decrypts data using OTRK
# program destroys PRIV on the local system

An '''organizational ombudsman''' is a designated neutral or impartial dispute resolution practitioner whose major function is to provide independent, impartial, confidential and informal assistance to managers and employees, clients and/or other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] of a [[corporation]], [[university]], non-governmental organization, governmental agency or other entity.  As an independent and neutral employee, the organizational [[ombudsman]] ideally should have no other role or duties. This is in order to maintain independence and neutrality, and to prevent real or perceived conflicts of interest.

Using an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) sensibility, an organizational ombudsman provides options for people with concerns, including  [[whistleblower]]s, who seek to bring their concerns forward safely and effectively.  Additionally, an organizational ombudsman offers coaching on [[ethics]] and other management issues, provides [[mediation]] to facilitate conflict resolution, helps enable safe upward feedback, assists those who feel [[Harassment|harassed]] and [[Discrimination|discriminated]] against. Overall, the organizational ombudsman helps employees and managers navigate [[bureaucracy]] and deal with concerns and complaints.

The organizational ombudsman role has evolved from at least two sources:  a) an evolution from the concept of the 'classical' ombudsman and b) a spontaneous creation and re-invention{{spaced ndash}}of the idea of an internal, neutral conflict resolver{{spaced ndash}}often by senior managers who had never heard of the classical model.

Evolution from the classical model: the classical ombudsman appeared in [[Sweden]] in the early 19th century as an independent high-level public official responsible to the [[Parliament of Sweden|parliament]] or legislature and appointed by constitutional or legislative provisions to monitor the administrative activities of government. This model has been copied and also adapted in many ways in many countries and milieus.

The spontaneous creation model: the organizational ombudsman role has also been regularly "re-invented" by employers who did not know of the classical ombudsman but valued the importance of a senior manager who is a neutral, independent, confidential and informal problem-solver and systems change agent. Examples appeared in the 1920s in the US and probably appeared here and there in many cultures. In many organizations the organizational ombudsman is seen as part of a [[complaint system]] or link to a [[complaint system]], but the office is intended to function, and to appear to function, independently from all regular line and [[staff management]]{{spaced ndash}}and to report to the CEO or Board of Directors. 

The concept has been widely implemented, and has been spread around the globe, with many  corporations, universities, government and non-government entities establishing organizational ombudsman programs.

==Impartial third party role==

Currently, the role is considered by some as a hallmark of an ethical organization and a key component of an integrated [[dispute resolution]] system, or [[complaint system]].   Sometimes referred to as the ultimate 'inside-outsider', an organizational Ombudsman adheres to professional standards strictly governing their confidentiality and neutrality.  By virtue of their protected and highly placed internal role (e.g., reporting to a board of directors rather than to line or staff management), they can be particularly effective at working long-term with management to help effect change in policies, procedures, systems or structures that are problematic for employees or inefficient for the organization.

==Associations and professional standards==

The [[International Ombudsman Institute]] supports ombudsmen institutions to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
 |url=http://www.theioi.com/the-i-o-i/about-the-i-o-i
 |title=About the I.O.I.
 |publisher=International Ombudsman Institute
 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The umbrella professional association for organizational ombudsmen is the [[International Ombudsman Association]], which provides training and establishes standards of practice.  Other non-profit [[think tank]]s, such as the [[Institute for Collaborative Engagement]], have strongly supported the work and growth of the profession, as has the [[American Bar Association]], through its support of standards and guidelines to establish organizational ombudsman offices.

==Specific examples==
Universities appoint ombudsmen to handle student and staff complaints and grievances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miami.edu/sa/index.php/ombudsperson/ Retrieved 2013-10-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ombudsman.cornell.edu/ Retrieved 2009-11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations and businesses contract or hire an ombudsman to enable businesses and organizations to realize their goals. Some practitioners are certified mediators from organizations such as The Center for Dispute Resolution. Other practitioners have received a masters or Ph.D. in programs such as Mediation and Conflict Studies. In this case study involving a home services organization,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resologics.com/impact-studies/2015/9/1/impact-study-home-services-organization&lt;/ref&gt; the organization used an Ombuds Office for monitoring, reporting, conflict resolution and engagement. Team coaching tools were deployed as well. In a case study involving a manufacturing business,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resologics.com/impact-studies/2014/10/29/impact-study-manufacturing&lt;/ref&gt; the role of the ombudsperson included mediation, coaching individuals within the team, coaching with leadership to discover overall goals, team diagnostic assessments, ongoing team coaching centered on organizational culture, communications, team agreements, etc., and finally, training in conflict awareness.

'''Sir Paul Collier''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CBE|FBA}} (born 23 April 1949) is professor of economics and public policy in the [[Blavatnik School of Government]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He is also a director of the [[International Growth Centre]], the director of the [[Centre for the Study of African Economies]], and a fellow of [[St Antony's College, Oxford]].

==Early life and education==
Collier was born on 23 April 1949.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{Citation | title = Birthdays | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | pages = 33 | date = 23 April 2014 | accessdate = 23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in [[Sheffield]] where he attended [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|King Edward VII School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward |first=Nick |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/It39s-hats-off-to-a.4326660.jp |title=It's hats off to a master of art! |publisher=The [[Sheffield Star]] |date= |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
From 1998 until 2003 he was the director of the Development Research Group of the [[World Bank]]. In 2010 and 2011, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine on its [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|list of top global thinkers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,39#thinker56 December 2011 [[Foreign Policy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,28&lt;/ref&gt; Collier currently serves on the advisory board of [[Academics Stand Against Poverty]] (ASAP).

Collier is a specialist in the political, economic and developmental predicaments of poor countries.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9581576 |title=How to help the poorest: Springing the traps |accessdate=7 August 2007 |format= |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a Distinction Award from the University of Oxford, and in 1988 he was awarded the ''Edgar Graham Book Prize'' for the co-written ''Labour and poverty in rural [[Tanzania]]: [[Ujamaa]] and rural development in the United Republic of Tanzania''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=2890|title=IUB Libraries: Edgar Graham Book Prize (African Studies)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Bottom Billion]]: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It'' ({{ISBN|0-19-531145-0}}), has been compared&lt;ref name=economist /&gt; to [[Jeffrey Sachs]]'s ''[[The End of Poverty]]'' and [[William Easterly]]'s ''The White Man's Burden'', two influential books, which like Collier's book, discuss the pros and cons of [[development aid]] to developing countries.

His 2010 book ''The Plundered Planet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7298/full/465550a.html|title=Empowerment is key|first=Iqbal|last=Quadir|date=1 June 2010|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=465|issue=7298|pages=550–551|doi=10.1038/465550a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/16/plundered-planet-paul-collier-book-review|title=The Plundered Planet: How to Reconcile Prosperity with Nature by Paul Collier|author=Alex Renton|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/08/plundered-planet-paul-collier-review | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=The Plundered Planet: How to Reconcile Prosperity with Nature by Paul Collier | first=John | last=Vidal | date=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/53359098-7a61-11df-9cd7-00144feabdc0.html|title=The Plundered Planet|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/329/5994/904|title=SUSTAINABILITY AND SOURCES OF WEALTH|date=20 August 2010|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=329|issue=5994 |page=904|doi=10.1126/science.1193025}}&lt;/ref&gt; is encapsulated in his formulas:
::Nature – Technology + Regulation = Starvation
::Nature + Technology – Regulation = Plunder
::Nature + Technology + Regulation ([[Good governance]]) = Prosperity

The book describes itself as an attempt at a middle way between the [[extremism]] of "Ostriches" ([[denialism]], particularly [[climate change denial]]) and "Environmental Romanticism" (for example, anti-[[genetically modified organisms]] movements in Europe).  The book is about [[sustainable management]] in relation with the geo-[[politics of global warming]], with an attempt to avoid a global [[tragedy of the commons]], with the prime example of [[overfishing]].  In it he builds upon a legacy of the economic psychology of [[greed and fear]], from early [[Utilitarianism]] ([[Jeremy Bentham]]) to more recently the [[Stern Review]].

He is a patron of the [[Media Legal Defence Initiative]].

Currently he is working on a book called ''State of War'', in which he "sets out why [he thinks] democracy has gone wrong in the bottom billion and what would be needed to put it on track."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miguel|first=Edward|title=Africa's Turn?|date=2009|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-01289-8|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research topics ===
* Governance in low-income countries, especially the [[political economy]] of democracy
* Economic growth in Africa
* Economics of civil war, aid, [[globalisation]] and poverty
* The [[greed versus grievance|greed vs grievance]] debate in international relations

==Honours==
Collier was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2008 Birthday Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=58729 |date=14 June 2008 |page=7 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to promoting research and policy change in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=60728 |supp=y|page=1|date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Collier was awarded the [[President's Medal (British Academy)|President's Medal]] by the [[British Academy]], for "his pioneering contribution in bringing ideas from research in to policy within the field of African economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Academy President’s Medal awarded to Paul Collier|url=https://www.socsci.ox.ac.uk/news/british-academy-president2019s-medal-awarded-to-paul-collier|website=Social Sciences Division|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, Collier was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections to the British Academy celebrate the diversity of UK research|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/elections-british-academy-celebrate-diversity-uk-research|website=British Academy|accessdate=29 July 2017|date=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19615">'''''Plebiscito.eu''''', originally known as '''Plebiscite 2013''' ({{lang-it|Plebiscito 2013}}, '''P2013'''), is a supposedly cross-party nonpartisan committee that campaigns for the independence of [[Veneto]] from [[Italy]]. Its main leaders have been [[Lodovico Pizzati]], a former secretary of [[Venetian Independence]] (IV), one of the most active [[Venetian nationalism|Venetist]]-[[separatism|separatist]] parties so far, and [[Gianluca Busato]], who came to regional prominence in March 2014 as the main organiser of the ''[[Venetian independence referendum, 2014|plebiscito]]'', an online referendum on independence.

==History==

===Background and formation===

The committee is part of a [[Venetian nationalism#Recent developments|long-time effort]] started in November 2012 with the endorsement by the [[Regional Council of Veneto]] of resolution 44/2012 on the self-determination of the Venetian people through a referendum. In April 2013 [[Stefano Valdegamberi]], a regional councillor of the [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre]] and later of [[Popular Future]], introduced a bill (342/2013) in order to call a referendum on independence by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?n=80&amp;p=84&amp;c=5&amp;e=88&amp;t=0&amp;idNotizia=23517 |title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto - Sala stampa |publisher=Consiglioveneto.it |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://indipendenzaveneta.net/progetto-di-legge-342/ |title=Progetto di legge 342 |publisher=Indipendenza Veneta |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://indipendenzaveneta.net/valdegamberi-e-lanzarin-sullindipendenza-del-veneto/ |title=Valdegamberi e Lanzarin sull’indipendenza del Veneto |publisher=Indipendenza Veneta |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordesteuropa.it/stories/home_venezie_post/14598_referendum_sullindipendenza_via_alliter_grazie_a_valdegamberi/ |title=Venezie Post |publisher=Nordesteuropa.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://indipendenzaveneta.net/valdegamberi-protocolla-progetto-indipendentista/ |title=Valdegamberi protocolla progetto indipendentista |publisher=Indipendenza Veneta |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 7 June the bill was endorsed by more than 15 regional councillors, sufficient to convene a special session of the Council on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/politica/2013/7-giugno-2013/consiglio-straordinario-bis-l-indipendenza-veneta-2221525010996.shtml |title=Consiglio straordinario bis per l’indipendenza veneta - Corriere del Veneto |publisher=Corrieredelveneto.corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://indipendenzaveneta.net/il-consiglio-straordinario-si-fara-il-27-giugno/ |title=IL CONSIGLIO STRAORDINARIO SI FARA’ IL 27 GIUGNO |publisher=Indipendenza Veneta |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also several municipal councils endorsed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plebiscito2013.eu/about-us/legge-referendaria-per-lindipendenza-del-veneto/ |title=Legge referendaria per l’indipendenza del Veneto &amp;#124; Plebiscito2013 |publisher=Plebiscito2013.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 Pizzati formed a joint separatist cartel with Valdegamberi of Popular Future (FP), [[Antonio Guadagnini]] of [[Veneto State]] (VS), [[Fabrizio Comencini]] of [[Liga Veneta Repubblica]] (LVR), other Venetist groups, associations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mattinopadova.gelocal.it/regione/2013/06/26/news/cartello-indipendentista-per-il-referendum-1.7325499 |title=Cartello indipendentista per il referendum - Regione - Il Mattino di Padova |publisher=Mattinopadova.gelocal.it |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, on 7 July, Pizzati launched P2013, which has since been endorsed by politicians from different parties, activists, intellectuals, professionals and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plebiscito2013.eu/about-us/ |title=Chi siamo &amp;#124; Plebiscito2013 |publisher=Plebiscito2013.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plebiscito2013.eu/blog/category/testimonial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717063715/http://plebiscito2013.eu/blog/category/testimonial/ |archivedate=July 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindipendenza.com/referendum-veneto-raggiunte-20-firme-per-convocare-il-consiglio-regionale/ |title=Referendum Veneto: raggiunte 20 firme per convocare il Consiglio regionale &amp;#124; L'Indipendenza Nuova |publisher=Lindipendenza.com |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They notably included [[Franco Rocchetta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plebiscito2013.eu/franco-rocchetta-testimonial-di-plebiscito2013-eu-la-repubblica-veneta-del-xxi-secolo/ |title=Franco Rocchetta testimonial di Plebiscito2013.eu: "La Repubblica Veneta del XXI secolo" &amp;#124; Plebiscito2013 |publisher=Plebiscito2013.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; founder and early leader of [[Liga Veneta]] (and former federal president of [[Lega Nord]]), who returned to active politics after virtually 20 years of absence from the political scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lintraprendente.it/2014/03/il-veneto-urla-indipendenza-ce-il-quorum-ce-il-si/ |title=Il Veneto urla “indipendenza”.

The birth of P2013 caused a rift within IV as some members, led by president [[Luca Azzano Cantarutti]], rejected Pizzati's initiative and formed [[Let Veneto Decide]], which was endorsed by Valdegamberi, VS, LVR, ''[[Raixe Venete]]'', [[Veneto First]], [[Independentist Youth]], other Venetist groups and individuals (see [[Venetian Independence#Plebiscite 2013 vs. Let Veneto Decide|article]]).

In October P2013 launched [[Veneto Business]], a platform for separatist entrepreneurs, in partnership with [[Business for Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plebiscito2013.eu/veneto-business-si-presenta-in-anteprima-questa-sera-a-chiampo-vi/ |title=Veneto Business si presenta in anteprima questa sera a Chiampo (VI) &amp;#124; Plebiscito2013 |publisher=Plebiscito2013.eu |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://venetobusiness.com/cose-veneto-business/ |title=COS’E’ VENETO BUSINESS &amp;#124; Piattaforma internazionale per imprenditori veneti |publisher=Venetobusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227124513/http://venetobusiness.com/cose-veneto-business/ |archivedate=2015-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://venetobusiness.com/dichiarazione-di-veneto-business/ |title=Dichiarazione di Veneto Business &amp;#124; Piattaforma internazionale per imprenditori veneti |publisher=Venetobusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227125602/http://venetobusiness.com/dichiarazione-di-veneto-business/ |archivedate=2015-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online referendum on independence===
{{main|Venetian independence referendum, 2014}}
In November P2013 launched ''Plebiscito.eu'', an online referendum to be held in each and every municipality of Veneto on 16 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plebiscito2013.eu/il-plebiscito-digitale-segue-il-metodo-bertolissi-per-dare-la-voce-ai-cittadini-veneti/ |title=IL PLEBISCITO DIGITALE SEGUE IL “METODO BERTOLISSI” PER DARE LA VOCE AI CITTADINI VENETI &amp;#124; Plebiscito2013 |publisher=Plebiscito2013.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plebiscito2013.eu/il-plebiscito-digitale-si-terra-il-16-febbraio-in-tutto-il-veneto/ |title=IL PLEBISCITO DIGITALE SI TERRÀ IL 16 FEBBRAIO IN TUTTO IL VENETO &amp;#124; Plebiscito2013 |publisher=Plebiscito2013.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership of the initiative was taken by [[Gianluca Busato]], a software entrepreneur and long-time Venetist activist, whose firm powered the digital consultation.&lt;ref name="corrieredelveneto.corriere.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/politica/2014/18-marzo-2014/indipendenza-700-mila-voti-scontro-referendum-digitale-2224227569852.shtml |title=ŤIndipendenza, 700 mila votiť Scontro sul referendum digitale - Corriere del Veneto |publisher=Corrieredelveneto.corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.panorama.it/politica/referendum-indipendenza-veneto |title=Il Veneto e il referendum per l'indipendenza (come la Crimea) &amp;#124; Panorama |publisher=News.panorama.it |date=2014-03-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote, with no official recognition, was later postponed and took place from 16 to 21 March 2014.&lt;ref name="corrieredelveneto.corriere.it"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plebiscito2013.eu/indetto-il-plebiscito-per-lindipendenza-del-veneto-dal-16-marzo-al-21-marzo-2014/ |title=INDETTO IL PLEBISCITO PER L’INDIPENDENZA DEL VENETO DAL 16 MARZO AL 21 MARZO 2014 &amp;#124; Plebiscito2013 |publisher=Plebiscito2013.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26604044 |title=BBC News - Venice votes on splitting from Rome |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-03-16 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4036461.ece |title=Venetians vote to say arrivederci to Italy |publisher=The Times |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Plebiscito.eu'''s staff, 2.36 million Venetians (63.2% of all eligible voters) participated in the online referendum and 89.1% of them (that is to say 56.6% of all eligible voters) voted yes.&lt;ref name="Plebiscito.eu-results"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blog.plebiscito.eu/news/referendum-di-indipendenza-del-veneto-i-risultati/ |title=REFERENDUM DI INDIPENDENZA DEL VENETO: I RISULTATI &amp;#124; Repubblica Veneta, federale, indipendente, libera e sovrana |publisher=Blog.plebiscito.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RischioCalcolato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rischiocalcolato.it/2014/03/veneto-libero-indipendente-nato-in-europa-leuro-problema-italiano.html |title=Veneto Libero, Indipendente (nella Nato in Europa e con l'Euro Il Problema è lo STATO ITALIANO) - Rischio Calcolato |publisher=Rischiocalcolato.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was enough for P2013 to proclaim Veneto's independence from Italy in [[Treviso]] on the night of 21 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/referendum-indipendenza-veneto-due-milioni-a-favore-a827fd1d-99d4-4b23-836c-c653559cc797.html |title=Referendum indipendenza Veneto: 2 milioni di sì - Rai News |publisher=Rainews.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/politica/2014/21-marzo-2014/referendum-19-milioni-votanti-questa-sera-tutti-piazza-treviso-2224246432447.shtml |title=In mille dichiarano l’indipendenza ŤOra Zaia puň solo inseguirciť - Corriere del Veneto |publisher=Corrieredelveneto.corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10715888/Veneto-residents-support-leaving-Italy-in-unofficial-referendum.html |title=Veneto residents support leaving Italy in unofficial referendum |publisher=Telegraph |date=2014-03-21 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Hannah |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2586531/Venice-votes-split-Italy-89-citys-residents-opt-form-new-independent-state.html |title=Venice votes to split from Italy as 89% of the city's residents opt to form a new independent state &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poll, ten "delegates for independence" were elected too: [[Gianluca Busato]] was the preferred candidate with 135,306 votes, followed by [[Stefano Vescovi]] (48,320), [[Selena Veronese]] (46,947), [[Silvia Gandin]] (43,025), [[Lodovico Pizzati]] (25,731), [[Gianfranco Favaro]] (16,670), [[Raffaele Serafini]] (16,627), [[Manuel Carraro]] (16,627), [[Gianluca Panto]] (16,321) and [[Paolo Bernardini]] (16,299). Finally, voters were asked to express their opinion on three "foreign policy issues", where Veneto to become independent: adoption of the [[Euro]] (supported by 51.4% of voters), accession to [[European Union]] membership (supported by 55.7% of voters) and accession to [[NATO]] membership (supported by 64.5% of voters); turnout was however much lower for these three questions (24.6%, 22.3% and 19.8%, respectively).&lt;ref name="Plebiscito.eu-results"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RischioCalcolato"/&gt;

The reliability of these results was contested by a number of analysts, while some pollsters confirmed Venetians' support of independence (see [[Venetian independence referendum, 2014#Turnout and results|here]]).

===Aftermath of the referendum===
The day after the referendum, Busato announced that the separatist process generated by the referendum was to be led by [[Veneto Yes]], which would be transformed "from committee for yes to independence to a political organisation which will defend the results obtained with the declaration of independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venetosi.org/a-tutto-campo/ |title=A TUTTO CAMPO &amp;#124; Veneto Sì, a difesa dell'indipendenza della Repubblica Veneta |publisher=Venetosi.org |date=2014-03-22 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgazzettino.it/NORDEST/PRIMOPIANO/veneto_s_amp_igrave_partito_referendum_veneto_beppe_grillo_indipendenza/notizie/589333.shtml |title=Dopo il referendum, nasce il partito |publisher=Ilgazzettino.it |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P2013, whose goal was reached, was basically supplanted by ''Plebiscito.eu'', engaged in the "structuring of the Venetian Republic", and Veneto Yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venetosi.org/veneto-si-a-difesa-dellindipendenza-della-repubblica-veneta/ |title=Veneto Sì, a difesa dell’indipendenza della Repubblica Veneta &amp;#124; Veneto Sì, a difesa dell'indipendenza della Repubblica Veneta |publisher=Venetosi.org |date=2014-04-19 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venetosi.org/veneto-si-tutti-riconoscano-lindipendenza-della-repubblica-veneta/ |title=VENETO SÌ: TUTTI RICONOSCANO L’INDIPENDENZA DELLA REPUBBLICA VENETA &amp;#124; Veneto Sì, a difesa dell'indipendenza della Repubblica Veneta |publisher=Venetosi.org |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Plebiscito.eu'', the self-proclaimed "Venetian Republic" has two "legitimate organs": the "Delegation of Ten",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.plebiscito.eu/repubblica-veneta/delegazione-dei-10/ |title=DELEGAZIONE DEI 10 &amp;#124; Repubblica Veneta, federale, indipendente, libera e sovrana |publisher=Plebiscito.eu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising the aforementioned elects, and the "Treasury".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.plebiscito.eu/repubblica-veneta/tesoreria-2/ |title=TESORERIA &amp;#124; Repubblica Veneta, federale, indipendente, libera e sovrana |publisher=Plebiscito.eu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was established with the self-styled "Decree 2/2014 of the Venetian Republic", issued by the Delegation of Ten on 22 April, and was initially composed by [[Cristiano Zanin]] (treasurer), [[Stefano Venturato]] (counselor), [[Gianfranco Favaro]] (counselor) and [[Lodovico Pizzati]] (consultant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.plebiscito.eu/repubblica-veneta/delegazione-dei-10/tesoreria/ |title=ISTITUZIONE DELLA TESORERIA DELLA REPUBBLICA VENETA &amp;#124; Repubblica Veneta, federale, indipendente, libera e sovrana |publisher=Plebiscito.eu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 ''Plebiscito.eu'' and the "Venetian Republic" experienced an internal reshuffle, which brought to the abandonment of leading roles by several founding members of the committee, notably including Pizzati, Zanin, [[Gianluca Panto]], [[Manuel Carraro]] and [[Giovanni Dalla-Valle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.plebiscito.eu/repubblica-veneta/presidente/tesoreria-della-repubblica-veneta/ |title=TESORERIA DELLA REPUBBLICA VENETA &amp;#124; Repubblica Veneta, federale, indipendente, libera e sovrana |publisher=Plebiscito.eu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://republicaveneta.com/due-nuovi-delegati-fanno-il-loro-ingresso-nella-delegazione-dei-dieci/ |title=DUE NUOVI DELEGATI FANNO IL LORO INGRESSO NELLA DELEGAZIONE DEI DIECI &amp;#124; Republica Veneta - Venetian Republic - Repubblica Veneta |publisher=Republica Veneta |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://republicaveneta.com/mario-sandrin-entra-nella-delegazione-dei-dieci/ |title=MARIO SANDRIN ENTRA NELLA DELEGAZIONE DEI DIECI &amp;#124; Republica Veneta - Venetian Republic - Repubblica Veneta |publisher=Republica Veneta |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, along with [[Franco Rocchetta]] and [[Andrea Arman]], distanced from the Venetist organisation over disagreements with the Delegation of Ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miglioverde.eu/rocchetta-arman-e-della-valle-puntano-il-dito-contro-plebiscito-eu/ |title=Maretta Totale In Plebiscito.Eu.

In March 2015 ''Plebiscito.eu'' organised an "election of the Provisional Parliament of the Venetian Republic".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plebiscito.eu/repubblica-veneta/delegazione-dei-10/legge-elettorale-per-lelezione-del-parlamento-provvisorio-della-repubblica-veneta/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vicenzapiu.com/leggi/plebiscitoeu-parlamento-e-governo-provvisori-della-repubblica-veneta-il-1520-marzo-2015-elezioni&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of the elects were VS members.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.plebiscito.eu/parlamento-veneto-i-risultati-delle-elezioni-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was brought against iGate Mastech for placing an advertisement for thirty computer programmers in 2006 "that expressly favored H-1B visa holders to the exclusion of [[US citizen]]s, lawful permanent citizens and other legal US workers" according to the [[US Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/02/h1_b_discrimination_doj_fine/ DoJ beats up tech firm for H-1B only job ads | The Register&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Robert Hamilton Bruce Lockhart''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] (2 September 1887 – 27 February 1970) was a British diplomat (Moscow, [[Prague]]), journalist, author, [[secret agent]] and [[association football|footballer]]. His 1932 book, ''Memoirs of a British Agent'',&lt;ref name="Memoirs1932"/&gt; became an international best-seller, and brought him to the world's attention. It tells of his failed effort to sabotage the Bolshevik revolution in Moscow in 1918; his co-conspirators were double agents working for the Bolsheviks.  In the end the "Lockhart Plot", was a cunning `sting' deliberately manufactured and controlled by Soviet master spy [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] with the goal of discrediting the British and French governments.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Debo, "Lockhart Plot or Dzerhinskii Plot?." ''Journal of Modern History'' 43.3 (1971): 413-439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Long, "Plot and counter‐plot in revolutionary Russia: Chronicling the Bruce Lockhart conspiracy, 1918." ''Intelligence and National Security'' 10.1 (1995): 122-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
He was born in [[Anstruther]], Fife, the son of Robert Bruce Lockhart, the first headmaster of [[Spier's School]], Beith, Ayrshire, Scotland. His mother was Florence Stuart Macgregor, while his other ancestors include Bruces, Hamiltons, Cummings, Wallaces and Douglases. He claimed he could trace a connection back to [[Alexander Boswell (judge)|Boswell of Auchinleck]]. In ''Memoirs of a British Agent'', he wrote, ''"There is no drop of English blood in my veins."'' He attended [[Fettes College]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lockhart|first1=Robert Bruce|title=My Scottish Youth|date=1993|publisher=B&amp;W Publishing|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1 873631 26 X|pages=313–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family were mostly schoolmasters, but his younger brother [[Rob Lockhart|Rob McGregor MacDonald Lockhart]] became an Indian Army general. His brother [[John Bruce Lockhart|John Harold Bruce Lockhart]] was the headmaster of [[Sedbergh School]], while his nephews [[Rab Bruce Lockhart]] and [[Logie Bruce Lockhart]] went on to become headmasters of [[Loretto School|Loretto]] and [[Gresham's School|Gresham's]]. His great-nephew, Simon Bruce-Lockhart, was headmaster of [[Glenlyon Norfolk School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lundy|first=Darryl|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p19821.htm#i198210|title=John Harold Bruce-Lockhart profile|publisher=www.thepeerage.com}} (and other linked pages)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;

==Career==
===Malaya===
At age 21, he went out to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] to join two uncles who were rubber [[plantation economy|planters]] there. According to his own account, he was sent to open up a new rubber estate near [[Pantai]] in Negeri Sembilan, in a district where "there were no other white men". He then "caused a minor sensation by carrying off Amai, the beautiful ward of the Dato' Klana, the local Malay prince… my first romance". However, three years in Malaya, and one with Amai, came to an end when "…doctors pronounced Malaria, but there were many people who said that I had been poisoned". One of his uncles and one of his cousins "bundled my emaciated body into a motor car and… packed me off home via Japan and America". The Dato' Klana in question was the [[undang|chief]] of [[Sungei Ujong]], the most important of the Nine States of Negeri Sembilan, whose palace was at [[Ampangan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Lockhart, R. H., ''Return to Malaya'' (London: Putnam), 1936, pp. 4–5, 195, 211 &amp; 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Moscow posting===
Bruce Lockhart next joined the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Service]] and was posted to Moscow as Vice-Consul. At the time of his arrival in Russia, people had heard that a great footballer named Lockhart from Cambridge was arriving, and he was invited to turn out for Morozov a textile factory team that played their games 30 miles east of Moscow – the manager of the cotton mill was from Lancashire, England. Bruce Lockhart played for most of the 1912 season and his team won the Moscow league championship that year. The gold medal he won is in the collection of the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="BBCSport"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moffat|first=Colin|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4764284.stm|title=BBC SPORT: "O'Connor not first Scot in Moscow"|publisher=BBC News|date=8 March 2006|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great player however was Robert's brother, John, who had played rugby union for Scotland, and by his own admission Robert barely deserved his place in the team and played simply for the love of the sport.&lt;ref name="Memoirs1932"/&gt;

Bruce Lockhart was British Consul-General in Moscow when the [[February Revolution|first Russian Revolution]] broke out in early 1917, but left shortly before the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of October that year.

===Return Mission to Moscow===
He soon returned to Russia at the behest of Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[Lord Milner]] as the United Kingdom's first envoy to the Bolsheviks (Russia) in January 1918 in an attempt to counteract German influence. [[Moura Budberg]], the widow of a high-ranking Czarist diplomat Count Johann von Benckendorff, became his mistress.&lt;ref name="Memoirs1932"&gt;Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, ''Memoirs of a British Agent''; first published 1932 by Macmillan (January 1975); {{ISBN|0-333-17329-5}}/{{ISBN|978-0-333-17329-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockhart, on his return, was also working for the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and had been given £648 worth of diamonds to fund the creation of an agent network in Russia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Later, Bruce Lockhart spoke out for [[Arthur Ransome]], saying he had been a valuable intelligence asset amid the worst chaos of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4306595.stm|title=How MI5 watched children's author|publisher=BBC News|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the chaos worsened in Russia and purges took hold among the Bolshevik leaders, Lockhart provided assistance to bring Trotsky's secretary, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina, to England; she later married Ransome.&lt;ref name="Memoirs1932"/&gt;

===Arrest and imprisonment===
In 1918, Bruce Lockhart and fellow British agent, [[Sidney Reilly]], were dramatically alleged to have plotted to assassinate [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Lockhart and British officials condemned this as Soviet propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Mike|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12785695|title=Did Britain try to assassinate Lenin?|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=19 March 2011|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of plotting against the Bolshevik regime and, for a time during 1918, was confined in the [[Kremlin]] as a prisoner and feared being condemned to death. However, he escaped trial in an exchange of "[[espionage|secret agents]]" for the Russian diplomat [[Maksim Maksimovich Litvinov]]. He later wrote about his experiences in his 1932 autobiographical book, ''[[Memoirs of a British Agent]]'', which became an instant worldwide hit, and was made into the 1934 film, ''[[British Agent]]'', by [[Warner Brothers]].

Lockhart was tried [[in absentia]] before the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal in a proceeding which opened November 25, 1918.&lt;ref name=Service164&gt;Robert Service, ''Spies and Commissars: Bolshevik Russia and the West.'' London: Macmillan, 2011; pg. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20 defendants faced charges in the trial, most of whom had worked for the Americans or the British in Moscow, in the case levied by procurator [[Nikolai Krylenko]].&lt;ref name=Service164 /&gt; The case concluded on December 3, 1918, with two defendants sentenced to be shot and various others sentenced to terms of prison or forced labor for terms up to five years.&lt;ref&gt;Service, ''Spies and Commissars,'' pp. 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt; Lockhart and Sidney Reilly were both sentenced to death in absentia, with the sentence to be executed if they were ever found in Soviet Russia again.&lt;ref&gt;Service, ''Spies and Commissars,'' pg. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finance ===
Lockhart was appointed the commercial secretary of the British legation in Prague in November 1919. Finding the work boring, in 1922 he left the post and moved into finance. He joined a central European Bank which was run by the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Your England|last=Lockhart|first=Robert Bruce|publisher=Putnam|year=1955|isbn=|location=London|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===
In 1928 Lockhart left the world of finance and moved into journalism, joining [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbook]]'s ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Michael|date=7 January 2010|title=Lockhart, Sir Robert Hamilton Bruceunlocked (1887–1970)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34578;jsessionid=7CE5A589233D74F6B662BAD15516DC5B|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the editor of the paper's '[[Londoner's Diary]]' and helped organise Beaverbrook's [[Empire Free Trade Crusade|Empire Crusade]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beaverbrook: A Life|last=Chisholm, Anne|first=Davie, Michael|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1992|isbn=9780394568799|location=London|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s Lockhart also began to release a number of books. They were successful enough that writing became his full-time career in 1937.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Second World War and after===
During the [[Second World War]], Lockhart became director-general of the [[Political Warfare Executive]], co-ordinating all British propaganda against the [[Axis powers]]. He was also for a time the British liaison officer to the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] under President [[Edvard Beneš]]. After the war, he resumed his writing career as well as lecturing and broadcasting, and made a weekly [[BBC Radio]] broadcast to [[Czechoslovakia]] for over ten years. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Personal life==
He had a son from his first marriage to Jean Bruce Haslewood,  whom R. H. Bruce Lockhart married in 1913.

His son was author [[Robin Bruce Lockhart]], who wrote the 1967 book ''Ace of Spies'' – about his father's friend and fellow agent [[Sidney Reilly]] – from which the 1983 miniseries ''[[Reilly, Ace of Spies]]'' was produced.

Lockhart married Frances Mary Beck in 1948. His posthumous diaries reveal that he struggled most of his life with alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Knightly, The Second Oldest Profession (New York: Norton, 1986), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Sir Robert Hamilton Bruce Lockhart, died on 27 February 1970 at the age of 82, leaving property valued at £2054. His address at death was Brookside, Ditchling, Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;"Bruce-Lockhart sir Robert Hamilton" in Probate Index for 1970, online at probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar, accessed 12 April 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1983 British television series ''[[Reilly, Ace of Spies]]'' was based on a book by his son. Bruce Lockhart was portrayed by actor [[Ian Charleson]] in the series.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Reichsstatthalter''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁaɪçsˌʃtathaltɐ|lang}}, ''[[Reich]] [[locum tenens|lieutenant]]'') was a title used in the [[German Empire]] and later in [[Nazi Germany]].

==''Statthalter des Reiches'' (1879–1918)==
&lt;!--Too much background?:
In 1871, the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[North German Confederation]] and the south German states of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]{{spaced ndash}}in other words, nearly the whole [[German Confederation]]{{spaced ndash}}defeated [[Second French Empire|France]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The French ceded the largely German-speaking [[Alsace]] (''Elsaß'') and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] (''Lothringen'') to the Hohenzollern dynasty's new-formed German Empire. While the ''Reich'' in itself was a federal state, composed of 25 subjects, the newly annexed area was placed under direct control of Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]]. The office of ''Reichsstatthalter'' as a form of [[governor]] was introduced in 1879 (before it had one ''[[Oberpräsident]]'' Eduard von Möller, 1 September 1871 – 30 September 1879) in the process of gradually transforming [[Alsace-Lorraine]] into a [[States of the German Empire|federal state]] equal to the original 25. The office was abolished when Alsace-Lorraine was ceded to [[Third French Republic|France]] after losing [[World War I]].
--&gt;
The office of ''Statthalter des Reiches'' (otherwise known as ''Reichsstatthalter'') was instituted in 1879 by the German Empire for the areas of [[Alsace]] (''Elsaß'') and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] (''Lothringen'') that [[Second French Empire|France]] had ceded to Germany following the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It was a form of [[governor]]ship intended to exist while [[Alsace-Lorraine]] became a [[States of the German Empire|federal state of the Empire]]. It was abolished when Alsace-Lorraine was, in turn, ceded back to [[Second French Republic|France]] after Germany lost [[World War I]].

[[Free State of Waldeck-Pyrmont|Waldeck-Pyrmont]] joined Prussia in 1928/29; the [[Territory of the Saar Basin|Saar territory]] was a [[League of Nations]] protectorate until 1935, Danzig was a [[Free City of Danzig|city-state]] independent from Germany.]]
During the [[Third Reich]], the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]]s created the office of ''Reichsstatthalter'' (Reich Governor or Reich Deputy) to gain direct control over all states other than [[Free State of Prussia|Prussia]]) after winning the general elections of 1933. Their independent state governments and parliaments were successively abolished, and the Reich government took over direct control in a process called ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' ("coordination"). Prussia's government had already been taken over by the Reich a year earlier in the ''[[Preußenschlag]]'' under Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]].

Two weeks after the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which effectively made [[Adolf Hitler]] the [[Führer|dictator of Germany]], the Nazi government issued the Second Law for Synchronization of the States with the [[German Reich|Reich]] (''Zweites Gesetz zur Gleichschaltung der Länder mit dem Reich'') on 7 April 1933. This law deployed one Reich Governor in each state. The Reich Governors were given the task of overseeing the fulfillment of Hitler's political guidelines in the states. Indeed, the law required them to carry out "the general policy of the Chancellor." In practice, they acted as [[proconsul]]s with complete authority over the state governments. The deputies' main authorities lay in:
* appointing and dismissing the state prime minister
* dissolving the state parliament and calling new elections
* issuing and announcing state laws
* appointing and dismissing important state agents and judges
* granting [[amnesty]]

In [[Prussia]], the largest of the German states, Hitler took direct control by appointing himself as ''Reichstatthalter.'' However, he passed his authority to [[Hermann Göring]], who had been installed as [[Minister President of Prussia|Prussian prime minister]] without an election. The [[Provinces of Prussia|Prussian provinces]] were administered by an ''Oberpräsident'', usually the local ''[[Gauleiter]]''.

===Law for the Reconstruction of the Reich (1934)===
The Law for the Reconstruction of the Reich (''{{ill|Gesetz über den Neuaufbau des Reiches|de}}'') passed on 30 January 1934; formally de-federalized the Reich for the first time in its history. However, Germany had effectively become a highly centralized state with the passage of the Enabling Act and the posting of the Reich Governors. The states' powers were transferred to the Reich, and their parliaments were abolished. The Reich Governors were made responsible to the Reich Minister of the Interior, [[Wilhelm Frick]]. For all intents and purposes, the states were reduced to provinces.

===Reich Governors Law (1935)===
The Reich Governors Law (''Reichsstatthaltergesetz'') of 30 January 1935 formally designated the Reich Governors as the representatives of the Reich government, appointed to watch over the execution of the political guidelines issued by the ''[[Führer|Führer und Reichskanzler]]'' (Hitler). They received the authority to "inform" the provincial authorities about the guidelines and the measures to fulfill them. The ''Reichsstatthalter'' were now also empowered to take over all functions of state government, and also appointed the mayors of all towns and cities with populations fewer than 100,000. This had the effect of giving the Reich Interior Ministry near-complete control over local government. The Interior Minister appointed the mayors of all cities with populations greater than 100,000 (though Hitler reserved the right to appoint the mayors of [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]] himself if he deemed it necessary), and as mentioned above the Reich Governors were responsible to him.

===''Anschluss''===
[[File:Grossdeutsches Reich Staatliche Administration 1944.png|thumb|The (de facto abolished) states and annexed areas of Nazi Germany, 1944.]]
After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' ("union") with Germany, [[Austria]]'s last pre-war ''[[Chancellor of Austria|Kanzler]]'' became also its first ''Reichsstatthalter'': 15 March 1938 – 30 April 1939 [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] (b. 1892 – d. 1946; NSDAP; also ''Führer der Österreichischen Landesregierung''), be it most of his term besides a ''[[Reichskommissar]] für die Wiedervereiningung Österreichs mit dem Deutschen Reich'' 'Reich Commissioner for Reunification of Austria with the German Reich' (23 April 1938 – 31 March 1940 Josef Bürckel, b. 1895 – d. 1944, NSDAP); next each constitutive Land (some differences in borders- thus Burgenland was partitioned away) got its own ''Reichsstatthalter'', generally the last Premier.

The '''Saint James Church massacre''' was a [[massacre]] perpetrated on St James Anglican Church in [[Kenilworth, Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], on 25 July 1993 by four members  of the [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA). Eleven members of the congregation were killed and 58 wounded. In 1998 the attackers were granted amnesty for their acts by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission.]].

==Massacre==
The attack occurred during the Sunday evening service. Sichumiso Nonxuba, Bassie Mkhumbuzi, Gcinikhaya Makoma and Tobela Mlambisa approached the church, a congregation of the [[Church of England in South Africa]], in a vehicle stolen by Mlambisa and Makoma beforehand. Nonxuba, who commanded the unit, and Makoma entered the church armed with [[United States hand grenades#M26/A1/A2, M57 and M61|M26 hand grenade]]s and [[R4 assault rifle]]s.&lt;ref name="SAPARelease"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Churches were used to oppress blacks, says amnesty applicant|publisher=[[South African Press Association]]|date=9 July 1997|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media/1997/9707/s970709e.htm|accessdate=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They threw the grenades and then opened fire on the congregation, killing 11 and wounding 58.&lt;ref name="trcAmnesty"&gt;{{cite journal|date=11 June 1998|title=Decision AC/98/0018|journal=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa|publisher=[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]]}} 
[http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/decisions/1998/980611_makoma%20mkhumbuzi%20mlambisi.htm Department of Justice and Constitutional Development website], doj.gov.za; accessed 3 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One member of the congregation, Charl van Wyk, who wrote a book about the event (''Shooting Back: the right and duty of self defense''), returned fire with a [[.38 special]] revolver, wounding one of the attackers. At this point they fled the church. Mkhumbuzi had been ordered to throw four petrol bombs into the church following the shooting, but abandoned this intention as all four fled in the vehicle.&lt;ref name="trcAmnesty"/&gt;

Members of the congregation killed were Guy Cooper Javens, Richard Oliver O'Kill, Gerhard Dennis Harker, Wesley Alfonso Harker, Denise Gordon, Mirtle Joan Smith, Marita Ackermann, Andrey Katyl, Oleg Karamjin, Valentin Varaksa and Pavel Valuet.&lt;ref name="trcAmnesty"/&gt; The last four on this list were Russian seamen attending the service as part of a church outreach programme. Another Russian seaman, Dmitri Makogon, lost both legs and an arm in the attack. The attack was seen as particularly shocking as relatively few terrorist attacks happened in the suburbs and the [[Cape Town]] area was regarded as relatively peaceful. The attack was seen as harming prospects for future constitutional negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Carlin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/10-shot-dead-in-cape-town-church-black-gunmen-open-fire-on-congregation-in-attack-likely-to-1487217.html|title=10 shot dead in Cape Town church: Black gunmen open fire on congregation in attack likely to undermine negotiations in South Africa|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar attacks==
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2016}}
APLA cadres were held responsible for several similar attacks. Among these were the attack on [[King William's Town]] Golf Club on 28 November 1992 in which four people were killed, and the attack on the Heidelberg Tavern in [[Observatory, Cape Town]] on 31 December 1993, in which four people were killed. [[Ballistics|Ballistic]] tests showed that the same rifles were used in the St James and Heidelberg Tavern attacks.

==Arrest and trial==
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2016}}
Makoma was arrested ten days later and convicted for 11 murders. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Nonxuba, Mlambisa and Mkhumbuzi were subsequently arrested and charged in 1996. They had in the meantime joined the [[South African National Defence Force]] as part of the integration of APLA operatives into the new national defence force.

In 1997, while on trial, Nonxuba, Mlambisa and Mkhumbuzi appealed to the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] for amnesty, together with Makoma. They were granted bail pending their appearance before the TRC. Nonxuba died in a car accident while on bail.

Makoma, Mkhumbuzi and Mlambisa were all granted [[amnesty]] for the St James Church attack by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC).&lt;ref name="trcAmnesty"/&gt; As a result, Makoma was freed after serving only 5½ years of his sentence, and the trial of Mkhumbuzi and Mlambisa was never completed. In this and other APLA amnesty hearings, APLA operatives claimed that they were following their orders and that they regarded all whites as legitimate targets as they were complicit in the government's policy of [[apartheid]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In statements made to the representatives of St James church they added they were unaware the selected target was a church until they arrived in Kenilworth. Dawie Ackerman, husband of one of the victims, noted that perhaps 35–40% of the congregation were people of colour, with the counsel for the APLA saying they had assumed all congregants would be white as the church was in a white area.&lt;ref name="trcAmnesty"/&gt;

[[Letlapa Mphahlele]], national director of operations for APLA, took responsibility for ordering the attacks as part of his application for amnesty. He claimed that he had authorised attacks on white civilians following the killing of five school children by the [[Transkei|Transkei Defence Force]] in [[Umtata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forachange.co.uk/index.php?stoid=343 "Hands that unleashed Thunder"], Forachange.co.uk; accessed 20 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty in such cases was typically granted in terms of the TRC's mandate because the crimes were considered politically motivated, with the perpetrators following the orders of the APLA commanders, and full disclosure was made to the TRC. Although amnesty was granted to the individual perpetrators, the TRC found the act itself, and other APLA/PAC attacks specifically targeting civilians, were "a gross violation of human rights" and a "violation of internal [sic] humanitarian law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Liberation Movements from 1960 to 1990|journal=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report|volume=2|page=692|publisher=[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]]|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/TRC%20VOLUME%202.pdf|format=PDF|quote=The commission finds that the targeting of civilians for killing was not only a gross violation of human rights of those affected but a violation of internal humanitarian law|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconciliation==
Several of the church members who were injured or who lost family members in the attacks, as well as Charl van Wyk, who had returned fire on the attackers, later met and publicly reconciled with the APLA attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/decisions/1998/980611_makoma%20mkhumbuzi%20mlambisi.htm|title=Justice Home|website=Doj.gov.za|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
On 27 August 2002, Gcinikhaya Makoma was arrested along with six others following a cash-in-transit heist of a [[Standard Bank]] cash van in [[Constantia, Cape Town]], in which R1.8 million was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?&amp;art_id=vn20051031114008797C932324 IOL Gang fled R1,8m heist 'at speed of lightning'], Iol.co.za; accessed 20 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/southafrica/news/st-james-killer-gets-life-for-heist-death-20120217|title=St James killer gets life for heist death|website=News24.com|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and the others were later acquitted, with the magistrate finding that the prosecution case had been badly put together and that documents had been falsified by an investigating officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20051129110151146C810787|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2008-06-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215203659/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20051129110151146C810787|archivedate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makoma was eventually convicted on 16 February 2012  of murder and robbery and sentenced to life and 46 years in prison for his role in a December 2007 cash van heist in [[Parow, Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/saturday-star/ex-apla-man-gets-life-in-prison-for-cash-van-heist-1.1238493 IOL Ex-Apla man gets life in prison for cash van heist], Iol.co.za; accessed 20 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, Charl Van Wyk became a founding member of Gun Owners of South Africa (GOSA), an online civilian [[right to keep and bear arms|gun rights]] ownership group, which is involved in public demonstrations against the Firearms Control Act.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Education==
Bullock was born in [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]], and grew up outside of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].  He received his B.A. in economics and philosophy from [[Grove City College]] and his law degree from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]].&lt;ref name="twsBio"/&gt; Bullock joined the [[Institute for Justice]] at its founding in 1991.&lt;ref name="twsBio"/&gt;

==Career==
Bullock was lead co-counsel in the 2005 Supreme Court case ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]''.&lt;ref name="twsCSMonitor2"/&gt; After the decision by the high court to allow the [[New London, Connecticut|City of New London]] to seize the homes and businesses of current residences to make room for a "90-acre office, hotel, and housing complex", Bullock said that it was "a sad day for the country and a sad day for the Constitution."&lt;ref name="twsCSMonitor2"/&gt;

Bullock has advocated against government use of [[Civil forfeiture in the United States|civil forfeiture]].&lt;ref name="twsNJDotCom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; He has said that when the police pull drivers over for minor traffic infractions and seize their cash, they do not "respect fundamental notions of due process."&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; He represented Russ Caswell when the police tried to seize Caswell's motel in [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts]] after incidents of illegal drug activity on the premises.&lt;ref name="twsWallStreetJournal3"&gt;{{cite web

'''Sturla Þórðarson''' (1214–1284) was an [[Iceland]]ic politician/chieftain and writer of sagas and contemporary history during the 13th century.

Sturla was the son of [[Þórður Sturluson]] and his mistress Þóra, and grandson of [[Sturla Þórðarson the elder]]. He was a nephew and pupil of the famous saga-writer [[Snorri Sturluson]]. He fought alongside [[Þórður kakali Sighvatsson]] during the [[Age of the Sturlungs]].

He is best known for writing ''[[Íslendinga saga]]'', the longest saga within ''[[Sturlunga saga]],'' and ''[[Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar]],'' the story of [[Haakon IV of Norway]]. He also wrote a saga of Haakon's son, [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the lawmender]] (''[[Magnúss saga lagabœtis]]''), of which only fragments have survived. Some scholars also believe him to have written ''[[Kristni saga]]'' and ''[[Sturlubók]]'', a transcript of ''[[Landnáma]]''. He is moreover listed in ''[[Skáldatal]]'' as the court ''[[skald]]'' of the Swedish ruler [[Birgir Jarl]].

Sturla was appointed [[law speaker]] over all of [[Iceland]] for a brief period after the dissolution of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], and wrote the law book ''[[Járnsíða]].''

His brother was [[Ólafr Þórðarson|Ólafur Þórðarson hvítaskáld]].

'''Svantepolk Knutsson''' (died 1310), Lord of Viby in [[Östergötland]], was a Scandinavian [[magnate]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Axelsson, ''Svantepolk Knutsson'', https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/artikel/34741, Swedish biographical dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Svantepolk's father was [[Canute, Duke of Revalia]], a bastard son of king [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] with a high-born Swedish lady Helena, daughter of [[Earl Guttorm]]. His mother had been a [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranian]] lady whose first name and precise origin is not known to us, but who is indicated to have come from the [[ducal family of Pomerelia]].
Svantepolk's brother was [[Eric, Duke of Halland]] who died in 1304.

Svantepolk settled in Sweden in the mid-13th century. His wife was [[Benedicta of Bjelbo|Benedikte of Ymseborg]], daughter of (Earl) Sune Folkesson, a grandson of earl [[Birger Brosa]]. Benedikte's mother was [[Helena Sverkersdotter]], the daughter of king [[Sverker II of Sweden]] and his first wife Benedikte Ebbesdatter of the [[Galen family]] of Denmark. Benedikte's elder sister [[Catherine of Ymseborg]] was wife of king [[Eric XI of Sweden]] (1216–50), so Svantepolk was the late king's brother-in-law.

Svantepolk became the [[lawspeaker|justiciar]] of [[Östergötland]] and a wealthy and remarkable feudal lord in Sweden. His son Knut presumably died childless.

Svantepolk and Benedikte's daughters married lords of Swedish high nobility and became ancestresses of several Swedish noble families, substantial dowries following. Lord Svantepolk, with royal ancestry and rights to ducal dignity of Halland and [[Revalia]], was a valued ancestor, well-remembered in his noble Swedish descendants' pedigrees and family lore. The name [[Svante]], a shortened version of Svantepolk, was given to many Swedish descendants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36751">[[File:Taco Truck St Louis MO.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A [[taco truck]] in the downtown area of St. Louis, Missouri]]
The phrase "'''taco trucks on every corner'''" was used by [[Marco Gutierrez]], the co-founder of ''Latinos for Trump,'' on September 1, 2016, in comments that received widespread attention during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential elections]].

During an interview with MSNBC, Gutierrez referred to his Mexican heritage, stating that "My culture is a very dominant culture, and it's imposing and it's causing problems.

== Origin ==
The phrase originated with Marco Gutierrez, a co-founder of the group ''Latinos for Trump'', during an interview with [[Joy-Ann Reid|Joy Reid]] on [[MSNBC]] on September 1, 2016.

The phrase was used within the context of a warning about the "dominance" of [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]], underscoring Gutierrez's stance that immigration should be more closely regulated.{{efn|"While on All in With Chris Hayes on Thursday evening, Latinos for Trump founder Marco Gutierrez warned of the danger of allowing Mexican culture to enter the United States unabated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rodriguez, Mathew | date= September 2, 2016 | url=https://mic.com/articles/153367/latino-donald-trump-supporter-says-more-mexicans-means-a-taco-truck-on-every-corner#.2DujMnmZJ|title=Latino Donald Trump supporter says more Mexicans means a taco truck on every corner|publisher=[[Mic.com]]|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an interview with [[Deutsche Welle]] on September 8, 2016, Gutierrez explained, "If you don't regulate the immigration, if you don't structure our communities, we are going to do whatever we want. We are going to take over. That is what I'm trying to say and I think what is happening with my culture is that its imposing [itself] on the American culture – and both cultures are reacting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/trump-supporters-taco-trucks-remark-sparks-online-anger-and-hunger/a-19536870|title=Trump supporter's 'taco trucks' remark sparks online anger – and hunger|last=Machhaus|first=Carolina|date=2016-09-08|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2347">'''Working Women United''' (also known as the '''Working Women United Institute''') is a [[women's rights]] organisation based in the United States which was formed in New York City, in 1975, to combat sexual harassment of women in the workplace.

According to some researchers, the organization was the first to use the term "[[sexual harassment]]" in the workplace context.&lt;ref name=fitz&gt;Fitzgerald, Louise F. "Sexual harassment: The definition and measurement of a construct." Ivory power: Sexual harassment on campus 21, no. 22 (1990): 24-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the organization's activism, their definition for sexual harassment was "the treatment of women workers as sexual objects," but the organization did not specify which behaviors constituted such harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Loy, Pamela Hewitt, and Lea P. Stewart. "The extent and effects of the sexual harassment of working women." Sociological focus 17, no. 1 (1984): 31-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carmita Wood==
The founding of the group was inspired by the case of '''Carmita Wood''', who quit her job at Cornell University due to sexual harassment and became one of the first women in the US to sue her employer on such grounds.&lt;ref name=fitz/&gt;

In 1975, Carmita Wood quit her position at Cornell University due to harassment from her supervisor, [[Boyce McDaniel]], and the University refused to approve of a transfer. Subsequently, Wood filed for unemployment benefits from the university. Cornell refused to approve the benefits, stating Wood had quit for "personal reasons." Working Women United was active in response to the incident and Wood's subsequent lawsuit. Cornell instructor [[Lin Farley]], a key organiser in Working Women United, used the phrase "sexual harassment" at a hearing of the [[New York City Human Rights Commission]], and ''The New York Times'' reported on the hearing and the phrase used, helping to introduce the concept and phrase "sexual harassment" into the national lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/738873/depressingly-long-history-sexual-harassment-turning-points|website=The Week|title=The depressingly long history of sexual harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
