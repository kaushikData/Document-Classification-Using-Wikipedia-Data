The '''Bachelor of Science in Law''' ('''BSL''') is a somewhat special-purpose undergraduate degree that is typically intended for students who have completed some undergraduate education, but not received a baccalaureate degree, and are intending to resume their education and commence the study of law, ultimately towards a [[Juris Doctor]] degree, but need a bachelor's degree first.  Academic work at the start of a law program is sometimes combined with previous academic credit to form the basis of a BSL award.  The BSL degree is also sometimes intended for students who do not intend to attend [[law school]], but are instead becoming [[paralegal]]s or other legal assistants.

'''Blood diamonds''' (also called '''conflict diamonds''', '''war diamonds''', '''hot diamonds''', or '''red diamonds''') is a term used for a [[diamond]] [[Diamond mining|mined]] in a war zone and sold to finance an [[insurgency]], an invading army's war efforts, or a [[warlord]]'s activity. The term is used to highlight the negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas, or to label an individual diamond as having come from such an area. Diamonds [[Diamond mining|mined]] during the recent civil wars in [[Angola]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Guinea]], and [[Guinea Bissau]] have been given the label.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20121023004513/http://www.un.org/peace/africa/Diamond.html Conflict Diamonds].'' United Nations Department of Public Information, March 21, 2001, archived online 23 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/january-2007/conflict-resources-%E2%80%98curse%E2%80%99-blessing "Conflict resources: from 'curse' to blessing"] by Ernest Harsch. Africa Renewal: January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KPSCStatistics&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kimberleyprocessstatistics.org/static/pdfs/AnnualTables/2008GlobalSummary.pdf |format=PDF |title=Global Summary 2008 |work=[[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726231200/https://kimberleyprocessstatistics.org/static/pdfs/AnnualTables/2008GlobalSummary.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[conflict resource]] refers to analogous situations involving other natural resources.

==History==

===Angola===
Reports estimated that as much as 20% of the total diamond production in the 1980s was being sold for illegal and unethical purposes and 19% was specifically ''conflict'' in nature.&lt;ref name=PACWEB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blooddiamond.pacweb.org/kimberlyprocess/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116014842/http://blooddiamond.pacweb.org/kimberlyprocess/ |archivedate=2007-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, the illegal diamond trade was estimated by the [[World Diamond Council]] to have been reduced to 4% of the world's diamond production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlddiamondcouncil.com/estimate.shtml%7ctitle=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM%7c%7ctitle=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM%7cwork=worlddiamondcouncil.com%7ctitle=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM%7cwork=worlddiamondcouncil.com|title=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM|work=worlddiamondcouncil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211002030/http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/index.html |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Diamond Council]] reported that by 2004 this percentage had fallen to approximately 1% and up to today the World Diamond Council refers to this illegal trade to be virtually eliminated, meaning that more than 99% of diamonds being sold have a legal background. &lt;ref name=PACWEB/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venetiamajor.com.au/services/diamonds-gemstones/conflict-diamonds/|title=Conflict Diamonds|work=Venetia Major - Bespoke Jewellery|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410042847/http://www.venetiamajor.com.au/services/diamonds-gemstones/conflict-diamonds/|archivedate=2013-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the UN Resolution, UNITA was able to continue to sell or trade some diamonds in order to finance its war effort. The UN set out to find how this remaining illicit trade was being conducted and appointed Canadian ambassador [[Robert Fowler (diplomat)|Robert Fowler]] to investigate. In 2000, he produced the [[Fowler Report]], which named those countries, organizations and individuals involved in the trade.  The report is credited with establishing the link between diamonds and third world conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kNErbPSzUUC|title=Diamonds and Conflict: Problems and Solutions|author=Arthur V. Levy|pages=5–6|publisher=N ova Publishers|year=2003 |isbn=1-59033-715-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led directly to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295]], as well as the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]]. Still, after the report was published in 2013 smugglers from these African countries were selling blood diamonds through channels less sophisticated such as social media posts. And rhinestones from Angola, produced by UNITA were being traded to Cameroon to get them a Cameroonian certificate naturalization to then be sold as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chutel |first1=Lynsey |title=Selling blood diamonds is as simple as a Facebook post and a WhatsApp message |url=https://qz.com/africa/1014548/blood-diamonds-from-central-african-republic-are-sold-over-facebook-and-whatsapp/ |website=Quartz Africa |publisher=Quartz Africa |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ivory Coast===
[[Ivory Coast]]  began to develop a fledgling diamond mining industry in the early 1990s. A [[Coup d'état|coup]] overthrew the government in 1999, starting a civil war. The country became a route for exporting diamonds from Liberia and war-torn Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/background.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213064137/http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/background.html |archivedate=2006-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heartmatter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierra-leone.org/heartmatter.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120121759/http://www.sierra-leone.org/heartmatter.html |archivedate=2007-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign investment began to withdraw from Ivory Coast. To curtail the illegal trade, the nation stopped all diamond mining and the [[UN Security Council]] banned all exports of diamonds from Ivory Coast in December 2005. This ban lasted about ten years but it was later lifted in April 2014 when members of the UN council voted to suspend the sanction. The Kimberley process officials also notified in November 2013 that Ivory Coast was right producing artisanal diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Land of Conflict: Ivory Coast Diamonds |url=https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/wikidiamond/diamond-industry-history/land-conflict-ivory-coast-diamonds/ |website=Israeli Diamond Industry |publisher=The Israeli Diamond Industry |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground/&gt;

Despite UN sanctions the illicit diamond trade still exists in Ivory Coast. Rough diamonds are exported out of the country to neighboring states and international trading centers through the northern [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|Forces Nouvelles]] controlled section of the country, a group which is reported to be using these funds of chele to re-arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/861/en/campaigners_call_for_urgent_action_on_zimbabwe_blo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902191501/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/861/en/campaigners_call_for_urgent_action_on_zimbabwe_blo |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/550/99/PDF/N0955099.pdf?OpenElement|title=ODS HOME PAGE|author=ODS Team|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[Zaire]]) has suffered numerous looting wars in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miningafrica.net/mining-countries-africa/democratic-republic-of-congo/|title=Democratic Republic of Congo|work=Mining Africa|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been a member of the Kimberley Process since 2003 and now exports about 8% of the world's diamonds.&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground/&gt;'However, even nowadays there is a warning concerning diamonds proceeding from this area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enforcement |url=https://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/enforcement |website=Kimberley Process |publisher=Kimberley Process |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; since there have been multiple cases of fake Kimberley certificates accompanying the gems. Once one of [[De Beers]]  most celebrated and priceless diamonds, the D-colour {{convert|777|carat|g}} [[Millennium Star]] was discovered in the DRC and sold to De Beers, in open competition with other diamond buyers, between 1991 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|last2=McGreal|first2=Chris|last3=Vidal|first3=John|title=Blood, sweat and ice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/nov/09/features11.g2|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
From 1989 to 2003, [[Liberia]] was engaged in [[Second Liberian Civil War|a civil war]]. In 2000, the UN accused Liberian president [[Charles G. Taylor]] of supporting the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) insurgency in neighboring [[Sierra Leone]] with weapons and training in exchange for diamonds.&lt;ref name="pssure"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[United Nations]] applied sanctions on the Liberian diamond trade. In August 2003, Taylor stepped down as president and, after being exiled to [[Nigeria]], faced trial in [[The Hague]]. On July 21, 2006, he pleaded not guilty to [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s,&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground/&gt; of which he was found guilty in April 2012.  On May 30, 2012, he began a 50-year sentence in a high security prison in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news

Around the time of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], [[al-Qaeda]] allegedly bought gems from Liberia as some of its other financial assets were frozen.&lt;ref name="BBCal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2775763.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Al-Qaeda 'traded blood diamonds'|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having regained peace, Liberia is attempting to construct a legitimate diamond mining industry. The UN has lifted sanctions and Liberia is now a member of the [[Kimberley Process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Security Council votes to lift ban on Liberian diamond exports|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-security-council-votes-to-lift-ban-on-liberian-diamond-exports-1.689632|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 however, Liberian diamonds were reported to be partly produced using [[child labor]] according to the U.S. Department of Labor's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''.

=== Sierra Leone ===
The [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]] started in 1991 and continued until 2002, costing at least 50,000 lives and causing local people to suffer killings, mutilation, rape, torture and abduction, mainly due to the brutal warfare waged by rebel group, the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF). The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) claimed that they supported causes of justice and democracy in the beginning, but later on they started to control the villages and to prevent local people from voting for the new government by chopping off their limbs. Victims included children and infants. It created numerous examples of physical and psychological harm across Sierra Leone.&amp;nbsp;

Moreover, they also occupied the diamond mines in order to get access to funding and continued support of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smillie|first=I|date=2013|title=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|url=|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|volume=46(04)|pages=1004-1004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during that time, RUF was mining up to $125 million of diamonds yearly. Since diamonds are used as a funding source, they also created opportunities for tax evasion and financial support of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global Witness|first=|date=2006|title=The Truth About Diamonds : Conflict and Development.|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/import/the_truth_about_diamonds.pdf|journal=Global Witness|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[United Nations Security Council]] imposed diamond sanctions in 2000, which were then lifted in 2003. According to [[National Geographic News]], all of these civil wars and conflicts created by rebel groups resulted in over four million deaths in the African population and injuries to over two million civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/african-diamond-trade2.htm|title=How the African Diamond Trade Works|last=Hoyt|first=A|date=|website=Howstuffworks.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another latest conflict diamond statistic from Statistic Brain, revealed that Sierra Leone has been listed as second highest in the production of conflict diamonds, which is shown as 1% of the world's production, after Angola, which produced 2.1% in 2016. 15% of Sierra Leone's diamond production are conflict diamonds. It shows that the production of conflict diamonds still exists in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/conflict-diamond-statistics/|title=Conflict Diamond statistics|last=Statistics Brain|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314173102/http://www.statisticbrain.com/conflict-diamond-statistics|archive-date=2012-03-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2005 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Country Reports on Human Right Practices of Africa from the United States]], serious human rights issues still exist in Sierra Leone, even though the 11-year civil conflict had officially ended by 2002. Sierra Leone remains in an unstable political situation, although the country has elected a new government. The huge consequences of blood diamonds still remains a mainstream issue in Sierra Leone. One of the biggest issues is people still being abused by the security forces, including rape and the use of excessive force on detainees, including teenagers. Child abuse and child labor are other serious issues which took place in Sierra Leone after the civil conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61591.htm|title=2005 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Africa : Sierra Leone|last=U.S. Department of State|first=|date=2006|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they need a huge number of workers, the security forces started kidnapping and forcing young adults to be their slaves; children were forced to join their army as soldiers, and women were raped. They even burned entire villages. Thousands of men, women, and children are used as slaves to collect diamonds, and they are forced to use their bare hands to dig in mud along river banks instead of digging with tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/26/world/africa/blood-diamonds/index.html|title=How diamonds fuel Africa’s conflicts|last=Paul|first=Armstrong|date=2012|website=CNN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/89089538/Ethical-Issue-Analyis-Blood-Diamond-Analysis|title=Ethical Issue Analysis: Blood Diamond Analysis|last=Tammy|first=Hanna|date=2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the report, The Truth About Diamonds: Conflict and Development from Global Witness, it mentioned that Sierra Leone is listed as second from the bottom of the [[United Nations Human Development Index|United Nation Human Development Index]].&amp;nbsp;It also shows that Sierra Leone still makes slow progress, in 2016, in such different aspects as, for example, education, health, and human rights, since 1990, which is also the year that conflicts took place in Sierra Leone. It shows that it is a huge consequence of blood diamonds that it brought into Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/SLE|title=Human Development Report - Sierra Leone|last=Human Development Report|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the war had ended in 2002 and the government tried to improve and adjust the cooperation of the diamond industry. Sierra Leone resulted in an increase of over US$140 million in 2005 and attempted a percentage return of export tax to diamond mining communities. However, it does not improve anything — the money is not reaching the public and it has not provided benefit to anyone in the communities. For instance, the Kono district in Sierra Leone has been mined for 70 years, but they still have no basic facilities, like electricity and repairing of roads. Houses are destroyed because of the civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global Witness|first=|date=2006|title=The Truth About Diamonds: Conflict and Development|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/import/the_truth_about_diamonds.pdf|journal=The Truth About Diamonds: Conflict and Development|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also examines the unethical issues of how rebel groups treat those locals.

=== Republic of the Congo ===
The [[Republic of the Congo]] (Congo-Brazzaville) was expelled from the Kimberley Process in 2004&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt; because, despite having no official diamond mining industry, the country was [[export]]ing large quantities of diamonds, the origin of which it could not detail. It was also accused of falsifying certificates of origin. The Republic of the Congo was readmitted in 2007.&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite news|publisher=IPS|accessdate=2010-08-11|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40296|title=Blood Diamonds No Longer Congo-Brazzaville’s Best Friend|date=30 Nov 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117091311/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40296|archivedate=2009-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
[[Zimbabwe]] Diamonds are not considered conflict diamonds by the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]].

In July 2010, the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]] agreed that diamonds from the country's disputed [[Marange Diamond Fields]] could be sold on the international market,&lt;ref name=TheIndependent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/zimbabwe-gets-goahead-to-sell-diamonds-again-2028699.html|title=Zimbabwe gets go-ahead to sell diamonds again|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a report from the Scheme's monitor a month earlier described diamonds mined from the fields as [[Conflict-free diamond|conflict-free]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703630304575270681883985308|title=Zimbabwe Nears Approval for Marange-Field Diamond Exports - WSJ|author1=Farai Mutsaka |author2=Peter Wonacott |author3=Sarah Childress |date=28 May 2010|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict diamond campaign==
[[Global Witness]] was one of the first organizations to pick up on the link between diamonds and conflicts in Africa in its 1998 report entitled "A Rough Trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/A_Rough_Trade.pdf|title=A Rough Trade: The Role of Companies and Governments in the Angolan Conflict|author=Dan Brown|publisher=[[Global Witness]]|accessdate=2011-04-11|date=1998-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raO8jHBdDhYC|page=233|title=Glitter &amp; Greed: The Secret World of the Diamond Empire|author=Janine P. Roberts|publisher=The Disinformation Company|year=2003|isbn=0-9713942-9-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the passing of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173]] in 1998, the United Nations too identified the conflict diamond issue as a funding for war.  The [[Fowler Report]] in 2000 detailed in depth how [[UNITA]] was financing its war activities, and in May 2000, led directly to the passing of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295]] and the diamond producing countries of southern Africa meeting in [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] to plan a method by which the trade in conflict diamonds could be halted, and buyers of diamonds could be assured that their diamonds have not contributed to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/202/41606.html|title=Final Report of the UN Panel of Experts ("The "Fowler Report")|publisher=Global Policy Forum|date=2000-03-10|accessdate=2010-03-20|author=Robert Fowler|authorlink=Robert Fowler (diplomat)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N00/396/56/PDF/N0039656.pdf |title=Resolution 1295 (2000) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this resolution the Security Council wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcomes the proposal that a meeting of experts be convened for the purpose of devising a system of controls to facilitate the implementation of the measures contained in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173|Resolution 1173]] (1998), including arrangements that would allow for increased transparency and accountability in the control of diamonds from their point of origin to the bourses, emphasizes that it is important that, in devising such controls, every effort be made to avoid inflicting collateral damage on the legitimate diamond trade, and welcomes the intention of the Republic of South Africa to host a relevant conference this year''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/SC6988.doc.htm|title=RESOLUTIONS  AND  STATEMENTS OF  THE  SECURITY  COUNCIL 2000|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kimberley Process Certification Scheme===
{{Main|Kimberley Process Certification Scheme}}
On July 19, 2000, the [[World Diamond Congress]] at [[Antwerp]] adopted a resolution to strengthen the diamond industry's ability to block sales of conflict diamonds.&lt;ref name=wdcongress2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondfacts.org/facts/fact_06.html|title=Fact #6- The Facts - DiamondFacts.org|work=diamondfacts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNJuly2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2000-07-19/world/africa.diamonds.01.reut_1_conflict-diamonds-diamond-industry-rough-diamonds?_s=PM:WORLD|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403165546/http://articles.cnn.com/2000-07-19/world/africa.diamonds.01.reut_1_conflict-diamonds-diamond-industry-rough-diamonds?_s=PM%3AWORLD|title=Diamond leaders in pact to ban 'conflict gems' funding African wars|archivedate=3 April 2012|work=CNN|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution called for an international certification system on the export and import of diamonds, legislation in all countries to accept only officially sealed packages of diamonds, for countries to impose criminal charges on anyone trafficking in conflict diamonds, and instituted a ban on any individual found trading in conflict diamonds from the diamond [[Exchange (organized market)|bourses]] of the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses]].&lt;ref name=CNNJuly2000/&gt; The Kimberley Process was at the start led by South Africa and Canada as vice president and since then every year a new chair and vice chair country are elected to maintain the legitimacy of their practices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chair |url=https://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/chair |website=Kimberley Process |publisher=Kimberley Process |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system tracks diamonds from the mine to the market and regulates the policing surrounding the export, manufacture and sale of the products. Also in tourist countries like Dubai and the United Kingdom. All the Kimberley members are not allowed to trade with non members.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} Before a gemstone is allowed through the airports to other countries, the Kimberley Certification must be presented by the gem's owner or obtained from a renowned attorney. The certificate should also be requested by the customer when the gems have reached a retail store to ensure its precedence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debeersgroup.com/ImageVaultFiles/id_841/cf_5/Diamonds-_development_and_democracy_April_2008.PDF |format=PDF |title=Diamonds, Development, and Democracy |first=Nicky |last=Oppenheimer |publisher=debeersgroup.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005102236/http://www.debeersgroup.com/ImageVaultFiles/id_841/cf_5/Diamonds-_development_and_democracy_April_2008.PDF |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17–18 of 2001, diamond industry figures convened and formed the new organization, the [[World Diamond Council]]. This new body set out to draft a new process, whereby all diamond rough could be certified as coming from a non-conflict source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worlddiamondcouncil.com/chairmansreportforlondon.shtml%257|title=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM|website=www.worlddiamondcouncil.com|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KPCS was given approval by the UN on March 13, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/497/66/PDF/N0149766.pdf |title=UN Resolution 56/263 - The role of diamonds in fueling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts }} UN 96th plenary meeting, 13 March 2002, accessed online November 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and in November, after two years of negotiation between governments, diamond producers, and Non-Government organizations, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was created.

The Kimberley Process attempted to curtail the flow of conflict diamonds, help stabilize fragile countries and support their development. As the Kimberley Process has made life harder for criminals, it has brought large volumes of diamonds onto the legal market that would not otherwise have made it there. This has increased the revenues of poor governments, and helped them to address their countries’ development challenges. For instance, around $125 million worth of diamonds were legally exported from Sierra Leone in 2006, compared to almost none at the end of the 1990s.&lt;ref name="kimberly"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortcomings and criticism===

The Kimberley Process has ultimately failed to stem the flow of blood diamonds, leading key proponents such as Global Witness to abandon the scheme.&lt;ref name="Failed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16027011|title=NGO Global Witness leaves diamond vetting scheme|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=5 December 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is no guarantee that diamonds with a Kimberley Process Certification are in fact conflict-free.  This is due to the nature of the corrupt government officials in the leading diamond producing countries.  It is common for these officials to be bribed with $50 to $100 a day in exchange for paperwork declaring that blood diamonds are Kimberley Process Certified.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan, E. Kieron|title=Blood Diamond Farce|date=11 August 2010|accessdate=12 December 2011|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig11/ryan-k1.1.1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency===
The Kimberley system attempted to increase governments' [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] by forcing them to keep records of the diamonds they are exporting and importing and how much they are worth. In theory, this would show governments their finances so that they can be held accountable for how much they are spending for the benefit of the country's population.  However non-compliance by countries such as Venezuela has led to the failure of accountability.&lt;ref name="Failed"/&gt;

The company [[Materialytics]] claims that it can trace the origin of virtually any diamond using [[Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://materialytics.com/gsa2015determinationofdiamondprovenance/|title=Diamonds: GSA 2015: Determination of Diamond Provenance|work=materialytics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no way to know whether a diamond purchased online is blood free or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thediamondringreview.com/2017/10/the-real-story-history-of-conflict_14.html|title=The Real Story &amp; History of Conflict Blood Diamonds|website=www.thediamondringreview.com|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of this legislation was key to the success of the KPCS, as the United States is the largest consumer of diamonds. The CDTA states: 'As the consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the United States has an obligation to help sever the link between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an effective solution.&lt;ref name=CDTA/&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] also maintains an office for a Special Adviser for Conflict Diamonds.  As of October 14, 2015, the position is held by [[Ashley Orbach]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/e/eb/diamonds/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadian policy ===
During the 1990s diamond-rich areas were discovered in Northern Canada. [[Canada]] is one of the key players in the diamond industry. [[Partnership Africa Canada]] was created in 1986 to help with the crisis in Africa. This organization is also part of the Diamond Development Initiative. The Diamond Development Initiative helps improve and regulate the legal diamond industry.

The [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberley Process]] was initiated in May 2000 by [[South Africa]] with Canada a major supporter of instituting the scheme. Canada has now passed several laws that help stop the trade of conflict diamonds. The laws deal with the export and import of rough diamonds, and also how they are transferred. In December 2002 the [[Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act]] was passed by the Canadian government. This law acts as a system that helps control the importing, exporting and transporting of rough diamonds through Canada. The Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act also states that the Kimberley Process is the minimum requirement of certifying rough diamonds and a certificate is also required for all shipments of diamonds. This certificate is called the [[Canadian Certificate]], it gives permission for an officer to seize any shipment of diamonds that does not meet the requirements of the Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act.&lt;ref name="stop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopblooddiamonds.org/Canadian-Policy-Laws.asp|title=Stop Blood Diamonds - Creating a Conflict Free Diamond World|work=stopblooddiamonds.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510200002/http://www.stopblooddiamonds.org/Canadian-Policy-Laws.asp|archivedate=2007-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of the Northwest Territories of Canada (GNWT) also has a unique certification program. They offer a Government certificate on all diamonds that are mined, cut, and polished in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Canadian diamonds are tracked from the mine, through the refining process, to the retail jeweler with a unique diamond identification number (DIN) laser inscribed on the diamond's girdle. To obtain this certificate one must cut and polish the diamond in the NWT.

== Technology response ==
Technical services have emerged that may act as a solution for tracking diamond movement across borders. A service was launched in July 2016 that allows managers to build systems using a [[blockchain (database)|blockchain database]] for tracking high-value or highly regulated items through a [[supply chain]].  [[Everledger]] is one using such a system to "record the movement of diamonds from mines to jewelry stores" and is one of the inaugural clients of a new [[blockchain]]-based tracking service from [[IBM]].&lt;ref name=wsj20160714&gt;

*Danish filmmaker [[Mads Brügger]]'s documentary ''[[The Ambassador (2011 film)|Ambassadøren]]'' (2011, in English: "The Ambassador") addresses the trade in [[diplomatic passport]]s in order to make money with blood diamonds.
*Players compete in ''[[Diamond Trust of London]]'' to extract diamonds out of Angola before the implementation of the Kimberley Process.
*The remix version of [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning song ''[[Diamonds from Sierra Leone]]'' performed by American artist [[Kanye West]], has verses that detail the blood diamond trade in Sierra Leone, and comments about the Western public unawareness of the origins of the diamonds linked to the conflict.
*Blood diamonds play a part in ''[[Far Cry 2]]'', serving as the player's currency, acquired by missions from the two warlord factions or from guarded briefcases. One of the endings also involves delivering a case of stolen diamonds to a border guard as a bribe.
*Blood Diamonds is a thriller fiction book title by Jon Land, copyright 2002; {{ISBN|0-765-30226-8}}

==Plot==
{{quote|Badged by the FBI but given free rein, wealthy as a wizard Wall Street trader, intelligent enough to make [[Mensa society|Mensa]] members feel inferior, master of exotic Chongg Ran meditation, Pendergast, “skin as pale as marble, eyes like silver conchas,” shoulders his custom 1911 Les Baer Thunder Ranch Special .45 and sets out to find the killer who deposited his estranged son, Alban, dead on his Manhattan mansion’s doorstep. Alban is autopsied, and an exotic [[turquoise]] is found in his stomach. At the [[American Museum of Natural History]], Pendergast consults an expert gemologist—worth reading if buying turquoise—and heads for California’s [[Salton Sea]] in search of the Golden Spider Mine, all while giving only passing notice to a museum murder under investigation by his friend Lt. [[Vincent D'Agosta]]. So begins Pendergast’s deconstruction of a deadly conspiracy originating with [[patent medicine]] and ending with bizarre battles—[[triflic acid]], [[poison darts]] and Sumatran buckthorn as weapons—at the museum and the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]]. A Pendergast ancestor, Hezekiah, built the family’s fortune on an elixir that ultimately left users with [[ALS]]- or [[Huntington's disease]]–like symptoms. Now the villain is spurred by epigenetic changes wrought on users’ descendants by “Hezekiah’s Compound Elixir and Glandular Restorative.” Pendergast visits exotic climes for clues, and the authors offer sparkling descriptions—the Salton Fontainebleau is a “fantastical cross between a Chinese temple and an [[Asbury Park]] amusement parlor.” Constance Greene and other familiar characters appear, and Pendergast learns a startling truth about Alban, whose warped psyche had once wrought havoc.

Great character-driven crime fiction—readers new to the series won’t be entirely lost, and Pendergast patrons will be thoroughly satisfied.}}

'''''Brimstone and Treacle''''' is a 1976 BBC television play by [[Dennis Potter]]. Originally intended for broadcast as an episode of the ''[[Play for Today]]'' series, it remained untransmitted until 1987. The play, featuring [[Denholm Elliott]], was made into a film version (released in 1982) co-starring [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].

The play features a middle-aged middle-class couple living in a [[north London]] suburb whose life has been catastrophically affected by a hit-and-run accident which has left their beautiful undergraduate daughter totally dependent upon them, but their lives are dramatically changed by the arrival of a mysterious young stranger.

==Plot==
For two years, Tom and Amy Bates have been struggling to cope with their altered lives, after their daughter Pattie (or Patricia) was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident. Pattie is unable to walk, completely dependent upon others for the activities of daily living,  and seemingly unable to communicate beyond making unintelligible sounds. Although poorly educated and gullible, Amy Bates firmly believes that Pattie is able to understand what is being said in her presence, whereas Tom Bates has given up all hope of her recovery. In fact, judging from the sounds she makes, Pattie seems to realise what is going on around her, but Tom Bates is beyond noticing.

One day on his way home from work he witnesses a handsome, well-dressed young man collapse in the street. Bates is among the passersby who offer to help him. The young man, who gives his name as Martin Taylor, quickly recovers. A few hours later he turns up at the Bates', handing Tom his wallet, which Martin pretends Tom lost in the general hubbub. Though the cash is gone, Bates' credit card is still there. Although Martin's true identity remains a mystery, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (who played Martin in the film production) has said that he believes him to be the [[Devil]].

From the moment he enters the house, he casts furtive and knowing glances at the audience (according to the stage directions) so they know at once that he is not what he pretends to be. He claims to have been Pattie's fiancé.

He offers to be at Pattie's side despite the changed circumstances, and care for her for an unspecified period of time. Amy Bates in particular jumps at the suggestion; she has not had an hour off since Pattie's accident and is stranded in the house without the chance to go even to the hairdressers or do some window-shopping.

Tom Bates is reluctant to accept Martin's help. He has always been very choosy about his daughter's friends, and as he cannot remember Pattie ever mentioning Martin's name, he does not want her to be left alone with what might well be a complete stranger. Eventually Martin wins him over by his excellent cooking and lip service to his bigotry; Tom has joined the [[British National Front|National Front]].

At the first opportunity, Martin rapes the helpless Pattie (although in the film version, the rape comes late in the action, precipitating Pattie's return to consciousness shortly after he removes her nappy). When Amy Bates comes back from the hairdressers she recognises a change in her daughter's facial expression, but attributes it to Martin's presence. However, when Martin tries to rape the disabled girl again after Mr. and Mrs. Bates have gone to bed, Pattie starts screaming so loudly that he runs out of the house. When the Bateses come to see what has happened to their daughter, they find that she has fully recovered from her disabilities, and though still confused, asks her father what has been happening to her. She also recovers her memories of the events preceding her accident, which result from her discovery of her father's infidelity.

''Brimstone and Treacle'' was originally written by Potter as a television play, commissioned, paid for and recorded in 1976 by the [[BBC]], for their ''[[Play for Today]]'' slot. The cast were [[Denholm Elliott]] (Mr. Bates), [[Michael Kitchen]] (Martin), [[Patricia Lawrence]] (Mrs. Bates) and [[Michelle Newell]] (Pattie); plus minor characters.

It was withdrawn shortly before its scheduled transmission, it was listed in the ''[[Radio Times]]'', because then Director of Television Programmes [[Alasdair Milne]] found it "nauseating" though "brilliantly made".  ''Brimstone and Treacle'' was finally shown in August 1987, and has been released as a DVD.

Rewritten by Potter for the stage, the play premiered on 11 October 1977 at the [[Crucible Theatre]], [[Sheffield]].

==Potter on ''Brimstone and Treacle''==

In 1978, Potter said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I had written ''Brimstone and Treacle'' in difficult personal circumstances. Years of acute [[psoriatic arthropathy]]—unpleasantly affecting skin and joints—had not only taken their toll in physical damage but had also, and perhaps inevitably, mediated my view of the world and the people in it. I recall writing (and the words now make me shudder) that the only meaningful [[sacrament]] left to human beings was for them to gather in the streets in order to be sick together, splashing vomit on the paving stones as the final and most eloquent plea to an apparently deaf, dumb and blind God. [...] I was engaged in an extremely severe struggle not so much against the dull grind of a painful and debilitating illness but with unresolved, almost unacknowledged, 'spiritual' questions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Building of Baku City Executive Power''' is an administrative building at [[Istiglaliyyat Street| Istiglaliyyat Street, 4]]. The building was built in Baroque style in 1900–1904 on the basis of architect Józef Gosławski's project.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev135"&gt;Şamil Fətullayev-Fiqarov-Bakının memarlıq ensiklopediyası, Bakı, Şərq-Qərb nəşriyyatı, 2013, 528 pages. p. 135-138&lt;/ref&gt; The building is the last work of architect Gosławski. After the death of Gosławski in 1904, the project was initially led by Kazimierz Skórewicz, later by [[Józef Płoszko]].

The building constructed on the order of Baku Duma is currently being used by Executive Authority of the Baku City. The building was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 2 August 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikasi Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Kazimierz Skórewicz prepared detailed sketch project with assignment of State Duma, Construction Commission, which included Gosławski, [[Józef Płoszko]], Skórewicz and [[Adolf Eichler]]. On 18 July 1898, after the Commission evaluated Skurvick's sketch project, it was decided to assign Gosławski the plan, façade works. It's unknown to determine if Gosławski used Skórewicz's ideas, since there is no sketch of Skórewicz in the archives.

==Construction==
Although the building was designed with side wings, the construction began with the main building, and the cost of such large construction was too heavy for the city treasury. On 18 May 1900, a solemn ceremony was held for groundbreaking of city duma and first administrative building of the city's personal services. The Construction Commission carefully monitored the construction progress and the quality process. Particular attention was paid to the quality of the stone chosen for facade walls, as it could have an effect not only on firmness, but also on the general impression.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev218"&gt;Bakı memarları XIX əsrin sonu-XX əsrin əvvəllərində 2013, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the eve of the construction of the first floor in the course of construction works, the governor of Baku requires the mayor to send the project to confirm it. He referred to the necessity of the governor's approval of the construction of public and private buildings for the community halls. According to some statements, Gosławski prepared a special project part of the building intended for the hall, "specially designed for the Duma sessions and designed as an amphitheater in the style of a parliamentary hall". The cost of this additional building was 51,000 rubles, and the cost of the whole building reached 441,174 rubles. Later this idea lost its importance.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev135"/&gt;
After the main construction of the building and the cleaning of the construction dump, the chief city gardener offered to plant "a garden to serve the beauty of architecture" in front of the building. He drafted the garden and in 1904 this project was implemented.

After the death of Gosławski on 15 January 1904, Skórewicz, who was appointed to manage the construction of the building, made a great effort to keep the architectural idea completely and do not load interiors by Uprava and Duma. The weakening of the construction commission, which had completed the work of the building, led to the stoppage of work to be done, and Skórewicz, who could not work without the commission's decision, demanded the commission to take over the completed work because the successful completion of the construction of the city house was dependent on it.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev221"/&gt;

Under the direction of Józef Płoszko, one of the flanks on the premises for the Upravan water pipeline department was built, based on the Gosławski's project. The construction started in the summer of 1911 was completed on 27 September 1912 and the building was handed over.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev221"&gt;Bakı memarları XIX əsrin sonu-XX əsrin əvvəllərində 2013, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The stones used for the facades of the building was shaved and prepared by the Atayev brothers (masters Salman, Aslan, Iskender, Abuzar, Eyyub) in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|İ.V.Qoslavski-"Qafqazlı Rastrelli" (1865–1904)|2013|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bricks were used on the facade of two upper floors as the artistic element of the Gosławski composition. At that time, new modern-style facing materials were beginning to be included in the structure of buildings. Since this was a very expensive material, it is not widely distributed in Baku buildings. However, in the architectural facade of the City Duma building, this color element has been an effective part of the building's history and modernity. For the second and third floors of the Gosławski's project, he included a red brick as a facing material in the overall estimate. The construction was successful and as Gosławski's report to construction commission, it was necessary to order a bricks to keep the construction going. While reviewing the history of the City Duma's construction process, it becomes evident that Gosławski was the chief architect of the city and the author of the building project, but did not have the right to act freely, and sanction of the construction commission was necessary in the solution of each issue.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev218"/&gt;

When fasading with red bricks it became clear that white flakes could not be cleaned on the bricks. At that time, Gosławski, who did not know how to deal with this difficult situation and how to solve the problem, appealed to the journal of "Civil Engineers Society news", published in St. Petersburg. In his question, Gosławski explains that the sulfuric acid solution used to remove the shingles had a negative effect on the lime stone used to cover all facades, saying that "it cannot be used, and I do not know any other method." At the same time, he was advised to familiarize himself with some articles in "Brushing and Cleaning the Brick" magazine. There is no information about the architect's use of these tips or the solution of this serious problem.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev218"&gt;Bakı memarları XIX əsrin sonu-XX əsrin əvvəllərində 2013, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tower===
[[File:Bakı şəhər İcra Hakimiyyəti binasının qülləsi.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|&lt;center&gt;Tower on the sidewalk&lt;/center&gt;]]
Difficulties appeared between the governor of Baku and the City Duma, who reported on 3 May 1901, to the commander of the civilian section in the Caucasus while building a tower directly on the front of the building. Because, any change in the plan required higher authorities permission. Based on the Gosławski project, the tower on the sidewalk reduced width of the sidewalk because it stood on the arches. 

After the approval of the tower, the price of the building reached 400,000 rubles.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev220"&gt;Bakı memarları XIX əsrin sonu-XX əsrin əvvəllərində 2013, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mayoralty of Baku facade detail 6.jpg|190px|thumbnail|right|A chained lion ornament under the central porch of the tower]]
===Development of roof cover===
At the beginning of 1902, the building was almost ready, with carpentry and roof covering started to be completed by January 1903.  In 1903, a large and expressive silhouette of the tower of the city house was selected, with a tall roof effectively worked on Nikolaevski Street. The former mayor of Baku, A. Novikov, explains why he was taking such a decision on the roof cover:
{{cquote|''"After my arrival in the city, I attended a construction commission meeting. The conversation was on the roof. Iron had to fit the estimate. I do not remember – painted or galvanized; the architect in the commission suggested that all the roof be galvanized. The difference was in the price. According to his words, it was only a few thousand rubles difference. I was opposed to wasting money and good iron, and if it were well painted, I would have been for centuries. What a pity! I was alone. It was decided to have a galvanized roof."''&lt;ref name="Fatullayev220"/&gt;}} 
In spite of the strong protest of the mayor, the construction commission did not pay attention to his idea, but allowed the architect to choose the closest choice to the overall architectural appearance of the city architecture. By the end of 1902, the construction of the house was completed without interior, and Gosławski wanted a vacation with the due to his illness. The Duma fulfilled his request, taking into account the services of the city's architect, and appointed Skórewicz as a follower of his work.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev220"/&gt;
== Architectural features==
Gosławski who respected the classic scheme of the composition, symmetrically solved the facade of the building, and expressed a vertical tower against the horizontal divisions of the main volume of the building of Duma. While preparing his own projects, he was in the position of architectural unexpectedness for urban buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|İ.V.Qoslavski-"Qafqazlı Rastrelli" (1865–1904)|2013|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building of the Duma became an important factor in construction of large and monumental buildings of different historical styles on the central street, distinguished by the high quality of architecture.
===Exterior===
The three-storeyed building of the Duma dominates the historical center of the city with the use of the Baroque motifs in the original interpretation, with the classic methods of composition. Putting tower at the center of the main façade, it combines it with organic volumes, and the whole composition was given artifacts that lacked at that time the central city highway – Nikolayevski Street. The brightly decorated facades both in general and in separate details, the proportion of divisions, the sculpture of stone details have led to the formation of the expressive facade of the Duma building. Gosławski has successfully solved the color duplication of the two upper floors with the facade element of the composition. Facing brick forms interesting color gamma between the limestone window frames, without disturbing unity of the architecture.&lt;ref name="Qoslavski84"&gt;{{Harvnb|İosif Qoslavski. Bakı şəhərinin tarixindəki memar|2013|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center of the fasad is decorated with the emblem of the city of Baku. In the middle of the emblem protected till today, three golden torchs depicting Azerbaijan as a land of fire are depicted on the blue waves.

===Interior===
The architecture of the interior is built with seriousness and severity. Gosławski used rhythm of [[Corinthian order]] pilaster. He incorporates semicircular arches in the interiors of the building as a leading compositing element in the central staircase.&lt;ref name="Qoslavski84"/&gt;

Although the Duma was allocating funds for technical specifications in the construction process, the development of the interior of the house was slow. The death of the author of the building, Gosławski, also affected the reduction of temp in completion. In order to accelerate the process, it was decided to change the architect for construction in the interior development process. In this chair, Skórewicz was replaced by Józef Płoszko, who later became known as the architect of the [[Ismailiyya Palace]]. Both of these architects had a great tact for not to go beyond the plan of Gosławski. Nevertheless, each of these architects had their own creative lineage, as they knew the construction process as they were, and that affected the building's interior space and its completion.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev223"&gt;Bakı memarları XIX əsrin sonu-XX əsrin əvvəllərində 2013, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting room===
For the first time, Gosławski used the classical order system in the interior design of the meeting room of Duma at full capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|İ.V.Qoslavski-"Qafqazlı Rastrelli" (1865–1904)|2013|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It divides the walls of the walls into arrows in three sections. The second half of the interior of the hall appears as a continuation of the first one in other interpretations, perimeters, quiet horizontal and vertical divisions, and new architectural methods. The hall's plafon completes the overall architecture of the meeting room's interior. 
Exquisite work to be used in the interior of the building required great skill. For this purpose the competition was announced, the works of three companies were presented, among which the French company, which was built by Franz's master Pojiltsov, has been declared as "satisfying the requirements with the smoothness and elegance of the painting". "Florencia" company was entrusted with painting work. This company has made painting works consisting of adhesive paint and wall panels of the ceiling in the rooms of Duma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|İ.V.Qoslavski-"Qafqazlı Rastrelli" (1865–1904)|2013|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustics===
Despite the positive architectural quality of the meeting hall, it was discovered that the acoustics were weak during the operation. Since Gosławski was ill, he could not solve the acoustics of the hall that were important to such places.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev223"/&gt; When the issue of improving the acoustics of the meeting hall emerged, it was decided to engage civil engineer [[Nikolai Bayev]], who built a magnificent acoustics at Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater by order of Mayilov brothers in 1911.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev223"/&gt;

When Bayev understood that it's not an escape from the situation, he offered to cover all the walls of the hall with a mushroom, and paint it, which was made in the concert hall of the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]], according to the new version he found to improve the acoustics of the hall. Soon they draw out linen covers, flooring carpets and heavy curtains of windows, but due to lack of funding Bayev's project could not be implemented.&lt;ref name="Fatullayev223"/&gt;

[[File:Hector berlioz.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A distinguished-looking man in his forties with medium-length hair, aquiline nose, and circa-1850 formal high collar|[[Hector Berlioz]] was the first to use the term "choral symphony" for a musical composition—his ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]''.]]

A '''choral symphony''' is a [[musical composition]] for [[orchestra]], [[choir]], and sometimes [[solo (music)|solo]] vocalists that, in its internal workings and overall musical architecture, adheres broadly to [[symphony|symphonic]] [[musical form]].&lt;ref name="kenox144"&gt;Kennedy, ''Oxford Dictionary'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "choral symphony" in this context was coined by [[Hector Berlioz]] when he described his ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'' as such in his five-paragraph introduction to that work.&lt;ref name="avant1"&gt;"Avant-Propos de l'auteur", Reiter-Biedermann's vocal score (Winterthur, 1858), p. 1. As quoted in Holoman, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The direct antecedent for the choral symphony is [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]. Beethoven's Ninth incorporates part of the ''Ode an die Freude'' ("[[Ode to Joy]]"), a poem by [[Friedrich Schiller]], with text sung by soloists and chorus in the last movement. It is the first example of a major composer's use of the human voice on the same level as instruments in a symphony.&lt;ref group=a&gt;[[Peter Winter|Peter von Winter]]'s ''Schlacht-Sinfonie'' also uses a concluding chorus. Written in 1814, it predates Beethoven's Ninth by a decade. However, as an occasional work written in one movement, the ''Schlacht-Sinfonie'' "stands outside the generic tradition of the symphony". Bonds, ''New Grove (2001)'', 24:836.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few 19th-century composers, notably [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Franz Liszt]], followed Beethoven in producing choral symphonic works. Notable works in the genre were produced in the 20th century by [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], among others. The final years of the 20th century and the opening of the 21st century have seen several new works in this genre, among them compositions by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[William Bolcom]] and [[Robert Strassburg]]&lt;ref&gt;http://milkenarchive.org/artists/view/robert-strassburg/&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "choral symphony" indicates the composer's intention that the work be symphonic, even with its fusion of narrative or dramatic elements that stems from the inclusion of words. To this end, the words are often treated symphonically to pursue non-narrative ends, by use of frequent repetition of important words and phrases, and the transposing, reordering or omission of passages of the set text. The text often determines the basic symphonic outline, while the orchestra's role in conveying the musical ideas is similar in importance to that of the chorus and soloists.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, Vaughan Williams, 444"&gt;Kennedy, ''Vaughan Williams'', 444.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a symphonic emphasis, a choral symphony is often influenced in musical form and content by an external narrative, even in parts where there is no singing.

==History==
[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man with long grey hair holding a pen and music paper|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] redefined the symphony genre by introducing words and voices in his Ninth Symphony.&lt;ref name="bonds24837"/&gt;]]
The symphony had established itself by the end of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres.&lt;ref name="bonds24835"/&gt; While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists.&lt;ref name="laruewolf24812"&gt;Larue and Wolf, ''New Grove'' (2000), 24:812&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas.&lt;ref name="bonds24835"/&gt; As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige.&lt;ref name="laruewolf24812"/&gt; A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.&lt;ref name="bonds24835"&gt;Bonds, ''New Grove (2001)'', 24:835.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824, Beethoven redefined the symphony genre in his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]] by introducing text and voice into a previously instrumental genre. His doing so sparked a debate on the future of the symphony itself.&lt;ref name="bonds24837"/&gt; Beethoven's use of words, according to [[Richard Wagner]], had shown "the limits of purely instrumental music" and marked "the end of the symphony as a vital genre".&lt;ref&gt;As cited in Bonds, ''New Grove'' (2000), 24:837.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were not sure how to proceed—whether to emulate the Ninth by writing symphonies with choral finales, or to develop the symphony genre in a purely instrumental fashion.&lt;ref name="bonds24837"&gt;Bonds, ''New Grove (2001)'', 24:837.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, the symphony was seen "as an all-embracing, cosmic drama that transcended the realm of sound alone".&lt;ref name="bonds24838"&gt;Bonds, ''New Grove (2001)'', 24:838.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some composers both emulated and expanded upon Beethoven's model. Berlioz showed in his choral symphony ''Roméo et Juliette'' a fresh approach to the epic nature of the symphony as he used voices to blend music and narrative but saved crucial moments of that narrative for the orchestra alone.&lt;ref name="bonds24837"/&gt; In doing so, Bonds writes, Berlioz illustrates for subsequent composers "new approaches for addressing the metaphysical in the realm of the symphony".&lt;ref name="bonds24837"/&gt; Mendelssohn wrote his [[Lobgesang]] as a work for chorus, soloists and orchestra. Labeling the work a "symphony-cantata", he expanded the choral finale to nine [[movement (music)|movements]] by including sections for vocal soloists, [[recitative]]s and sections for chorus; this made the vocal part longer than the three purely orchestral sections that preceded it.&lt;ref name="todd"&gt;Todd, ''New Grove (2001)'', 16:403.&lt;/ref&gt; Liszt wrote two choral symphonies, following in these multi-movement forms the same compositional practices and programmatic goals he had established in [[Symphonic poems (Liszt)|his symphonic poems]].&lt;ref name="bonds24838"/&gt;

[[File:Penderecki, Krzysztof.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A man with a grey beard: he is wearing glasses and a blue shirt.|[[Krzysztof Penderecki]] wrote his [[Symphony No. 7 (Penderecki)|Seventh Symphony]] to celebrate the third millennium of the city of Jerusalem.]]
After Liszt, Mahler took on the legacy of Beethoven in his early symphonies, in what Bonds terms "their striving for a utopian finale". Towards this end Mahler used a chorus and soloists in the finale of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Second Symphony]], the "Resurrection". In his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third]], he wrote a purely instrumental finale following two vocal movements, and in his [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth]] a vocal finale is sung by a solo [[soprano]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonds, ''New Grove (2001)'', 24:839.&lt;/ref&gt; After writing his [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Fifth]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Mahler)|Sixth]] and [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Seventh]] Symphonies as purely instrumental works, Mahler returned to the vein of "festival-symphonic ceremonial" in his [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]], which integrates text throughout the body of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''New Grove (2001)'', 15:622.&lt;/ref&gt; After Mahler, the choral symphony became a more common genre, taking a number of compositional turns in the process. Some composers, such as Britten, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich and Vaughan Williams, followed symphonic form strictly.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stcm241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schwarz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cox2115"/&gt; Others, such as [[Havergal Brian]], [[Alfred Schnittke]] and [[Karol Szymanowski]], chose either to expand symphonic form or to use different symphonic structures altogether.&lt;ref name="macdonald4"&gt;MacDonald, notes for Naxos 8.570308, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Samson, 122, 126"&gt;Samson, 122, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weitzman5"&gt;Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the history of the choral symphony, works have been composed for special occasions. One of the earliest was Mendelssohn's [[Lobgesang]], commissioned by the city of Leipzig in 1840 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention of [[movable type]].&lt;ref name="todd"/&gt; More than a century later, [[Henryk Górecki]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Górecki)|Second Symphony]], subtitled "Copernican", was commissioned in 1973 by the [[Kosciuszko Foundation]] in [[New York City|New York]] to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kosz, notes for Naxos 8.555375, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In between these two works, in 1930, conductor [[Serge Koussevitzky]] asked Stravinsky to write the ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' for the 50th anniversary of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, ''Choral Masterworks'', 265.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1946, composer [[Henry Barraud]], then head of [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|Radiodiffusion Française]], commissioned [[Darius Milhaud]] to write his [[Symphony No. 3 (Milhaud)|Third Symphony]], subtitled "Te Deum", to commemorate the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''New Grove (1980)'', 12:306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Penguin'', 774.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, more such choral symphonies were written. [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Penderecki)|Seventh Symphony]] was for the third millennium of the city of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, notes to Naxos 8.557766 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tan Dun]]'s ''Symphony 1997: Heaven Earth Mankind'' commemorated the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] that year to the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Author unknown, notes for Sony Classical SK 63368, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Glass's [[Symphony No. 5 (Glass)|Fifth Symphony]] as one of several pieces commissioned to celebrate the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="glass5"&gt;{{cite news|author=Glass, Philip|title=Notes by Philip Glass on his Fifth Symphony.|work=Nonesuch 79618-2|year=1999|url=http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/symphony_5.php|accessdate=2009-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611120123/http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/symphony_5.php|archivedate=2007-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Spicer (musician)|Paul Spicer]]'s choral symphony ''Unfinished Remembering'' (2014, libretto by Euan Tait) was commissioned to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

==General features==
Like an [[oratorio]] or an [[opera]], a choral symphony is a musical work for orchestra, choir and (often) solo voices, although a few have been written for unaccompanied voices.&lt;ref name="kenox144"/&gt; Berlioz, who in 1858 first coined the term when describing his work ''Roméo et Juliette'', explained the distinctive relationship he envisaged between voice and orchestra:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even though voices are often used, it is neither a concert opera nor a [[cantata]], but a choral symphony. If there is singing, almost from the beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the dramatic scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....&lt;ref name="avant1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike oratorios or operas, which are generally structured [[dramaturgy|dramaturgically]] into [[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s and choruses, a choral symphony is structured like a symphony, in [[Movement (music)|movements]]. It may employ the traditional four-movement scheme of a fast opening movement, slow movement, [[scherzo]] and finale,&lt;ref name="kenox144"/&gt; or as with many instrumental symphonies, it may use a different structure of movements.&lt;ref&gt;Bonds, ''New Grove (2001)'', 24:833.&lt;/ref&gt; The written text in a choral symphony shares equal standing with the music, as in an oratorio, and the chorus and soloists share equality with the instruments.&lt;ref name="stke"&gt;Steinberg, ''Choral Masterworks'', 268; Kennedy, ''Vaughan Williams'', 444.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the use of text allowed the choral symphony to evolve from an instrumental symphony with a choral finale, as in the Beethoven's Ninth, to a composition that can use voices and instruments throughout the entire composition, as in Stravinsky's ''Symphony of Psalms'' or Mahler's Eighth Symphony.&lt;ref name="stke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kenmah151"&gt;Kennedy, ''Mahler'', 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the text can give a basic outline that correlates to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Bells (poem)|The Bells]]'', a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a [[symphony]] to [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], which he followed in his choral symphony [[The Bells (Rachmaninoff)|of the same name]].&lt;ref name="stcm241"&gt;Steinberg, ''Choral Masterworks'', 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his ''Roméo et Juliette'', yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form.&lt;ref name="holoman"/&gt; It can also influence the musical content in parts where there is no singing, as in ''Roméo et Juliette''. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for [[exposition (literary technique)|expository]] and [[narrative]] sections of the work.&lt;ref name="macdonald2596"/&gt;

==Relation of words and music==
As in an oratorio, the written text in a choral symphony can be as important as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas.&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt; The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, as in the case of Rachmaninoff,&lt;ref name="stcm241"/&gt; Britten&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt; and Shostakovich,&lt;ref name="schwarz"/&gt; or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz,&lt;ref name="holoman"/&gt; Mahler&lt;ref name="franklin"/&gt; and Havergal Brian.&lt;ref name="macdonald4341"/&gt; Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski,&lt;ref name="Samson, 122, 126"/&gt; Schnittke&lt;ref name="weitzman5"/&gt; and, again, Havergal Brian.&lt;ref name="macdonald4"/&gt; The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative.&lt;ref name="ottaway"/&gt; Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;

===Musical treatment of text===
[[File:Walt Whitman - George Collins Cox.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A smiling old man with a hat, dark jacket and long grey beard|[[Walt Whitman]]'s use of free verse became appreciated by composers seeking a more fluid approach to setting text.]]

Vaughan Williams' program note for ''A Sea Symphony'' discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, "The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically."&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;Kennedy, Vaughan Williams, 444&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Walt Whitman]]'s poems inspired him to write the symphony,&lt;ref name="cox2115"&gt;Cox, ''The Symphony'', 2:115.&lt;/ref&gt; and Whitman's use of [[free verse]] became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be "pushed about by the music", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.&lt;ref name="ottaway"&gt;Ottaway, ''Vaughan Williams Symphonies'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, "Veni, Creator Spiritus", in what music writer and critic [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]] referred to as "an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations".&lt;ref name="stsy335"/&gt; He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.&lt;ref name="stsy335"&gt;Steinberg, ''The Symphony'', 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his ''[[Sinfonia antartica|Sinfonia Antartica]]'', based on his music for the film ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]'', to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Ottaway, 50, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's [[Symphony No. 7 (Glass)|Seventh Symphony]], also known as ''A Toltec Symphony'', the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed "from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture".&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{cite news|author=Freed, Richard |title=Symphony No. 7—A Toltec Symphony |work=Kennedy Center program notes |date=January 2005 |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2851 |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030119/http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2851 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and words as equals===
[[File:Igor Stravinsky LOC 32392u.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man with short hair and glasses, wearing a dark suit and leaning against a piano|[[Igor Stravinsky]] used chorus and orchestra in his ''Symphony of Psalms'' "on an equal footing".]]

Stravinsky said about the texts of his ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' that "it is not a symphony in which I have included ''Psalms'' to be sung. On the contrary, it is the singing of the ''Psalms'' that I am symphonizing".&lt;ref name="white321"&gt;White, ''Stravinsky'', 321.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was as much musical as it was textual. Stravinsky's [[counterpoint]] required several musical [[voice (polyphony)|voices]] to function simultaneously, independent [[melody|melodically]] and [[rhythm]]ically, yet interdependent [[harmony|harmonically]]. They would sound very different when heard separately, yet harmonious when heard together.&lt;ref name="white321"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachs and Dahlhaus, ''New Grove (2001)'', 6:564–569.&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate maximum clarity in this interplay of voices, Stravinsky used "a choral and instrumental ensemble in which the two elements should be on an equal footing, neither of them outweighing the other".&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky, ''Chronicles'', as cited in White, ''Stravinsky'', 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler's intent in writing his Eighth Symphony for exceptionally large forces was a similar balance between vocal and instrumental forces. It was not simply an attempt at grandiose effect,&lt;ref name="kenmah151"/&gt; though the composer's use of such forces earned the work the subtitle "Symphony of a Thousand" from his press agent (a name still applied to the symphony).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Mahler'', 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Stravinsky, Mahler makes extensive and extended use of counterpoint, especially in the first part, "Veni Creator Spiritus". Throughout this section, according to music writer [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]], Mahler displays considerable mastery in manipulating multiple independent melodic voices.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Mahler'', 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Musicologist [[Deryck Cooke]] adds that Mahler handles his huge forces "with extraordinary clarity".&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaughan Williams also insisted on a balance between words and music in ''A Sea Symphony'', writing in his program note for the work, "It is also noticeable that the orchestra has an equal share with the chorus and soloists in carrying out the musical ideas".&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt; Music critic [[Samuel Langford]], writing about the premiere of the work for ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', concurred with the composer, writing, "It is the nearest approach we have to a real choral symphony, one in which the voices are used throughout just as freely as the orchestra."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Kennedy, ''Vaughan Williams'', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Leaves of Grass: A Choral Symphony'', [[Robert Strassburg]] composed a symphonic "musical setting" in ten movements for the poetry of Walt Whiteman while balancing the contributions of a narrator, a chorus and an orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milkenarchive.org/artists/view/robert-strassburg/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Words determining symphonic form===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-18684-0002, Dresden, Tod Stalin, Parade KVP.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man with dark hair and moustache, wearing a uniform, posted over a military parade|[[Yevgeny Yevtushenko|Yevtushenko]]'s poems about the terror under Stalin (pictured) and other Soviet abuses inspired Shostakovich to write his Thirteenth Symphony]]

Rachmaninoff's choral symphony ''The Bells'' reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem.&lt;ref name="stcm241"/&gt; Britten reversed the pattern for his ''[[Spring Symphony]]''—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, "the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view."&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;Britten, Benjamin, "A Note on the Spring Symphony", ''Music Survey'', Spring 1950. As quoted in White, ''Britten'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gestation of Shostakovich's [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Thirteenth Symphony]], ''Babi Yar'', was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem ''[[Babi Yar]]'' by [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition.&lt;ref name="maes366"/&gt; Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection ''Vzmakh ruki'' (''A Wave of the Hand'') prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with "A Career" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing ''Babi Yar's'' theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses:&lt;ref name="maes366"/&gt; "'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity".&lt;ref name="maes366"&gt;Maes, 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.&lt;ref name="schwarz"&gt;Schwarz, ''New Grove (1980)'', 17:270.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled "Das Siegeslied" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly [[chromaticism|chromatic]] martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces.&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, ''The Symphony'', 2:143–144; MacDonald, notes for Naxos 8.570308, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Szymanowski allowed the text by 13th-century Persian poet [[Rumi]] to dictate what Dr. Jim Samson calls the "single tripartite movement"&lt;ref&gt;Samson, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and "overall arch structure"&lt;ref&gt;Samson, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; of his Third Symphony, subtitled "Song of the Night".

===Words expanding symphonic form===
[[File:Gustav-Mahler-Kohut.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A middle-aged man with glasses and dark hair, wearing a circa-1890s dark suit|[[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] first expanded the model set by Beethoven's Ninth, then abandoned it.]]
A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] prepared for his ''Roméo et Juliette''. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the "Queen Mab Scherzo" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows.&lt;ref name="holoman"&gt;Holoman, 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, "as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the ''[[Symphonie fantastique|[Symphonie] Fantastique]]'', both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its ''potpourri'' of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work]."&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Second Symphony]], the "Resurrection", the vocal fourth movement, "Urlicht", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale.&lt;ref name="franklin"&gt;Franklin, ''New Grove (2001)'', 15:618.&lt;/ref&gt; He then abandoned this pattern for his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]], as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone.&lt;ref name="Mitchell, New Grove, 11:515"&gt;Mitchell, ''New Grove'', 11:515.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mahler, [[Havergal Brian]] expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his [[Symphony No. 1 "The Gothic" (Brian)|Symphony No. 1 "The Gothic"]]. Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's ''[[Faust]]'' and Gothic cathedral architecture.&lt;ref name="macdonald4341"&gt;MacDonald, ''New Grove (2001)'', 4:341.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the ''[[Te Deum]]''.&lt;ref name="macdonald4341"/&gt;

==Symphonies for unaccompanied chorus==
A few composers have written symphonies for unaccompanied chorus, in which the choir performs both vocal and instrumental functions. [[Granville Bantock]] composed three such works—''Atalanta in Calydon'' (1911), ''Vanity of Vanities'' (1913) and ''A Pageant of Human Life'' (1913). His ''Atalanta'', called by musicologist Herbert Antcliffe "the most important [work of the three] alike in technical experiment and in inspiration",&lt;ref&gt;Antcliffe, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; was written for a choir of at least 200, the composer specifying "'not less than 10 voices for each part,'" a work with 20 separate vocal parts.&lt;ref name="mcveagh5"&gt;Cited in McVeagh, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Using these forces, Bantock formed groups "of different weights and colors to get something of the varied play of tints and perspective [of an orchestra]".&lt;ref name="mcveagh6"&gt;Musicologist Ernest Newman, cited in McVeagh, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the choir is generally divided into three sections, approximating the timbres of woodwinds, brass and strings.&lt;ref name="antcliffe338"&gt;Antcliffe, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Within these divisions, Antcliffe writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Almost every possible means of vocal expression is employed separately or in combination with others. To hear the different parts of the choir describing in word and tone "laughter" and "tears" respectively at the same time is to realize how little the possibilities of choral singing have as yet been grasped by the ordinary conductor and composer. Such combinations are extremely effective when properly achieved, but they are very difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name="antcliffe338"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roy Harris]] wrote his Symphony for Voices in 1935 for ''[[a cappella]]'' choir split into eight parts. Harris focused on harmony, rhythm and dynamics, allowing the text by Walt Whitman to dictate the choral writing.&lt;ref name="profitt"&gt;Profitt, notes for Albany TROY 164.&lt;/ref&gt; "In a real sense, the human strivings so vividly portrayed in Whitman's poetry find a musical analog to the trials to which the singers are subjected", John Profitt writes both of the music's difficulty for performers and of its highly evocative quality.&lt;ref name="profitt"/&gt; [[Malcolm Williamson]] wrote his Symphony for Voices between 1960 and 1962, setting texts by Australian poet [[James McAuley]]. Lewis Mitchell writes that the work is not a symphony in any true sense, but rather a four-movement work preceded by an invocation for solo [[contralto]].&lt;ref name="mitchell2"&gt;Mitchell, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is a combination of poems celebrating the Australian wilderness and visionary Christianity, its jagged lines and rhythms matched by the music.&lt;ref name="mitchell2"/&gt; Mitchell writes, "Of all his choral works, with the possible exception of the Requiem for a Tribe Brother, the Symphony is the most Australian in feeling".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmatic intent==
[[File:OldCity07.JPG|thumb|alt=An archway and gate in a large stone wall|[[Jaffa Gate]] in Jerusalem. Penderecki's Seventh Symphony, subtitled "Seven Gates of Jerusalem", is "pervaded by the number 'seven' at various levels".&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt;]]
Some recent efforts have paid less attention to symphonic form and more to programmic intent. [[Hans Werner Henze]] wrote his 1997 [[Symphony No. 9 (Henze)|Ninth Symphony]] in seven movements, basing the structure of the symphony on the novel ''[[The Seventh Cross]]'' by [[Anna Seghers]]. The novel recounts the flight of seven fugitives from a [[Nazis|Nazi]] prison camp, the seven crosses symbolizing the seven death sentences; the ordeal of the one prisoner who makes it to freedom becomes the crux of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Schluren, notes to EMI 56513, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Penderecki's Seventh Symphony, subtitled "Seven Gates of Jerusalem" and originally conceived as an oratorio, is not only written in seven movements but, musicologist Richard Whitehouse writes, is "pervaded by the number 'seven' at various levels."&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt; An extensive system of seven-note phrases binds the work together, as well as the frequent use of seven notes repeated at a single pitch.&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt; Seven chords played ''fortissimo'' bring the work to a close.&lt;ref name="whitehouse"&gt;Whitehouse, notes to Naxos 8.557766, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Glass's Fifth Symphony, completed in 1999 and subtitled "[[Requiem]], [[Bardo]] and [[Trikaya|Nirmanakaya]]", is written in 12 movements to fulfill its programmatic intent. Glass writes, "My plan has been for the symphony to represent a broad spectrum of many of the world's great 'wisdom' traditions",&lt;ref name="glass5"/&gt; synthesizing "a vocal text that begins before the world's creation, passes through earthly life and paradise, and closes with a future dedication".&lt;ref name="glass5"/&gt; Glass writes that he considered the millennium at the beginning of the 21st century to be a symbolic bridge between past, present and spiritual rebirth.&lt;ref name="glass5"/&gt;

More recently, Glass based the philosophical and musical structure for his Seventh Symphony on the [[Huichol people|Wirrarika]] sacred trinity.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt; Glass wrote about the work's respective movement headings and their relation to the overall structure of the symphony, "'The Corn' represents a direct link between Mother Earth and the well-being of human beings.... 'The Sacred Root' is found in the high deserts of north and central Mexico, and is understood to be the doorway to the world of the Spirit. 'The Blue Deer' is considered the holder of the Book of Knowledge. Any man or woman who aspires to be a 'Person of Knowledge' will, through arduous training and effort, have to encounter the Blue Deer...."&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;

===Words changing programmatic intent===
Addition of a text can effectively change the programmatic intent of a composition, as with the two choral symphonies of [[Franz Liszt]]. Both the [[Faust Symphony|''Faust'']] and ''[[Dante Symphony|Dante]]'' symphonies were conceived as purely instrumental works and only later became choral symphonies.&lt;ref&gt;Shulstad, 217, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Liszt authority [[Humphrey Searle]] asserts that Liszt's later inclusion of a chorus effectively sums up ''Faust'' and makes it complete,&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''The Symphony'', 1:269.&lt;/ref&gt; another Liszt expert, Reeves Shulstad, suggests that Liszt changed the work's dramatic focus to the point of meriting a different interpretation of the work itself.&lt;ref name="shulstad217"/&gt; According to Shulstad, "Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to [[Gretchen]] and an ... orchestral peroration in [[C (musical note)|C major]], based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. One might say that this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination".&lt;ref name="shulstad217"&gt;Shulstad, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a "Chorus mysticus", the male chorus singing the final words from Goethe's ''Faust''.&lt;ref name="shulstad217"/&gt; The tenor soloist, accompanied by the chorus, sings the last two lines of the text. "With the addition of the 'Chorus Mysticus' text", Shulstad writes, "the Gretchen theme has been transformed and she no longer appears as a masked Faust. With this direct association to the final scene of the drama we have escaped Faust's imaginings and are hearing another voice commenting on his striving and redemption".&lt;ref&gt;Shulstad, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Two men standing on a mountain top watching rings of angels circling overhead|From ''Paradiso'' Canto 31 by [[Dante Alighieri]]. Illustration by [[Gustave Doré]]. Dante's hearing the music of Heaven from afar.]]
Likewise, Liszt's inclusion of a choral finale in his [[Dante Symphony|''Dante'' Symphony]] changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow the structure of the ''[[Divina Commedia]]'' and compose ''Dante'' in three movements—one each for the ''Inferno'', ''Purgatorio'' and ''Paradiso''. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a [[Magnificat]], at the end of the second.&lt;ref&gt;Shulstad, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of [[Heaven]] and hear its music from afar.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, "Liszt, Franz", ''New Grove'', 11:45.&lt;/ref&gt; Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.&lt;ref name="bonds24838"/&gt;

Conversely, a text can also spark the birth of a choral symphony, only for that work to become a purely instrumental one when the programmatic focus of the work changes. Shostakovich originally planned his [[Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich)|Seventh Symphony]] as a single-movement choral symphony much like his [[Symphony No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Second]] and [[Symphony No. 3 (Shostakovich)|Third Symphonies]]. Shostakovich reportedly intended to set a text for the Seventh from the Ninth Psalm, on the theme of vengeance for the shedding of innocent blood.&lt;ref name="volktest184"&gt;Volkov, ''Testimony'', 184; Arnshtam interview with Sofiya Khentova in Khentova, ''In Shostakovich's World'' (Moscow, 1996), 234, as quoted in Wilson, 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this he was influenced by Stravinsky; he had been deeply impressed with the latter's ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'', which he wanted to emulate in this work.&lt;ref name="volkss175"&gt;Volkov, ''Shostakovich and Stalin'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Ninth Psalm's theme conveyed Shostakovich's outrage over Stalin's oppression,&lt;ref name="vosp427"&gt;Volkov, ''St. Petersburg'', 427.&lt;/ref&gt; a public performance of a work with such a text would have been impossible before the German invasion. Hitler's aggression made the performance of such a work feasible, at least in theory; the reference to "blood" could then be associated at least officially with Hitler.&lt;ref name="vosp427"/&gt; With Stalin appealing to the Soviets' patriotic and religious sentiments, the authorities were no longer suppressing [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] themes or images.&lt;ref&gt;Volkov, ''St. Petersburg'', 427–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Shostakovich eventually realized that the work encompassed far more than this symbology.&lt;ref name="stsy557"&gt;Steinberg, ''The Symphony'', 557.&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the symphony to the traditional four movements and made it purely instrumental.&lt;ref name="stsy557"/&gt;

===Supplanting text wordlessly===
While Berlioz allowed the programmatic aspects of his text to shape the symphonic form of ''Roméo'' and to guide its content, he also showed how an orchestra could supplant such a text wordlessly to further illustrate it.&lt;ref name="macdonald2596"/&gt; He wrote in his preface to ''Roméo'':

[[File:Romeo and juliet brown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A painting of a woman dressed in clothing circa 1600 standing on a balcony, being kissed by a man who has climbed up to her from outside the building|Berlioz allowed text to dictate symphonic form in [[Romeo and Juliet|''Roméo'']] but allowed the music to supplant the text wordlessly.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;If, in the famous garden and cemetery scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician that he had to give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.&lt;ref name="avant1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a manifesto, this paragraph became significant for the amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words.&lt;ref name="macdonald2596"&gt;MacDonald, ''New Grove (1980)'', 2:596.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in ''Roméo'', Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony.&lt;ref name="Temperley, ''New Grove'', 18:460"&gt;Temperley, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:460.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.&lt;ref name="bonds24837"/&gt;

More recently, Alfred Schnittke allowed the programmatic aspects of his texts to dictate the course of both his choral symphonies even when no words were being sung. Schnittke's six-movement [[Symphony No. 2 (Schnittke)|Second Symphony]], following the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref name="moody"/&gt; works programmatically on two levels simultaneously. While soloists and chorus briefly perform the mass, set to chorales taken from the [[Gradual]],&lt;ref name="ivashkin5"&gt;Ivashkin, notes for Chandos 9519, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; the orchestra provides an extended running commentary that can continue much longer than the section of the mass being performed. Sometimes the commentary follows a particular chorale but more often is freer and wider ranging in style.&lt;ref name="ivashkin5"/&gt; Despite the resulting stylistic disparity, biographer Alexander Ivashkin comments, "musically almost all these sections blend the choral [sic] tune and subsequent extensive orchestral 'commentary.'"&lt;ref name="ivashkin5"/&gt; The work becomes what Schnittke called an "Invisible Mass",&lt;ref&gt;As cited in Ivanskin, notes to Chandos 9519, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ivashkin termed "a symphony against a chorale backdrop".&lt;ref name="ivashkin5"/&gt;

The program in Schnittke's [[Symphony No. 4 (Schnittke)|Fourth Symphony]], reflecting the composer's own religious dilemma at the time it was written,&lt;ref name="ivashkin161"/&gt; is more complex in execution, with the majority of it expressed wordlessly. In the 22 variations that make up the symphony's single movement,&lt;ref group=a&gt;The actual number of variations in the Schnittke Fourth Symphony is "a subtle non-synchronicity" of the piece, considering the "3 by 5 scheme" of the Rosary these variations are reportedly based on. Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Schnittke enacts the 15 traditional [[:Category:Mysteries of the Rosary|Mysteries of the Rosary]], which highlight important moments in the life of Christ.&lt;ref name="ivashkin165"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; As he did in the Second Symphony, Schnittke simultaneously gives a detailed musical commentary on what is being portrayed.&lt;ref name="ivashkin165"/&gt; Schnittke does this while using church music from the Catholic, [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] faiths, the orchestral texture becoming extremely dense from the many musical strands progressing at the same time.&lt;ref name="moody"&gt;Moody, ''New Grove (2001)'', 22:566.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ivashkin161"&gt;Ivashkin, ''Schnittke'', 161.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tenor]] and a [[countertenor]] also sing wordlessly at two points in the symphony. The composition saves words for a finale that uses all four types of church music [[counterpoint|contrapuntally]]&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; as a four-part choir sings the ''[[Ave Maria (prayer)|Ave Maria]]''.&lt;ref name="ivashkin161"/&gt; The choir can choose whether to sing the ''Ave Maria'' in Russian or Latin.&lt;ref name="ivashkin161"/&gt; The programmatic intent of using these different types of music, Ivashkin writes, is an insistence by the composer "on the idea ... of the unity of humanity, a synthesis and harmony among various manifestations of belief".&lt;ref name="ivashkin165"&gt;Ivashkin, ''Schnittke'', 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copenhagen''' is the name of [[East West Theatre Company]]'s theatre production of [[Copenhagen (play)|the same name]]; written by [[Michael Frayn]] and directed by Nermin Hamzagic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MESS International Theatre Festival: ''Catalogue''|url=http://www.mess.ba/2009/en/program/catalogue_entry/41/|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show is Nermin Hamzagic's  first professional directorial engagement and it was soon followed by a documentary called ''Dreamers'' which was selected for screening at [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] 09 and Jihlava documentary film festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEE FILM: ''Dreamers U.S. Premiere''|url=http://seefilmla.org/drupal/program/youth/dreamers/|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Copenhagen'' tells a story of two nuclear physicists and a wife of one of them. [[Werner Heisenberg]] was one of the founders of [[quantum mechanics]] and he also discovered [[the Uncertainty Principle]]. [[Niels Bohr]], Heisenberg’s professor, was one of the scientists whose findings played a crucial role in understanding of structure of [[atom]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. 

''Copenhagen'', directed by Nermin Hamzagic, was played at a derelict and abandoned Memorial to the Victims of WW II, [[Vraca Memorial Park]] in [[Sarajevo]] near the so-called inter-entity boundary drawned during the 1991-1995 [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East West Theatre Company: ''Copenhagen, Our Story''|url=http://eastwest.ba/copenhagen/|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also performed during [[East West Theatre Company]]'s summer festival called ''Summer Begins With East West'' in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studentski Oglasi: ''Play "Kopenhagen"'' - In Bosnian|url=http://www.studentskioglasi.ba/cool-kultura/3962-ljeto-pocinje-sa-east-west-centrom/|accessdate = December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Tynan O'Mahony''' (6 July 1936{{spaced ndash}}10 March 2005), better known as '''Dave Allen''', was an Irish [[observational comedy|observational comedian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Double|first1=Oliver|title=Stand-Up! on being a comedian|date=1997|contribution=Dave Allen|publisher=Methuen Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0413703200|page=140|quote=This was quite an innovation, because up to this point there had been no tradition of observational comedy in British stand-up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[satire|satirist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaither|first1=Carl C. &amp; Alma E.|title=Gaither's Dictionary of Scientific Quotations|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-1114-7|page=906|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially becoming known in Australia during 1963–64, Allen made regular television appearances in the United Kingdom from the later 1960s and until the mid-1980s. The [[BBC]] aired his ''Dave Allen Show'' 1972–1986,&lt;ref&gt;BBC's released DVD (this copy for Sweden and Finland), back side of its cover states (translated from Swedish "The best sketches 1971–1986 with Dave Allen" (a combination of him sitting in his famous chair, drinking, smoking and telling jokes - and his sketches)&lt;/ref&gt; which was also exported to several other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;The mentioned DVD clearly supports at least Sweden and Finland&lt;/ref&gt; His career had a major resurgence during the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the height of his career he was Britain's most controversial comedian, regularly provoking indignation at his frequent highlighting of political hypocrisy and disregard for religious authority. His television shows were also broadcast in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand.

==Early life==
David Tynan O'Mahony was born in [[Firhouse]], [[Dublin]], Ireland, the youngest of three sons&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; of Gerard "Cully" Tynan O'Mahony, managing editor of ''[[The Irish Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries | title=Dave Allen: Irreverent comedian whose reflective monologues provoked outrage and delight | first=Stephen | last=Dixon | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=12 March 2005 | accessdate=4 January 2014 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an English mother, Jean Archer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;ti=0&amp;r=an&amp;db=ONSmarriage1984&amp;F2=O%27Mahony&amp;F4=1a&amp;F5=1402&amp;F0=Archer&amp;rank=0&amp;gss=angs-d&amp;pcat=BMD_MARRIAGE&amp;fh=0&amp;h=50606886&amp;recoff= |title=Ancestry.com |publisher=Search.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=6 January 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers were John and Peter.&lt;ref name="GOC"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Robin Brown (Director) |date=19 April 2013 |title=Dave Allen: God's Own Comedian |medium=Television documentary |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s94tc |accessdate =12 November 2014 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Two]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mahony left school aged 16, after attending the secondary school at [[Newbridge College]], [[Terenure College]] and the [[Catholic University School]], and followed his father into [[journalism]]. He joined the ''Drogheda Argus'' as a [[copy boy]], but at the age of 19 went to [[London]].

==Career==
He drifted through a series of jobs, before becoming a [[Redcoats (Butlins)|Butlins Redcoat]] at [[Skegness]] in a troupe that also included the British jazz trumpeter and writer [[John Chilton]].  At the end of each summer season he did stand-ups at [[Striptease|strip]] clubs and for the next four years appeared in night clubs, theatres and working men's clubs. When entertainment work was slow he sold toys in a [[Sheffield]] store and also worked as a door-to-door draught-excluder salesman.  He changed his stage surname to "Allen" on the prompting of his agent, who believed that few people in Britain could pronounce "O'Mahony" correctly. Allen himself hoped that a surname beginning with "A" would put him at the top of any agent's list.

Allen lost the top of his left forefinger above the middle knuckle after catching it in a machine cog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Caden |date=20 February 2005 |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/fingered-at-last-the-truth-behind-the-comedians-missing-digit-26205189.html |title=Fingered at last: the truth behind the comedian's missing digit |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he enjoyed inventing stories to explain the loss, which became a minor part of his act. One version was that his brother John had surprised him by snapping his jaw shut when they were children, resulting in him biting it off. A further explanation he gave on his programme, ''Dave Allen at Large'', was that he often stuck his finger in his whiskey glass, and it had been eaten away by strong drink. He also said it was worn away from repeatedly brushing the dust from his suit. One of his stand-up jokes was that, when he was a boy, he and his friends would go see a cowboy movie at the local cinema, then come out all ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Staring down at his truncated finger, he would mutter, "I had a sawn-off shotgun." On his show he told a long, elaborate ghost story, ending with "something evil" attacking Allen in a dark and haunted house. Allen grabbed and bit the attacker, the studio lights came back up, and it was his own left hand.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Story related in "Dave Allen at Peace", Telemovie 9partially fictionalised), BBC, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen's first television appearance was on the BBC talent show ''New Faces'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/collections/p00btrgb/video/p00fprzc/spike_milligans_q_the_cash_machine/ "Great Irish Comedians"], BBC Comedy  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321163125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/collections/p00btrgb/video/p00fprzc/spike_milligans_q_the_cash_machine/ |date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted pop music shows in the early 1960s, including tours by [[Adam Faith]] and [[Helen Shapiro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/bradford_timeline/5548903853/in/set-72157626323725628/ |title=Helen Shapiro tour programme, 1961 |author=Bradford Timeline |work=Flickr |year=2011 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 1963 was the compère of a [[The Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour|tour of Britain]], headlined by Shapiro, that also included [[The Beatles]], then starting to become well known. In 1962 he had toured [[South Africa]] with American vaudeville star [[Sophie Tucker]], whom he described as "one of the most charming and delightful performers with whom I have ever worked". Tucker was impressed with him and suggested that he try his luck in Australia. Moving there, he worked with [[Digby Wolfe]] on Australian television, becoming Wolfe's resident comedian.

While on tour in Australia in 1963, he quickly proved successful and accepted an offer to headline a television talk show with [[Nine Network|Channel 9]], ''Tonight with Dave Allen'', which was also successful. However, only six months after his television début he was banned from the Australian airwaves when, during a live broadcast, he told his show's producer—who had been pressing him to go to a commercial break—to "go away and masturbate", so that he could continue an entertaining interview with [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The ban was dropped quietly as Allen's popularity continued unabated.

Allen returned to the United Kingdom in 1964 and made a number of appearances on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], including ''The Blackpool Show'' and ''[[Val Parnell]]'s [[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'', and on the BBC on ''[[Val Doonican|The Val Doonican Show]]''. In 1967 he hosted his own comedy/chat series, ''Tonight with Dave Allen'', made by [[Associated Television|ATV]], which earned him the [[Variety, the Children's Charity|Variety Club's]] ITV Personality of the Year Award.

He signed with the BBC in 1968 and appeared on ''The Dave Allen Show'', a variety/comedy sketch series. This was followed from 1971-79 by ''Dave Allen at Large''.  The theme tune for ''The Dave Allen Show'' and ''Dave Allen at Large'', written by [[Alan Hawkshaw]], was "Blarney's Stoned" (originally recorded for [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]] in 1969 under the title "Studio 69").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/tvthemes2.htm 'Off the telly' website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228123122/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/tvthemes2.htm |date=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shows introduced his solo joke-telling-while-sitting-on-a-stool-and-drinking routine. This stand-up routine by Allen led to sketches that continued the themes touched on in the preceding monologues. Meanwhile, he began to appear in theatre. In 1972 he acted as a doctor in the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]]'s production of [[Edna O'Brien]]'s play ''A Pagan Place''. With family friend [[Maggie Smith]]&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; in the lead, he appeared in ''[[Peter Pan]]'' in a run during 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1485435/Dave-Allen.html |title=Dave Allen |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 March 2005 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974. Allen played the roles of [[George Darling (Peter Pan)|Mr Darling]] and [[Captain Hook]] in the production at the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce K. |last=Hanson |title=Peter Pan on Stage and Screen: 1904–2010 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen made ''The Dave Allen Show in Australia'' (1975–1977) for his old employers, Channel 9.

Allen was also a social commentator, appearing in several television documentaries for ITV, beginning with ''Dave Allen in the Melting Pot'' (1969), looking at life in [[New York City]] and dealing with issues such as racism and drugs. Later programmes included ''Dave Allen in Search of the Great English Eccentric'' (1974) and ''Eccentrics at Play'' (1974), in which he looked at [[Eccentricity (behavior)|colourful characters]] with idiosyncratic passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayward|first=Anthony |title=Dave Allen (obituary)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dave-allen-5838.html |accessdate=6 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 March 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Both the BBC and Dave Allen received death threats from the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and the [[Provisional IRA]]" {{cn|date=November 2018}}
 
Allen's satirizing of religious ritual, especially Catholic, throughout each episode of ''Dave Allen at Large'' caused minor controversy, which - coupled with sometimes comparatively frank material - earned the show a risqué reputation. In 1977 the Irish state broadcaster [[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]] placed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on Allen. Routines included sketches showing the Pope (played by Allen) and his cardinals doing a striptease to music ("[[The Stripper]]") on the steps of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]], aggressive priests beating their parishioners and other priests, priests who spoke like [[Dalek]]s through electronic confessionals, and an extremely excitable Pope who spoke in a [[Chico Marx]] style accent as he ordered Allen to "getta your bum outta Roma!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Dave Allen |year=2005 |editor-first=Graham |editor-last=McCann |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he played a troubled property man suffering a mid-life crisis in [[Alan Bennett]]'s television play ''One Fine Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137997/ |title=One Fine Day (TV Movie 1979) |work=IMDb |year=2014  |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New seasons of the comedy series, now titled ''Dave Allen'', were broadcast from 1981 until 1990.

===Later career===
His final series for the BBC in 1990 caused controversy with a joke:&lt;ref name="Newley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newley|first=Patrick|date=March 2005|title=Obituaries: Dave Allen|journal=The Stage|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2005/03/dave-allen/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/mar/11/broadcasting.uknews|title=Dave Allen dies aged 68 |last=Plunkett|first=John|date=11 March 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1990/jan/16/offensive-language|title=Offensive Language|date=16 January 1990|work=Hansard HC Deb|pages=vol 165 c173W|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We spend our lives on the run. We get up by the clock, eat and sleep by the clock, go to work by the clock, get up again, go to work – and then we retire. And what do they fucking give us? A clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxNz_9FlxNw|title=Video of Show|date=11 January 1990|work="offensive language"|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This prompted MP [[Robert Hayward]] to ask a [[question time|parliamentary question]] about "offensive language" in broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Newley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plunkett" /&gt; In 1993 Allen returned to ITV, where he starred in the ''Dave Allen Show'', which was his final regular television series.

By the late 1990s Allen was living quietly in semi-retirement at home in [[Holland Park]], west London. A keen amateur artist, he continued to exhibit his paintings.&lt;ref name = "telegraph"/&gt; He had given up cigarettes in the 1980s, having smoked regularly during earlier television appearances. A comedy skit in 1994 talked not only about quitting smoking but hating the smell of smoke. The 90s saw him make occasional chat show appearances and discuss his career in the six-part ''The Unique Dave Allen'' (BBC, 1998), in between clips from his past BBC series.

As he grew older, he brought a rueful awareness of aging to his material, with reflections on the antics of teenagers and the sagging skin and sprouting facial hair of age. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the [[British Comedy Awards]] in 1996.

==Material==
===Act===
Allen's act was typified by a relaxed, rueful and intimate style. He sat on a high bar stool facing his audience, smoking and occasionally sipping from a glass of what he always allowed people to assume was whiskey but in fact was merely ginger ale with ice. He was a sober-minded man, and although he sometimes appeared crotchety and irritable on stage he always gave off an air of charm and serene melancholy, both in his act and in real life. Each day he pored over newspapers, scribbling notes and ideas for his routines. Along with his seated stand-up routines his television shows were interspersed with filmed sketch comedy.

===Religion===
He was a religious sceptic&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1485435/Dave-Allen.html |title=Dave Allen obituary |publisher=''Daily Telegraph'' |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=29 May 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to Allen, "what you might call a practising [[Atheism|atheist]]", and often joked, "I'm an atheist, thank God") as a result of his deeply held objections to the rigidity of his strict Catholic schooling. Consequently religion became an important subject for his humour, especially the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Church of England]], generally mocking church customs and rituals rather than beliefs. In 1998 he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The hierarchy of everything in my life has always bothered me. I'm bothered by power. People, whoever they might be, whether it's the government, or the policeman in the uniform, or the man on the door—they still irk me a bit. From school, from the first nun that belted me—people used to think of the nice sweet little ladies—they used to knock the fuck out of you, in the most cruel way that they could. They'd find bits of your body that were vulnerable to intense pain—grabbing you by the ear, or by the nose, and lift you, and say 'Don't cry!' It's very hard not to cry. I mean, not from emotion, but pain. The priests were the same. And I sit and watch politicians with great cynicism, total cynicism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of his act Allen always raised his glass and quietly toasted his audience with the words "Goodnight, thank you, and may your God go with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10026098/Dave-Allen-Gods-Own-Comedian-BBC2-review.html|title=Dave Allen – God's Own Comedian, BBC2, review|first=Martin|last=Chilton|date=28 December 2014|newspaper=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on others==
Highly regarded in Britain, Allen's comic technique and style had a lasting influence on many young British comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1999_May/ai_54738758/ |title=Mark Thomas: method and madness of a TV comic |first=Amy |last=Otchet |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |year=May 1999 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126160232/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1999_May/ai_54738758/ |archivedate=26 January 2012 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; His targets were often figures of authority, his style was observational rather than gag-driven, and his language frequently ripe;  as such he was a progenitor for the "alternative" comedians of the 1980s. In his native Ireland, he always remained somewhat controversial. His mocking of the Catholic Church made him unpopular amongst some Irish Catholics, while his mocking of the [[Ulster]] Protestant leader [[Ian Paisley, Baron Bannside|Ian Paisley]] made him unpopular amongst many [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].  

In a 2017 interview with [[Howard Stern]], [[Adam Sandler]] attributed Dave Allen as one of his first comedic influences when he saw his act at the Nevele hotel at the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-O3VjdmbzA|title=Howard Stern Show April 12 2017|first=|last=|date=13 April 2017|publisher=Howard Stern|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1964 Allen married actress Judith Stott, whom he had met in Australia. The marriage ended in divorce in 1983. Their son, Edward James Tynan O'Mahony (professionally Ed Allen), is also a comedian.

Allen's hobbies included painting, which he became increasingly enthusiastic about in his later years. His first exhibition, ''Private Views'', was held in [[Edinburgh]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZvGmocvz_SYJ:https://www.scotsman.com/news/celebrity/final-bow-for-comic-who-put-the-alternative-into-comedy-1-739337+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=jp=|title=Final Bow for Comic who put the Alternative into Comedy |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=  12 March 2005|accessdate=8 January 2017 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He died peacefully in his sleep as a result of [[Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome]] at his home in [[Kensington]], London, on 10 March 2005 at the age of 68. He was survived by Karin Tynan O'Mahony (née Stark), his wife of 18 months who had been his partner since 1986,&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; and his three children from his first marriage: his children Edward and Jane, and stepson Jonathan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-428602/Dave-Allen-leaves-3m--adopted-daughter.html |title=Dave Allen leaves £3m in his will... but nothing to his adopted daughter |publisher=[[Mail Online]] |date= 13 January 2007|accessdate=6 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a son of his first wife. Three weeks after Allen's death Karin gave birth to their son, Cullen.

A dramatisation of Allen's life and career, entitled ''Dave Allen At Peace'', was shown on [[RTÉ One]] and [[BBC Two]] in 2018, with [[Aidan Gillen]] portraying the comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/14/daveallen |title=BBC programme information, |accessdate=25 March 2018 |publisher=BBC Media Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4897">'''De-Mail''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[E-Government]] communications service that makes it possible to exchange [[legal document|legal]] [[electronic document]]s between citizens, agencies, and businesses over the Internet. The project called Bürgerportal is realized by the German government in cooperation with private business partners in an effort to reduce communication costs of administration and companies.

The project was announced in 2008 and has been accepted by [[Bundestag]] and [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in early 2011. The De-Mail law (which serves as the legal basis for the service) went into effect on May 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzestexte/de_mail_gesetz.pdf?__blob=publicationFile Federal Ministry of the Interior]: De-Mail Law, May 2nd 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
With the introduction of De-Mail the German legislation implements the [[European Union|EU]] [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which demands that authorities accept [[legally binding]] electronic communications by the end of 2009.

The government specifies legal and technical requirements for the services, but does not provide the services. The services are provided by private companies which are allowed to provide De-Mail services after an official [[certification]] process.

== Services ==
Besides email communication, other services are specified that support the communication process.

* '''De-Mail''' is the email communication service which also specifies several ''options'' commonly known from postal mail, such as [[registered mail]], personal delivery (delivery only to the recipient, not to any representatives), delivery and pick-up notifications.
* '''De-Mail accounts''' can be registered by individuals and companies and require identification of the applicant. Email addresses for individuals have the form &lt;Firstname&gt;.&lt;Lastname&gt;@&lt;De-Mail-Provider&gt;.de-mail.de (but can also be registered for pseudonyms if marked as such); companies can also register subdomains in the form of &lt;Domain-Name&gt;.de-mail.de.
* '''De-Ident''' allows users to request signed [[Identity document|proof of identity]] from their provider (based on the identification during the account sign-up process) which can then be forwarded via De-Mail to e.g. online shops to provide proof of identity, age, etc.
* '''De-Safe''' provides users with encrypted online storage for documents. Usage of this service does, however, not fulfill the legal storage and archiving requirements for documents.

== Usage ==
Usage should be voluntary for all users, and should only be an additional option to postal mail.

== Criticism ==
Several aspects of the law have sparked criticism of the system.

* Communication between De-Mail and regular email addresses is not possible. The same applies to clients using the ''electronic court and administration mail'' ([[:de:Elektronisches Gerichts- und Verwaltungspostfach|Elektronisches Gerichts- und Verwaltungspostfach]]) which already provides legal electronic communication between courts and other participating governmental organizations.

The '''Dictionary of Art Historians''' (DAH) is an [[Internet encyclopedia project|online encyclopedia]] of topics relating to [[art historian]]s, [[art critic]]s and their dictionaries.  The mission of the project is to provide free, reliable, English-language information on published art historians.

The DAH was started in 1986 as a notecard project indexing art historians by the editors Lee R. Sorensen and Monique Daniels.&lt;ref name=DAH&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about Mission statement and history of the DAH]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the project was migrated to the internet and in 2010 the project was adopted by the art history department of [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wlu.edu/details.php?resID=604 Entry for the DAH] on library website of Washington and Lee university&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the project was adopted by the [http://www.dukewired.org/ Wired!

'''''{{Lang|de|Die Entführung aus dem Serail}}''''' (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; [[Help:IPA/Standard German|[ˈdɪ ʔɛntˈfyːʁʊŋ aʊ̯s dem zɛˈʁaɪ̯l]]]) ([[Köchel catalogue|K. 384]]; '''''The Abduction from the Seraglio'''''; also known as '''''{{Lang|it|Il Seraglio}}''''') is an [[opera]] [[Singspiel]] in three acts by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. The German [[libretto]] is by [[Gottlieb Stephanie]], based on [[Christoph Friedrich Bretzner]]'s [[Belmont und Constanze|''Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail'']]. The plot concerns the attempt of the hero Belmonte, assisted by his servant Pedrillo, to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the [[seraglio]] of [[Pasha]] Selim. The work premiered on 16 July 1782 at the Vienna [[Burgtheater]], with the composer conducting.

==Origins==
The company that first sponsored the opera was the ''Nationalsingspiel'' ("national [[Singspiel]]"), a pet project (1778–1783) of the Austrian emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. The Emperor had set up the company to perform works in the German language (as opposed to the [[Italian opera]] style widely popular in Vienna). This project was ultimately given up as a failure, but along the way it produced a number of successes, mostly a series of translated works. Mozart's opera emerged as its outstanding original success.&lt;ref&gt;Manning 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The inspector of the ''Nationalsingspiel'' was [[Gottlieb Stephanie]].&lt;ref name="abert"&gt;Abert 2007, 620&lt;/ref&gt; When the 25-year-old Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781, seeking professional opportunity, one of the first tasks to which he addressed himself was to become acquainted with Stephanie and lobby him for an opera commission. To this end, he brought a copy of his earlier opera ''[[Zaide]]'' and showed it to Stephanie, who was duly impressed. Mozart also made a strong impression on the manager of the theater, Count [[Orsini-Rosenberg|Franz Xaver Orsini-Rosenberg]], when in the home of Mozart's friend and patroness [[Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein|Maria Wilhelmine Thun]] the Count heard him play excerpts from his opera ''[[Idomeneo]]'', premiered with great success the previous year in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="abert" /&gt; With this backing, it was agreed that Stephanie would find appropriate material and prepare a libretto for Mozart. Stephanie complied by preparing an altered version of an earlier work [[Belmont und Constanze|''Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail'']] without attributing or seeking permission from its original author [[Christoph Friedrich Bretzner]]. Bretzner later complained loudly and publicly about the theft.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Mozart received the libretto from Stephanie on 29 July 1781. He had few opportunities to compose professionally during the summer and he set to work on the libretto at a very rapid pace, finishing three major numbers in just two days. A letter to his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] indicates he was very excited about the prospect of having his opera performed in Vienna, and worked enthusiastically on his project.

At first Mozart thought he needed to finish his opera in only two months, because tentative plans were made to perform it at the September visit of the Russian [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]] (son of [[Catherine the Great]] and heir to the Russian throne). However, it was ultimately decided to perform operas by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] instead, giving Mozart more time.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens 1990, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

It was around this time that Mozart articulated his views about the role of the composer and the librettist in the preparation of an opera. He wrote to his father (13 October 1781):
{{quote|text=I would say that in an opera the poetry must be altogether the obedient daughter of the music. Why are Italian comic operas popular everywhere – in spite of the miserable libretti? … Because the music reigns supreme, and when one listens to it all else is forgotten. An opera is sure of success when the plot is well worked out, the words written solely for the music and not shoved in here and there to suit some miserable rhyme ... The best thing of all is when a good composer, who understands the stage and is talented enough to make sound suggestions, meets an able poet, that true phoenix;&lt;ref&gt;By this Mozart meant something exceedingly rare. The same metaphor is used in the first scene of Mozart's later opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in that case, no fears need be entertained as to the applause – even of the ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It would seem that something along these lines did happen—that is, Mozart decided to play a major role in the shaping of the libretto, insisting that Stephanie make changes for dramatic and musical effect. On 26 September Mozart wrote:
{{quote|text=Now comes the rub! The first act was finished more than three weeks ago, as was also one aria in act 2 and the drunken duet ["Vivat Bacchus", act 2] ... But I cannot compose any more, because the whole story is being altered – and, to tell the truth, at my own request. At the beginning of act 3 there is a charming quintet or rather finale, but I would prefer to have it at the end of act 2. In order to make this practicable, great changes must be made, in fact an entirely new plot must be introduced – and Stephanie is up to his neck in other work. So we must have a little patience.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mozart was evidently quite pleased to have in Stephanie a librettist who would listen to him. The September 26 letter also says:
{{quote|text=Everyone abuses Stephanie. It may be the case he is only friendly to my face. But after all he is preparing the libretto for me – and, what is more, exactly as I want it – and by Heaven, I don't ask anything more of him.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the delays for rewriting, the composition took several more months. The premiere took place on 16 July [[1782 in music|1782]], at the [[Burgtheater]] in Vienna.

==Character==
''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' is in the genre of "Singspiel", thus the music lacks [[recitative]]s and consists entirely of set numbers. As Hughes notes, the action is mostly carried forward by the spoken dialogue, so the libretto gave Mozart little opportunity to display an achievement for which his later operas are celebrated, namely the construction of scenes in which the plot is both reflected in and driven forward by the music.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Spike (1972:20)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Die Entführung'' is lighthearted and frequently comic, with little of the deep character exploration or darker feelings found in Mozart's later operas.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Manning 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The opera was inspired by a contemporary interest in the exotic culture of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a nation which had only recently ceased to be a military threat to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens (1990, 74). Braunbehrens suggests that "preparations had just begun to celebrate" the centennial of lifting of the Turkish [[Battle of Vienna|Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Later in the decade, Austria was again at war with Turkey (see [[Austro–Turkish War (1787–1791)]]) but this was a war of aggression, not defense.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two contemporary works also showing the contemporary interest in matters Turkish were Giovanni Paolo Marana's ''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]'' and [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Persian Letters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart's opera includes a [[Turkish music (style)|Westernized version of Turkish music]], based very loosely on the Turkish [[Janissary Music|Janissary band music]].

Certain aspects of the opera conform to an eighteenth-century European view of [[orientalism]]. The Pasha's titular harem, for example, reprised themes of sexual libertinage. And the comically sinister overseer, Osmin, is a send-up of earlier stereotypes of Turkish despotism.&lt;ref&gt;Osterhammel (1998) notes: "Neben das alte Bild des dämonisierten Feindes trat in der künstlerischen Repräsentation nun der übertölpelte Buffo-Türke, wie man ihn als Haremswächter Osmin auf Mozarts ''Entführung aus dem Serail'' (1782) kennt." [Next to the older image of the demonised enemy stood the over-the-top Turkish Buffoon in cultural representation, such as the Harem overseer Osmin from Mozart's ''Abduction from the Seraglio''.] p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opera also defies the stereotype of despotic Turkish culture, since its climax entails a selfless act of forgiveness on the part of the Pasha.&lt;ref&gt;Others have suggested that the Pasha is portrayed positively for acting like a Christian. This argument is made in Matthew Head – ''Orientalism, Masquerade and Mozart's Turkish Music'',{{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}} and possibly implied by Mary Hunter who says that he is "represented as European by his act of mercy" (in "The ''Alla Turca'' Style" in [[Jonathan Bellman]] (ed) – ''The Exotic in Western Music''){{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The music includes some of the composer's most spectacular and difficult arias. Osmin's act 3 aria "[[O, wie will ich triumphieren]]" includes characteristic 18th century [[coloratura]] passage work, and twice goes down to a low [[D (musical note)|D]] ([[Scientific pitch notation|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), one of the lowest notes demanded of any voice in opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobaopera.mb.ca/learn/trivia.html|title=Learn About Opera|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous aria in the opera is the long and elaborate "Martern aller Arten" ("Tortures of all kinds") for Konstanze, an outstanding challenge for sopranos. Konstanze sings in a kind of [[sinfonia concertante]] with four solo players from the orchestra; the strikingly long orchestral introduction, without stage action, also poses problems for stage directors.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see Rosen (1997, 165) and Eisen (2006, 164–165).&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtuosity of these roles is perhaps attributable to the fact that when he took up the task of composing the opera, Mozart already knew the outstanding reputations of the singers for whom he was writing, and he tailored the arias to their strengths.&lt;ref name="abert" /&gt; The first Osmin was [[Ludwig Fischer (bass)|Ludwig Fischer]], a bass noted for his wide range and skill in leaping over large intervals with ease. Similarly, Mozart wrote of the first Konstanze, [[Caterina Cavalieri]], "I have sacrificed Konstanze's aria a little to the flexible throat of Mlle. Cavalieri."

==Reception==
[[File:Entfuhrung aus dem Serail484.jpg|thumb|Mozart (at center) attended a performance of his own opera ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' while [[Mozart's Berlin journey|visiting Berlin]] in 1789. Franz Frankenberg performed the role of Osmin, Friedrich Ernst Wilhelm Greibe played Pedrillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Starší divadlo v českých zemích do konce 18. století|editor-last=Jakubcová|editor-first=Alena|authorlink= |year=2007|publisher=Divadelní ústav, Academia|location=Prague|isbn=978-80-200-1486-3|page=707|url= |language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] The opera was a huge success. The first two performances brought in the large sum of 1200 florins, three times what Mozart's salary had been for his old job in Salzburg.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 201&lt;/ref&gt; The work was repeatedly performed in Vienna during Mozart's lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;For a listing see Deutsch 1965, 201&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout German-speaking Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See the index entry for the opera in Deutsch 1965. The Stuttgart premiere had to wait until 19 September 1795, because the singspiel ''Belmont und Constanze'', set to the same story by Christian Ludwig Dieter (1757–1822), first performed there in 1784, was so popular as to preclude any performances of Mozart's version; ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed, 1954, [[Eric Blom]], ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1787, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] wrote (concerning his own efforts as a librettist):
{{quote|text=All our endeavour ... to confine ourselves to what is simple and limited was lost when Mozart appeared. ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' conquered all, and our own carefully written piece has never been so much as mentioned in theater circles.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Deutsch 1965, 305. The work of his own to which Goethe refers is his ''{{Lang|de|Scherz, List und Rache}}'' which was used for an opera {{ill|Scherz, List und Rache|de|lt=of the same title}} by [[Max Bruch]] in 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the opera greatly raised Mozart's standing with the public as a composer, it did not make him rich: he was paid a flat fee of 100 Imperial ducats (about 450 florins) for his work, and made no profits from the many subsequent performances.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera reached Paris in November 1801, when [[Frédéric Blasius]] conducted Ellmenreich's company in performances at the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]].&lt;ref&gt;Noiray, Michel. "Blasius [Blassius], (Matthieu-)Frédéric" in [[Stanley Sadie]], ed., ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', 4 vols. (London: Macmillan, 1992), 1: 498&lt;/ref&gt;

This opera is firmly ensconced in the repertoire today. 

==="Too many notes"===
The complexity of Mozart's work noted by Goethe also plays a role in a well-known tale about the opera which appeared in the early (1798) biography of Mozart by [[Franz Xaver Niemetschek]]. In the version of the anecdote printed in ''[[John Bartlett (publisher)|Bartlett]]'s Book of Anecdotes'', a reference work, the story is told like this:

{{quote|text=The Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] commissioned the creation of ''The Abduction from the Seraglio'', but when he heard it, he complained to Mozart, "That is too fine for my ears – there are too many notes." Mozart replied, "There are just as many notes as there should be."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard and Fadiman (2000, 339)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The authenticity of this story is not accepted by all scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Schmidt-Hensel, and references cited there.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the version given by the Bartlett reference (and many other places) includes a translation of the original German that is dubious. The original reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cited text from: [http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/nc/ueber-uns/presse/detail/article/2006-10-16-362.html "... gewaltig viele Noten, lieber Mozart!". ''Die Mozart-Autographe der Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224154541/http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/nc/ueber-uns/presse/detail/article/2006-10-16-362.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, Exhibition notes, Berlin 2006, by Roland Dieter Schmidt-Hensel, State Library Berlin; [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation|Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Zu schön für unsere Ohren, und gewaltig viel Noten, lieber Mozart!}}

"Too many notes" is not a plausible translation of the German phrase "gewaltig viel Noten". Mautner (1956:33), translating Niemetschek, renders this as "an extraordinary number of notes", while Branscombe (2006) translates it simply as "very many notes".&lt;ref&gt;Branscombe (2006, 165)&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote, which is often repeated, is considered by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006, 238–239)&lt;/ref&gt; to unfairly give the Emperor a bad reputation concerning both his own musical abilities and his appreciation and support of Mozart.

==Instrumentation==
The singers perform with a [[Classical period (music)|Classical-era]] [[orchestra]]: pairs of [[western concert flute|flute]]s (2nd doubling piccolo), [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[Natural horn|horn]]s, [[trumpet]]s, a set of two [[timpani]], and [[string section|strings]]. They are augmented with the instruments needed for [[Turkish music (style)|"Turkish" music]]: [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], and [[piccolo]]. The aria, "{{Lang|de|Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose|italic=no}}", is augmented by a [[basset horn]].

The orchestra for the premiere included a number of eminent musicians of the day: first cellist [[Joseph Franz Weigl]], first oboist [[Josef Triebensee]], second horn [[Joseph Leutgeb]], and the clarinettist brothers [[Anton Stadler|Anton]] and [[Johann Stadler]]. In the first violin section was [[Josepha Weber|Franz de Paula Hofer]], who later became Mozart's brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Edge (1992:72–73)&lt;/ref&gt; The four musicians who played the "Turkish" instruments remain anonymous, though it is known that they were recruited for this purpose by one Franz Tyron, [[Kapellmeister]] of the Austrian Second Field Artillery Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Edge (1992:75)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
:Place: the country house of the Pasha (German "Bassa"), in Turkey
:Time: 16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. F. Bretzner|editor1-last=Bloch|editor1-first=John W.|title=The Abduction from the Seraglio (libretto)|date=1962|publisher=[[G. Schirmer]]|location=New York|page=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 1===
After a lively overture, Belmonte enters, looking for his betrothed, Konstanze, who with her English servant Blonde has fallen into the hands of pirates and been sold to [[Pasha]] Selim (Aria: "Hier soll ich dich denn sehen" – "Here surely I must find her").&lt;ref&gt;English titles from ''[http://www.chandos.net/Details06.asp?CNumber=CHAN%203081 The Abduction From the Seraglio]'', [[Chandos Records]] CHAN 3081 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Osmin, the Pasha's bad-tempered servant, comes to pluck [[Common fig|fig]]s in the garden and contemptuously ignores Belmonte's questions (Aria: "Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden" – "You may think, you've found a maiden"). Belmonte tries to obtain news of his servant, Pedrillo, who has been captured with the women and is serving as a servant in the Pasha's palace. Osmin replies with insults and abuse (Duet: "Verwünscht seist du samt deinem Liede!" – "The devil take you and your song, sir"). Belmonte leaves in disgust. Pedrillo enters and Osmin rages at him, vowing to get him tortured and killed in many different ways (Aria: "Solche hergelaufne Laffen" – "These young men who go a-spying"). Osmin leaves and Belmonte enters and happily reunites with Pedrillo. Together they resolve to rescue Konstanze and Blonde, who is Pedrillo's fiancée (Aria: "Konstanze, Konstanze, dich wiederzusehen … O wie ängstlich" – "Konstanze, Konstanze, to see thee again … Oh what trembling").

Accompanied by a chorus of [[Janissaries]] ("Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder" – "Sing to the mighty Pasha Selim"), Pasha Selim appears with Konstanze, for whose love he strives in vain (Aria of Konstanze: "Ach ich liebte" – "How I loved him"). Pedrillo tricks the Pasha into hiring Belmonte as an architect. When Belmonte and Pedrillo try to enter the palace, Osmin bars their way, but they hurry past him anyway (Terzett: "Marsch! Marsch! Marsch! Trollt euch fort!" – "March! March! March! Clear off!").

===Act 2===
[[File:John frederick lewis-reception1873.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the women's quarters in a [[seraglio]], [[John Frederick Lewis]], 1873]]
The Pasha has given Blonde to Osmin, to be his slave; however, she defiantly rebuffs her new master's rough lovemaking attempts (Aria: "Durch Zärtlichkeit und Schmeicheln" – "With smiles and kind caresses"), threatens to scratch out his eyes, and chases him out of the room (Duet: "Ich gehe, doch rate ich dir" – "I'm going, but mark what I say"). Konstanze enters and greets Blonde in distress (Aria: "Welcher Wechsel herrscht in meiner Seele … Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose" – "Oh what sorrow overwhelms my spirit … Endless grief tortures my spirit"). The Pasha enters, demands her love, and threatens to use force, but she resolutely rejects him. (Aria: "Martern aller Arten" – "Tortures unrelenting")  Left alone, he muses on her determination to remain chaste, which increases his desire for her.

Pedrillo informs Blonde that Belmonte has come and is planning to rescue them. Blonde is filled with joy. (Aria: "Welche Wonne, welche Lust" – "Oh, the happy, happy day"). After singing a short ditty to boost his courage (Aria: "Frisch zum Kampfe" – "Now Pedrillo, now for battle!"), Pedrillo invites Osmin to drink (Duet: "Vivat [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]! Bacchus lebe!" – "Here's to Bacchus, long live Bacchus").  Despite his [[Khamr|religious prohibition against alcoholic beverages]], Osmin drinks heavily and falls asleep.  Konstanze joins Belmonte who declares his love (Aria: "Wenn der Freude Tränen fließen" – "When tears of joy flow"). The two couples reunite (Quartet, Belmonte, Konstanze, Pedrillo, Blonde: "Ach Belmonte! Ach, mein Leben" – "Ah, Belmonte, ah my dear one!"). After their initial expressions of love and joy, Belmonte and Pedrillo both question anxiously whether their respective fiancees have remained faithful during their forced separation; to their delight the women respond with indignation and dismay, and Blonde slaps Pedrillo's face. The two men apologize for their failure of confidence; the women forgive them for the offensive questions.

===Act 3===
Belmonte and Pedrillo come to the garden with ladders (Aria, Belmonte: "Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke" – "Love, only love, can now direct me").  Pedrillo gets the attention of the women by singing a ballad about a rescue similar to the one he is planning (Romanze, Pedrillo: "In Mohrenland gefangen war" – "In Moorish lands a maiden fair"). However, Osmin enters, sees the ladders, and rouses the castle.  Osmin exults in the prospect of seeing them all hanged (Aria: "[[O, wie will ich triumphieren]]" – "My triumphant hour's approaching"). Belmonte pleads for their lives and tells Pasha Selim that his father is a Spanish [[Grandee]] and Governor of [[Oran]], named Lostados, and will pay a generous ransom. Unfortunately, Pasha Selim and Lostados are long-standing enemies. The Pasha rejoices in the opportunity to subject his enemy's son to a horrible death. He leaves Belmonte and Konstanze to bid each other a last farewell; they lovingly assure each other that being tortured to death will be a pleasure, so long as they get tortured to death together (Duet: "Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele.... Weh, du soltest für mich sterben" – "What dreadful fate conspires against us.... Woe, you will die because of me"). However, the Pasha decides that he can make a better point against Lostados by showing mercy and releasing Belmonte and his friends. All are set at liberty – much to the dismay of Osmin, who would prefer to see them all brutally executed (Finale: "Nie werd' ich deine Huld verkennen" – "Your noble mercy passes measure").

==Adaptations==
The Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]] wrote an opera called ''[[Palatsi (opera)|The Palace]]'' (first performed 1995); it contains characters whose names are adapted from ''Abduction'' and loosely uses elements of the plot of Mozart's opera as the starting point of a satirical fantasy.

Music professor, composer, and humorist [[Peter Schickele]] claims to have "discovered" [[P. D. Q. Bach]]'s ''[[The Abduction of Figaro]]'', a [[pastiche]] of the ''Entführung'' and Mozart's ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.

===Background and inception===
In May 1918, [[Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven|C.J. Langenhoven]] wrote an [[Afrikaans]] poem called "Die Stem", for which music was composed by the Reverend {{ill|Marthinus Lourens de Villiers|af}} in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110111010/http://tortel.net/~lochner/blerkas/woorde/002.txt|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/symbols/anthem.htm |title=SA National Anthem History|accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely used by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] in the 1920s, which played it at the close of daily broadcasts, along with "[[God Save The King]]". It was recorded for the first time in 1926 when its first and third verses were performed by Betty Steyn in England for the [[Zonophone]] record label;&lt;ref name=Siemon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flatint.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-south-african-national-anthem.html|title=flatint: The South African National Anthem: a history on record|first=Siemon|last=Allen|date=15 October 2013|publisher=BlogSpot|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samap.ukzn.ac.za/die-stem-van-suid-afrika|title=Die stem van Suid-Afrika|work=South African Music Archive Project|access-date=18 April 2018|publisher=Digital Innovation South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was sung publicly for the first time on 31 May 1928.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 1938, South Africa proclaimed it to be one of the two co-national anthems of the country, along with "[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]".&lt;ref name=NYT1938/&gt;

It was sung in [[South African English|English]] as well as Afrikaans from 1952,&lt;ref name="Sym"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moeschberger|first1=Scott L.|last2=DeZalia|first2=Rebekah A.

===Decline===
As the dismantling of apartheid began in the early 1990s, South African teams were readmitted to international sporting events, which presented a problem as to the choice of national identity South Africa had to present.

===Consolidation===
The practice of singing two different national anthems had been a cumbersome arrangement during the transition to post-apartheid South Africa. On most occasions, it was usually the first verse of "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" that was sung at ceremonies, in both official languages prior to 1994, with some English medium schools in what was then Natal Province singing the first verse in Afrikaans and the second in English. During this period of two national anthems, the custom was to play both "Die Stem" and "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika" during occasions that required the playing of a national anthem. However, this proved cumbersome as performing the dual national anthems took as much as five minutes to conclude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/28/world/johannesburg-journal-will-rugby-embrace-or-crush-a-dainty-flower.html|title=Johannesburg Journal;Will Rugby Embrace, or Crush, a Dainty Flower?|first=Donald G. |last=McNeil, Jr.|date=28 March 1996|location=New York|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, following the adoption of a new national constitution, a new [[National anthem of South Africa|composite national anthem]] was introduced, which combined part of "Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika" and part of "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" into a single composition in order to form a new hybrid song.

===Legacy===
Since the end of apartheid and the adoption of a new national anthem in the 1990s, the status of "Die Stem" has become somewhat controversial in contemporary South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-539872757.html|work=Cape Times|location=South Africa|access-date=1 November 2018|title=Old Boys Ban for Die Stem|date=23 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-430570714.html|title=Why I Choose to Sing Die Stem|date=4 October 2015|publisher=|location=South Africa|work=The Sunday Independent|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-194475541.html|title='Natoo' says no to Die Stem.(News)|date=25 February 2009|publisher=|work=Post|location=South Africa|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its connection with the apartheid regime and white minority rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/post/20140723/282067685059813|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/south-african-anthem-best-in-the-world/|title=Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika named best national anthem in the world|first=Alexis|last=Haden|date=27 December 2017|work=The South African}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/hofmeyr-sings-die-stem-at-innibos-1.1716416#.VJgh814C8|title=Hofmeyr sings Die Stem at Innibos |date=8 July 2014 |website= |publisher=iol News |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2014-07-16-die-stem-steve-hofmeyr-and-a-die-hard-sense-of-idealism|title=Steve Hofmeyr, 'Die Stem' and living in the past|first=Haji Mohamed|last=Dawjee|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|location=South Africa|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/04/08/Crowd-gathers-in-defence-of-the-church-square-statue |title=Steve Hofmeyr, Sunette Bridges defend Paul Kruger statue |publisher=Eyewitness News |date=2015-04-08 |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

! colspan="3" | First verse
|-
|''Uit die blou van onse hemel,''
| Ringing out from our blue heavens,
| From the blue of our heaven
|- 
|''Uit die diepte van ons see,''
| From our deep seas breaking round,
| From the depths of our sea,
|- 
|''Oor ons ewige gebergtes''
| Over everlasting mountains,
| Over our eternal mountain ranges
|- 
|''Waar die kranse antwoord gee.''
| Where the echoing crags resound,
| Where the cliffs give answer
|- 
|''Deur ons vêr verlate vlaktes''
| From our plains where creaking wagons,
| Through our far-deserted plains
|- 
|''Met die kreun van ossewa.''
| Cut their trails into the earth,
| With the groan of ox-wagon
|- 
|''Ruis die stem van ons geliefde,''
| Calls the spirit of our country,
| Rustles the voice of our beloved,
|- 
|''Van ons land Suid-Afrika.''
| Of the land that gave us birth.
| Of our country South Africa
|- 
|''Ons sal antwoord op jou roepstem,''
| At thy call we shall not falter,
| We will answer to your calling,
|- 
|''Ons sal offer wat jy vra:''
| Firm and steadfast we shall stand,
| We will offer what you ask

|''Ons sal lewe, ons sal sterwe,''
| At thy will to live or perish,
| We will live, we will die

|''Ons vir jou, Suid-Afrika.''
| O South Africa, dear land.
| We for Thee, South Africa

! colspan="3" | Second verse
|-
|''In die murg van ons gebeente,''
| In our body and our spirit,
| In the marrow of our bones
|-
|''in ons hart en siel en gees,''
| In our inmost heart held fast;
| In our heart and soul and spirit
|-
|''In ons roem op ons verlede,''
| In the promise of our future,
| In the glory of our past
|-
|''In ons hoop op wat sal wees.''
| And the glory of our past;
| In our hope of what will be
|-
|''In ons wil en werk en wandel,''
| In our will, our work, our striving,
| In our will and work and wander,
|-
|''Van ons wieg tot aan ons graf.''
| From the cradle to the grave-
| From our crib to our grave
|-
|''Deel geen ander land ons liefde,''
| There's no land that shares our loving,
| Share no other land our love,
|-
|''Trek geen ander trou ons af.''
| And no bond that can enslave.
| No other loyalty can sway us.
|-
|''Vaderland, ons sal die adel,''
| Thou hast borne us and we know thee,
| Fatherland! We will bear the nobility
|-
|''Van jou naam met ere dra:''
| May our deeds to all proclaim
| Of your name with honour:

| In our winter night's cold
|-
|''In die lente van ons liefde,''
| In the surging life of springtime,
| In the spring of our love,
|-
|''in die lanfer van ons rou.''
| In the autumn of despair;
| In the autumn of our sorrow
|-
|''By die klink van huw'liksklokkies,''
| When the wedding bells are chiming,
| At the sound of wedding bells,
|-
|''by die kluit-klap op die kis.''
| Or when those we love do depart,
| At the stonefall on the coffin.
|-
|''Streel jou stem ons nooit verniet nie,''
| Thou dost know us for thy children
| Soothes your voice us never in vain,
|-
|''Weet jy waar jou kinders is.''
| And dost take us to thy heart
| You know where your children are.
|-
|''Op jou roep sê ons nooit née nie,''
| Loudly peals the answering chorus;
| At your call we never say no,
|-
|''Sê ons altyd, altyd ja:''
| We are thine, and we shall stand,
| We always, always say yes:
|-
|''Om te lewe, om te sterwe -''

A '''doily''' (also doiley, doilie, doyly, doyley) is an ornamental mat, typically made of paper or fabric, and variously used for protecting surfaces or binding flowers, in food service presentation, or as a head covering or clothing ornamentation. It is characterized by [[Cutwork|openwork]], which allows the surface of the underlying object to show through.

== Etymology ==
Doiley was a 17th-century [[London]] [[draper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/doily |title=Doily |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who made popular "a woolen stuff, 'at once cheap and genteel,' introduced for summer wear in the latter part of the 17th c."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web |title=Doily, adj. and n. |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|doily}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was used as an adjective, as in "doily stuffs" or "doily suit." Later, usage shifted to refer to "a small ornamental napkin used at dessert," known as a "doily-napkin."&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

== Usage ==

=== Furniture protection ===
In addition to their decorative function doilies have the practical role of protecting fine-wood furniture from the scratches caused by crockery or decorative objects, or from spilled tea when used on tea trays or with cups and saucers. When used to protect the backs and arms of chairs, they are serving as [[antimacassar]]s.

=== Flower arrangement ===
Doilies are traditionally used to bind the stems in [[Nosegay|posies]] (formal flower arrangements called tussie-mussies in the Victorian Era).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felbinger |first=Elaine |title=Tussie Mussies |publisher=huntingtonbotanical.org/ |date=May–June 2005 |journal=SUBROSA: the Huntington Rose and Perennial Gardens Newsletter |issue=42 |accessdate=26 January 2014 |url=http://huntingtonbotanical.org/Rose/Subrosa/42/tussiemussies.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food service and etiquette ===
Doilies figure prominently in the custom of [[finger bowl]]s, once common in formal, [[Service a la russe|multi-course dinners]]. The linen doily (never paper) separates the dessert plate from the finger bowl. The custom requires that both doily and finger bowl are removed to the upper left of the place setting before briefly dipping fingertips into the water and drying them on the napkin. Failing to move both together is a faux pas. 
 
Disposable paper doilies "were designed as a cheaper but respectable alternative to crocheted linen doilies" and are commonly used to decorate plates, placed under the food for ornamentation. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "sales rocketed in the 1950s as a reaction to post-war austerity and the doily quickly became a symbol of upward social mobility." However, the UK is currently  experiencing a decline, prompting a "Save our Doilies" campaign. Once "a symbol of suburban gentility" they are now perceived as outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-455636/Dont-tell-Hyacinth-doily-dead.html |title=Don't tell Hyacinth but the doily is dead |accessdate=26 January 2014 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
They are [[crochet]]ed, [[tatting|tatted]] or [[knitting|knitted]] out of [[cotton]] or [[linen]] thread. Many patterns for crocheting or knitting doilies were published by thread manufacturers in the first part of the 20th century. The designers were often anonymous. The designs could be circular or oval starting from the center and working outward, reminiscent of the [[Polar coordinates system]]. Doilies, as well as other household items, may be made by crocheting rows on a grid pattern using a technique called [[filet crochet]], similar to points on the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

Contemporary designers continue to make patterns for modern hand craft enthusiasts. Although it may to some extent interfere with the original use, some doilies involve [[embroidery]] or have raised designs (rose petals, popcorn, or ruffles) rather than being flat.

[[File:Shimer Class Chicago.PNG|thumb|An egalitarian dialogue at [[Shimer College]].]]
'''Egalitarian dialogue''' is a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.  Although previously used widely in the [[social sciences]] and in reference to the [[Bakhtin]]ian philosophy of [[dialogue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bakhtin in contexts: across the disciplines |page=142
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081011268X|isbn=081011268X
|first=Amy |last=Mandelker |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was first systematically applied to [[dialogical education]] by [[Ramón Flecha]] in his 2000 work ''Sharing Words. Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning''.

Egalitarian dialogue is one of the seven principles of [[dialogic learning]] (Flecha, 2000), the others being cultural intelligence, equality of differences, creation of meaning, instrumental dimension, solidarity, and transformation. The principle of egalitarian dialogue is deeply interrelated with the other principles of dialogic learning. By recognizing all people's [[cultural intelligence]] and respecting differences from an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] standpoint, egalitarian dialogue encourages individuals to create meaning, develop solidarity among different people, and create new instrumental dimensions. This interdependence among the principles of dialogic learning favors constant social transformation.

==Equality of differences==
The recognition and respect of different types of knowledge raises the awareness that each person has something to share, something different and equally important. Therefore, the wider the diversity of voices engaged in egalitarian dialogue, the better the knowledge that can be dialogically constructed. In this sense, dialogic learning is oriented towards equality of differences, stating that true equality includes the right to live in a different way (Flecha, 2000). This perspective, which [[Paulo Freire]] (1997) calls ''unity in diversity'', never defends diversity or difference without simultaneously proposing equality and fairness toward different individual and groups.

Equality of differences is also enacted in the Learning Communities (Valls, 2000; Elboj et al., 2001). The Learning Communities are schools in Spain, Brazil and Chile that have undergone a process of educational and social transformation based on dialogic learning. In the learning communities, the equality of differences principle is shown, among other practices, in the interactive groups (Aubert et al., 2004), where students and adults who have different levels of instruction and are from different backgrounds, teach and learn from each other. Those interactions create [[Zone of Proximal Development]] (Vygotsky, 1978), this showing that [[meaning-making]] and learning do not depend solely on the intervention of professionals, but on all the knowledge brought by anyone related to the students (Flecha, 2000).

==Creation of meaning==
Habermas (2004a, 2004b) has stressed the need to recover the [[lifeworld]] from its systemic colonization by the “steering media” of power, law and bureaucratization. The systemic decolonization is a way of reinventing democracy in public spaces and institutions and for recovering meaning. Habermas' concept of [[lifeworld]] refers to the everyday contexts where people relate to each other and create meaning and structures to organize themselves. In [[Habermas]]' view, and also from a dialogic learning perspective, subjects create meaning through [[intersubjectivity]] or the interaction among subjects engaged in egalitarian dialogue.

Any person can engage in such meaning making dialogue because humans have ''epistemological curiosity'', which when expressed in egalitarian dialogue can criticize and end with what Freire (2001) called the ''bureaucratizing of the mind'', an invisible power of alienating domestication. Such debureaucratization process can be seen in Dialogic Musical Gatherings (CONFAPEA, 2005), where people develop their epistemological curiosity listening to classical music and later engaging in a dialogue about the instruments that were playing, about the composer, his life and his position in a historical context, the style of the music listened to and its relationship with the cultural claims of each participant belonging to the Music Gathering, etc. In this process, meaning is created and recovered because music escapes the system and goes back to people's [[lifeworld]] tearing down the walls of cultural [[elitism]].

==Instrumental dimension==
The Instrumental Dimension of learning, as a principle of dialogic learning, should not be confused with instrumentality or the technocratic colonization of learning. In dialogic learning, as in [[Habermas]] (1984), the instrumental and [[communicative rationality]] are not opposed to each other, but instrumental learning becomes more intense and profound when situated in an adequate dialogical framework. The ability to select and process information is the cognitive tool that best enables one to function confidently in today's society. Dialogue and reflection encourage the development of that ability. Relationships with other people put not only diverse information but also its selection and processing at our disposal(Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In addition, "when dialogue is egalitarian, it encourages intense reflection, since people need to understand other positions and express their own" (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In this sense, in egalitarian dialogue, procedures and ends are dialogically agreed. Those work for purposes of understanding, and do not let interactants hide themselves behind means that obscure exclusionary interests.

In education without dialogue, every single item becomes a target for power claims, even methods and instruments for learning, and therefore, the bureaucratization of those elements is inevitable. For this reason, the instrumental dimension of dialogic learning is never purely instrumental. It is also ethical, respectful, characterized by a sense of solidarity that contributes to break up the existing educational structure.

==Solidarity==
[[Social solidarity|Solidarity]] feeds dialogue, but at the same time, egalitarian dialogue, as essential communication, must underlie any act of solidarity (Freire, 1970). That is why, ''egalitarian educational practices must be grounded in conceptions of solidarity'' (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;20).

The emphasis of [[dialogic learning]] on solidarity as the wheel that drives this perspective on education can be evidenced in the Learning Communities. For instance, in the School for Adults La Verneda-Sant Martí (Sánchez, 1999; Flecha, 2000) all the activities are open to anyone from the community and the city, and are also deeply integrated in the neighborhood. Because of discussing books from the classic literature through dialogic learning, the dialogic literary gatherings help improve the lives of the participants in the gathering but also of other people in the school and the neighborhood, when for example some participants in the gathering  take part of different committees of the school that plan actions of social transformation in the neighborhood, the city and beyond.

In this sense, solidarity is not only understood as an act for identifying and denouncing problems, but also as means to solve them. Solidarity does not only imply denouncing the process of dehumanization, but also announcing the dream of a new society (Freire, 2001). In this regard, solidarity goes beyond rebellious attitudes that do not propose an alternative, and reaches a more radically critical and dialogical position that implies the transformation of oneself, institutions, and the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3590">'''Engineered languages''' (often abbreviated to '''engelangs''', or, less commonly, '''engilangs''') are [[constructed languages]] devised to test or prove some hypotheses about how languages work or might work.  There are at least three subcategories, [[philosophical languages]] (or ideal languages), logical languages (sometimes abbreviated as ''loglangs''), and experimental languages.  Raymond Brown describes engineered languages as "languages that are designed to specified ''objective'' criteria, and modeled to meet those criteria".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some engineered languages have been considered candidate global [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]]s, and some languages intended as international auxiliary languages have certain "engineered" aspects (in which they are more regular and systematic than their natural language sources).

== Logical languages ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of cognitive science topics]] --&gt;

{{further|Knowledge representation}}

Logical languages are meant to allow (or enforce) unambiguous statements.  They are typically based on [[predicate logic]] but can also be based on any system of formal [[logic]].  The two best-known logical languages are the predicate languages [[Loglan]] and its successor [[Lojban]]. They both aim to eliminate syntactical ambiguity and reduce semantic ambiguity to a minimum.  In particular, the [[lojban grammar|grammar of Lojban]] is carefully engineered to express such predicate logic in an unambiguous manner.

== Philosophical languages ==
{{main|Philosophical language}}
Philosophical languages are designed to reflect some aspect of philosophy, particularly with respect to the nature or potential of any given language. [[John Wilkins]]' [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|Real Character]] and Edward Powell Foster's [[Ro (language)|Ro]] constructed their words using a taxonomic tree. Vocabularies of [[oligosynthetic]] languages, for example [http://www.ygyde.neostrada.pl/index.htm Ygyde], are made of  [[compound word]]s, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of [[morpheme]]s. [[Suzette Haden Elgin]]'s [[Láadan]] is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on [[muted group theory]]. [[Sonja Elen Kisa]]'s [[Toki Pona]] is based on [[minimalism|minimalistic]] [[voluntary simplicity|simplicity]], incorporating elements of [[Taoism]].

== Experimental languages ==

{{main|Experimental languages}}

An experimental language is a [[constructed language]] designed for the purpose of exploring some element in the theory of [[linguistics]].  Most such languages are concerned with the relation between [[language and thought]]; however, languages have been constructed to explore other aspects of language as well. In [[science fiction]], much work has been done on the assumption popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].

'''English for academic purpose (EAP)''' is an approach to teaching English that aims at training students, usually in a higher education setting, to use the language appropriately for study. It is a common form of 'English for specific purposes' (ESP). EAP helps students improve their language skills in listening, speaking, reading, grammar, and vocabulary development. In addition, students are introduced to a new way of teaching, test taking, note taking, academic vocabulary usage, research and library skills. EAP has been shown to effectively prepare students in terms of language for undergraduate programs in college and university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Deborah|date=2011-06|title=EAP Essentials: A Teacher’s Guide to Principles And Practice, Olwyn Alexander, Sue Argent And Jenifer Spencer|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2011.04.004|journal=System|volume=39|issue=2|pages=273–274|doi=10.1016/j.system.2011.04.004|issn=0346-251X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== Definition of English for Academic Purposes ==
'''English for academic purposes''' (EAP) courses help students prepare for higher education in college/university level. There are two main types of EAP: pre-sessional courses and in-sessional courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English for Academic Purposes|last=Swales|first=John M.|publisher=Research Gate|year=January 1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of other approaches where EAP is delivered, including modular university entrance pathways.
* Pre-sessional courses: In the United States, there are July–August courses, and they help the students to prepare for their college-level classes in the Fall semester.
* In-sessional courses: opposite to pre-sessional courses, these courses are taught in parallel with the student's main courses. They can be understood as language support classes which help students improve their language skills for the classes that they are attending.

During this course, students are given resources to improve their skills in formal and informal communication, new vocabulary, writing skills, reading skills, critical thinking, oral presentation skills, and other areas. In addition, EAP helps international students, second-language influenced local students, certain students with gaps in their track record and some return-to-study mature-age students, to get acquainted with the new learning environment and educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Phuong|date=June 2010|title=EAP and LLNP Students: Common Problems and Strategies|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1081554.pdf|journal=Canadian Center of Science and Education|volume=3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study Skills ==

=== Academic Writing Classes ===
The writing class gives students as much time as they can to practice their writing skills. Starting with writing a paragraph, students have to be acquainted with completing the full essay after several weeks. Later, students are required to write several essays about some topics which they can choose themselves. While practicing their writing, students have the chance to develop their language use based on their current ability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Academic Writing: Process and Product|last=Robinson|first=Pauline C.|publisher=British Council|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researching and collecting information skills are practiced while writing academic essays, which is very important for their college level. Teachers instruct students how to choose reliable sources for the article and how to quote them. Students may have feedback from their teachers after each essay for the improvement of future essays. Moreover, students have opportunities to talk with their teachers about problems that they had on their essays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Academic Speaking Classes ===
Unlike normal conversation, the program is designed to help students improve their speaking ability in an educational setting to prepare for university&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Stephen|date=1993-06|title=Book Reviews : Study Speaking: A Course in Spoken English for Academic Purposes Tony Lynch and Kenneth Anderson. 1992.

Specifically, interoperability in oral communication and transactional capabilities are focused and improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Promoting pragmatic awareness and spoken discourse skills with EAP classes.|last=Clennell|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=April 1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, students will be given some specific topics and must discuss them with other students and the professor throughout class. Students will be familiar with face-to-face and eye contact while practicing. In addition, the ability to improvise in some cases such as forgetting vocabulary, solving when others speak too fast, and especially learning how to use spoken communication are also enhanced through these classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Study Speaking, Volume 1|last=Anderson|first=Kenneth|last2=Lynch|first2=Tony|last3=Maclean|first3=Joan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic Listening Classes ===
Similar to academic speaking classes, there are two processes that students need to be familiar with are interactive listening and transactional listening. Interactive listening helps students in daily conversation, such as how to start and give response during oral communicating while transactional listen is more important for students in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohd|first=Yusri|last2=Suzila|first2=Intan|date=2005|title=Academic Listening: What Non-ESL Lecturers Should Know|url=|journal=University Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia|volume=9|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, skills such as interference, readiness, and eagerness to learn are necessary for students in higher education. During class, students must listen to the conversation or short lectures and take notes or answer the questions based on the information in the video. There is the combination between listening and speaking skills while students have to listen to one specific topic and discuss with their classmates about that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Language Listening: Theory and Practice|last=Flowerdew|first=John|last2=Miller|first2=Lindsay|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic Reading Classes ===
Through reading, students are provided with sufficient knowledge to be ready for higher education. Specifically, in order to fully understand a reading, it requires students not only to have enough vocabulary but also a partial knowledge of the topic.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evaluation of an EAP Reading Course at the Faculty of Education, Kuwait University|last=Al Mutawa|first=Najat A|last2=Islam|first2=Nadra|publisher=Kuwait University|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing and reading skills are also incorporated when students write a summary of the paragraph. Speaking and listening skills have a strong connection with the reading skills because students can practice those skills in reading section.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, listening to the short conversation and discussing with other classmates about the article often applies while they are in the reading lecture. Other skills such as identifying the subject of the paragraph, citing references to the knowledge that students had, questioning and answering questions are also improved after the course.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Critical Thinking ===
Underpinning all the above and other study skills, the strongest driver in EAP is the practice of critical thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/930059196|title=Critical Thinking Skills : Developing Effective Analysis and Argument.|last=Stella.|first=Cottrell,|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd|isbn=9780230285293|oclc=930059196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/855831514|title=Critical thinking : an introduction|last=Alec|first=Fisher,|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107401983|oclc=855831514}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is a predominant assessment criteria across all higher education outcomes, particularly so in postgraduate education. Many teachers of EAP use critical thinking as the basis for launching into any or all of the above skills. Critical thinking includes embracing ambiguities, challenging assumptions, recognising rhetorical bias and paradigmatic perspectives, distinguishing normative from positive or descriptive writing, applying Socratic method to analysis, and looking for subtext. 

== Testing/Performance ==
In the former case, sometimes EAP courses may be intended to raise students' general English levels so that they can enter university. In the UK, this often means endeavouring to help students get a score of 6 or above in the [[International English Language Testing System|IELTS]] examination. In the US, this can mean helping students attain a score of 80 or greater on the [[Test of English as a Foreign Language|TOEFL]] or more than 4 on the [[International Test of English Proficiency|iTEP]]. Outside Anglophone countries, English-medium universities may have a preparatory school where students can spend a year or two working on their English and academic skills before starting degree courses.

== Teachers' Role in EAP  ==
The role of teachers in education, especially in the EAP is undeniable. Teachers have the duty to provide student with assessments that encourage, correct, and improve students' proficiency. This can be expressed in the students’ works, tests, or oral communication. A meeting in the teacher office can be made if necessary. The teacher also directly affects the student's ability to learn. Designing lectures, topics, and instructions are some of the main things that need to be consulted and researched before being taught. Creating and maintaining a healthy learning environment is essential for students, and teachers are the one who take responsibility for this. The teacher also understands the learning ability of each individual in the class. Therefore, they are also the ones who give topics for articles or design tests for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 2014|title=English for Academic Purposes Teacher|url=https://intoglobal.com/media/82252/english-for-academic-purposes-teacher-17-02-14-job-description.pdf|journal=University of East Anglia|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teacher Training for EAP (TEAP) ==
The preparation for the teaching of EAP is known as Teaching English for Academic Purposes, or TEAP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=Marian|date=2007-06|title=Hyland, Ken.(2006).English for academic purposes: An advanced resource book.

Reputable TEAP courses in the UK are aligned with developing participants' competencies to fit the BALEAP competence framework, designed by the British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes (BALEAP). The most reputable and longstanding TEAP courses in the UK are delivered by Bristol University, [[SOAS, University of London|SOAS University of London]], the London School of Economics (LSE), University of Glasgow, [[University of Sheffield]], University of Brighton, University of Leicester, [[University of Nottingham]] and Lancaster University, among others.

While the origins of the English language development aspect in TEAP are presumed to derive through the practice as a subset of English for Specific Purposes (ESP), with such English language teaching (ELT) influences as the Communicative Approach to Language Acquisition, the Lexical Approach, audio-lingual techniques and even grammar translation, there are several other crucial and underestimated aspects. These include: traditional higher education study skills programmes such as WAC (Writing Across the Curriculum) in the USA and provisions driven by social constructionist perspectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Labov|first=William|title=Narrative analysis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9781139519632.003|work=The Language of Life and Death|pages=14–43|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139519632|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;; contrastive rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9781139524599|title=Contrastive Rhetoric|last=Connor|first=Ulla M.|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139524599|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;; systemic functional linguistics and related genre-based education&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Knowledge, Curriculum and the Future School|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781472593405.ch-001|work=Knowledge and the Future School : Curriculum and Social Justice|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781472593405|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Swales|first=John M.|title=1990.

Therefore, it is clear that EAP as a practice has origins far more broadly rooted in tertiary education preparation traditions and a future that has moved in quite a distinct direction from ELT practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11260">[[Image:Iranischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|[[Dhul-Qarnayn]], with the help of some ''[[jinn]]'', building the Iron Wall to keep the barbarian Gog and Magog from civilized peoples. (16th-century [[Iranian art|Persian miniature]])|400x400px]]
The '''Gates of Alexander''' was a legendary barrier supposedly built by [[Alexander the Great]] in the [[Caucasus]] to keep the uncivilized barbarians of the north (typically associated with [[Gog and Magog]]&lt;ref&gt;Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius 8; Alexander Romance, epsilon recension 39.&lt;/ref&gt;) from invading the land to the south. The gates were a popular subject in [[medieval]] [[travel literature]], starting with the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' in a version from perhaps the 6th century.

The wall, also known as the '''Caspian Gates''', has been identified with two locations: the Pass of [[Derbent|Derbent, Russia]] or with the [[Pass of Dariel]], west of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Tradition also connects it to the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]] (Red Snake) on its south-eastern shore.

Historically, these fortifications were part of [[Sasanian defence lines|the defence lines]] built by [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] of Persia. The Great Wall of Gorgan may have been built by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].

==Literary background==
The name Caspian Gates originally applied to the narrow region at the southeast corner of the Caspian Sea, through which Alexander actually marched in the pursuit of [[Bessus]], although he did not stop to fortify it. It was transferred to the passes through the Caucasus, on the other side of the Caspian, by the more fanciful historians of Alexander. 

[[Josephus]], a Jewish historian in the 1st century, is known to have written of Alexander's gates, designed to be a barrier against the Scythians. According to this historian, the people whom the Greeks called Scythians were known (among the Jews) as Magogites, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]] in the Hebrew Bible. These references occur in two different works. ''[[The Jewish War]]'' states that the iron gates Alexander erected were controlled by the king of [[Hyrcania]] (on the south edge of the Caspian), and allowing passage of the gates to the [[Alans]] (whom Josephus considered a Scythic tribe) resulted in the sack of [[Media (region)|Media]]. Josephus's ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' contains two relevant passages, one giving the ancestry of Scythians as descendants of Magog
son of [[Japheth]], and another that refers to the Caspian Gates being breached by Scythians allied to [[Tiberius]] during the [[Armenian War of 58–63|Armenian War]].{{efn|1=Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D1%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D6%3Awhiston%20section%3D1 1.123] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D18%3Awhiston+chapter%3D4%3Awhiston+section%3D4 18.97]; ''[[The Jewish War]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D7%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D7%3Awhiston%20section%3D4 7.244-51]}}{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122}}

The Gates occur in later versions of the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' of Pseudo-Callisthenes, in the interpolated chapter on the "Unclean Nations" (8th century). This version locates the gates between two mountains called the "Breasts of the North" ({{lang-gr|Μαζοί Βορρά}}{{sfn|Anderson|1932|p=37}}). The mountains are initially 18 feet apart and the pass is rather wide, but Alexander's prayers to [[God]] causes the mountains to draw nearer, thus narrowing the pass. There he builds the Caspian Gates out of bronze, coating it with fast-sticking oil. The gates enclosed twenty-two nations and their monarchs, including Goth and Magoth ([[Gog and Magog]]). The geographic location of these mountains is rather vague, described as a 50-day march away northwards after Alexander put to flight his Belsyrian enemies (the [[Bebryces|Bebrykes]],{{sfn|Anderson|1932|p=35}} of [[Bithynia]] in modern-day North [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Stoneman |editor-first=Richard (tr.) |title=The Greek Alexander Romance |publisher=Penguin |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZmqYv_dSwMC&amp;pg=PA185 |pages=185–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Anderson|1932|p=11}}

A somewhat similar story also appears in the [[Qur'an]], [[Sura|Surat]] ''[[al-Kahf]]'' 83-98 with key differences. Rather than the builder being a conquering emperor like Alexander, the Qur'an describes a liberating hero predating Alexander, known as [[Dhul Qarnayn]]. Also the structure is a huge iron wall rather than a gate and its purpose is to defend people at the foot of two mountains from Gog and Magog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dathorne|first= O. R. |authorlink= O. R. Dathorne |title= Imagining the World: Mythical Belief Versus Reality in Global Encounters |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qfdb6QbyvgQC&amp;pg=PA46 |accessdate= February 5, 2013 |year= 1994 |publisher= Greenwood  |location= |isbn= 0897893646 | pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Gates of Alexander story was included in travel literature such as the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'' and the ''[[Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''. The identities of the nations trapped behind the wall are not always consistent, however; Mandeville claims Gog and Magog are really the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], who will emerge from their prison during the [[End Times]] and unite with their fellow [[Jews]] to attack the [[Christians]]. [[Marco Polo|Polo]] speaks of Alexander's Iron Gates, but says the [[Comanians]] are the ones trapped behind it. He does mention Gog and Magog, however, locating them north of [[Cathay]]. Some scholars have taken this as an oblique and confused reference to the [[Great Wall of China]], which he does not mention otherwise. The Gates of Alexander may represent an attempt by Westerners to explain stories from China of a great king building a great wall.{{fact|date=July 2015}} Knowledge of Chinese innovations such as the compass and [[south-pointing chariot]] is known to have been diffused (and confused) across Eurasian trade routes.

The medieval German legend of the [[Red Jews]] was partially based on stories of the Gates of Alexander. The legend disappeared before the 17th century.

==Geographical identifications==
[[File:Hyrcania-Alexanders-gates-map.svg|thumb|400px|Caspian Gates: Darial Gorge, Derbent,  Rhaegae, Wall of Gorgan.&lt;br/&gt;([[File:Yellowironoxide.jpg|14px|link=]] Iberia or ancient Georgia); [[File:Pink..PNG|14px|link=]] Hyrcania).]]
It is not clear which precise location Josephus meant when he described the Caspian gates. It may have been the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent|Gates of Derbent]] (lying due east, nearer to Persia), or it may have been the [[Darial Gorge]], (lying west, bordering [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]] or Georgia proper. Both are situated in present-day Dagistan.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=11, 51–52}}

However, neither these were within Hyrcania, but lay to the north and west of its boundaries. Another suggestion is some mountain pass in the [[Zagros Mountains|Taurus-Zagros Mountains]], somewhere near [[Rey, Iran|Rhaegae, Iran]], in the heart of Hyrcania.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=11}}

===Derbent===
[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The Caspian Gates in Derbent, Russia are often identified with the Gates of Alexander]]
The Gates of Alexander are most commonly{{cn|date=August 2016}} identified with the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]], whose thirty north-looking towers used to stretch for forty kilometers between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]], effectively blocking the passage across the Caucasus.

Derbent was built around the world's only{{fact|date=September 2011}} surviving [[Sassanid]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] fortress, which served as a strategic location protecting the empire from attacks by the [[Gokturks]]. The historical Caspian Gates were not built until probably the reign of [[Khosrau I of Persia|Khosrau I]] in the 6th century, long after Alexander's time, but they came to be credited to him in the passing centuries. The immense wall had a height of up to twenty meters and a thickness of about 10 feet (3 m) when it was in use.

===Darial===
The [[Pass of Dariel]] or Darial has also been known as the "Gates of Alexander" and is a strong candidate for the identity of the Caspian Gates.{{sfnp|Anderson|1932|p=15–20}}
[[File:Darielpass 1906.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Darial Gorge]] before 1906.]]

===Wall of Gorgan===
An alternative theory links the Caspian Gates to the so-called "Alexander's Wall" (the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]]) on the south-eastern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]], 180&amp;nbsp;km of which is still preserved today, albeit in a very poor state of repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kleiber|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Wall of Gorgan]] was built during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian dynasty]] simultaneously with the construction of the [[Great Wall of China]] and it was restored during the [[Sassanid]] era (3rd-7th centuries)&lt;ref name="PDF 5.3 MB"&gt;Omrani Rekavandi, H., Sauer, E., [[Tony Wilkinson|Wilkinson, T.]] &amp; Nokandeh, J.

'''''How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman''''' ({{lang-pt|Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês}}) is a [[Cinema of Brazil|Brazilian]] [[black comedy]] directed by [[Nelson Pereira dos Santos]] released in [[1971 in film|1971]].

Almost all of the dialogue in the film was written in the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] language.  The actors and actresses who portrayed the Tupinambas wore historically correct attire resulting in  a considerable amount of historically correct nudity and semi-nudity in many scenes. 

The location for the entire film was the Bay of [[Ilha Grande]], which has 365 islands and whose shores comprise the [[Angra dos Reis]] and [[Parati]] municipalities in the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].

==Plot==
In [[Colonial Brazil|16th century Brazil]] rival [[France|French]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlers are utilizing the indigenous people as allies in their struggle to establish control. The [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambás]], who live in the [[Guanabara Bay]] area, are allied with the French, while the [[Tupiniquim people|Tupiniquins]] are allied with the Portuguese.  

A Frenchman who has been captured by the Portuguese is then captured by the Tupinambás after they attack and kill a group of Portuguese. He tries to convince his captors by speaking in French (reciting the poem by [[Étienne Jodelle]] found in [[André Thévet]]'s ''Singularities of France Antarctique'') but the Tupinambás don't believe that the Frenchman was a prisoner of the Portuguese they have killed, and the Chief thinks he is Portuguese because "No Frenchman would shoot at the Tupinambá." The tribe's shaman predicted they would find a strong Portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chief's brother being killed by a Portuguese musket ball. Now they have one.

However, the Frenchman is allowed free run of the village area, is eventually provided with a "wife," and adopts traditional Tupinambá attire in place of his Western clothes. 
 
Another Frenchman comes to the village and tells the Tupinambás that their prisoner is indeed Portuguese—he then promises the outraged Frenchman that he will tell the Tupinambás the truth when the Frenchman finds a hidden treasure that another European has hidden in the area.

The relationship between the Frenchman and his Tupinambá "wife" remains enigmatic. It is unclear for most of the movie if she intends to save him from the group that wants to eat him, or if she has been assigned to win his trust and prevent him from escaping.  
 
After using cannon powder provided by the Frenchman to defeat the Tupiniquins in battle, the Tupinambás [[Human cannibalism|eat]] the Frenchman as celebration.

In the last seconds of his life the Frenchman refuses to play along with the ceremonial script that the Tupinambás expect him to follow and instead angrily (and loudly) tells the Tupinambás that his death will not revitalize them (as his death and the subsequent cannibal feast is intended to do) but rather will doom them all to extermination. 

The movie ends with a postscript that reveals the Tupiniquim were later exterminated by their own allies, the Portuguese.

The '''Information Age''' (also known as the '''Computer Age''', '''Digital Age''', or '''New Media Age''') is a [[history of the world|historic period]] in the [[21st century]] characterized by the rapid shift from traditional industry that the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought through industrialization, to an economy based on [[information technology]]. The onset of the Information Age is associated with the [[Digital Revolution]], just as the Industrial Revolution marked the onset of the Industrial Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43092627|title=The information age : economy, society and culture|last=Manuel.|first=Castells,|date=1996|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631215948|location=Oxford|oclc=43092627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of what digital means (or what information means) continues to change over time as new technologies, user devices, methods of interaction with other humans and devices enter the domain of research, development and market launch.

During the Information Age, the phenomenon is that the digital industry creates a knowledge-based society surrounded by a high-tech global economy that spans over its influence on how the manufacturing and service sectors operate in an efficient and convenient way.  In a commercialized society, the information industry is able to allow individuals to explore their personalized needs, therefore simplifying the procedure of making decisions for transactions and significantly lowering costs for both the producers and buyers.  This is accepted overwhelmingly by participants throughout the entire economic activities for [[wikt:efficacy|efficacy]] purposes, and new economic incentives would then be indigenously encouraged, such as the [[knowledge economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/146804/files/InformationSchool.pdf "Technology and Workforce: Comparison between the Information Revolution and the Industrial Revolution"] by Mathias Humbert, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;

The Information Age formed by capitalizing on [[Miniaturization|computer microminiaturization]] advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kluver|first=Randy|title=Globalization, Informatization, and Intercultural Communication|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan002006.htm|publisher=[[United Nations Public Administration Network]]|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution of technology in daily life and social organization has led to the fact that the modernization of information and communication processes have become the driving force of social evolution.&lt;ref name="HilbertDT&amp;SC"&gt;Hilbert, M. (2015). Digital Technology and Social Change [Open Online Course at the University of California] (freely available). Retrieved from https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/949415&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progression==
[[File:Rings of time Information Age (Digital Revolution).jpg|thumb|Rings of time showing some important dates in Information Age ([[Digital Revolution]]) from 1968 to 2017]]
===Library expansion===
Library expansion was calculated in 1945 by [[Fremont Rider]] to double in capacity every 16 years, if sufficient space were made available.&lt;ref name="The Scholar"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rider| title = The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library| publisher = Hadham Press| date = 1944| location = New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized [[microform]] analog photographs, which could be duplicated on-demand for library patrons or other institutions. He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media. Automated, potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth. [[Moore's law]], which was formulated around 1965, calculated that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-984051.html |title=Moore's Law to roll on for another decade |quote=Moore also affirmed he never said transistor count would double every 18 months, as is commonly said. Initially, he said transistors on a chip would double every year. He then recalibrated it to every two years in 1975. David House, an Intel executive at the time, noted that the changes would cause computer performance to double every 18 months. |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of the smaller and less expensive personal computers and improvements in computing power by the early 1980s resulted in a sudden access to and ability to share and store information for increasing numbers of workers.  Connectivity between computers within companies led to the ability of workers at different levels to access greater amounts of information.

===Information storage===
The world's technological capacity  to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986 to 15.8 in 1993, over 54.5 in 2000, and to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), roughly 4 CD-ROM per person of 1993, 12 CD-ROM per person in the year 2000, and almost 61 CD-ROM per person in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|last2=López|first2=Priscila|year=2011|title=The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6025|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.1200970|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21310967|via=|bibcode=2011Sci...332...60H}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the world's capacity to store information has reached 5 [[zettabytes]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillings|first=Michael R.|last2=Hilbert|first2=Martin|last3=Kemp|first3=Darrell J.|year=2016|title=Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/38f4b791|journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]]|volume=31|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 4,500 stacks of printed books from the [[earth]] to the [[sun]].

===Information transmission===
The world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993, 1.2 (optimally compressed) [[zettabytes]] in 2000, and 1.9 zettabytes in 2007 (this is the information equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day).&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007 (this is the information equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day).&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; In the 1990s,  the spread of the Internet caused a sudden leap in access to and ability to share information in businesses and homes globally. Technology was developing so quickly that a computer costing $3000 in 1997 would cost $2000 two years later and $1000 the following year.

===Computation===
The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[Million instructions per second|MIPS]] in 1986, to 4.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS in 1993, 2.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS in 2000 to 6.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; An article in the recognized Journal [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] reports that by now digital technology "has vastly exceeded the cognitive capacity of any single human being and has done so a decade earlier than predicted. In terms of capacity, there are two measures of importance: the number of operations a system can perform and the amount of information that can be stored. The number of synaptic operations per second in a human brain has been estimated to lie between 10^15 and 10^17. While this number is impressive, even in 2007 humanity's general-purpose computers were capable of performing well over 10^18 instructions per second. Estimates suggest that the storage capacity of an individual human brain is about 10^12 bytes. On a per capita basis, this is matched by current digital storage (5x10^21 bytes per 7.2x10^9 people)".&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016" /&gt;

==Relation to economics==
Eventually, [[Information and Communication Technology]]—computers, computerized machinery, [[fiber optic communication|fiber optics]], communication satellites, internet, and other ICT tools—became a significant part of the economy. Microcomputers were developed and many businesses and industries were greatly changed by ICT.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

[[Nicholas Negroponte]] captured the essence of these changes in his 1995 book, ''[[Being Digital]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/nn/bdcont.htm |title=Negroponte's articles |publisher=Archives.obs-us.com |date=1996-12-30 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book discusses similarities and differences between products made of atoms and products made of bits. In essence, a copy of a product made of bits can be made cheaply and quickly, and shipped across the country or internationally quickly and at very low cost.

===Impact on jobs and income distribution===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}

The Information Age has affected the workforce in several ways. It has created a situation in which workers who perform easily automated tasks are forced to find work that is not easily automated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Michael|title=How Information Gives You Competitive Advantage|url=https://hbr.org/1985/07/how-information-gives-you-competitive-advantage|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workers are also being forced to compete in a global [[job market]]. Lastly, workers are being replaced by computers that can do their jobs faster and more effectively. This poses problems for workers in industrial societies, which are still to be solved. However, solutions that involve lowering the [[working time]] are usually highly resisted.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Jobs traditionally associated with the middle class (assembly line workers, data processors, foremen and supervisors) are beginning to disappear, either through outsourcing or [[automation]]. Individuals who lose their jobs must either move up, joining a group of "mind workers" (engineers, doctors, attorneys, teachers, scientists, professors, executives, journalists, consultants), or settle for low-skill, low-wage service jobs.

The "mind workers" are able to compete successfully in the [[world economy|world market]] and receive (relatively) high wages. Conversely, production workers and service workers in industrialized nations are unable to compete with workers in developing countries and either lose their jobs through outsourcing or are forced to accept wage cuts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGowan|first=Robert|year=1991|title=The work of nations: Preparing ourselves for the 21st century capitalism, by Robert Reich. New York: Knopf Publishing, 1991|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.3930300407/abstract|journal=Human Resource Management|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=535–538|doi=10.1002/hrm.3930300407|issn=1099-050X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the internet makes it possible for workers in developing countries to provide in-person services and compete directly with their counterparts in other nations.

This has had several major consequences, including increased opportunity in developing countries and the globalisation of the workforce.

Workers in [[developing countries]] have a [[competitive advantage]] that translates into increased opportunities and higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In defense of Globalization|last=Bhagwati|first=Jagdish N.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full impact on the workforce in [[developing countries]] is complex and has downsides. (see discussion in section on [[Globalization|Globalisation]]).

In the past, the economic fate of workers was tied to the fate of [[national economies]]. For example, workers in the United States were once well paid in comparison to the workers in other countries. With the advent of the [[Information]] Age and improvements in communication, this is no longer the case.  Because workers are forced to compete in a global [[job market]], wages are less dependent on the success or failure of individual economies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Automation, productivity and job gain===
The Information Age has affected the workforce in that automation and computerisation have resulted in higher productivity coupled with net job loss in manufacture. In the United States for example, from January 1972 to August 2010, the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from 17,500,000 to 11,500,000 while manufacturing value rose 270%.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Manufacturing : Output vs. Jobs, January 1972 to August 2010 ".  BLS and Fed Reserve graphic, reproduced in Smith, Fran. [http://www.openmarket.org/2010/10/05/job-losses-and-productivity-gains/ "Job Losses and Productivity Gains"], OpenMarket.org, Oct 05, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it initially appeared that [[job loss]] in the [[industrial sector]] might be partially offset by the rapid growth of jobs in the [[IT sector]], the recession of March 2001 foreshadowed a sharp drop in the number of jobs in the IT sector. This pattern of decrease in jobs continued until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Sandra D. [http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/DE-Chap2.pdf "Information Technology Workers in the Digital Economy"], in Digital Economy 2003.  2003: Economics and Statistics Administration, Department of Commerce.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data has shown that overall, technology creates more jobs than it destroys even in the short run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yongsung|first=Chang|author2=Hong|title=Jay H.|journal=SERI Quarterly|date=July 2013|volume=6|issue=3|pages=44–53|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/89556690/does-technology-create-jobs|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of information-intensive industry===
Industry is becoming more information-intensive and less labor and capital-intensive (see [[Information industry]]). This trend has important implications for the workforce; workers are becoming increasingly productive as the value of their labor decreases. However, there are also important implications for capitalism itself; not only is the value of labor decreased, the value of capital is also diminished. In the classical model, investments in [[human capital]] and [[financial capital]] are important predictors of the performance of a new venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Arnold C.|last2=Gimeno-Gascon|first2=F. Javier|last3=Woo|first3=Carolyn Y.|year=1994|title=Initial human and financial capital as predictors of new venture performance|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883902694900132|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=9|issue=5|pages=371–395|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(94)90013-2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as demonstrated by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and [[Facebook]], it now seems possible for a group of relatively inexperienced people with limited capital to succeed on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/business/media/04carr.html|title=Film Version of Zuckerberg Divides the Generations|last=Carr|first=David|date=2010-10-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations==
The Information Age was enabled by technology developed in the [[Digital Revolution]], which was itself enabled by building on the developments in the [[Technological Revolution]].

===Computers===
{{main|History of computers}}

Before the advent of [[electronics]], [[mechanical computers]], like the [[Analytical Engine]] in 1837, were designed to provide routine mathematical calculation and simple decision-making capabilities. Military needs during [[World War II]] drove development of the first electronic computers, based on [[vacuum tubes]], including the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]], [[Colossus computer]], and [[ENIAC]].

The invention of the [[transistor]] in 1947 enabled the era of [[mainframe computers]] (1950s – 1970s), typified by the [[IBM 360]]. These large, room-sized computers provided data calculation and manipulation that was much faster than humanly possible, but were expensive to buy and maintain, so were initially limited to a few scientific institutions, large corporations, and government agencies. As transistor technology [[Moore's Law|rapidly improved]], the ratio of computing power to size increased dramatically, giving direct access to computers to ever smaller groups of people.

Along with electronic [[arcade machine]]s and [[home video game console]]s in the 1970s, the development of [[personal computer]]s like the [[Commodore PET]] and [[Apple II]] (both in 1977) gave individuals access to the computer. But data sharing between individual computers was either non-existent or largely [[sneaker net|manual]], at first using [[punched card]]s and [[magnetic tape]], and later [[floppy disk]]s.

===Data===
{{main|History of telecommunications}}

The first developments for storing data were initially based on photographs, starting with [[microphotography]] in 1851 and then [[microform]] in the 1920s, with the ability to store documents on film, making them much more compact.  In the 1970s, [[electronic paper]] allowed digital information to appear as paper documents.

Early [[information theory]] and [[Hamming code]]s were developed about 1950, but awaited technical innovations in data transmission and storage to be put to full use. While cables transmitting digital data connected [[computer terminals]] and [[peripheral]]s to mainframes were common, and special message-sharing systems leading to [[email]] were first developed in the 1960s, independent computer-to-computer networking began with [[ARPANET]] in 1969.  This expanded to become the [[Internet]] (coined in 1974), and then the [[World Wide Web]] in 1989.

Public digital data transmission first utilized existing phone lines using [[dial-up]], starting in the 1950s, and this was the mainstay of the Internet until [[broadband]] in the 2000s. The introduction of [[wireless networking]] in the 1990s combined with the proliferation of [[communications satellite]]s in the 2000s allowed for public digital transmission without the need for cables. This technology led to [[digital television]], [[GPS]], and [[satellite radio]] through the 1990s and 2000s.

Computers continued to become smaller and more powerful, to the point where they could be carried.  In the 1980s and 1990s, [[laptop]]s were developed as a form of portable computers, and [[PDA]]s could be used while standing or walking. [[Pager]]s existing since the 1950s, were largely replaced by [[mobile phone]]s beginning in the late 1990s, providing mobile networking features to some computers. Now commonplace, this technology is extended to [[digital camera]]s and other wearable devices. Starting in the late 1990s, [[Tablet computer|tablets]] and then [[smartphone]]s combined and extended these abilities of computing, mobility, and information sharing.

{{main|Optical communication}}

[[Optical communication]] has played an important role in [[communication network]]s.&lt;ref name="millman"&gt;S. Millman (1983), [http://doc.telephonecollectors.info/dm/BTL_History_Physical_Sciences_1983_op_r.pdf#page=34 ''A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System'', page 10], [[AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Optical communication provided the hardware basis for [[internet]] technology, laying the foundations for the [[Digital Revolution]] and Information Age.&lt;ref name="soh"&gt;[http://www.soh-vehe.jp/english/background3.html The Third Industrial Revolution Occurred in Sendai], Soh-VEHE International Patent Office, [[Japan Patent Attorneys Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While working at [[Tohoku University]], Japanese engineer [[Jun-ichi Nishizawa]] proposed [[fiber-optic communication]], the use of [[optical fiber]]s for optical communication, in 1963.&lt;ref name=Bhat&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bhat, K.

The three essential elements of optical communication were invented by Jun-ichi Nishizawa: the [[semiconductor laser]] (1957) being the light source, the graded-index optical fiber (1964) as the transmission line, and the [[PIN photodiode]] (1950) as the optical receiver.&lt;ref name="soh"/&gt; [[Izuo Hayashi]]'s invention of the [[continuous wave]] semiconductor laser in 1970 led directly to the light sources in fiber-optic communication, [[laser printer]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, and [[optical disc drive]]s, commercialized by Japanese entrepreneurs,&lt;ref name=burning&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnstone|first=Bob|title=We were burning : Japanese entrepreneurs and the forging of the electronic age.|year=2000|publisher=BasicBooks|location=New York|isbn=9780465091188|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opening up the field of optical communications.&lt;ref name="millman"/&gt;

[[File:Empty Frames at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The frame which once held ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]''|alt=An empty frame hanging on a wall, between several portraits]]

On March 18, 1990, 13 works of art valued at a combined total of $500 million were [[art theft|stolen]] from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in [[Boston]]. In the early hours, guards admitted two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the thieves tied up the guards and over the next hour committed the largest-value recorded theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to the art's recovery, but in 2017 this was temporarily doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set to the end of the year. This was extended into 2018 following helpful tips from the public.

The stolen works had originally been purchased by art collector [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] (1840–1924) and intended to be left on permanent display at the museum with the rest of her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return. Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was left untouched. Among the stolen works was ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'', one of only 34 known works by [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting, valued at over $200 million.{{when|At the time of the theft, or when since?|date=March 2018}} Also missing is ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'', [[Rembrandt]]'s only known [[seascape]]. Other works by Rembrandt, [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and [[Govaert Flinck|Flinck]] were also stolen.

According to the FBI, the stolen artwork was moved through the region and offered for sale in [[Philadelphia]] during the early 2000s. They believe the thieves were members of a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] based in the  [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]. They also claim to have targeted two suspects, although they have not been publicly identified and are now deceased. Boston gangster [[Robert Donati|Bobby Donati]], murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars, has been cited as a possible collaborator in the heist. Significant evidence suggests that [[Hartford, Connecticut]] gangster Robert Gentile knows the location of the works, although he denies involvement.

==Robbery==
Around midnight on Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red [[Dodge Daytona]] pulled up near the side entrance of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt; Two men with fake police uniforms waited for at least an hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a [[Saint Patrick's Day]] party nearby.&lt;ref name=abathstory&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/03/10/guard-who-opened-door-robbers-notorious-gardner-museum-heist-under-suspicion-years-later/1TUiDyi1GbcnBgQT64oISP/story.html |title=Decades after the Gardner heist, police focus on guard |first=Stephen |last=Kurkjian |work=Boston Globe |date=March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928031507/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/03/10/guard-who-opened-door-robbers-notorious-gardner-museum-heist-under-suspicion-years-later/1TUiDyi1GbcnBgQT64oISP/story.html |archivedate=September 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later at around 1{{nbsp}}a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with a fellow guard, the only other person in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt;

[[File:ISGardnerMuseum.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum|Gardner Museum]] in 2008|alt=refer to caption]]

At 1:24{{nbsp}}a.m., one of the two men outside pushed the buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a disturbance in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.&lt;ref name=insider&gt;{{cite news|date=May 2009 |first=Milton |last=Esterow |title=Inside the Gardner Case |url=http://www.artnews.com/2009/05/01/inside-the-gardner-case/ |work=ArtNews |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225044341/http://www.artnews.com/2009/05/01/inside-the-gardner-case/ |archivedate=December 25, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the museum was equipped with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves went upstairs to the Dutch Room. As one of them approached [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Self-Portrait'' (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting off the wall and  attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'' out of the frame, as well as ''[[A Lady and Gentleman in Black]]''.  They also removed [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' and [[Govaert Flinck]]'s ''[[Landscape with Obelisk]]'' from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze [[Gu (vessel)|gu]] from the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref name=insider /&gt;

Elsewhere in the museum, they stole five [[Degas]] drawings and an eagle [[finial]]. The finial sat at the top of a [[Napoleon]]ic flag, which they attempted to unscrew from the wall, but failed.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt; [[Manet]]'s ''[[Chez Tortoni]]'' was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27{{nbsp}}a.m. and again at 12:53{{nbsp}}a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once more, telling them "You'll be hearing from us in about a year," although they were never heard from again.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8:15{{nbsp}}a.m. later that morning.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt;

Altogether, thirteen pieces were stolen at an estimated loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest recorded private property theft in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/hot-canvases |title=Hot Canvases: A new book shatters myths about art theft |first=David |last=Menconi |work=Harvard Magazine |date=March–April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322000716/http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/hot-canvases |archivedate=March 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return.&lt;ref name=McShane&gt;{{cite book |last= McShane |first= Thomas |title= Stolen Masterpiece Tracker |year= 2006 |publisher= Barricade Books |isbn=978-1-56980-314-1 |first2= Dary |last2= Matera |chapter= 18.

==Investigation==
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] took control of the case on the grounds that the artwork would likely cross state lines.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; They have conducted hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving [[Scotland Yard]], [[Japan]]ese and [[France|French]] authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and art dealers.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The FBI believes the thieves were members of a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] based in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]], and that the stolen paintings were moved through [[Connecticut]] and the [[Philadelphia]] area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including ''The Storm on the Sea of Galilee''; however, their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited.&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= FBI Says It Has Clues in '90 Boston Art Heist |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/us/fbi-says-it-has-clues-in-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0 |work= The New York Times |accessdate= March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fbipress1&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/fbi-provides-new-information-regarding-the-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist |title=FBI Provides New Information Regarding the 1990 Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Art Heist: Information Sought from Those in Philadelphia and Connecticut Who May Have Knowledge of the Art's Location |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division |first=Greg |last=Comcowich |date=March 18, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710143612/https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/fbi-provides-new-information-regarding-the-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist |archivedate=July 10, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI stated it believed it knew the identity of the thieves in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased.

No single motive or pattern has emerged through the thousands of pages of evidence gathered.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available.&lt;ref name=McShane /&gt; The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two [[Raphael]]s and a [[Botticelli]] painting.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt; [[Titian]]'s ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', which is one of the museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt; Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the paintings from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the [[Irish Republican Army]] in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states [[Whitey Bulger]] was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;

The museum first offered a [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] of $1 million, but that was later increased to $5 million in 1997.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;  The reward is for "information that leads directly to the recovery of all of [their] items in good condition",&lt;ref name=fbipress1 /&gt; which remains on offer more than a quarter-century later.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; In May 2017, the bounty was doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set for midnight on December 31 of that year.&lt;ref name="10million"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner Museum staff|title=Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum : Gardner Museum doubles reward to $10 million for return of stolen art|url=http://www.gardnermuseum.org/resources/theft/reward_doubled|website=www.gardnermuseum.org|accessdate=May 26, 2017|language=en|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/design/gardner-museum-doubles-reward-for-recovery-of-stolen-masterpieces.html |title=Gardner Museum Doubles Reward for Recovery of Stolen Masterpieces |last=Bowley |first=Graham |date=May 23, 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 24, 2017 |issn=0362-4331 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524073316/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/design/gardner-museum-doubles-reward-for-recovery-of-stolen-masterpieces.html |archivedate=May 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Shelley |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/15/million-reward-for-stolen-gardner-museum-artwork-set-expire-end/3PD4IlwNU26FKpo4hLUCzK/story.html |title=$10m reward for stolen Gardner museum artwork set to expire at end of 2017 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reward was extended into 2018 following an outpouring of tips from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$10M Reward Extended For Return Of Stolen Gardner Museum Art|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/01/11/isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-heist-reward-extended/|website=CBS|accessdate=January 16, 2018|language=en|date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities have stated they will not charge anyone who voluntarily turns in the artwork, but anyone caught knowingly in possession of stolen items could be prosecuted.&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt;&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; The thieves cannot face charges because the five-year statute of limitations has expired.&lt;ref name=searchcont&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy |first1=Shelley |title=Search for artworks from Gardner heist continues 25 years later |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/17/gardner-museum-art-heist-one-boston-most-enduring-mysteries-years-later/9U3tp1kJMa4Zn4uClI1cdM/story.html |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215221154/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/17/gardner-museum-art-heist-one-boston-most-enduring-mysteries-years-later/9U3tp1kJMa4Zn4uClI1cdM/story.html |archivedate=February 15, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of DNA evidence===
In 2010, the FBI announced that some evidence from the original crime scene had been sent to the FBI's Laboratory in [[Quantico, Virginia]], for retesting with the hope of finding new [[DNA]] evidence to identify the culprits of the theft.

In June 2017, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that some of the crime scene evidence collected by the FBI was missing.  Even after an exhaustive search, they were unable to locate [[handcuffs]] and [[duct tape]] used to immobilize the museum's two security guards that could have contained traces of the thieves' DNA material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Shelley |last2=Kurkjian |first2=Stephen |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/12/evidence-gardner-museum-thefts-that-might-bear-dna-missing/bQgapZNs1FKlTczoAijqnJ/story.html |title=Evidence in Gardner Museum thefts that might bear DNA is missing |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=June 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leads===
In 1994, the museum director Anne Hawley received a letter that promised the return of the pieces for $2.6 million. If interested, the museum had to get ''The Boston Globe'' to publish a coded message in a business story. The message was published, but nothing further was heard once law enforcement got involved.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt;

Late one night in 1997, ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reporter Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn]] by William Youngworth, a career criminal and associate of New England art thief Myles Connor Jr.,&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; to see what was purported to be ''The Storm on the Sea of Galilee''. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit dealing with Youngworth after not making any progress.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; The painting has since disappeared.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;

[[File:Suffolk Downs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Suffolk Downs]] was searched in December 2015 without result|alt=Suffolk Downs]]
On August 6, 2015, police released a video from the night before the theft that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape: one remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New video shows possible dry run for Gardner Museum art Heist |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/08/06/new-video-shows-possible-dry-run-for-gardner-museum-art-heist/rxxqmXXfKI8ap180aT2BjL/story.html?p1=ClickedOnBreakingNewsBox |website=boston.com |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125203802/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/08/06/new-video-shows-possible-dry-run-for-gardner-museum-art-heist/rxxqmXXfKI8ap180aT2BjL/story.html?p1=ClickedOnBreakingNewsBox |archivedate=January 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=Is America's greatest art heist about to be solved? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/aug/07/americas-greatest-art-heist-solved-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum |website=The Guardian |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214212739/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/aug/07/americas-greatest-art-heist-solved-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum |archivedate=February 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guards had previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; &amp;ndash; which is not to say they could not have been collaborators.

In December 2015 FBI agents searched  [[East Boston]]'s [[Suffolk Downs]] [[horse racing]] track, acting on a tip consistent with rumors among Suffolk Downs employees in the 1990s that the stolen art was there. Stables, parts of the grandstand closed since the early 1990s, and two safes (which had to be drilled open) were searched without result.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurkjian |first1=Stephen |title=Search of Suffolk Downs for Gardner Museum masterpieces came up empty |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/27/search-suffolk-downs-for-gardner-museum-masterpieces-came-empty/H1iiRlZopLFfxOkM9Nm41J/story.html |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231020612/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/27/search-suffolk-downs-for-gardner-museum-masterpieces-came-empty/H1iiRlZopLFfxOkM9Nm41J/story.html |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential perpetrators===
{{further|Robert Donati#Possible role in Gardner Museum theft}}

Boston [[gangster]] [[Bobby Donati]] may have been involved in the heist. New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr., in prison at the time of the robbery, has stated that he and associate Bobby Donati eyed the museum in the 1980s and Donati oversaw the operation.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; Shortly before the robbery, Donati was seen at a nightclub with a sack of police uniforms.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; Donati worked under Boston crime boss [[Vincent M. Ferrara|Vincent Ferrara]], and visited him in prison in the early 1990s. When Ferrara asked about the robbery, Donati said he "buried the stuff" and would find a way to negotiate his release. Donati was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt;

[[Hartford, Connecticut]], gangster Robert "Bobby the Cook" Gentile has been suggested on multiple occasions as knowing the location of the Gardner works.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt;&lt;ref name=courant /&gt; In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]], Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor with the help of his son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the [[black market]].&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art.  In 2015, Gentile submitted to a [[polygraph|lie detector]] test, denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful.&lt;ref name=courant&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahoney |first1=Edmund H. |title=Prosecutors Reveal More Evidence They Say Ties Robert Gentile To Gardner Museum Robbery |url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-art-heist-0107-20160106-story.html |website=courant.com |publisher=Hartford Courant |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082228/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-art-heist-0107-20160106-story.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago.&lt;ref name="wcvb2may"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.wcvb.com/news/fbi-returns-to-home-of-man-linked-to-500m-art-heist/39340372 |title=FBI searching mobster's home for stolen Gardner masterpieces |website=WCVB |access-date=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510215744/http://m.wcvb.com/news/fbi-returns-to-home-of-man-linked-to-500m-art-heist/39340372 |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-sentencing-20170905-story.html|title=Feds Say Gentile's Feigning Mental Issues, But Gangster's Sentencing Postponed|last=MAHONY|first=EDMUND H.|work=courant.com|access-date=September 5, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the museum raised its bounty in 1997, Myles J. Connor Jr. said he could locate the missing artwork in exchange for [[legal immunity]]. Authorities rejected his offer. Connor now believes that the Gardner works have passed into other, unknown hands. "I was probably told, but I don't remember," he said, blaming a heart attack that affected his memory.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; Louis Royce, another Boston area gangster, claims he is still owed 15% for devising the plan for two fake policemen to request access to the museum at night.&lt;ref name=nydn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connelly |first1=Sherryl |title=Possible leads in $500M Boston museum robbery in 1990 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/leads-500m-boston-museum-robbery-1990-article-1.2115903  |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=January 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213151704/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/leads-500m-boston-museum-robbery-1990-article-1.2115903 |archivedate=December 13, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacques-François de Villiers''' (1727–1794) was a [[France|French]] physician and translator.

Villiers practised as a doctor in the camps of the royal army during the [[Seven Years' War]]. He was later appointed ''docteur-régent'' of the faculty of medicine at the [[University of Paris]] and also worked at the [[École nationale vétérinaire d'Alfort|Royal Veterinary School]].

He wrote ten articles for Diderot and D'Alembert's famous ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', including the longest article of the work, "Forneau (Chimie philosophique)" ("Furnace (Chemical philosophy"). He also contributed to the ''Journal de médecine'' and was the translator of numerous medical works from Latin and from English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Kafker, Frank A.: ''Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).''

'''Lingala''' (Ngala) is a [[Bantu language]] spoken throughout the northwestern part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and a large part of the [[Republic of the Congo]], as well as to some degree in [[Angola]] and the [[Central African Republic]]. It has over 10 million speakers.

==History==
In the 19th century, before the creation of the [[Congo Free State]], the ''Bangala'' (literally: 'river people') were a group of similar Bantu peoples living and trading along the bend of the Congo River that reached from [[Irebu]] at the mouth of the [[Ubangi River]] to the [[Mongala River]]. They spoke similar languages, such as [[Losengo language|Losengo]], but their trade language was [[Bangi language|Bangi]], which was the most prestigious language between [[Stanley Pool]] ([[Kinshasa]]) and Irebu. As a result, people upstream of the Bangala mistook Bangi for the language of the Bangala and called it Lingala (language of the Bangala), and European missionaries followed suit.

In the last two decades of the 19th century, after the forces of [[Leopold II of Belgium]] conquered the region and started exploiting it commercially, Bangi came into wider use. The colonial administration, in need of a common language for the region, started to use the language for administrative purposes. It had already simplified, compared to local Bantu languages, in its [[grammar|sentence structure]], [[morphology (linguistics)|word structure]] and [[phonology|sounds]], and speakers borrowed words and constructs liberally from other languages. However, the fact that speakers had very similar native languages prevented Lingala from becoming as radically restructured as [[Kituba]], which developed among speakers of both Bantu and West African languages.

Around 1900, [[Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae|CICM]] missionaries started a project to "purify" the language in order to make it "pure Bantu" again. Meeuwis (1998:7) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[M]issionaries, such as the Protestant W. Stapleton and later, and more influentially, E. De Boeck himself, judged that the grammar and lexicon of this language were too poor for it to function properly as a medium of education, evangelization, and other types of vertical communication with the Africans in the northwestern and central-western parts of the colony (..). They set out to 'correct' and 'expand' the language by drawing on lexical and grammatical elements from surrounding vernacular languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The importance of Lingala as a [[vernacular]] has since grown with the size and importance of its main center of use, [[Kinshasa]]; with its use as the [[lingua franca]] of the armed forces, and with the popularity of [[soukous]] music.

== Name ==
European missionaries called the language ''[[Bangala language|Bangala]]'', after the Bangala people, or ''Lingala''. The latter was intended to mean '(language) of the Bangala' or 'of the River' (that is, 'Riverine Language'). However, this was an error, as the proper Bangi form would have been ''Kingala''.&lt;ref name=Nurse&gt;Derek Nurse (2003) ''The Bantu Languages'', p 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Lingala'' first appears in writing in a publication by the [[CICM Missionaries|CICM]] missionary Egide De Boeck (1903).

== Characteristics and usage ==
According to some linguists, Lingala language is a Bantu-based creole of Central Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lingala-language|title=Lingala language|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with roots in the Bobangi language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bobangi.wordpress.com|title=Bobangi language|publisher=|accessdate=10 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In its basic vocabulary, Lingala has many borrowings from different other languages such as in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English.

In practice, the extent of borrowing varies widely with speakers of different regions (commonly among young people), and during different occasions.

'''[[French language|French]]''' 
* momie'', comes from 'ma mie' in old French meaning 'my dear" although it can sound like it means grandmother, is used in Lingala to mean [[girlfriend]]  
* ''kelasi'' for [[Class (education)|class]]/[[school]]

* ''chiclé'' for [[chewing gum]]

'''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]

* ''mésa'' for [[Table (furniture)|table]]
* ''sapátu'' for [[shoe]]s

* ''pesodent'' for [[Pesodent|peso dent]]
* ''mamiwata'' for [[mermaid]], literally [[Mammy archetype|mammy]]/[[seareine]]  
* ''búku'' for [[book]]&lt;ref&gt;Le grand Dzo : nouveau dictionnaire illustré lingala-français / Adolphe &lt;/ref&gt;
* ''mótuka'', from ''motor-car'', for [[car]]&lt;ref&gt;Lingala – Malóba ma lokóta/Dictionnaire&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
The Lingala language can be divided into several dialects or variations. The major variations are considered to be Standard Lingala, Spoken Lingala, Kinshasa Lingala and Brazzaville Lingala.

Standard Lingala (called ''lingala littéraire'' or ''lingala classique'' in French) is mostly used in educational and news broadcastings on radio or television, in religious services in the Roman Catholic Church and is the language taught as a subject at all educational levels. Standard Lingala is historically associated with the work of the Catholic Church and missionaries. It has a seven-vowel system {{IPA|/a/ /e/ /ɛ/ /i/ /o/ /ɔ/ /u/}} with an obligatory tense-lax [[vowel harmony]]. It also has a full range of morphological noun prefixes with mandatory grammatical agreement system with subject–verb, or noun–modifier for each of class. Standard Lingala is largely used in formal functions.

Spoken Lingala (called ''lingala parlé'' in French) is the variation mostly used in the day-to-day lives of Lingalaphones. It has a full morphological noun prefix system, but the agreement system is more lax than the standard variation, i.e. noun-modifier agreement is reduced to two classes. Regarding phonology, there is also a seven-vowel system but the vowel harmony is not mandatory. This variation of Lingala is historically associated with the Protestant missionaries' work. Spoken Lingala is largely used in informal functions, and the majority of Lingala songs use spoken Lingala over other variations. Modern spoken Lingala is increasingly influenced by French; French verbs, for example, may be "lingalized" adding Lingala inflection prefixes and suffixes: "acomprenaki te" or "acomprendraki te" (he did not understand, using the French word comprendre) instead of classic Lingala "asímbaki ntína te" (literally: s/he grasped/held the root/cause not).

====Vowel harmony====
Lingala words show [[vowel harmony]] to some extent. The close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} normally do not mix with the open-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in words. For example, the words ''ndɔbɔ'' 'fishhook' and ''ndobo'' 'mouse trap' are found, but not ''
*ndɔbo'' or ''
*ndobɔ''.

====Vowel shift====
The Lingala spoken in Kinshasa shows a vowel shift from {{IPA|/ɔ/}} to {{IPA|/o/}}, leading to the absence of the phoneme {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in favor of {{IPA|/o/}}. The same occurs with {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, leading to just {{IPA|/e/}}. So in Kinshasa, a native speaker will say ''mbóte'' as {{IPA|/ᵐbóte/}}, compared to the more traditional pronunciation of {{IPA|/ᵐbɔ́tɛ/}}.

(1) {{IPA|[ᶮʒ]}} is allophonic with {{IPAblink|ʒ}} depending on the dialect.

====Prenasalized consonants====
The [[prenasalized stop]]s formed with a nasal followed by a voiceless plosive are [[allophone|allophonic]] to the voiceless plosives alone in some variations of Lingala.
* {{IPA|/ᵐp/}}: {{IPA|[ᵐp]}} or {{IPA|[p]}}
*: e.g.: mpɛmbɛ́ni is pronounced {{IPA|[ᵐpɛᵐbɛ́ni]}} but in some variations {{IPA|[pɛᵐbɛ́ni]}}
* {{IPA|/ⁿt/}}: {{IPA|[ⁿt]}} or {{IPA|[t]}}
*: e.g.: ntɔ́ngó is pronounced {{IPA|ⁿtɔ́ᵑɡó}} but in some variations {{IPA|[tɔ́ᵑɡó]}}
* {{IPA|/ᵑk/}}: {{IPA|[ᵑk]}} or {{IPA|[k]}}
*: e.g.: nkanya (''fork'') is pronounced {{IPA|[ᵑkaɲa]}} but in some variations {{IPA|[kaɲa]}}
* {{IPA|/ⁿs/}}: {{IPA|[ⁿs]}} or {{IPA|[s]}} (inside a word)
*: e.g.: nyɔnsɔ is pronounced {{IPA|[ɲɔ́ⁿsɔ]}} but in some variations {{IPA|[ɲɔ́sɔ]}}
The prenasalized voiced occlusives, {{IPA|/ᵐb/, /ⁿd/, /ᵑɡ/, /ⁿz/}} do not vary.

===Tones===
Lingala being a [[tonal language]], tone is a distinguishing feature in [[minimal pair]]s, e.g.: ''mutu'' (human being) and ''mutú'' (head), or kokoma (to write) and kokóma (to arrive). There are two tones possible, the normal one is low and the second one is high. There is a third, less common tone – starting high, dipping low and then ending high – all within the same vowel sound, e.g.: ''bôngó'' (therefore).

====Tonal morphology====
Tense [[morphemes]] carry tones.
* koma (kom&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;-a : write) inflected gives
** [[simple present]] &lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;-a&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt; :

==Grammar==

===Noun class system===
Like all [[Bantu languages]], Lingala has a [[noun class]] system in which nouns are classified according to the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es they bear and according to the prefixes they trigger in sentences. The table below shows the noun classes of Lingala, ordered according to the numbering system that is widely used in descriptions of Bantu languages.

{|class="wikitable"
!Class!!Noun prefix!!Example!!Translation
|-
|'''1'''||mo-||mopési||''servant''
|-
|'''2'''||ba-||bapési||''servants''
|-
|'''3'''||mo-||mokíla||''tail''
|-
|'''4'''||mi-||mikíla||''tails''
|-
|'''5'''||li-||liloba||''word''
|-
|'''6'''||ma-||maloba||''words''
|-
|'''7'''||e-||elokó||''thing''
|-
|'''8'''||bi-||bilokó||''things''
|-
|'''9'''||m-/n-||ntaba||''goat''
|-
|'''10'''||m-/n-||ntaba||''goat (pl.)''
|-
|'''9a'''||Ø||sánzá||''moon''
|-
|'''10a'''||Ø||sánzá||''moon'' (pl.)
|-
|'''11'''||lo-||lolemo||''tongue''
|-
|'''12'''||bo-||bosoto||''dirt''
|-
|}

Individual classes pair up with each other to form singular/plural pairs, sometimes called 'genders'. There are seven genders in total. The singular classes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 take their plural forms from classes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, respectively. Additionally, many household items found in class 9 take a class 2 prefix (''ba'') in the plural: ''lutu'' → ''balutu'' 'spoon', ''mesa'' → ''bamesa'' 'table', ''sani'' → ''basani'' 'plate'. Words in class 11 usually take a class 10 plural. Most words from class 14 (abstract nouns) do not have a plural counterpart.

Class 9 and 10 have a nasal prefix, which [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] to the following consonant. Thus, the prefix shows up as 'n' on words that start with ''t'' or ''d'', e.g. ''ntaba'' 'goat', but as 'm' on words that start with ''b'' or ''p'' (e.g. ''mbisi'' 'fish'). There is also a prefixless class 9a and 10a, exemplified by ''sánzá'' → ''sánzá'' 'moon(s) or month(s)'. Possible ambiguities are solved by the context.

Noun class prefixes do not show up only on the noun itself, but serve as markers throughout the whole sentence. In the sentences below, the class prefixes are underlined. (There is a special verbal form 'a' of the prefix for class 1 nouns.)
*&lt;u&gt;mo&lt;/u&gt;lakisi &lt;u&gt;mo&lt;/u&gt;lai yango &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;biki (&lt;small&gt;CL&lt;/small&gt;1.teacher &lt;small&gt;CL&lt;/small&gt;1.tall that &lt;small&gt;CL&lt;/small&gt;1:recovered) ''That tall teacher recovered''
*&lt;u&gt;ba&lt;/u&gt;to &lt;u&gt;ba&lt;/u&gt;kúmisa Nkómbó ya Yɔ́ (&lt;small&gt;CL&lt;/small&gt;2.people &lt;small&gt;CL&lt;/small&gt;2.praise name of You) ''(Let) people praise Your name'' (a sentence from the Lord's Prayer)

Only to a certain extent, noun class allocation is [[Semantics|semantically]] governed. Classes 1/2, as in all Bantu languages, mainly contain words for human beings; similarly, classes 9/10 contain many words for animals. In other classes, semantical regularities are mostly absent or are obscured by many exceptions.

===Verb inflections and morphology===

====Verbal extensions====
There are 4 morphemes modifying verbs. They are added to some verb root in the following order:
# Reversive (-ol-)
#: e.g.: kozinga ''to wrap'' and kozingola ''to develop''
# Causative (-is-)
#: e.g. : koyéba ''to know'' and koyébisa ''to inform''
# Applicative (-el-)
#: e.g. : kobíka ''to heal (self), to save (self)'' and kobíkela ''to heal (someone else), to save (someone)''
# Passive (-am-)
#: e.g. : koboma ''to kill'' and kobomama ''to be killed''
# Reciprocal or stationary (-an-, sometimes -en-)
#: e.g. : kokúta ''to find'' and kokútana ''to meet''

====Tense inflections====
The first tone segment affects the subject part of the verb, the second tone segment attaches to the semantic morpheme attached to the root of the verb.
* present perfect (LH-í)
* simple present (LL-a)
* recurrent present (LL-aka)
* undefined recent past (LH-ákí)
* undefined distant past (LH-áká)
* future (L-ko-L-a)
* subjunctive (HL-a)

== Writing system ==
Lingala is more a spoken language than a written language, and has several different writing systems, most of them ad hoc. Due to the low literacy of Lingala speakers in Lingala (in the [[Republic of the Congo]] literacy rate in Lingala as a first language is between 10% and 30%),{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} its popular orthography is very flexible and varies from one Congo to the other. Some orthographies are heavily influenced by the French language orthography; including double S, ''ss'', to transcribe [s] (in the Republic of the Congo); ''ou'' for [u] (in the Republic of the Congo); i with trema, ''aï'', to transcribe {{IPA|[áí]}} or {{IPA|[aí]}}; e with acute accent, ''é'', to transcribe [e]; ''e'' to transcribe {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, o with acute accent, ó, to transcribe {{IPA|[ɔ]}} or sometimes [o] in opposition to o transcribing [o] or {{IPA|[ɔ]}}; i or y can both transcribe [j]. The allophones are also found as alternating forms in the popular orthography; ''sango'' is an alternative to ''nsango'' (information or news); ''nyonso'', ''nyoso'', ''nionso'', ''nioso'' (every) are all transcriptions of ''nyɔ́nsɔ''.

In 1976, the ''Société Zaïroise des Linguistes'' ([[Zaire|Zairian]] Linguists Society) adopted a writing system for Lingala, using the open e {{IPA|(ɛ)}} and the open o {{IPA|(ɔ)}} to write the vowels {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, and sporadic usage of accents to mark tone, though the limitation of input methods prevents Lingala writers from easily using the {{IPA|ɛ}} and {{IPA|ɔ}} and the accents. For example, it is almost impossible to type Lingala according to that convention with a common English or French keyboard. The convention of 1976 reduced the alternative orthography of characters but did not enforce tone marking. The lack of consistent accentuation is lessened by the disambiguation due to context.

The popular orthographies seem to be a step ahead of any academic based orthography. Many Lingala books, papers, even the translation of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and more recently, Internet forums, newsletters, and major websites, such as Google's Lingala, do not use the Lingala specific characters ɛ and ɔ. Tone marking is found in most literary works.

=== Alphabet ===
The Lingala language has 35 [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s and [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s. The digraphs each have a specific order in the alphabet, for example ''mza'' will be expected to be ordered before ''mba'', because the digraph ''mb'' follows the letter ''m''. The letters ''r'' and ''h'' are rare but present in borrowed words.
The accents indicate the tones :
* no accent for default tone, the low tone
* acute accent for the high tone
* circumflex for descending tone
* caron for ascending tone

'''''Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus''''' is the third novel in the [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'' series]], six juvenile [[science fiction]] novels by [[Isaac Asimov]] that originally appeared under the pseudonym Paul French.  The novel was first published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday &amp; Company]] in 1954.  Since 1972, reprints have included a foreword by Asimov explaining that advancing knowledge of conditions on [[Venus]] have rendered the novel's descriptions of that world inaccurate.

In his autobiography ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'', Asimov notes that his original version of the novel was rejected by Doubleday and had to be extensively revised before it was accepted:
{{quote|On the whole, Doubleday was justified, for Lucky Starr, in this particular adventure, was needlessly close-mouthed, allowing his sidekick to think he was an utter bastard, when I was merely trying to keep things from the reader.  I had to rewrite in such a way as to keep things from the reader in a subtler fashion and more in keeping with Lucky's character.}}

==Setting==
''Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus'' was written in the mid-1950s, when little was known about [[Venus]] apart from its mass, volume, orbital characteristics, and the fact of its unbroken cloud cover.  Asimov assumed that [[Venus in fiction#Swamp|Venus has a temperate climate]], with a period of rotation of 36 hours, a planet-wide ocean covering the surface, and an atmosphere that is 90% [[nitrogen]] and 10% [[carbon dioxide]]; that the planetary ocean is covered with blue-green native vegetation; and that native animals inhabit the ocean.  These animals, many of them [[phosphorescence|phosphorescent]], include an aggressive carnivore called an orange patch that shoots a jet of water at its prey, and the V-frogs, small amphibians that the human colonists keep as pets.

Asimov's Venus has a human population of six million living in some fifty domed cities on the ocean floor.  The largest Venusian city is Aphrodite, with a population of a quarter million. The chief exports are fertilizer made from the native vegetation, and animal feed derived from cultivated [[yeast]].

==Plot summary==

Shortly after returning from the [[Asteroid Belt]], David "Lucky" Starr learns that his Science Academy roommate Lou Evans had been sent to investigate trouble on Venus, but the Council of Science office on Venus has requested that he be recalled and investigated for corruption.

As Starr and John "Bigman" Jones are shuttled to Venus, their pilots suffer an episode of [[paralysis]], and Starr is required to keep their craft from smashing itself against the surface of the Venusian ocean.  Afterwards, the pilots have no memory of the event.

Upon reaching the Venusian city of Aphrodite, Starr and Bigman meet Dr. Mel Morriss, head of the Council of Science on Venus, who explains that Venusian scientists are perfecting strains of yeast that can be processed into luxury foods for export; whereas for six months there has been a growing series of incidents of bizarre behavior among the human colonists, often followed by [[amnesia]]. Morriss believes they are being [[telepathy|telepathically]] controlled by an unknown enemy.  Evans was sent to Venus to investigate, but was found with stolen data concerning a secret strain of yeast, and is under arrest.  When Starr confronts him, Evans admits to having stolen the data, but refuses to explain further.  While Starr is questioning him, word reaches them that a man is threatening to open an outside airlock, which will allow the ocean to flood Aphrodite.

Starr, Bigman, and Morriss go to the airlock to deal with the crisis, where they meet the city's chief engineer, Lyman Turner, the inventor and owner of a laptop computer carried with him.  While Bigman goes through the ventilation ducts to cut power to the airlock door, Starr realizes that the airlock crisis is a feint and hastens to Council headquarters, to find that Evans has escaped custody and left Aphrodite in a [[submarine]].

Starr and Bigman pursue Evans in another submarine, eventually finding him and learning that the V-frogs are the source of the telepathic incidents; Evans having tested this [[hypothesis]] by stealing the secret data on the yeast strain, and interesting the V-frogs therein with the result of an accident involving that strain. Evans further reveals that the V-frogs have trapped himself and the other protagonists beneath an enormous deep-sea orange patch, which will attack them if they attempt escape.

Starr, in response, leaves the submarine and uses an electric shock to destroy the orange patch's heart, killing it. He then returns to the submarine, and pilots this to the surface of the ocean, where he intends to communicate his findings to an orbiting [[space station]] to be relayed to the Council on Earth.

On the surface, the V-frogs communicate telepathically with him, telling him they intend to take over the minds of the humans on Venus. Initially they keep him away from the radio; but he is able to distract them and transmit his message. Returning to Aphrodite, Starr explains to Morriss that the V-frogs' telepathy is used by a human individual to attempt control over the rest of humanity, and that the means of doing so is Lyman Turner's computer. Bigman destroys the computer and Starr captures Turner, hoping to re-create his computer in the interest of reforming Turner himself.

==Themes==
In ''Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus'', Asimov returned to a recurring theme of his work&amp;nbsp;— the use of mental powers to influence or control the actions of others.  As far back as "[[Half-Breeds on Venus]]" in 1940, Asimov was writing about telepathic Venusians mentally controlling a native sauropod.  The character of the [[Mule (Foundation)|Mule]] from the 1945 [[Foundation series|Foundation]] story of the same name, and Joseph Schwartz from the 1950 novel ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'' could also use their mental powers to control others.  Later, Asimov would introduce the mind-reading robot [[List of Robot series characters#R. Giskard Reventlov|R. Giskard Reventlov]] in the 1983 novel ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', and the telepathic world-entity Erythro in the 1989 novel ''[[Nemesis (Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]''.  Asimov's science-fictional mentor, [[John W. Campbell]], was fascinated by the idea of telepathy, and as the editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', he was able to ensure that his fascination was reflected in the stories his writers wrote and his magazine printed.

Asimov also created a number of alien creatures to populate his Venusian ocean, and this was ''not'' a common theme of his.  Asimov's works usually centered on the interactions of sentient beings, usually humans or [[robot]]s, or occasionally intelligent aliens, with his fictional worlds serving only as backdrops.  For ''Oceans of Venus'', his only novel-length work set on that world, he hearkened back to the works of [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]], whose imaginative alien ecologies made him a major figure in the science fiction field during his brief writing career in the mid-1930s.  In his anthology ''[[Before the Golden Age]]'', Asimov wrote that ''Oceans of Venus'' was "a conscious imitation of the spirit" of Weinbaum's 1935 story "[[Parasite Planet]]", which was also set on Venus.

The growing [[Cold War]] background of the Lucky Starr series is also present in ''Oceans of Venus'', though here it serves as a red herring, causing Mel Morriss to wrongly suspect a Sirian plot behind the growing troubles on Venus.  Asimov also repeats a plot twist from ''[[David Starr, Space Ranger]]'', momentarily throwing suspicion on one character before revealing that the actual villain is someone else.

One unusual aspect of ''Oceans of Venus'' is the brief appearance of Lyman Turner's wife in chapter 7.  Mrs. Turner is the only female character to appear in the entire Lucky Starr series.

Both Turner and the Mule from the Foundation series are discovered and stopped due to very similar mistakes. The Mule could not bring himself to touch the mind of Bayta Darrell, the only woman who cared about him (and whom he seemed to love), leaving her free to piece together the clues about his identity. Similarly, Turner is exposed because he couldn't bring himself to disturb his dearly loved wife during the supposed danger to the city, despite their house being equipped with a shelter for such occasions, which made Starr realize he knew there was no danger in the first place.

==Reception==
Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Villiers Gerson praised the novel as "crackling with suspense, lit by humor, sparkling with complexities of plot, and alive with interest".&lt;ref&gt;"Teen-Agers: Science Fiction", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', November 14, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer [[Groff Conklin]] found ''Oceans of Venus'' a cut above the series's first two installments, calling it "a colorful and exciting tale. . . . [A] real thriller for fans of all ages."&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', February 1955, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Boucher]] similarly reported ''Oceans'' an improvement over the series's previous installments, singling out its "combining plausible adventure, interesting alien life-forms and a sound detective story."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading," ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|F&amp;SF]]'', February 1955, pp.97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]] also reviewed the novel favorably, ranking it with [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, P. Schuyler. "The Reference Library," ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]'', August 1955, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
In 1991 the story was adapted as a [[comic book]] by [[Fernando Fernandez (comics)|Fernando Fernandez]].

[[Image:Man Myth Magic no1.jpg|thumb|right|First Edition Cover. Painting by [[Austin Osman Spare]]]]'''''Man, Myth &amp; Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] of the [[supernatural]], including [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[mythology]] and [[religion]]. It was edited by [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]]. The art director was Brian Innes, former percussionist of [[The Temperance Seven]].

''Man, Myth &amp; Magic'' was originally published as a British weekly magazine by BPC Publishing, Ltd.. The printer was [[Purnell &amp; Sons. Leeds]]. Publication commenced in 1970, and continued for 112 issues spanning 1,000 articles with some 5,000 illustrations, many of them in full colour. Purnell also sold binders for gathering the installments into seven volumes, plus one additional binder for the magazine covers.

In 1970 [[BPC Publishing Ltd]] put out a very popular hardcover set condensing all 112 magazines into a 24 volume set.&lt;ref name="MMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro-reading.com/mamyandma.html|title=Man, Myth and Magic|publisher=Retro-Reading|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was reprinted as a 21 volume revised edition by [[Marshall Cavendish]] in 1995 ({{ISBN|9781854357311}}).&lt;ref name="21Vol"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Man-Myth-Magic-Illustrated-Encyclopedia/dp/185435731X|title=Man, Myth and Magic: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mythology, Religion and the Unknown (21 Volume Set) (9781854357311)  Richard Cavendish, Amanda Harman, Brian Innes  Books|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The material has been sold to Cavendish Square Publishing, which has published ten volumes of the material reorganized into books according to subject, including ''Witches and Witchcraft'' as well as ''Beliefs, Rituals, and Symbols of Ancient Greece and Rome''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cavendish Square Products|url=https://cavendishsq.com/products|website=Cavendish Square Publishing|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two hundred academics and specialists contributed to the magazine, and wrote in a generally accessible style.

The editorial board consisted of:

* [[Glyn Daniel]], archaeologist and editor of '[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'.
* [[E. R. Dodds]], former [[Regius Professor of Greek (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Greek]] at Oxford.
* [[Mircea Eliade]], professor of the History of Religion at [[University of Chicago]].

The four '''Miles brothers''', Harry, Herbert, Joseph, and Earle C, were pioneers in American cinema. In 1902, they established one of the first motion picture exchanges in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golden Gate and the silver screen |last=Bell |first=Geoffrey |authorlink= |year=1984 |publisher=[[Associated University Presses]] |isbn= |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlMYmqI13HcC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;ots=M0sukOS1UV&amp;dq=%22Miles%20Brothers%22%20film%20OR%20cinema&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Miles%20Brothers%22%20film%20OR%20cinema&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 1906 film, ''[[A Trip Down Market Street]]'', is an historic 13-minute journey down Market Street in [[San Francisco]] from 8th Street to the Embarcadero, giving a rare view of the street before the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Market Street on film 1906 |author=Max Garrone |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=30 April 2010 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/stew/detail?entry_id=62237 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was long thought to have been made in September 1905, after being dated as such by the [[Library of Congress]] based on the state of construction of several buildings.

However, in 2009 and 2010, film historian David Kiehn, a co-founder of Niles Film Museum in [[Fremont, California|Niles, California]], a museum devoted to [[Essanay Studios]], dated the film to the spring of 1906 from automobile registrations and weather records. Kiehn and eventually found promotional materials from the film's original release.  The film was sent to New York City by train the night before the earthquake, which destroyed the Miles Brothers' studio where it had been kept.  Three prints survive as of 2010, and it has been digitally restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/stew/detail?entry_id=74952&amp;tsp=1|title='60 Minutes' does take on 1906 'A Trip Down Market Street'|first=Vlae|last=Kershner|date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5171">In cognitive psychology, the '''missing letter effect''' refers to the finding that, when people are asked to [[consciously]] detect target letters while reading text, they miss more letters in frequent, function words (e.g. the letter "h" in "the") than in less frequent, content words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The effect is usually measured using a paper-and-pencil procedure, where readers are asked to circle a target letter every time they come across it while reading a short passage.  The missing letter effect is more likely to appear when reading words that are part of a normal sequence, than when words are embedded in a mixed-up sequence (e.g. readers asked to read backwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Hypotheses==
Two primary hypotheses tried to explain the missing letter effect: [[Alice F. Healy|Healy]] (1994) emphasized identification processes playing a crucial role, almost entirely focusing on word frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Healy
  | first = A. F.

  | doi = 10.3758/BF03213975
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Koriat &amp; Greenberg (1994) viewed the structural role of the word within a sentence (i.e. function words vs. content words) to be crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both accounts were thoroughly investigated, but neither could completely explain the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | pmid = 11318050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new model called the guidance-organization model was recently proposed to potentially explain the missing letter effect. It is a combination of the two models proposed by Healy, Koriat, and Greenberg.  As Greenberg et al. explain: "The time spent processing high-frequency function words at the whole-word level is relatively short, thereby enabling the fast and early use of these words to build a tentative structural frame."&lt;ref&gt;

Klein and Saint-Aubin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klein |first1=Raymond |title=What a simple letter-detection task can tell us about cognitive processes in reading |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=2016 |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=417-425 |doi=10.1177/0963721416661173}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the attentional-disengagement model similarly includes aspects of the two earlier models but emphasizes the role of attention in reading and comprehension. They suggest that attention disengages faster from functional words than content words leading to the missing letter effect.

The term was first coined by [[Alfred A. Tomatis]] who used [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's music]] as the listening stimulus in his work attempting to cure a variety of disorders. The approach has been popularized in Don Campbell's book, ''The Mozart Effect'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Don|title=The Mozart Effect : tapping the power of music to heal the body, strengthen the mind, and unlock the creative spirit|date=1997|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0380974184|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted scores on one portion of the [[IQ]] test.&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = Frances H.| last2 = Shaw | first2 = Gordon L.| last3 = Ky | first3 = Catherine N.| doi = 10.1038/365611a0 | title = Music and spatial task performance | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 365 | issue = 6447 | pages = 611 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8413624| pmc = | url = http://www.uwosh.edu/psychology/faculty-and-staff/frances-rauscher-ph.d/Rauscher_ShawKy_1993.pdf/view}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the [[List of Governors of Georgia|United States' Governor of Georgia]], [[Zell Miller]], proposed a budget to provide every child born in Georgia with a CD of [[classical music]].

==Alfred A. Tomatis==
The concept of the "Mozart effect" was described by French researcher [[Alfred A. Tomatis|Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis]] in his 1991 book ''Pourquoi Mozart?'' (''Why Mozart?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~biglars/Mozart.html|title=Mozart on the Brain|first=Lars|last=Sorensen|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the music of Mozart in his efforts to "retrain" the ear, and believed that listening to the music presented at differing frequencies helped the ear, and promoted healing and the development of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Billie M.|last2=Andrews|first2=Susan R.|title=An historical commentary on the physiological effects of music: Tomatis, Mozart and neuropsychology|journal=Integrative Physiological and Behavioral Science|volume=35|issue=3|pages=174–188|doi=10.1007/BF02688778|pmid=11286370|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rauscher ''et al.'' 1993 study==
Frances Rauscher, Gordon Shaw, and Catherine Ky (1993) investigated the effect of listening to music by Mozart on [[spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial reasoning]], and the results were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They gave research participants one of three standard tests of abstract spatial reasoning after they had experienced each of three listening conditions: the [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448]]  by Mozart, verbal relaxation instructions, and silence. They found a temporary enhancement of spatial-reasoning, as measured by spatial-reasoning sub tasks of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Rauscher et al. show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary: no student had effects extending beyond the 15-minute period in which they were tested. The study makes no statement of an increase in IQ in general (because IQ was never measured).&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"/&gt;

==Popularization==
While Rauscher et al. only showed an increase in "spatial intelligence", the results were popularly interpreted as an increase in general IQ. This misconception, and the fact that the music used in the study was by Mozart, had an obvious appeal to those who valued this music; the Mozart effect was thus widely reported. In 1994, ''[[New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] wrote in a light-hearted article, "researchers [Rauscher and Shaw] have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter", and presented this as the final piece of evidence that Mozart has dethroned [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the world's greatest composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=CLASSICAL VIEW; Listening To Prozac . . . Er, Mozart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/arts/classical-view-listening-to-prozac-er-mozart.html|publisher=New York Times|date=August 28, 1994|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; " A 1997 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article mentioned some of the Rauscher and Shaw results. It described one study in which three- and four-year-olds who were given eight months of private piano lessons scored 30% higher on tests of spatio-temporal reasoning than control groups given computer lessons, singing lessons, and no training. 

The 1997 book by Don Campbell, ''The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit'', discusses the theory that listening to [[Mozart]] (especially the piano concertos) may temporarily increase one's [[IQ]] and produce many other beneficial effects on mental function. Campbell recommends playing specially selected classical music to infants, in the expectation that it will benefit their [[neural development|mental development]].

After ''The Mozart Effect'', Campbell wrote a follow-up book, ''The Mozart Effect For Children'', and created related products. Among these are collections of music that he states harness the Mozart effect to enhance "deep rest and rejuvenation", "intelligence and learning", and "creativity and imagination". Campbell defines the term as "an inclusive term signifying the transformational powers of music in health, education, and well-being. It represents the general use of music to reduce stress, depression, or anxiety; induce relaxation or sleep; activate the body; and improve [[memory]] or [[awareness]]. Innovative and experimental uses of music and sound can improve listening disorders, [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|attention deficit disorder]], [[autism]], and other mental and physical disorders and diseases".&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Don |title=The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit |year=1997 |isbn=0-380-97418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are controversial. The relationship of sound and music (both played and listened to) for cognitive function and various physiological metrics has been explored in studies with no definitive results.

==Political impact==
The political impact of the theory was demonstrated on January 13, 1998, when [[Zell Miller]], governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], announced that his proposed state budget would include $105,000 a year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. Miller stated "No one questions that listening to music at a very early age affects the spatial-temporal reasoning that underlies math and engineering and even chess." Miller played legislators some of Beethoven's "[[Ode to Joy]]" on a tape recorder and asked "Now, don't you feel smarter already?" Miller asked [[Yoel Levi]], music director of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra|Atlanta Symphony]], to compile a collection of classical pieces that should be included. State representative [[Buddy DeLoach|Homer DeLoach]] said "I asked about the possibility of including some [[Charlie Daniels]] or something like that, but they said they thought the classical music has a greater positive impact. Having never studied those impacts too much, I guess I'll just have to take their word for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Sack |title=Georgia's Governor Seeks Musical Start for Babies |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A12 |date=1998-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent research and meta-analyses ==
While some supportive reports have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T., Brown, T. |title=Reexamination of the effect of Mozart's music on spatial task performance|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=131|issue=4|pages=365|doi=10.1080/00223989709603522|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies with positive results have tended to be associated with any form of music that has energetic and positive emotional qualities.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thompson, W.F., Schellenberg, E.G. &amp; Husain, G. |title=Arousal, mood, and the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=3|pages=248–51|pmid=11437309|year=2001|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Husain"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Husain, G., Thompson, W.F. &amp; Schellenberg, E.G. |title=Effects of musical tempo and mode on arousal, mood, and spatial abilities: Re-examination of the "Mozart effect"|journal=Music Perception|volume=20|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1525/mp.2002.20.2.151|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the intellectual benefits of enhanced mood and arousal are not restricted to spatial-temporal reasoning, but extend to speed of processing and creative problem solving.&lt;ref name="Ilie"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ilie, G., &amp; Thompson, W.F. |year=2011|title= Experiential and cognitive changes following seven minutes exposure to music and speech|journal= Music Perception|volume= 28|issue=3|pages= 247–264|doi=10.1525/mp.2011.28.3.247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among children, some studies suggest no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|doi=10.1348/026151002166433|title=Listening to Mozart does not improve children's spatial ability: Final curtains for the Mozart effect|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=241|last1 = McKelvie|first1 = Pippa|last2=Low|first2=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others suggest that the effect can be elicited with energetic popular music that the children enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schellenberg, E.G., &amp; Hallam, S. |title=Music listening and cognitive abilities in 10 and 11 year olds: The Blur effect|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1060|pages=202–9|pmid=16597767|year=2005|doi=10.1196/annals.1360.013|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1507375/1/SchellenbergHallam2006Music202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of subsequent evidence supports either a null effect, or short-term effects related to increases in mood and arousal, with mixed results published after the initial report in ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="bridgett"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of listening to Mozart and Bach on the performance of a mathematical test|pmid=10939064|last=Bridgett |first=D.J.|author2=Cuevas, J.|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=90|issue=3 Pt 2|year=2000 |pages=1171–1175|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999  a major challenge was raised to the existence of the Mozart effect by two teams of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F.| title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 400 | issue = 6747 | pages = 826–827| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid =  10476958| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = K.

Chabris reported a  [[meta-analysis]] demonstrating that "any cognitive enhancement is small and does not reflect any change in IQ or reasoning ability in general, but instead derives entirely from performance on one specific type of cognitive task and has a simple neuropsychological explanation", called "enjoyment arousal". For example, he cites a study that found that "listening either to Mozart or to a passage from a [[Stephen King]] story enhanced subjects' performance in paper folding and cutting (one of the tests frequently employed by Rauscher and Shaw) but only for those who enjoyed what they heard". Steele et. al. found that "listening to Mozart produced a 3-point increase relative to silence in one experiment and a 4-point decrease in the other experiment".&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steele |first=M |title=Papers by Steele casting doubt on the Mozart effect |publisher=appstate.edu |url=http://www.acs.appstate.edu/~kms/research/Steele.htm |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, the effect was replicated with the original Mozart music, but eliminated when the tempo was slowed down and major chords were replaced by minor chords.&lt;ref name="Husain"/&gt;

Another meta-analysis by Pietschnig, Voracek, and Formann (2010) combined results of 39 studies to answer the question as to whether or not the Mozart Effect exists. They concluded that there is little evidence to support the Mozart effect, as shown by small effect sizes. However, the most striking finding in this meta-analysis is the significantly larger effects published in studies affiliated with Rauscher or Rideout, with effect sizes more than three times higher for published studies affiliated with these founding members of the Mozart Effect. These systematic moderating effects due to lab affiliation call into question the existence of a Mozart Effect. In addition, this study also found strong evidence supporting a confounding [[publication bias]] when effect sizes of samples who listened to Mozart are compared to samples not exposed to a stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pietschnig|first1=Jakob|last2=Voracek|first2=Martin|last3=Formann|first3=Anton K.|title=Mozart effect–Shmozart effect: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=3|year=2010|pages=314–323|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite implementing Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky's (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|last2=Shaw|first2=Gordon L.|last3=Ky|first3=Katherine N.|title=Listening to Mozart enhances spatial-temporal reasoning: towards a neurophysiological basis|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=185|issue=1|year=1995|pages=44–47|pmid=7731551|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(94)11221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggestions of three key components that must be present to replicate the Mozart Effect, McCutcheon (2000) still failed to reproduce the Mozart Effect in a study with 36 adults. These conditions were: to ensure a task that taps into spatial components of mental imagery; a research design that does not include a pretest to avoid ceiling effects; a musical composition that is complex rather than repetitive and simple. Regardless of listening to classical music, jazz or silence, the study did not yield a significant effect on spatial reasoning performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lynn E.|title=Another failure to generalize the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=87|issue=5|year=2000|pages=325–30|pmid=11026433|doi=10.2466/pr0.2000.87.1.325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mozart Effect is likely just an artifact of arousal and heightened mood.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Martin H.|last2=West|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Estell|first3=David B.|title=The Mozart effect: Arousal, preference, and spatial performance.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=S|issue=1|year=2006|pages=26–32|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.S.1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Arousal and mood factors in the "Mozart effect"|pmid=11011888|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=91|issue=1|year=2000|pages=188–190|url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms//documents/Arousal.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.91.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arousal is the confounding variable that mediates the relationship between spatial ability and music that defines the Mozart Effect.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt; The "neural resonance" theory of Rauscher and colleagues which contends that Mozart's music primes the neural pathways of spatial reasoning has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"/&gt;

Government bodies also became involved in analysing the wealth (some 300+ articles as of 2005) of reports. A German report concluded, for instance, that "... passively listening to Mozart — or indeed any other music you enjoy — does not make you smarter. But more studies should be done to find out whether music lessons could raise your child's IQ in the long term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Abbott |title=Mozart doesn't make you clever |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070413/full/news070409-13.html |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate= 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ralph |last=Schumacher |title=Macht Mozart schlau? |url=http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |publisher=Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung |page=183 |accessdate=2009-05-22 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172239/http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular presentations of the "Mozart effect", including Alex Ross's comment that "listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter" and Zell Miller's "don't you feel smarter" query to the Georgia legislature, almost always tie it to "intelligence." Rauscher, one of the original researchers, has disclaimed this idea. In a 1999 reply to an article challenging the effect,&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt; published along with the article, she wrote (emphasis added):
{{quote|Our results on the effects of listening to ''Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major K. 448'' on spatial–temporal task performance have generated much interest but several misconceptions, many of which are reflected in attempts to replicate the research. The comments by Chabris and Steele et al. echo the most common of these: that listening to Mozart enhances intelligence. ''We made no such claim.'' The effect is limited to spatial–temporal tasks involving mental imagery and temporal ordering.}}

On efforts like Miller's budget proposal, and the press attention surrounding the effect, Rauscher has said, "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;ref name="rauschernyt"&gt;Goode, Erica (1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/science/mozart-for-baby-some-say-maybe-not.html "Mozart For Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"]. ''The New York Times'', 1999-08-03 p. f1: Rauscher, "the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars in the psychological community now view the claim that playing classical music to children can boost their intelligence to be a "myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology |isbn=1405131128|author1=Lilienfeld, Scott O. |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |author2=Lynn, Steven Jay |author3=Ruscio, John |author4=Beyerstein, Barry L. |year=2009|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Emory University]] psychologist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] ranks Mozart Effect as number six in his book ''[[50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=University of Vienna|authorlink1=University of Vienna|title=Mozart's music does not make you smarter, study finds|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100510075415.htm|website=www.sciencedaily.com|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health benefits===
Music has been evaluated to see if it has other properties. The April 2001 edition of ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' assessed the possible health benefits of the music of Mozart.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/mozart.html |title=The Mozart Effect |publisher=epilepsy.org |accessdate= 2007-08-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109052504/http://epilepsy.org.uk/info/treatment/mozart-effect|archivedate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jenkins played Sonata K.448 to patients with epilepsy and found a decrease in epileptiform activity. According to the British Epilepsy Organization, research has suggested that apart from Mozart's [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|K.448]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488)]], only one other piece of music has been found to have a similar effect; a song by the Greek composer [[Yanni]], entitled "Acroyali/Standing in Motion" (version from ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]] performed at the [[Acropolis]]'').&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt; It was determined to have the "Mozart effect", by the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' because it was similar to Mozart's K.448 in [[tempo]], structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yanni in Words67"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yanni |author2=Rensin, David |title=Yanni in Words |publisher=[[Miramax Books]] |year=2002 |isbn=1-4013-5194-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of Mozart's music==
While it is clear that exposure to Mozart does not raise IQ, studies of the effects of music have explored as diverse areas as its links to [[seizure]] onset&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=J. R.|last2=Daaboul|first2=Y.|last3=Fino|first3=J. J.|last4=Shaw|first4=G. L.|title=The "Mozart Effect" on Epileptiform Activity|journal=Clinical EEG and Neuroscience|volume=29|issue=3|year=1998|pages=109–119|doi=10.1177/155005949802900301}}&lt;/ref&gt; or research in animals suggesting that even exposure in-utero in rats improves their [[maze]] learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Improved maze learning through early music exposure in rats |pmid=9664590 |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information | volume=20 |issue=5 |date=July 1998 |journal=Neurol.

J. |doi=10.1080/01616412.1998.11740543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original claim continues to influence public life. For instance a German [[sewage treatment]] plant plays Mozart music to break down the waste faster, reports the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]''.  Anton Stucki, chief operator of the [[Treuenbrietzen]] plant was quoted as saying, "We think the secret is in the vibrations of the music, which penetrate everything—including the water, the sewage and the cells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Sewage plant plays Mozart to stimulate microbes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/sewage-mozart-germany|accessdate=8 April 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red Umbrella Project''' is a [[New York City|New York]] based [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that advocates on behalf of [[sex worker]]s and strives to empower them by giving them a voice.

== History  ==
The Red Umbrella Project was founded in 2010 by writer and activist [[Audacia Ray]]. As a former sex worker, Ray witnessed first-hand the [[discrimination]] against sex workers by police and society.  Ray envisioned an organization where sex workers could come together to share their stories, advocate for change and help one another.  She chose the name The Red Umbrella Project because in 2001 during the 49th Venice Biennale of Art in [[Venice|Venice, Italy]], sex workers demonstrated against inhumane work conditions and [[human rights violation]] by holding up [[International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers|red umbrellas]], making this a symbol of resistance to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/campaigns/red-umbrella-campaigns|title=Under the Red Umbrella  {{!}} Sex Work Europe|website=www.sexworkeurope.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Ray started hosting storytelling events for sex workers at the Happy Ending Lounge on New York's Lower East Side. The goals of these workshops and storytelling events were to shine light and empower sex workers, but it soon became apparent that these sex workers shared several common burdens. Many identified as [[Transgender|trans]] or [[queer]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; there was an alarming rate of [[HIV/AIDS]] cases among them,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/trans-sex-workers-are-25-times-more-likely-to-be-hiv-positive-than-the-general-population/|title=Trans Sex Workers Are 25 Times More Likely to Be HIV Positive Than the General Population|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; they feared carrying condoms due to the criminalization of condoms,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  and most of all they were tossed aside and mistreated by most of society, when all they were doing is trying to make a living and find economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/sex-workers-legalization-c-v-r.html|title=Is Prostitution Just Another Job?|last=|first=|date=2016-03-21|work=|newspaper=New York Magazine|access-date=2016-12-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/nyregion/08bodies.html|title=Prostitute Disappearances Unnoticed Until Bodies Were Found|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|date=2011-04-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy issues ==

=== Sex-worker diversion programs ===
In 2014 New York City created a series of special courts for sex workers arrested on prostitution-related charges. The new courts, known as [[Human trafficking|Human Trafficking]] Intervention Courts (HTIC),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/12/sex-trafficking-victims-not-prostitutes-finally-getting-help-and-a-new-name-in-court.html|title=Sex Trafficking Victims, Not 'Prostitutes,' Finally Getting Help (and a New Name) in Court|last=Ungar-Sargon|first=Batya|date=2015-01-12|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  treated all sex workers as human trafficking victims, and through a variety of [[bullying]] tactics forced defendants to forgo their [[constitutional right]] of a [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] and agree to a [[plea bargain]] of a sex worker diversion program which consisted of a court mandated treatment program, followed by [[adjournment in contemplation of dismissal]] (ACD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/why-are-new-york-courts-lumping-in-sex-workers-with-the-victims-of-human-trafficking-6680891|title=Why Are New York Courts Lumping in Sex Workers With the Victims of Human Trafficking?|last=Merlan|first=Anna|date=2014-10-01|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Umbrella Project argued that the city's intentions were good and that the new court does help people who are forced into sex work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the court still treats the sex workers like criminals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/sex-workers-and-the-city-0000550-v22n1|title=Special Prostitution Courts and the Myth of 'Rescuing' Sex Workers - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-20|date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes the assumption that all sex workers are victims of human trafficking and that no one does sex work out of free will, for their personal economic gain. There may also be assumed [[Workplace discrimination|discrimination within the workforce]] due to the fact that many sex workers are of [[Person of color|color,]] queer or trans. The counseling and assistance offered through the court mandated treatment program provides them with no way of economic opportunity other than sex work. The Red Umbrella Project wants to see the sex-worker diversion program restructured with an emphasis on [[economic empowerment]] through job training and economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/why-do-sex-work-diversion-programs-fail/|title=Why Do Sex-Work Diversion Programs Fail?|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-ny-courts-treating-sex-workers-as-trafficking-victims|title=Not Everyone Is Happy with the NY Courts Treating Sex Workers as Trafficking Victims {{!}} VICE News|newspaper=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/gira-grant-flawed-justice-sex-workers-article-1.1958688?cid=bitly|title=Gira Grant: Flawed justice for sex workers|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS and trans health disparity ===
The Red Umbrella Project along with the Nation Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) and Best Practices Policy Project (BPPP) published a report that [[transgender]] people in the sex trade are twelve times more likely to be living with HIV/AIDS than transgender people who were never involved in the sex trade and twenty-five times more likely to be living with HIV/AIDS than the general population. The Red Umbrella Project points to the fear of [[condom]]s as being used as evidence of prostitution along with [[Racial profiling|profiling of race]] and [[Gender policing|gender]] by police officers where: "Women and trans people having condoms on them is criminalized, whereas a white [[Cisgender|cis male]] having condoms on him is looked at as safe-sex practice." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/13553/Criminalizing_Condoms_Sex_Workers_Get_Policed_but_Remain_Unprotected|title=Criminalizing Condoms: Sex Workers Get Policed but Remain Unprotected|last=Chen|first=Michelle|date=2012-07-20|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Red Umbrella Project and other advocacy groups have been able to push for reform in heavily [[Liberalism|liberal]] cities such as New York City, [[San Francisco]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nypd-condoms-20140513-story.html|title=NYPD limits use of condoms seized from sex workers as evidence|last=Susman|first=Tine|date=2014-05-12|work=|publisher=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2016-12-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other more [[Conservatism|conservative]] cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] use condoms as evidence as part of their anti-prostitution campaign Project Rose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The Red Umbrella Diaries ==
[[File:Nahshon and Audacia Ray.jpg|thumb|Nahshon Dion Anderson and Audacia Ray founder of Red Umbrella Project.]]
The Red Umbrella Diaries started as a monthly story-telling event at the Happy Ending Lounge on New York's Lower East Side that sought to shed the [[Social stigma|stigma]] around sex work, make it less isolating and show that it can be both [[Exploitation of labour|exploitative]] and empowering" at the same time. The Red Umbrella Diaries was listed by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as "The Best Way to Meet Sex Workers (for Free)",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/new-documentary-aims-to-complicate-the-narrative-about-sex-workers-7885128|title=New Documentary Aims to 'Complicate the Narrative' About Sex Workers|last=Margolin|first=Madison|date=2015-11-10|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/best-of/2010/sports-and-recreation/best-way-to-meet-sex-workers-for-free-6449197|title=Best Way to Meet Sex Workers (for Free): Red Umbrella Diaries {{!}} Best of NYC® 2010: Your Key to the City|website=Village Voice|access-date=2016-12-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170510170711/http://www.villagevoice.com/best-of/2010/sports-and-recreation/best-way-to-meet-sex-workers-for-free-6449197
 |archive-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed as "Best of New York City's Sports and Recreation" in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The monthly event eventually led to a documentary produced by [[Audacia Ray]] and multi-[[Emmy Award]]-Winning director David Kornfield and funded by the Red Umbrella Project. The documentary featured seven sex workers telling their stories about trading money for sex on the streets of New York City. The documentary premiered at the [[Portland Film Festival]], in [[Portland, Oregon]] and at the [[IFC Center|IFC theater]] in New York City, and was a [[Doc NYC]] official selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/96311-talking-sex-work-with-the-red-umbrella-diaries-producer-audacia-ray/#.WFmLxnrauUm|title=Talking Sex Work with The Red Umbrella Diaries Producer Audacia Ray {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|last=Wissot|first=Lauren|newspaper=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memoir writing workshop ==
In 2012 the Red Umbrella Project started offering [[memoir]] writing workshops in New York City which was made possible in part by a grant from Poets &amp; Writers. The peer-facilitated workshops were open to all people with experience in the [[sex trade]] and allows sex workers a safe space to build writing skills, share their stories with others, and get feedback from their peers. Attendees of the workshop have the option of having their work published in the Red Umbrella Project's biannual literary journal ''Prose &amp; Lore'', and to share their work on stage as part of their Page to Stage workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redumbrellaproject.org/memoir/|title=Memoir Writing Workshops {{!}} Red Umbrella Project|website=redumbrellaproject.org|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pw.org/content/melissa_petro_and_red_umbrella_writers_dispel_myths_about_sex_work?cmnt_all=1|title=Melissa Petro and Red Umbrella Writers Dispel Myths About Sex Work {{!}} Poets and Writers|website=www.pw.org|access-date=2016-12-20|date=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One participant was [[Nahshon Dion Anderson|Nahshon Anderson]], who for eight weeks in 2013 workshopped the first chapter of their nonfiction manuscript Shooting Range that won a 2014 [[Bronx Recognizes Its Own Award]] (BRIO), given by the [[Bronx Council on the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/50th/stories/nahshon-d-ratcliff|title=Nahshon D.

{{Nihongo|'''Rokushō'''|緑青}} is a traditional [[Japan|Japanese]] chemical compound used in the [[niiro]] process for artificially inducing [[patina|patination]] in decorative non-ferrous metals, especially several copper alloys, with the results being metals of the [[irogane]] class.  These "colour metals," virtually unknown outside [[Japan]] until the late 19th century, have achieved some popularity in craft circles in other parts of the world since then.

==Usage==
Rokushō is used to treat a number of metals, including raw natural copper, which holds impurities, purified copper, and copper alloy mixes with two to five metals, to produce irogane metals, including: [[shakudō]], an alloy of copper and gold, which becomes black to dark blue-violet; [[shibuichi]], an alloy of fine silver and copper (in a higher percentage than sterling), which turns grey to misty [[Aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]] or other shades of blue to green; [[kuromido]] which becomes dark coppery black.  

Rokushō was generally used to patinate all types of [[mokume-gane]] ("wood grain metal") as well. 

Although other patination agents can be used on these metals, some artisans prefer the rich colors achieved with traditional rokushō in the niiro process.

These metals are becoming increasingly popular in high-end artistic jewelry, especially in bi-metals (a layer of the alloy fused to another metal such as sterling).  Because rokushō has a dramatically different effect on sterling silver than on the alloys typically fused to it in bi-metals, a common technique in art jewelry is to engrave through the alloy layer in a pattern to reveal the silver underneath prior to patination.  This provides a rich contrast in color, highlighting the pattern.

==Formulation==
The formulae for rokushō are not published widely or freely, but passed on in the Japanese craft tradition.  However, some scholars have analysed samples of the material.  

Premixed rokushō can be purchased outside Japan through specialty jewelry suppliers. Additionally, several different formulas have been proposed to replicate the traditional product for those who prefer to make their own:

* In a container made of glass, porcelain, or copper, dissolve 6g copper acetate, 2g calcium carbonate, and 2g sodium hydroxide in 150ml water. After a week, siphon or decant the clear liquid from the top; just before use, add another 2g copper sulfate.{{clarify|reason=1) text says "add another 2g copper sulfate", but this is the first instance of copper sulfate in the recipe, 2) calcium carbonate is not soluble in water|date=June 2015}}
* Dissolve 4g [[copper acetate]], 1g [[copper nitrate]], 1g [[cupric chloride]], and 4g [[copper sulfate]] in 1 liter of distilled water.
* Dissolve 60g copper acetate and 60g copper sulfate in a 2 liter solution of white vinegar diluted 5-12% with water.

Rokusho is not used alone, but mixed with one or more other chemicals.  Further, metal to be processed is cleaned in advance of treatment, using a mild acid bath (oxalic or sulfuric acids are frequently used), scrubbing with [[daikon radish]] or pumice, and / or a surface abrasive, and often treated after patination also.

'''Samuel Mauger''' (pronounced ''Major'') (12 November 1857 – 26 June 1936)&lt;ref name=adb&gt;John Lack, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100442b.htm Mauger, Samuel (1857–1936)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 10, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1986, pp 451–453. Retrieved 5 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was an Australian social reformer, hat manufacturing unionist and a [[Protectionist]] politician.

==Early life==
Mauger was born in [[Geelong]], Victoria, son of immigrants from [[Guernsey]], [[Channel Islands]], Samuel Mauger Senior and Caroline ''née'' Liz&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; who migrated to Australia in the 1850s. Mauger junior was educated at the Geelong National School, but left school early to become an errand boy for a hat maker when his father contracted rheumatic fever.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Mauger later owned the hat manufacturing business. Mauger was a Bible class teacher at St Mark's [[Church of England]] in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]]. He later became the Sunday-school superintendent at St Paul's Congregational Church in North Fitzroy. On 13 May 1880, Mauger married Hanna Rice who he had met at St Mark's; they eventually had four sons and four daughters.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Career==
Mauger held various memberships to various organisations. He was a superintendent in the Fire Brigades' Association of Victoria and four times president of the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Mauger was one of the founders and secretary of the Anti-Sweating League from 1895. Mauger was on the Board enquiry for unemployment in 1899 and involved in the royal commission of Victorian factories and shops law in 1900.

Being a devout Christian of the [[Australian Church]], Mauger was president of the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] and president of the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society.

Mauger attempted to run for politics in various State electorates before becoming a Member of Parliament. He stood for the seat of [[Electoral district of Fitzroy (Victoria)|Fitzroy]] in 1892, [[Electoral district of South Melbourne|South Melbourne]] in 1896 and [[Electoral district of Portland|Portland]] in 1897. In 1899 he was a firefighter in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birch|first=Adrian|title=Samuel Mauger firefighter.|url=http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/69174|publisher=State Library of Victoria|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900, Mauger was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Footscray|Footscray]]. He held the seat of Footscray until May 1901, where he resigned from State politics and ran for Federal politics. Mauger was the first member for [[Division of Melbourne Ports|Melbourne Ports]] in 1901 until his defeat to [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] candidate [[James Mathews (Australian politician)|James Mathews]] in [[Australian federal election, 1906|1906]]. Mauger then soon elected to the new Federal seat of [[Division of Maribyrnong|Maribyrnong]] and became the electorate's first Federal Member of Parliament. He was a Minister without a Portfolio from 1906 until 1907 and then [[Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)|Postmaster-General]] until 1908. Mauger lost his seat of [[Division of Maribyrnong|Maribyrnong]] to [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] candidate [[James Fenton (Australian politician)|James Fenton]] in [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910]].

Mauger ran for the Victorian Senate in 1913 and 1914, but failed to get elected.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/candidates/m.txt Australian Federal Political Candidates (Surname beginning with letter "M")]
&lt;/ref&gt; He was an ardent protectionist and was for some time honorary secretary of the protectionists' association of Victoria; he was for a time president of the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society, and chairman of the Indeterminate Sentences Board; and he presumably found some time for his business as a hatter and mercer. For about 50 years in every movement in Melbourne intended to better the conditions of the mass of the people, Mauger was to be found working incessantly and showing much organizing ability.

==Legacy==
In 1934 Mauger wrote a brochure on ''The Rise and Progress of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Victoria, Australia'',  on page 29 some verses relating to the success of the staff fund illustrate his philosophy of life. Basically it was that if anything is brought forward for the good of humanity, difficulties will vanish if the problem is tackled with sufficient courage.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;
Mauger died in [[Elsternwick, Victoria]] and is buried in the [[Melbourne General Cemetery]]. At his funeral, he was given a fire guard honour.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Mauger was survived by his wife, two sons and four daughters.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Samuel|Last=Mauger|shortlink=0-dict-biogMa-Mo.html#mauger1|accessdate=5 October 2009}}

'''Schizophonia''' is a term coined by [[R. Murray Schafer]] to describe the splitting of an original sound and its electroacoustic reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Originally, that was not possible, as every sound was an original and could only be heard once. Schizophonia is the separation of this native sound and the recording of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Music of the Environment|last = Schafer|first = Murray|publisher = |year = |isbn = 0826416144|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Star vs. the Forces of Evil''''' is an American [[Animated series|animated]] [[television series]] created by Daron Nefcy and developed by Jordana Arkin and [[Dave Wasson]], which airs on [[Disney XD]].&lt;ref name=zap2it/&gt; The first Disney XD series created by a woman, and the third overall for [[Disney Television Animation]] (following ''[[Pepper Ann]]'' and ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''), it follows the adventures of Star Butterfly (voiced by [[Eden Sher]]), the turbulent young heir to the royal throne in the dimension of Mewni, who is sent to Earth so she can complete her education and learn to be a worthy princess, and Marco Diaz ([[Adam McArthur]]), a human teenager who becomes her roommate and best friend, as they live their daily lives, and go on adventures in other dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/disney-tries-something-new-with-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-a-woman-creator-102477.html|title=Disney Tries Something New With ‘Star Vs.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters}}
Star Butterfly is a [[Magical girl|magical princess]] from the dimension of Mewni, and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. As per tradition, she is given the family heirloom wand on her 14th birthday. After she accidentally sets fire to the family castle, her parents King River and Queen Moon Butterfly decide that a safer option is to send her to Earth as a [[foreign exchange student]], so she can continue her magic training there. She befriends Marco Diaz and lives with his family while attending Echo Creek Academy. Going in a series of misadventures using "dimensional scissors" that can open [[Portals in fiction|portals]], Star and Marco must deal with everyday school life while protecting Star's wand from falling into the hands of Ludo, a villain from Mewni who commands a group of monsters. Besides also dealing with her ex-boyfriend Tom, in Season 3, Star goes up against more serious villains like Toffee and Meteora Butterfly while uncovering the mystery behind her relative Eclipsa Butterfly.

==Background and production==
Nefcy said she originally created Star as a girl who wanted to be a [[magical girl]] like ''[[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]]'', and Marco as a boy who was obsessed with ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and karate; they would be enemies instead of friends. In this earlier version, Star did not have any actual magical powers; she instead would approach and solve problems primarily through the force of her determination alone.&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/07/20/creator-daron-nefcy-guides-us-through-tonights-star-studded-episode-of-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|title=Creator Daron Nefcy Guides Us Through Tonight’s Star-Studded Episode of Star Vs. the Forces of Evil|date=July 20, 2015|work=Disney Insider Blog|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nerdist"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rutherford|first=Kristen|title=Interview: Daron Nefcy of Disney’s Star vs. the Forces of Evil|url=http://nerdist.com/interview-daron-nefcy-of-disneys-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|work=[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]|date=March 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nefcy began pitching the show when she was in her third year of college, when Cartoon Network was actively soliciting the creation of pilots for prospective new shows.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt; Nefcy originally placed Star in the fourth grade, reflecting on a time in her own childhood when she held a self-described obsession with the animated series ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]''. However, Nefcy later adjusted the character's age to fourteen during the time she made her series proposition to Disney.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/how-comic-con-helped-crea_b_5989262.html|title=How Comic-Con Helped Create Fans for Disney XD's ''Star vs. The Forces of Evil'' Six Months Before Its First Episode Airs - Jim Hill|author=|date=|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An executive at that time made the suggestion for Star to have actual magical powers. Nefcy worked this concept into the show's current iteration, along with the idea of different dimensions as show locations, the framing device of Star being a foreign exchange student, and the plot aspects relating to Star being a princess and the subsequent consequences of her royal birthright.&lt;ref name="nerdist"/&gt; Nefcy said that the overall concept has evolved over about six years.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt;

In addition to ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', Nefcy has said that she had heavy influence in her youth from the animated Japanese shows ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Unico]]'', the last of which featured a pink unicorn. She also cited shows unrelated to Japanese animation such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',&lt;ref name="nerdist"/&gt; and was influenced by independent comic series such as ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' and ''The Dungeon''.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; With regards to the development of more strong female characters, Nefcy said that she "looked at TV over the years and I have had to go to Japan when I was younger to find the cartoons that had the characters that I wanted to see. It was always a question of 'Well, why isn't that on TV in the U.S.?'"&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"/&gt;

One of the concepts she likes about the show is that it doesn't make high school the most important experience for teenagers. She also likes that Star does her own thing instead of being concerned about fitting in.&lt;ref name="nerdist"/&gt; Nefcy did not want the gimmick about keeping the magic powers a secret from others as typical of magical girl shows, so she had the students already know about it and Marco's parents as well. She also portrays Star as not really a superhero as she does not specifically go after super-villains except when they attack her, and that she doesn't really save people.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt; Nefcy said that the episodes balance comedy and drama: "we really want our characters to feel like teenagers and have them going through the normal emotions that teenagers go through, but in this magical setting."&lt;ref name="bloginterview 20150720"/&gt;

Storyboarding and design are done in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; In describing the process, Nefcy said that the show is storyboard-driven, with each episode mapped out by the storyboard artists. The storyboarders also do the writing, taking a two-page outline and turning it into a full script. A storyboard for 11 minutes would require about 2000 drawings to be done in a six-week period.&lt;ref name="business insider 2015-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/disney-animator-shares-best-and-worst-parts-of-her-job-2015-3|title=Disney animator shares best and worst parts of her job|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Jacquelyn|last=Smith|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After pre-production in the US, the first season animation was done at [[Mercury Filmworks]] in Ottawa, Canada. Mercury had also done ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'' and the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' series.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; For the rest of first season, the animation was done &lt;!-- on [[Toon City Animation]] in Manila, --&gt; in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="business insider 2015-3"/&gt; The second season was animated by Sugarcube and [[Rough Draft Studios]], both located in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet | user=daronnefcy | author=Daron Nefcy | number=679476188838903808 | title=@chuck_kopsho nope, now it's Sugarcube and RDK | date=December 22, 2015 | accessdate=August 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daronnefcy.com/post/135744482230/recently-i-got-the-wonderful-opportunity-to-visit|title=- Recently I got the wonderful opportunity to visit...|first=Daron|last=Nefcy | date=December 22, 2015 | work=daronnefcy.com|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme song was done by Brad Breeck, who also did ''[[Gravity Falls]]''{{'}} opening theme; Nefcy said: "when we were listening to it we didn't know, because we just listened [[Blind experiment|blind]]".

The show was initially scheduled to premiere on [[Disney Channel]] after being greenlighted in March 2013, for a premiere in the Fall of 2014, before being switched over to Disney XD.&lt;ref name="comicbook.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2013/03/disney-channel-greenlights-animated-series-about-magical-princess-from-young-creator-447677/|title=Disney Channel Greenlights Animated Series About Magical Princess From Young Creator|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=March 7, 2013|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 23, 2018, it was announced that the show would be moving to Disney Channel for its fourth season.&lt;ref name="Star4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/disney-channel-renews-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-announces-amphibia-owl-house-1202300438/|title=Disney Channel Launching Toon Series 'Amphibia' &amp; 'The Owl House', Renews 'Star Vs.

==Promotion and release==
The show's title sequence was promoted at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2014]] six months prior to its scheduled broadcast premiere. As a result, the footage was uploaded by fans to YouTube who then started generating fan art and fan fiction.&lt;ref name="huffpost"/&gt; The first episode premiered on Disney Channel in January 2015. The positive reaction on social media prompted Disney XD to order a second season of the series in February 2015, six weeks ahead of its launch of the series on Disney XD in March.&lt;ref name="deadline 20150212"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-renewed-season-two-disney-xd-1201371982/|title=Disney XD Orders Season 2 Of ‘Star Vs.

==Reception==
''Star vs. the Forces of Evil'' has received positive reviews by critics.

Kevin Johnson of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the pilot episode a B+, saying that the show was something children could have a lot of fun with, noting how the show follows current trends in western animation "towards large-eyed characters and quirky visual trends". Johnson stated that ''Star vs. the Forces of Evil'' "excels on wild, silly, and clever set-pieces to bring the laughs and action", but expected that adult viewers won't get much out of it.&lt;ref name="episode 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/star-vs-forces-evil-star-comes-earthparty-pony-214001|title=''Star Vs. The Forces Of Evil'': "Star Comes To Earth/Party With APony"[sic]|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|last=Johnson|first=Kevin|date=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the premiere of ''Star vs. the Forces of Evil'' became the most-watched animated series debut in Disney XD’s history.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/disney-xd-sets-animated-ratings-high-with-premiere-of-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-1201467036/|title=Disney XD Sets Animated Ratings High with Premiere of ‘Star vs. the Forces of Evil’|publisher=''[[Variety.com]]''|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the second season, Disney XD announced it had ordered a fourth season of the show, and that in 2016, ''Star'' and another animated show ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'' had reached over 100 million consumer views combined across its media platforms.&lt;ref name="hr4"/&gt;

In reviewing episodes from the first season, Marcy Cook of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' described the show as a blend of others such as ''[[Invader Zim]]'' and a sanitized ''[[Ren &amp; Stimpy]]'', with great appeal to tween and teen girls as well some laugh out loud moments for adults. She said, "[I]t's really cool to see a girl who is into cuteness and rainbows also kick-ass and enjoy it". Cook was bothered by the short episodes that made the plot seem rushed or underdeveloped. Cook was bugged by Marco's [[retcon]]ned personality from the pilot episode where he was a safety conscious kid to the series where he was a martial arts fight seeker.&lt;ref name="mary sue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|title=You Should Give Star Vs The Forces of Evil a Try|author=|date=|work=themarysue.com|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caitlin Donovan of entertainment website Epicstream listed it among her top 10 animated series of 2015. She found the first few episodes to be "a little rough for me, like the show was trying too hard to be funny and weird", but that the show got better with character development and relationship building, with "a really dramatic, high-tension finale to the first season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epicstream.com/featureslist/Top-10-Animated-Series-of-2015/2|title=Epicstream|author=|date=|work=epicstream.com|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tam''' (or '''Tamas''')  '''Lin''' (also called '''Tamlane''', '''Tamlin''', '''Tambling''', '''Tomlin''', '''Tam Lien''', '''Tam-a-Line''', '''Tam Lyn''', or '''Tam Lane''') is a character in a [[legend]]ary [[ballad]] originating from the Scottish Borders. It is also associated with a [[Reel (dance)|reel]] of the same name, also known as the Glasgow Reel. The story revolves around the rescue of Tam Lin by his true love from the [[Queen of the Fairies]]. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of [[Transformation chase|transformation]] is found throughout Europe in [[Folklore|folktale]]s.&lt;ref name=Child&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/englishscottishp02chil#page/334/mode/2up|editor-last=Child|editor-first=Francis James|title=Tam Lin|work=English and Scottish Popular Ballads|volume=I Part 2|pages=335-358|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin and Company]]|location=Boston|year=1890|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sacred&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch039.htmm|title=Tam Lin|work=The English and Scottish Popular Ballads|publisher=[[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]|year=2011|accessdate=2017-11-19}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has been adapted into numerous stories, songs and films.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Carterhaugh.jpg|thumb|[[Carterhaugh]], near the confluence of the [[Yarrow Water]] and the [[Ettrick Water]]]]
Most variants begin with the warning that Tam Lin collects either a possession or the [[virginity]] of any maiden who passes through the forest of [[Carterhaugh]]. When a young woman, usually called Janet or Margaret, goes to Carterhaugh and plucks a double rose, Tam appears and asks her why she has come without his leave and taken what is his. She states that she owns Carterhaugh because her father has given it to her.&lt;ref name=Fresno&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/C039.html|last=Waltz|first=Robert B.|last2=Engle|first2=David G.|title=Tam Lin|work=Folklore The Traditional Ballad Index: An Annotated Bibliography of the Folk Songs of the English-Speaking World|publisher=[[California State University, Fresno]]|year=2012|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most variants, Janet then goes home and discovers that she is pregnant; some variants pick up the story at this point.  When asked about her condition, she declares that her baby's father is an [[elf]] whom she will not forsake. In some versions, she is informed of a herb that will induce abortion; in all the variants, when she returns to Carterhaugh and picks a plant, either the same roses as on her earlier visit or the herb, Tam reappears and challenges her action.&lt;ref name=Child /&gt;

She asks him whether he was ever human, either after that reappearance or, in some versions, immediately after their first meeting resulted in her pregnancy. He reveals that he was a mortal man, who, falling from his horse, was caught and captured by the Queen of Fairies. Every seven years, the fairies give one of their people as a [[teind]] ([[tithe]]) to [[Hell]] and Tam fears he will become the tithe that night, which is  [[Halloween|Hallowe'en]]. He is to ride as part of a company of elven knights. Janet will recognise him by the white horse upon which he rides and by other signs. He instructs her to rescue him by pulling him down from the white horse - so Janet "catches" him this time - and holds him tightly.  He warns her that the fairies will attempt to make her drop him by [[Transformation chase|turning him]] into all manner of beasts (see [[Proteus]]), but that he will do her no harm. When he is finally turned into a burning coal, she is to throw him into a well, whereupon he will reappear as a naked man, and she must hide him. Janet does as she is asked and wins her knight. The Queen of Fairies is angry but acknowledges defeat.&lt;ref name=Fresno /&gt;&lt;ref name=Child /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fresno /&gt;

In different variations, Tam Lin is reportedly the grandson of the Laird of [[Roxburgh]], the Laird of [[Foulis Castle|Foulis]], the [[Lord Forbes|Earl]] of [[Castle Forbes|Forbes]], or the [[Earl of Moray|Earl of Murray]]. His name also varies between versions (Tam Lin being the most common) as Tom Line, Tomlin, Young Tambling, Tam-a-line and Tamlane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/balladsweirdwond00choprich#page/n115/mode/2up|last=Chope|first=R.P.|title=Tamlane|work=Ballads Weird and Wonderful|pages=53-60|publisher=Ballantyne, Hanson &amp; Co.|year=1911|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JacobsMore /&gt;

==Variants==
The ballad dates to at least as early as 1549 (the publication date of ''[[The Complaynt of Scotland]]'' that mentions "The Tayl of the [[Yogh|Ȝ]]ong Tamlene" ('The Tale of the Young Tamelene') among a long list of medieval romances).&lt;ref name=Child /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Complaynt of Scotland, c. vi., ed. J. A. H. Murray, E.E.T.S., p.68 (excerpted in: {{cite book|last=Ker|first=W. P.|authorlink=William Paton Ker|title=Epic and romance: essays on medieval literature|publisher=Macmillan|year=1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yaFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA389|page=389}})&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several interpretations of the Tam Lin story:

* [[Francis James Child]] collected fourteen variants in ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads''.&lt;ref name=Child /&gt; (Another Child ballad, ''[[Burd Ellen and Young Tamlane]]'', has no connection with this ballad except for the similarity of the heroes' names.)
* [[Joseph Jacobs]] included a variant, "Tamlane", in ''More English Fairy Tales''.&lt;ref name="JacobsMore" /&gt;
* [[John Myers Myers]] tells a variant in Silverlock.
* [[Michael Drayton]]'s narrative poem ''Nimphidia'' (1627) includes the character who goes by the name Tomalin. In the poem he is a vassal and kinsman of [[Oberon]], King of the Fairies.

==Motifs==
Child took the threat to take out Tam Lin's eyes as a common [[Scottish folklore|folklore]] precaution against mortals who could see fairies, in the tales of [[fairy ointment]].  [[Joseph Jacobs]] interpreted it as rather a reversal of the usual practice; the Queen of Faerie would have kept him from seeing the human woman who rescued him.&lt;ref name=JacobsMore/&gt;

In some variants, "[[Hind Etin]]" has verses identical to this for the first meeting between the hero and heroine.&lt;ref name=Child /&gt;{{rp|340}}

[[File:Tam o' Shanter and Souter Johnny at Kirkton Jean's.png|thumb|350px|The opening scene of the poem – Tam and his cronies drinking at Kirkton Jean's]]
"'''Tam o' Shanter'''" is a [[narrative poem]] written by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet [[Robert Burns]] in 1790, while living in [[Dumfries]]. First published in 1791, it is one of Burns' longer poems, and employs a mixture of [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[English language|English]].

The poem describes the habits of Tam, a farmer who often gets drunk with his friends in a [[public house]] in the Scottish town of [[Ayr]], and his thoughtless ways, specifically towards his wife, who is waiting at home for him, angry. At the conclusion of one such late-night revel after a market day, Tam rides home on his horse Meg while a storm is brewing.  On the way he sees the local haunted church lit up, with [[Witches' sabbath|witches and warlocks dancing]] and the [[Devil]] playing the [[bagpipes]].  He is still drunk, still upon his horse, just on the edge of the light,  watching, amazed to see the place bedecked with many gruesome things such as [[Gibbeting|gibbet irons]] and knives that had been used to commit murders and other macabre artifacts.  The witches are dancing as the music intensifies and, upon seeing one particularly wanton witch in a short dress he loses his reason and shouts, 'Weel done, cutty-sark!' ("cutty-sark": short shirt).  Immediately, the lights go out, the music and dancing stops and many of the creatures lunge after Tam, with the witches leading.  Tam spurs Meg to turn and flee and drives the horse on towards the [[River Doon]] as the creatures dare not cross a running stream.  The creatures give chase and the witches come so close to catching Tam and Meg that they pull Meg's tail off just as she reaches the [[Brig o' Doon]].

==Summary==
The poem begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[chapmen|chapman]] billies leave the street,&lt;br&gt;
And {{wikt-lang|sco|drouthy}} neibors, neibors, meet;&lt;br&gt;
As market days are wearing late,&lt;br&gt;
And folk begin to tak the gate,&lt;br&gt;
While we sit bousing at the [[ale|nappy]],&lt;br&gt;
An' getting [[drunk|fou]] and {{wikt-lang|sco|unco}} happy,&lt;br&gt;
We think na on the lang Scots miles,&lt;br&gt;
The [[wetland|mosses]], waters, slaps and stiles,&lt;br&gt;
That lie between us and our [[home|hame]],&lt;br&gt;
Where sits our sulky, sullen dame,&lt;br&gt;
Gathering her brows like gathering storm,&lt;br&gt;
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Burns has located us geographically:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(Auld [[Ayr]], wham ne'er a town surpasses,&lt;br&gt;
For honest men and bonnie lasses).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(a quote that gave [[Ayr United F.C.]] their nickname "the honest men"), Tam sits and drinks with his friends, and the reader is regaled with a dark prophecy of Tam's wife Kate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
She prophesied that late or soon,&lt;br&gt;
Thou wad be found, deep drown'd in [[River Doon|Doon]],&lt;br&gt;
Or catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk,&lt;br&gt;
By [[Alloway|Alloway's]] auld, haunted [[Church (building)|kirk]].&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tam's wife, Kate, is portrayed as an authority to be feared. Then:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ah, gentle dames! it gars me [[Tears#Types|greet]],&lt;br&gt;
To think how mony counsels sweet,&lt;br&gt;
How mony lengthen'd, sage advices,&lt;br&gt;
The husband frae the wife despises!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tam continues to drink and even flirts with the landlady of the [[pub]]. Eventually he mounts up and rides off on his grey mare Meg, for his long, dark, lonely ride home. Burns emphasises the spooky character of the [[Ayrshire]] countryside Tam has to ride through—but of course it is much easier as he is drunk:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inspiring bold [[John Barleycorn]]!&lt;br&gt;
What dangers thou canst make us scorn!&lt;br&gt;
Wi' tippenny, we fear nae evil;&lt;br&gt;
Wi' [[whisky|usquabae]], we'll face the devil!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:TamOShanterWoodcut.png|thumb|right|250px|Contemporary woodcut showing Tam wearing his bonnet and sitting astride his horse Meg]]
With the scene set, suddenly: "wow! Tam saw an unco sight!"

The sight he sees is [[Alloway Kirk]], ablaze with light, where a [[Witches' Sabbath|weird hallucinatory dance]] involving [[witchcraft|witches]] and [[warlock]]s, open coffins, and even the [[Devil]] himself is in full swing. The scene is bedecked in morbidly enthusiastic [[Gothic novel|gothic]] detail. Tam manages to watch silently until, the dancing witches having cast off most of their clothes, he is beguiled by one particularly comely female witch, Nannie, whose shirt ([[Cutty-sark (witch)|cutty-sark]]) is too small for her. He cannot help shouting out in passion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Weel done, Cutty-sark!

And in an instant all was dark:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Devil decides to chase Tam, but the evident pride in the ability of his horse is justified as she is able to help him to "win the key-stone o' the brig". (The Devil, witches and warlocks cannot cross running water.)

They only just make it though, as Nannie, first among the "hellish legion" chasing, grabs the horse's tail, which comes off.
In fine, tongue-in-cheek moralistic mode, the poem concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read,&lt;br&gt;
Ilk man and mother's son, take heed:&lt;br&gt;
Whene'er to Drink you are inclin'd,&lt;br&gt;
Or Cutty-[[shirt|sarks]] rin in your mind,&lt;br&gt;
Think ye may buy the joys o'er dear;&lt;br&gt;
Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Alloway Kirk.jpg|thumb|300px|Alloway Kirk, from Grose's ''Antiquities Of Scotland'', 1797]]
The poem first appeared in the ''Edinburgh Herald'' and the ''Edinburgh Magazine'' in March 1791,{{sfnp|Birch|2009|p=975|ps=none}} a month before it appeared in the second volume of [[Francis Grose]]'s ''Antiquities of Scotland'', for which it was written. [[Robert Riddell]] introduced Burns to Grose, and according to Gilbert Burns, the poet asked the antiquarian to include a drawing of Alloway Kirk when he came to Ayrshire; Grose agreed, as long as Burns gave him something to print alongside it.

Burns wrote to Grose in June 1790, giving him three witch stories associated with [[Alloway Kirk]], two of which he said were "authentic", the third, "though equally true, being not so well identified as the two former with regard to the scene". The second of the stories was, in fact, Tam o' Shanter. This is Burns' prose sketch of it to Grose:
{{quote|On a market-day, in the town of Ayr, a farmer from [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]], and consequently whose way lay by the very gate of Alloway kirk-yard, in order to cross the [[River Doon]], at the [[Brig o' Doon|old bridge]], which is almost two or three hundred yards farther on than the said old gate, had been detained by his business till by the time he reached Alloway it was the wizard hour, between night and morning.}}
{{quote|
Though he was terrified with a blaze streaming from the kirk, yet as it is a well known fact, that to turn back on these occasions is running by far the greatest risk of mischief, he prudently advanced on his road. When he had reached the gate of the kirk-yard, he was surprised and entertained, thorough the ribs and arches of an old gothic window which still faces the highway, to see a dance of witches merrily footing it round their old sooty black-guard master, who was keeping them all alive with the power of his bagpipe. The farmer stopping his horse to observe them a little, could plainly desern the faces of many old women of his acquaintance and neighbourhood. How the gentleman was dressed, tradition does not say; but the ladies were all in their smocks; and one of them happening unluckily to have a smock which was considerably too short to answer all the purpose of that piece of dress, our farmer was so tickled that he involuntarily burst out, with a loud laugh, 'Weel luppen, Maggy wi' the short sark!' and recollecting himself, instantly spurred his horse to the top of his speed. I need not mention the universally known fact, that no diabolical power can pursue you beyond the middle of a running stream. Lucky it was for the poor farmer that the river Doon was so near, for notwithstanding the speed of his horse, which was a good one, against he reached the middle of the arch of the bridge and consequently the middle of the stream, the pursuing, vengeful hags were so close at his heels, that one of them actually sprung to seize him: but it was too late; nothing was on her side of the stream but the horse's tail, which immediately gave way to her infernal grip, as if blasted by a stroke of lightning; but the farmer was beyond her reach. However, the unsightly, tailless condition of the vigorous steed was to the last hours of the noble creature's life, an awful warning to the Carrick farmers, not to stay too late in Ayr markets.}}

Thus began what was to be one of Burns' most sustained poetic efforts.

The story that the poem was written in a day was perpetrated by [[John Gibson Lockhart]], aided by [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]]. Its subtle nuances of tempo, pace and tone suggest that it had been given, as Burns told Mrs Dunlop on 11 April 1791, "a finishing polish that I despair of ever excelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lindsay |first=Maurice |title=The Burns Encyclopedia |contribution=Tam O'Shanter |year=1996 |edition=3rd |publisher=Robert Hale |url=http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/TamOShanter.23.shtml |isbn=978-0-7090-5719-2 |accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns based the character of Tam O'Shanter on Douglas Graham (1739–1811),{{sfnp|Irwin|2011|p=161|ps=none}} a friend who lived at Shanter Farm, about half a mile (0.8 km) inland from the fishing village of [[Maidens]] in South Ayrshire, near [[Kirkoswald, South Ayrshire|Kirkoswald]].{{sfnp|Watters|Watters|2003|p=128|ps=none}}

==Revision==
An early version of the poem includes four lines that were deleted at the request of one of Burns' friends.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Robert Burns to Alexander Fraser Tytler, Esq., April 1791, ''The Complete Works of Robert Burns (Self-Interpreting),'' Volume IV, Gebbie &amp; Co., Philadelphia (1886), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem originally contained the lines:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Three lawyers' tongues, turn'd inside out,
Wi' lies seam'd like a beggar's clout;
Three priests' hearts, rotten black as muck,
Lay stinking, vile in every neuk.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:TamOShanterTobacco.png|thumb|right|200px|Early 20th-century tobacco advert using an image of Tam]]
A handwritten note on the manuscript{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} written by Judge [[Alexander Fraser Tytler]], reads "Burns left out these four lines at my desire, as being incongruous with the other circumstances of pure horror." Burns had the lines removed from later editions; it was not unknown for Burns to make changes at the request of friends.

==Cultural depictions==
The [[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanter cap]] is named after the poem.

[[Lady Ada Lovelace]] named her beloved if "very wild and ... quite vicious" stallion Tom O'Shanter.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelace as quoted in ''The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage'' by Sydney Padua, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Métivier]] published ''Tam au Sabbat'', a [[Guernésiais]] version of Burns' poem, in ''La Gazette de Guernesey'' in 1855. This version was included in his collection ''Fantaisies guernesiaises'' in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;''La Grève de Lecq'', Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, 1988 {{ISBN|2-905385-13-8}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, the town of [[Barre (town), Vermont|Barre, Vermont]] erected [[Robert Burns Memorial (Barre)|a memorial to Burns]] in local granite, including a panel depicting a scene from the poem. 

In 1915, the American composer [[George Whitefield Chadwick]] completed a symphonic poem inspired by the poem.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Whitefield Chadwick]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}

In 1955, British composer [[Malcolm Arnold]]'s [[Tam O'Shanter Overture|Overture Op. 51a]] was named "Tam o' Shanter" after Burns' poem.

In the 1990s, Scottish figurative painter [[Alexander Goudie]] worked at a cycle of 54 large format paintings dedicated to Robert Burns' poem, currently displayed at Rozelle House Galleries, near Burns' home at [[Alloway]], [[Ayrshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goudie.co.uk/|title=The Goudie Collection @ Rozelle|work=goudie.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tam O' Shanter Urban Cottage on [[Bidston Hill]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], [[Merseyside]] was named after the poem in 1837 after being built beyond a stream which was said to repel [[witches]]. It attracts both Robert Burns fans and local witches and [[Wicca]] historians.

The [[Tam O'Shanter Inn]] in [[Glendale, California]] was named after the Robert Burns poem and was established in 1922 by the [[Van de Kamp Bakery Building|Van de Kamp bakery family]]. As of 2017, it is [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles']] oldest restaurant operated by the same family in the same location. It was [[Walt Disney]]'s favorite restaurant.

"[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]" by [[Iron Maiden]] is loosely based on the poem.

'''''That Was the Week That Was''''', informally '''''TWTWTW''''' or '''''TW3''''', was a [[satirical]] [[television]] comedy programme on [[BBC Television]] in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced and directed by [[Ned Sherrin]] and presented by [[David Frost]]. An American version by the same name aired on [[NBC]] from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.

The programme is considered a significant element of the [[satire boom]] in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through [[Parody|lampooning]] the [[The Establishment|establishment]] and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged [[Profumo affair]] and [[John Profumo]], the politician at the centre of the affair became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.

==Cast and writers==
Cast members included cartoonist [[Timothy Birdsall]], political commentator [[Bernard Levin]], and actors [[Lance Percival]], who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, [[Kenneth Cope]], [[Roy Kinnear]], [[Willie Rushton]], [[Al Mancini]], [[Robert Lang (actor)|Robert Lang]],  [[David Kernan]] and [[Millicent Martin]]. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song&amp;nbsp;– "That Was The Week That Was"&amp;nbsp;– sung by Martin to [[Ron Grainer]]'s [[theme tune]] and enumerating topics in the news. [[Frankie Howerd]] also guested with stand-up comedy.

Script-writers included [[John Albery]], [[John Antrobus]], [[John Betjeman]], [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]], [[Peter Cook]], [[Roald Dahl]], [[Richard Ingrams]], Lyndon Irving, [[Gerald Kaufman]], [[Frank Muir]], [[David Nobbs]], [[Denis Norden]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Eric Sykes]], [[Kenneth Tynan]], and [[Keith Waterhouse]].{{sfn|McCann|2006|page=156}}

==Programme==
[[File:RT1963.jpg|thumb|1963 ''[[Radio Times]]'' cover promotes the return of the programme for a second series.]]
The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It's over, let it go ...") sung by [[Millicent Martin]], referring to news of the week just gone. [[Lance Percival]] sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Home Secretary]] [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor|Henry Brooke]] were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Some other targets included the [[British Monarchy|monarchy]], the [[British Empire]], [[nuclear deterrence]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]] and [[propaganda]], [[capital punishment]],{{sfn|Hegarty|2016|page=55}} sexual and social hypocrisy, the [[class system]], and the [[BBC]] itself.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Well-remembered sketches include a controversial 'consumers' guide to religion', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a ''[[Which?]]'' magazine report, which received controversy from religious figures at the time.&lt;ref name="Briggs1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Asa|title=The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: Competition|url={{Google books|0pRGjVGtUvwC|plainurl=y}}|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-215964-9|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was not party political but did not treat all issues with what the producers considered to be a false level of impartiality and balance; one example of this is the issue of [[racism]] and "the evils of [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]",{{sfn|Hegarty|2016|page=55}} following the view of BBC Director-General Sir [[Hugh Greene]] that the BBC should not be bound by its charter to be impartial on issues of racism, which Greene and the producers of ''TW3'' viewed as "quite simply wrong".&lt;ref name="StrinatiWagg2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strinati|first1=Dominic|last2=Wagg|first2=Stephen|title=Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain|url={{Google books|T0lPwK1Q4koC|plainurl=y}}|date=24 February 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-92368-7|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1963 murder of 35-year-old white postal worker [[William Lewis Moore]] in Alabama, who was on a protest march against segregation in the [[American South]], ''TW3''{{'s}} Millicent Martin dressed as [[Uncle Sam]] sang a parody of "I Wanna Go Back to Mississippi" ("... where the Mississippi mud/kinda mingles with the blood/of the [[nigger]]s who are hanging from the branches of the tree ...") accompanied by [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] singers in [[blackface]] ("... we hate all the [[List of ethnic slurs#D|darkies]] and the [[Catholics]] and the [[Jews]] / Where we welcome any man / Who is strong and white and belongs to the [[Ku Klux Klan]]"), thus parodying ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]'', which was then being shown on the [[BBC]] despite accusations of racism over its use of blackface.&lt;ref name="StrinatiWagg2004" /&gt;{{sfn|Hegarty|2016|page=65}}

On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to [[John Kendrew]] and [[Max Perutz]], and to [[Francis Crick]], [[James Watson|James D. Watson]], and [[Maurice Wilkins]] was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who'd have thought he'd ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn't it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.

''TW3'' was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of ''[[The Third Man (TV series)|The Third Man]]'' television series after the end of ''TW3''. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of ''The Third Man'', until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of Greene.&lt;!-- Not knighted until 1964. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter ''That Was Satire That Was'', London: Victor Gollancz, 2000, pp. 270-71&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he's doing a grand job".&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Jeffries, "This'll kill you", ''The Guardian'', 16 January 1999, p. B5.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That ''was'' the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That ''was'' ''That Was The Week That Was''...that was."

===Kennedy tribute===
For the edition on Saturday, 23 November 1963, the day after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy]], ''TW3'' produced a shortened 20-minute programme with no satire, reflecting on the loss, including a contribution from [[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Sybil Thorndike]] and the tribute song "[[In the Summer of His Years (song)|In the Summer of His Years]]" sung by Martin with lyrics by [[Herbert Kretzmer]]. This edition was screened on [[NBC]] in the US the following day, and the soundtrack was released by [[Decca Records]]. A clip, featuring [[Roy Kinnear]], was shown in the [[David L. Wolper]] documentary film ''[[Four Days in November]]'' and on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] 2009 documentary ''JFK: 3 Shots that Changed America''. In addition to the Millicent Martin studio recording of "In the Summer of His Years" issued in the US by [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount]], other versions were recorded and released by [[Connie Francis]] ([[MGM Records|MGM]]), [[Mahalia Jackson]] ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]]), [[Kate Smith]] ([[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]]), [[Sarah Vaughan]] ([[Vernon Records|Vernon]]) and [[The Chad Mitchell Trio]] ([[Mercury Records|Mercury]]); the Francis recording became a Top 40 hit on the [[Cash Box]] pop singles chart in January 1964. BBC presenter [[Richard Dimbleby]], who broadcast the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|president's funeral]] from Washington, said the regular programme was scrapped when news of the assassination was received and that the programme was a good expression of the sorrow felt in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A British Program Honoring Kennedy Shown Over NBC|date=25 November 1963|newspaper=The New York Times|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
After two successful series in 1962 and 1963, the [[Television program|programme]] did not return in 1964. The reason given by the BBC was that 1964 was an election year and political material could compromise the corporation's impartiality.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Reception==
[[United Kingdom Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] was initially supportive, chastising the [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Reginald Bevins]] for threatening to "do something about it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2516511.stm | work=BBC News | title=BBC marks TW3 anniversary | date=26 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BBC received many complaints from organisations and establishment figures. [[Lord Aldington]], vice-chairman of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], wrote to the BBC's director-general [[Hugh Carleton Greene]] that Frost had a "hatred" of the Prime Minister, which "he finds impossible to control". The programme also attracted complaints from the [[Boy Scout Association]], upset by an item questioning the [[sexual orientation|sexuality]] of its founder [[Lord Baden-Powell]], and the government of Cyprus, which claimed that a joke about [[Archbishop Makarios]], the country's ruler, was a "gross violation of internationally accepted ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1554790/Tories-helped-take-TW3-off-the-air.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Chris | last=Hastings | title=Tories helped take TW3 off the air | date=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have identified ''TW3'' as breaking ground in comedy and broadcasting. Graham McCann said  it challenged the "convention that television should not acknowledge that it is television; the show made no attempt to hide its cameras, allowed the microphone boom to intrude and often revealed other nuts and bolts of studio technology."{{sfn|McCann|2006|pages=313–314}} In the 1960s, this was unusual and gave the programme an exciting, modern feel.&lt;ref name="ImageDissectors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/77 |title=TV Trends: Conspicuous Cameras |publisher=Image Dissectors |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''TW3'' also flouted conventions by adopting "a relaxed attitude to its running time: loosely structured and open-ended, it seemed to last just as long as it wanted and needed to last, even if that meant going beyond the advertised time for the ending [...] the real controversy of course, was caused by the content."{{sfn|McCann|2006|pages=313–314}}

Its subject matter has also been praised. McCann says: "''TW3''...did its research, thought its arguments through and seemed unafraid of anything or anyone.... Every hypocrisy was highlighted and each contradiction was held up for sardonic inspection. No target was deemed out of bounds: royalty was reviewed by republicans; rival religions were subjected to no-nonsense 'consumer reports'; pompous priests were symbolically defrocked; corrupt businessmen, closet bigots and chronic plagiarists were exposed; and topical ideologies were treated to swingeing critiques."{{sfn|McCann|2006}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Legacy==
''TW3'' was live and recordings were not made of all editions, although only two editions are missing; the first pilot, and the 13 April 1963 edition. A compilation of surviving material was shown on [[BBC Four]] to celebrate the 40th anniversary. In a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000, voted by industry professionals, ''That Was The Week That Was'' placed 29th.

Sherrin attempted to revive the formula with ''[[Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life]]'' but was less successful.

==Alternative versions==
=== US versions ===
An American version was on NBC, initially as a [[pilot episode]] on 10 November 1963, then as a series from 10 January 1964 to May 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ORIGINATOR HERE TO ASSIST 'T.W. 3' / David Frost Will Appear on New Satirical Revue|work=[[The New York Times]], p.49|author=[[Paul Gardner (journalist)|Gardner, Paul]]|date=January 3, 1964|accessdate=November 19, 2018| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/01/03/118649788.html?pageNumber=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot featured [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]], guests [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], and supporting performers including [[Gene Hackman]]. The recurring cast included Frost, Morgan, [[Buck Henry]] and [[Alan Alda]], with [[Nancy Ames]] singing the opening song and Stanley Grover and Ames performing solos and duets; regular contributors included [[Gloria Steinem]], [[William F. Brown (writer)|William F. Brown]], [[Tom Lehrer]] and [[Calvin Trillin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/01/20/97160719.html?pageNumber=87 "Morse for 'T.W. 3'" (''The New York Times'', January 20, 1964, p.87).] Retrieved October 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[announcer]] was [[Jerry Damon]].  Also a guest was [[Woody Allen]], performing [[stand-up comedy]]; the guest star on the final broadcast was [[Steve Allen]]. A running gag was a mock feud with [[Jack Paar]], whose own programme followed ''TW3'' on the NBC Friday schedule; Paar repeatedly referred to ''TW3'' as "Henry Morgan's Amateur Hour".

The American version is largely a lost program, although the pilot survives and was donated to the [[Library of Congress]] by a collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nitrateville.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=15906&amp;p=117338#p117276 |title=• View topic - The Last Sundown for Cinesation: 2013 Fest Report |publisher=Nitrateville.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur audio recordings of most episodes also survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound/stories/991119.stories.html |title=Lost and Found Sound: The Stories |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the series' cancellation, Lehrer recorded a collection of his songs used on the show, ''[[That Was The Year That Was]]'', released by [[Reprise Records]] in September 1965.

In the American version, an episode showed a smiling [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] contemplating an easy 1964 campaign against the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[nominee]], [[U.S. Senator]] [[Barry M. Goldwater]] of [[Arizona]]. The satirists sang that Goldwater could not win because he "does not know the dance of the liberal Republicans", then a substantial component of the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]], many of whose members had supported [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] for the Republican nomination.

On April 21, 1985 in the United States, the ABC network aired ''That Was The Week That Was'' as a special, hosted by David Frost (also serving as an executive producer) and [[Anne Bancroft]], and featuring future ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast members [[Jan Hooks]] and [[A. Whitney Brown]] and puppetry from ''[[Spitting Image]]''.&lt;ref name="hubcity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=that+was+the+week+that+was&amp;p=1&amp;item=T:05198|title='THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS (TV)'|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristy Glass and [[Kevin Ruf]] starred in a remake of ''TW3'' for ABC's ''Primetime Live'' in the fall of 2004. Soon after its premiere, Shelley Ross, the executive producer, was fired and ''TW3'' ended with her dismissal.

=== International versions ===
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--only one citation in section--&gt;
A Canadian show, ''[[This Hour Has Seven Days]]'', aired from 1964 to 1966 on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. Although partially inspired by ''That Was The Week That Was'', the Canadian show mixed satirical aspects with more serious journalism. It proved controversial and was cancelled after two series amid allegations of political interference. ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'', created by [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] comic [[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]], has been running since 1992 although the two are not related.

An Australian show, ''[[The Mavis Bramston Show]]'', aired from 1964 to 1968 on the [[Seven Network]]. It grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue—most notably the popular revues staged at [[Sydney]]'s [[Phillip Street Theatre]] in the 1950s and 1960s—but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially ''TW3'' and ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''.

The [[New Zealand]] show ''[[A Week Of It]]'' ran from 1977 to 1979, hosted by Ken Ellis, and featuring comedians [[David McPhail]], [[Peter Rowley]] and Chris McVeigh and comedian/musicians [[Jon Gadsby]] and [[Annie Whittle]]. The series lampooned news and politics and featured songs, usually by McPhail and Gadsby, who continued with their own show, ''McPhail and Gadsby'' in similar vein.

A [[Netherlands|Dutch]] version, ''Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer'', aired from November 1963 to 1966. It became controversial after the fourth edition, which included a parody of the [[Lord's Prayer]] ("Give us this day our daily television"). Angry viewers directed their protests especially against the most popular cast member: [[Mies Bouwman]]. After receiving several threats to her life she decided to quit the show. The show was praised as well: in 1966 it received the Gouden Televizier-ring, a prestigious audience award—though it turned out afterward that the election was rigged.&lt;ref name="toevallig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/andere-tijden/afleveringen/2001-2002/Zo-is-het-toevallig-ook-nog-s-een-keer.html|title='Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer'|last=Nijland|first=Yfke|publisher=Geschiedenis 24|language=Dutch|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Indian version titled ''The Week That Wasn't'' was launched and hosted by [[Cyrus Broacha]].

'''''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster''''' is a [[satire|satirical]]&lt;!-- Please do not change this! --&gt; book written by [[Bobby Henderson (activist)|Bobby Henderson]] that embodies the main beliefs of the [[religion]]&lt;!-- Please do not change this! --&gt; of the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster|Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]] or Pastafarianism.&lt;ref name="U Pitts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) was created by Bobby Henderson in an open letter to the Kansas State Board of Education in which he parodied the concept of [[intelligent design]]. After Henderson posted the letter on his website, it became an internet phenomenon and was featured in many large newspapers, which caught the attention of book publishers. Released in March 2006 by [[Villard Books]], ''The Gospel'' elaborates on Pastafarian beliefs established in the open letter.

''The Gospel'' includes a [[creation myth]], set of eight "I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts", and guide to [[evangelism|evangelizing]], and discusses history and lifestyle from a Pastafarian perspective. Henderson uses satire to show flaws with [[creationism]] and prove the Flying Spaghetti Monster, offering an alternative to the [[intelligent design movement]] in the process. The book, which has sold more than 100,000 copies,&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt; was generally well received.

==Background==
{{Main|Flying Spaghetti Monster}}
In 2005, Bobby Henderson, then a 24-year-old [[Oregon State University]] physics graduate, parodied the concept of intelligent design by professing belief in a Flying Spaghetti Monster in an [[open letter]] to the [[Kansas State Board of Education]].&lt;ref name="wpost"&gt;{{cite news | title=Verbatim: Noodle This, Kansas | date=August 28, 2005 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/27/AR2005082700019.html?nav=most_emailed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dallas Morning News"&gt;{{cite news | first=Clarence | last=Page | title=Keeping ID out of science classes| publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] | date=November 15, 2005 | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/balance/stories/111505dnedicyberpage.b4d5bd9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent the letter prior to the [[Kansas evolution hearings]] as a satirical protest against the teaching of [[intelligent design]] in biology classes.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/arts/design/29mons.html?ex=1178251200 |title=But Is There Intelligent Spaghetti Out There? |accessdate=2007-02-05 |format= |work=[[The New York Times]] Arts article | first=Sarah | last=Boxer | date=2005-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, he noted,

In May, having received no reply from the Kansas State Board of Education, Henderson posted the letter on his website.&lt;ref name="openletterabout"&gt;{{cite web | title=Discussion of the Open Letter | publisher=Henderson, Bobby | url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/discussion/ | accessdate=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Pastafarianism became an internet phenomenon.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-03-26-spaghetti-monster_x.htm |title="Spaghetti Monster" is noodling around with faith |accessdate=2007-02-05 |work=[[USA Today]] Science &amp; Space article | first1=Dan | last1=Vergano | date=2006-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | title = In the beginning there was the Flying Spaghetti Monster | date=September 11, 2005 | publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=2009-12-19| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1498162/In-the-beginning-there-was-the-Flying-Spaghetti-Monster.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As public awareness grew, the mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon.

According to Henderson, newspaper articles attracted the attention of book publishers; at one point, six publishers were interested in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="Comment" /&gt; In November 2005, Henderson received an $80,000 advance from [[Villard (imprint)|Villard]] to write ''The Gospel of The Flying Spaghetti Monster''.&lt;ref name="newyorkmag"&gt;{{cite news | first=Eric | last=Wolff | title=The Case For Intelligent Design: Spaghetti as the Creator | publisher=[[New York Magazine]] | date=November 16, 2005 | url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15011/|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson said that he planned to use the proceeds to build a pirate ship, with which he would spread the Pastafarian religion.&lt;ref name = "Wired"&gt;{{cite news | first=Katleen | last=Craig | title=Passion of the Spaghetti Monster | date=December 22, 2005 | publisher=Wired News | url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2005/12/69905|accessdate=29 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released on March 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812976564|title=The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|year=2009|work=[[Random House]]|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{Rquote|right|The book is necessary so that people see how much hard evidence supports the existence of the FSM. You can make a pretty strong argument for His existence. Especially if you use the same sort of reasoning the ID people do: specious reasoning and circular logic.|Bobby Henderson, explaining why he wrote ''The Gospel''&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;}}
''The Gospel'' presents the tenets of Pastafarianism—often satires of [[creationism]]—elaborating on the "beliefs" established in the open letter.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Austin" /&gt; It includes a creation-myth, a "propaganda" guide for evangelizing, some pseudo-scientific "proofs", and several pasta puns.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Along with crude drawings and altered stock photography, Henderson employs irony to present perceived flaws with evolution and discusses history and lifestyle from a Pastafarian perspective.&lt;ref name = "Austin"/&gt; The book also provides a Pastafarian "Guide to the Holidays."&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Henderson discusses the original Pastafarian "belief" that the decline in the number of pirates, who are revered by Pastafarians, has directly led to a rise in global temperature. He provides further "evidence" of this relationship with the observation "that many people dress up as pirates for Halloween, and the months following October 31 are generally cooler than those that precede it."&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt; This and other scientific claims made by Henderson are intended to be disputed.&lt;ref name="GOLEM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Horn|first=Gavin|author2=Lucas Johnston|year=2007|title=Evolutionary Controversy and a Side of Pasta: The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Subversive Function of Religious Parody|journal=GOLEM: Journal of Religion and Monsters|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.golemjournal.org/van%20horn%20spaghetti%20monsters.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116195232/http://golemjournal.org/van%20horn%20spaghetti%20monsters.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-11-16|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that declining numbers of pirates have resulted in rising temperatures is meant to demonstrate that [[correlation does not imply causation]].&lt;ref name="Volcano"&gt;{{cite book|last=Savino|first=John |author2=Marie D.

The book urges readers to try Pastafarianism for 30 days, saying, "If you don't like us, your old religion will most likely take you back."&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson states on his website that more than 100,000 copies of the book have been sold.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;&lt;!-- scroll three fifths down the page and look on the right hand side  --&gt;

==Pastafarian creation myth==
''The Gospel'' begins with the creation of the universe by an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt; On the first day, the Flying Spaghetti Monster separated the water from the heavens; on the second, because He could not tread water for long and had grown tired of flying, He created the land—complemented by a beer volcano.&lt;ref name="GOLEM" /&gt; Satisfied, the Flying Spaghetti Monster overindulged in beer from the beer volcano and woke up hungover.&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Between drunken nights and clumsy afternoons, the Flying Spaghetti Monster produced seas and land (for a second time, accidentally, because he forgot that he created it the day before) along with Heaven and a "midgit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/|title=Open Letter To Kansas School Board «  Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|website=www.venganza.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he named Man.&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Man and an equally short woman lived happily in the Olive Garden of Eden for some time until the Flying Spaghetti Monster caused a global flood in a cooking accident.&lt;ref name="GOLEM" /&gt;

This creation, "claimed" by Pastafarians to be only 5,000 years ago, would be considered laughable by many scientists.&lt;ref name="GOLEM" /&gt; To this, Henderson satirically retorts that the Flying Spaghetti Monster presented all evidence to the contrary in order to test Pastafarians' faith.&lt;ref name="Flying Spaghetti Monster p.37"&gt;The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to parodying certain [[Biblical inerrancy|biblical literalists]], Henderson uses this unorthodox method to lampoon intelligent design proponents,&lt;ref name="GOLEM" /&gt; whom he believes first "define [their] conclusion and then gather evidence to support it".&lt;ref name="Flying Spaghetti Monster p.37"/&gt;

==Captain Mosey and the Eight "I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts"==
[[File:MEVyMosey.png|thumb|200px|FSM giving the "I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts" tablets to Captain Mosey]]
The book contains the Eight "I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts", adherence to which enables Pastafarians to ascend to heaven, which includes a stripper factory and beer volcano.&lt;ref name = "Eight I'd Really"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grus|first=Doel|title=Your Religion Is False|publisher=Brightwalton LLC|year=2009|pages=74|chapter=Pastafarianism is False|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61SmVkVxlrQC&amp;pg=PT215&amp;lpg=PT215&amp;dq=gospel+of+the+flying+spaghetti+monster+main+religious+text#v=onepage&amp;q=flying%20spaghetti%20monster&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-01-24 | isbn=978-0-9824818-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Gospel'', Mosey the Pirate captain received ten stone tablets as advice from the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

[[File:Chestres-FR-08-monument tchécoslovaque-05.jpg|thumb|180px]]
'''"Truth prevails"''' ({{lang-cs|Pravda vítězí}}, {{lang-sk|Pravda víťazí}}, {{lang-la|Veritas vincit}}) is the [[national motto]] of the [[Czech Republic]]. The motto appears on the [[standard of the President of the Czech Republic]], which the [[Czech Constitution]] designates a national symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ez00000_.html|title=Czech Republic – Constitution|date=16 Dec 1992|publisher =Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=6 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in 1993, the motto was the motto of [[Czechoslovakia]] and appeared on the standard of the [[President of Czechoslovakia]] as well.

The motto is believed to be derived from [[Jan Hus]]' phrase "Seek the truth, hear the truth, learn the truth, love the truth, speak the truth, hold the truth and defend the truth until death".&lt;ref name="Truth"&gt;{{cite book | last = Holý| first =Ladislav| title =The little Czech and the Great Czech Nation: national identity and the post-communist transformation of society| publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1996| page = 40| isbn = 0-521-55469-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase thus appears along the base of the [[Jan Hus Memorial]] in [[Prague]]. [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], the first President of Czechoslovakia, adopted the shortened phrase "truth prevails" as a presidential motto shortly after independence from [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918. The sentiment was echoed over 75 years later in [[Václav Havel]]'s notion of "life in truth" and in his famous statement "Truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred" ({{lang-cs|Pravda a láska musí zvítězit nad lží a nenávistí}}).&lt;ref name="Truth"/&gt; The Latin version "Veritas vincit" was in use on the presidential banner from 1990 to 1992 as a linguistically neutral compromise reached between the Czech and Slovak political representation.

The concept of truth has a long tradition in Czech political thought. Jan Hus and [[John Amos Comenius]] connected the truth with theological aspects, while in Masaryk's ethical concepts truth was seen as the opposite of lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordon| first =Dane R.| title =Philosophy in post-communist Europe| publisher =Rodopi|year = 1998| page = 57| isbn = 90-420-0358-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hus' credo traditionally had been seen as testifying the moral and spiritual, rather than physical and military strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abrams| first =Bradley F.| title =The struggle for the soul of the nation: Czech culture and the rise of communism| publisher =Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2005| page = 100| isbn = 0-7425-3024-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter 77]] movement had the motto "Truth prevails for those who live in truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Willard| first =Dallas| title =A Place for Truth: Leading Thinkers Explore Life's Hardest Questions| publisher =InterVarsity Press|year = 2010| page = 39| isbn = 0-8308-3845-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44577">The '''US Open Series''' is the name given by the [[United States Tennis Association]] (USTA) for a series of North American professional [[tennis]] tournaments leading up to and including the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. It is also often referred to as the '''U.S. or North American hard court season'''. [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] currently sponsors the series, under a deal in place from 2012 to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emiratesusopenseries.com/USTA_and_Emirates_Airline_launch_landmark_partnership_for_US_Open_and_US_Open_Series/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402164426/http://www.emiratesusopenseries.com/USTA_and_Emirates_Airline_launch_landmark_partnership_for_US_Open_and_US_Open_Series/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was initially organized in 2004 as a way to focus more attention on American tennis tournaments by getting more of them on domestic [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clarke|first=Liz|title=USTA Moves to Promote Tennis; U.S. Open Series Aims To Please Players, Fans|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/620944291.html?dids=620944291:620944291&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+20%2C+2004&amp;author=Liz+Clarke&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=USTA+Moves+to+Promote+Tennis%3B+U.S.+Open+Series+Aims+To+Please+Players%2C+Fans|accessdate=July 2, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 2004, most summer North American tournaments were not on television, the exceptions being the prominent [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] events in [[Canada Masters|Canada]] and [[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]].

Under the US Open's broadcast rights, [[ESPN]] holds rights to all US Open Series events since 2015. The eight non-Masters tournaments receive about 50 hours of television combined &amp;ndash; about two hours on each day of their final weekends, chiefly on [[ESPN2]]. The dual-gender Washington D.C. [[Citi Open]] (the only ATP 500-level tournament in North America), which had been a part of the series since its 2004 founding, withdrew from the series after the 2015 edition due to frustrations over the lack of linear television coverage it received under ESPN (with the majority of the tournament relegated to [[ESPN3]] streaming); that tournament sold its exclusive coverage to [[Tennis Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/08/13/washington-dc-citi-open-separate-us-open-series-tennis-channel-espn-usta&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bonus Challenge ==

Players earn points for the US Open Series Bonus Challenge in order to win a bonus on top of the individual series tournaments' prize money, according to their results in these events. More points are awarded at some of the events, such as the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and [[WTA Premier tournaments|WTA Premier 5]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bonus Challenge|url=http://www.usopenseries.com/Standings/Bonus_Challenge/|publisher=US Open Series|accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three male and three female players with the most points in the US Open Series Bonus Challenge earn a money purse. The amount depends on their US Open Series placement and US Open result. If both are won then the bonus is $1 million as of 2010.

[[Lleyton Hewitt]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]] were the top point-getters in 2004, [[Andy Roddick]] and [[Kim Clijsters]] won in 2005, and [[Andy Roddick]] and [[Ana Ivanovic]] won in 2006. Defending US Open champions [[Roger Federer]] and [[Maria Sharapova]] won in 2007.

In 2005, whereas Roddick was upset in the first round against [[Gilles Müller]] at the Open, Clijsters became the first player to win both the US Open Series and the US Open, receiving $2.2 million, at the time the largest payday in women's sports. Clijsters defeated Frenchwoman [[Mary Pierce]] in straight sets: 6–3, 6–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreda|first=Allan|title=Clijsters Wins U.S. Open; Federer, Agassi Make Final|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aqinYtVK5NBU|publisher=Bloomberg|date=September 10, 2005|accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 she won $2.2 million again, this time $1.7 million for the US Open title and $500,000 in bonus for second place in the US Open Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clijsters Wins Second Consecutive U.S. Open Title|url=http://longislandtennismagazine.com/article1003/clijsters-wins-second-consecutive-us-open-title|newspaper=Long Island Tennis Magazine|date=September 13, 2010|accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Federer became the first male player and the second player overall to win the US Open Series and go on to win the US Open, winning $1.4 million plus the US Open Series bonus of $1 million, bringing his prize winning total to $2.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federer tames Djokovic to clinch US Open crown|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/10/2028189.htm|publisher=ABC News|date=September 10, 2007|accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topped Clijsters' $2.2 million as the biggest US Open payday to date.

In 2013, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal both won the US Open after also winning the US Open Series. Due to several considerable prize money increments over the years, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal surpassed Roger Federer's Us Open series payday record by winning $3.6 million each, and they shared the record for the largest prize money paycheck in tennis history for a single tennis tournament.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bonus Challenge – Emirates Airline US Open Series|url=http://www.emiratesusopenseries.com/Standings/Bonus_Challenge/?intloc=headernavsub|publisher=Emirates Airline US Open Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Open 2013: Taxman cometh for champions|url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/tennis/us-open-2013/us-open-2013-taxman-cometh-for-champions_768528.html|publisher=ZeeNews India|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Serena Williams would repeat her previous year performance in winning both the US Open Series and the US Open. She now stands alone in the record for the biggest payday in tennis history, with a total amount of $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serena sweeps aside Wozniacki for third straight US Open|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2014-09-07/serena_sweeps_aside_wozniacki_for_third_straight_us_open.html?chip=5?promo=media_wall|publisher=US Open Official Site - A USTA Event}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2017 US Open Series]] did not feature a Bonus Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|number=887436898209116162|user=usopen|title=We will not have #USOpenSeries bonus money this year.|date=July 18, 2017|access-date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Underground education''', or '''clandestine education''' refers to various practices of teaching carried out at times and places where such educational activities were deemed illegal.

Examples of places where widespread clandestine education practices took place included [[Education during the Slave Period|education of Blacks during the Slave Period in the USA]]&lt;ref name="PlatoSigler1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Julius A.

There is a Greek - mostly oral - tradition claiming that secret schools (''[[Krifo scholio]]'') operated during the Ottoman period. There is scant written evidence for this and many historians view it as a [[national myth]]. Others believe that the Greek secret school is a [[legend]] with a core of truth. According to certain sources, secret schools for Albanians operated in late 19th century by Albanian-speaking communities and [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] priests under Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=0JqPscM-kcYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=secret%20schools&amp;f=false Selçuk Akşin Somel, The Modernization of Public Education in the Ottoman Empire, 1839-1908.

In Lithuania, clandestine schools (''Slaptoji mokykla'') operated almost in every village, at the end of 19th and beginning of 20th century, because of the suppresion of Lithuanian language by the tsarist Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.vu.lt/psichologija/article/view/9273 K.

Secret schooling was organized in Jewish Ghettos during the Nazi regime and the German occupation in Europe. During the Taliban rule in various parts of Afghanistan (late 20th, early 21st c.), secret schools operated, mostly for women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/01/afghanistan.theobserver Afghan girls risk their lives to go to secret school, ''The Guardian''.

Japanese and other foreign schools, languages and printed material were restricted, and a compulsory assimilation program was instituted. Japanese schools became illegal in 1938. During that period, Japanese immigrants established secret schools and a newspaper in japanese was printed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=7nlxybOVae8C&amp;pg=PT37&amp;lpg=PT37&amp;dq=clandestine+schools+japan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_0QKHmY6aS&amp;sig=namFzr22cZmwX-H0mWHEbzI_MQs&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK3tuU24XaAhVH2aQKHZx7B-0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clandestine%20schools%20japan&amp;f=false  Daniela de Carvalho, Migrants and Identity in Japan and Brazil: The Nikkeijin.

"'''White Christmas'''" is a 2014 [[List of Christmas television episodes and specials in the United Kingdom|Christmas special episode]] of the British science fiction [[anthology series]] ''[[Black Mirror]]''. It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by Carl Tibbetts, and first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 16 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yoshida|first1=Emily|title=Here's the first promo for the Black Mirror Christmas Special|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7333243/first-promo-black-mirror-christmas-special-white-christmas-jon-hamm-charlie-brooker|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=The Verge|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only television special of the series, it was also the last episode to be aired on Channel 4, as the series would move to [[Netflix]] for its third series.

The episode starts with two men, Matt ([[Jon Hamm]]) and Joe ([[Rafe Spall]]), stationed at a remote outpost in the middle of a snowy wilderness. As they tell each other their respective lives to pass the time, those events are [[Story within a story|depicted on-screen]], forming three mini-stories ultimately relating to the characters' current situation.&lt;ref name=sunopxmas&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Hamm in Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror special - first pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a612187/jon-hamm-in-charlie-brookers-black-mirror-special-first-pictures.html#~oWzCSOMCaoS11U|accessdate=24 November 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oona Chaplin]] and [[Natalia Tena]] co-star as two characters in these stories.

The episode received very positive reviews, with praise for the performances of Hamm and Spall, the writing, and the [[plot twist|twist ending]].

==Plot==
Joe Potter ([[Rafe Spall]]) wakes up in a cabin on [[Christmas Day]]. As he enters the kitchen, Matt Trent ([[Jon Hamm]]) tries to talk to Joe, saying that the two have barely spoken in five years. To get Joe to open up, Matt tells the story of why he ended up in the cabin.

Matt runs an online group who watch each other have sex with women. It is Harry's ([[Rasmus Hardiker]]) turn. Through Harry's "Z-Eyes", Matt can speak in his head and see what Harry sees. Harry crashes an office Christmas party and approaches Amy ([[Verity Marshall]]) and Jennifer ([[Natalia Tena]]). He proceeds to tells them fabricated anecdotes. Overhearing Harry talking to Matt in his head, Jennifer invites him back. In her bedroom, she makes Harry drink something. Explaining that she also hears voices in her head, Harry begins to cough and splutter. Jennifer drinks a mouthful and forces the rest into Harry with a funnel. The two die. Though the group try to delete all the evidence, they are found out. Matt's wife "blocks" him, a feature of Z-Eyes that causes Matt to see her as a colourless silhouette and hear her as a distorted stream of noise. She gets custody of the children.

Matt then talks about his day job. The affluent Greta ([[Oona Chaplin]]) has undergone surgery to make a "cookie" of her—a digital clone stored within an egg-shaped object. Greta's cookie wakes up, not understanding where she is, and Matt explains that her job is to micromanage Greta's life. When the cookie refuses, Matt makes her experience three weeks passing in what lasts a few seconds to him. She protests again, leading Matt to force her to experience six months of time passing. Greta's cookie then concedes from the boredom caused by lack of stimuli, and she begins to control Greta's appliances and manage her calendar.

Joe expresses disgust at what he considers slavery. Matt presses him to talk about why he ended up in the cabin. Joe and his girlfriend Beth ([[Janet Montgomery]]) have dinner with her friends Tim (Dan Li) and Gita ([[Zahra Ahmadi]]). Joe finds a positive pregnancy test, but Beth does not want to keep the child. The conversation becomes heated: Beth blocks Joe and he smashes a vase in fury. The following morning, she leaves while he protests, still blocked. Joe has no way of tracing her. He stumbles across her one day and sees that she is still pregnant, but a passerby calls the police upon hearing Beth call for help. A legal block is enforced, which causes offspring to be blocked.

Beth always visits her father (Ken Drury) in his rural cabin at Christmas, so Joe journeys there each year and watches the blocked child from afar. When the child is four years old, Joe sees on the news that Beth has died, which lifts the legal block. Joe travels to Beth's father's house for [[Christmas Eve]]. He sees for the first time that the child is Asian—the father is Tim. Confusedly approaching Beth's father, Joe asks to see his daughter and ends up striking him on the head with a snow globe that he planned to give to the child. Beth's father falls onto a chair, bloodied, and Joe leaves. Two days later, Beth's daughter ventures out into the snow alone.

While telling the story, Joe gradually realises that he is in Beth's father's house. It is revealed that Joe and Matt are in a cookie, and Matt exits as Joe's cookie has given testimony which can be used to convict Joe. Matt bargained this evidence for his release, but he is placed on an offender's list which leaves him blocked by everybody. Meanwhile, an officer sets the radio in the cookie to play "[[I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day]]", the song on the radio when Joe killed Beth's father, and changes the settings so that Joe experiences 1000 years per minute. Inside the cookie, Joe attempts to destroy the radio, only for it to reappear every time he looks away, with the music getting progressively louder.

==Production==
===Casting===
The episode features [[Jon Hamm]], [[Oona Chaplin]], and [[Rafe Spall]] in the main roles.  Hamm later elaborated that he "had been a fan of ''Black Mirror'' and Charlie Brooker because I have a strange predilection for offbeat British things, and this was no exception. It came about in this very odd way, with me asking my agent if I could meet Mr. Brooker. I didn't know he was even working on a third series or a Christmas special or anything, it was simply that I really liked his work and really wanted to meet the guy."&lt;ref name=premiere&gt;{{cite news|title=When is Jon Hamm's Christmas Black Mirror airing |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a612386/when-is-jon-hamms-christmas-black-mirror-airing.html#~oWJHZOnNPVnz7d|accessdate=2 November 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm mentioned that he had "seen both previous series and absolutely loved it", and Brooker described Hamm's casting as "fortuitous".&lt;ref name=premds&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Mirror: Charlie Brooker, Jon Hamm on the dark side of Yuletide|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/interviews/a616435/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-on-the-dark-side-of-yuletide.html#~oYqejlSZze0OWO|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=Digital Spy|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Hamm, Spall accepted a part in the episode without having seen the series, but having once read a script for a previous episode.&lt;ref name=premds/&gt; Chaplin, who had just moved from the UK to Los Angeles to capitalise on her success in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', similarly praised the script, stating that she "flew out there with a plan to stay for a year, and then a week later I was coming back to the UK to do this.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlie Brooker on Black Mirror: ‘It’s not a technological problem we have, it’s a human one’|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11260768/Charlie-Brooker-Its-not-a-technological-problem-we-have-its-a-human-one.html|accessdate=2 November 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuity===
The special makes references to previous ''Black Mirror'' episodes. In the beginning of the scene in which Matt's computer shows dating club clients in the conference call, one of the users has the nickname, "I_AM_WALDO", and another, "Pie Ape". The Z-Eyes are reminiscent of a similar device in "[[The Entire History of You]]". Clips of TV shows from "[[The Waldo Moment]]" and "[[Fifteen Million Merits]]" are visible when Joe flicks through the TV channels. The pregnancy test Joe finds is the same one used in "[[Be Right Back]]". The [[News ticker|ticker]] during a news report mentions the prime minister from "[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]", as well as Victoria Skillane from "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]", and Liam Monroe from "The Waldo Moment". Bethany sings "Anyone Who Knows What Love Is", the same song that Abi sings in "Fifteen Million Merits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://observer.com/2014/12/cookies-arent-grains-debunking-the-single-universe-theory-of-black-mirror/ | first=Drew | last=Grant | title=Watch the 'Black Mirror' Christmas Special With Jon Hamm | work=[[The Observer]] | date=30 December 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/22/charlie-brooker-black-mirror_n_6508790.html | first=Lauren | last=Duca | title='Black Mirror' Intends To 'Actively Unsettle' Audiences, But It's Not Technology That You Should Fear | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=22 January 2015 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On 16 December 2014, the episode aired on [[Channel 4]] at 9 p.m. The [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] reports figures of 1.66 million viewers in the first 7 days, and 2.07 million viewers after 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly-top-30|title=Weekly top 30 programmes|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received critical acclaim. Ben Beaumont-Thomas of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the episode's comic satire and noted that "sentimentality is offset with wicked wit, and Brooker's brio and imagination paper over any gaps in logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/12/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-rafe-spall-jon-hamm|title=Black Mirror: White Christmas review – sentimentality offset with wicked wit|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 December 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' reviewer Mark Monahan gave the episode 4/5 stars and noted that the drama was "thrilling stuff: escapist entertainment with a very real-world sting in its tail". He equated the episode with the stronger of the previous ''Black Mirror'' episodes, stating that "it exaggerated present-day technology and obsessions to subtle but infernal effect, a nightmare-before-Christmas reminder that to revere our digital gizmos is to become their pathetic slave".&lt;ref name=Tgrve&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11295878/black-mirror-christmas-special-review-the-nightmares-before-christmas.html|title=Black Mirror: White Christmas, review: 'Be careful what you wish for...'
|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellen E Jones of ''[[The Independent]]'' also praised the episode, summarising that the episode was "great on our technology culture, but also just great; well cast, expertly structured and genuinely unsettling". She also compared it favourably to other Christmas television episodes, concluding that: "at a time of year when schmaltz usually covers the TV schedules like a snowdrift, this sidelong look at the state of humanity is all the more welcome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/black-mirror-white-christmas-channel-4--tv-review-nightmarish-tales-of-technophobia-cast-a-chill-over-christmas-9929508.html|title=Black Mirror: White Christmas, Channel 4 - TV review: Charlie Brooker's dystopian sci-fi casts a chill over festivities|website=[[The Independent]]|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Krupa of [[IGN]] gave the episode 8.5/10. In particular, he praised the acting, although he noted that Chaplin's role was the least developed. Despite Hamm's star billing, Krupa noted: "it's really Spall who shines brightest over the course of 90 minutes, as we experience the full depth of his misery".&lt;ref name=ignrev&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/12/16/black-mirror-white-christmas-review|title=JINGLE HELL
|website=[[IGN]]|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Den of Geek noted that the episode's finale was "a thrilling development that invites you to rewatch right from the beginning (something that will greatly benefit from the DVD release, when we can do it without all those ad breaks)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/black-mirror/33392/black-mirror-white-christmas-review|title=Black Mirror: White Christmas review|website=Den of Geek|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The William Blake Archive''' is a [[digital humanities]] project first created in 1996. The project is sponsored by the [[Library of Congress]] and supported by the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name = SiteInfo&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/site.info.html| publisher = The William Blake Archive| title = The William Blake Archive Site Info| accessdate = March 19, 2013|date = June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Rossetti Archive]], the archive provides digital reproductions of the various works of [[William Blake]], a prominent [[Romanticism|Romantic]]-period poet, artist, and engraver, alongside annotation, commentary and scholarly materials related to Blake.&lt;ref name = Eaves&gt;{{cite journal| title = Behind the Scenes at the William Blake Archive: Collaboration Takes More Than E-mail | last = Eaves| first = Morris| volume = 3| issue = 2 | date = December 1997| journal = Journal of Electronic Publishing| doi = 10.3998/3336451.0003.202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When publishing his poetry, William Blake would create print block illustrations for his book, print his books in black and white and then hand paint the illustrations within the prints. Furthermore, many of his works underwent multiple editions of printing, each with unique variations in the prints used to illustrate the poems and the poems themselves. Because of this complex process and the quality of his art, his art and poetry has been highly sought by collectors and scholars. The archive, as a [[digital humanities]] project, provides high quality digital copies of the facsimiles, providing scholars and students an opportunity to see the complexity of his published works often not available by viewing the scholarly print editions.&lt;ref name = McQuail&gt;{{Cite web| title = Using the William Blake Archive in Teaching Poetry| first =Josephine A. | last = McQuail| work = "World Wide Poetry on the Web" a MLA Poetry Division Panel| url = http://epc.buffalo.edu/conferences/00/mla/web.html| publisher = The Electronic Poetry Center at The University of Buffalo| accessdate = March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Viscomi&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Computers and the Humanities| date = February 2002| volume = 36| issue =  1| pages =27–48| title = Digital Facsimiles: Reading the William Blake Archive| first =Joseph | last =Viscomi| doi = 10.1023/A:1013163229994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive has been peer reviewed by the [[Modern Language Association]] in 2005 and the [[Multimedia Educational Tools for Learning and Online Teaching]] (MERLOT) process in 2010.&lt;ref name = SiteInfo/&gt;&lt;ref name = MERLOT&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewCompositeReview.htm?id=502599|title = Peer Review:The William Blake Archive| date = Nov 25, 2010| author = English Editorial Board|accessdate = March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MERLOT highly recommended the use of the tool for teaching, praising the access to primary sources it provides; however, they also noted the need for educators to create instructional materials on how to use the site and the ease by which someone could get lost.&lt;ref name = MERLOT/&gt; Scholars have also written a number of educational case studies on how to use the archive.&lt;ref group =note&gt;See for example Josephine A. McQuail "[http://epc.buffalo.edu/conferences/00/mla/mcquail.htm Using the William Blake Archive in Teaching Poetry]"  from MLA 2000 in Washington, D.C. or Daniel Cook "[http://www.romtext.org.uk/teaching-romanticism-vi-william-blake/ Teaching Romanticism VI: William Blake]" on the ''Romantic Textualities'' blog.&lt;/ref&gt;
