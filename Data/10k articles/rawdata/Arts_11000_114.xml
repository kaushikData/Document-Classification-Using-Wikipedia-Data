'''''Ali Pascha von Janina oder Die Franzosen in Albanien''''' (''Ali Pasha of Ioannina or The French in Albania'') is a one-act German [[singspiel]]. It is set around 1820 in [[Ioannina]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and is named after its central character [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]].

Its music and [[libretto]] are both by the German composer [[Albert Lortzing]] – it can be considered as a precursor to his later full-length operas. He had decided to write for the stage in 1823, aged 22. [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] subjects were then popular and so he chose that theme for his first work. On 30 January 1824 he married [[Rosina Regina Ahles]] and soon afterwards he completed the music, but it took him until 1828 to find a theatre which would mount the work.

The couple took on an engagement at the [[Landestheater Detmold|Hoftheater Detmold]] in autumn 1826, as well as appearing in theatres in [[Münster]] and [[Osnabrück]].  Lortzing finally premiered the work in the [[Städtische Bühnen Münster]] in on 1 February 1828, where it was a moderate success and enabled him to continue writing plays.

==Characters==
*Ali Bey, Pasha of Joannina ([[bass (voice type)|bass]])
*Ibrahim, overseer of the pasha's harem (bass)
*Captain Bernier ([[tenor]])
*Lieutenant Robert, Bernier's friend (tenor)
*Arianna, a girl from Corfu ([[soprano]])
*Soldiers, sailors, guards, slavegirls, slaves, imprisoned maidens (chorus)

==Plot==
Stationed in Ioannina with his battalion, the French naval captain Bernier has fallen in love with Arianna, a beautiful girl from the nearby island of [[Corfu]]. However, he has not heard from her for days and is worried about what might have happened to her. Bernier's friend Robert tries in vain to comfort him.

Bernier's concerns prove justified – Arianna had been captured by a wild horde whilst out walking on the beach and taken to Ali Pasha's [[harem]]. Ali Pasha cannot bear her laments and complaints and orders her to forget Bernier since she now belongs to him alone. The other women in the harem are unwilling to raise Arianna's hopes and instead advise her that the only way to survive her suffering is to submit herself to fate and Ali Pasha's will.

In the meantime Bernier receives news of his beloved and gains entry to Ali Pasha's palace under a pretext. Ali Pasha is initially delighted to welcome a Frenchman and brings in Arianna to show her off to him, make Bernier envious and draw on Bernier's knowledge of women.

Bernier and Arianna find it hard to conceal their true feelings and pretend that they do not know each other, but only a few minutes after Ali Pasha leaves she admits to her love. Ali Pasha overhears this from a hiding place and rushes back in swearing vengeance. Bernier is chained up but Robert and the French battalion succeed in penetrating the harem.

"'''Amarillo by Morning'''" is a [[country music]] song written by [[Terry Stafford]] and Paul Fraser, and recorded by Stafford in 1973. Several cover versions have since been made, including a major 1983 hit for [[George Strait]].

Members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.&lt;ref name="Top100"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs |author=Western Writers of America |year=2010 |authorlink=Western Writers of America |publisher=American Cowboy |url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RjFQXqGy?url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archivedate=10 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Stafford conceived the song after playing with his band at a rodeo in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and then driving back to his home in [[Amarillo, Texas]].&lt;ref name=albright-2003-17-09&gt;Albright, Max.

The single "[[Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose]]" had been previously released as an A-side 45 (Atlantic Master 26868; June 7, 1973), but due to the success of "Amarillo by Morning", the single was re-released October 4, 1973, as the A-side (Atlantic Master  26867-1 stereo and Atlantic Master 26867-2 mono), with "Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose" on the B-side.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cash Box]]'' - November 17, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The song entered the Cash Box Country Looking Ahead chart November 3, 1973, the Cash Box Country chart on December 15, 1973, peaking at #37, the Billboard Country chart December 1, 1973, peaking at #31, the Record World Country chart December 15, 1973, peaking at #50, and Canada RPM Country chart January 26, 1974, peaking at number 38.&lt;ref name=YoungH /&gt;

The song has been [[cover version|covered]] by numerous artists, including rodeo champion [[Chris LeDoux]] in 1975 on his album ''Life as a Rodeo Man'', [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[John Arthur Martinez]] on his 2004 album ''Lone Starry Night''.

South Texas recording artist Clifton Jansky from San Antonio recorded the song in November 1979 in Ludwig Studios in Houston, Texas. He had a regional hit in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Louisiana. Three years later, he exchanged soundtracks with Kelly Schoppa in Houston. He traded his soundtrack to "Amarillo by Morning" for a duet that Kelly had recorded in Nashville with Janie Fricke and no money changed hands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} George Strait heard Kelly's version in 1982 and decided to record Amarillo by Morning in 1983.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It has become George Strait's signature song since then.

Canadian indie rock artist [[Todd Fancey|Fancey]] covered the song on his 2018 album of 1960s and 70s country songs ''County Fair''.&lt;ref&gt;http://exclaim.ca/music/article/fancey-amarillo_by_morning&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian singer [[Zé Ramalho]] has also recorded the song.

===Critical reception===
Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, saying that he has "finally found his niche as a performer." He goes on to say that the "simple arrangement and understated delivery are the defining elements of just about every Strait record since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryuniverse.net/2011/08/02/retro-single-review-george-strait-amarillo-by-morning/ |title=Retro Single Review: George Strait, "Amarillo By Morning" – Country Universe |website=Countryuniverse.net |date=2011-08-02 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azerbaijan State Museum of History of Karabakh''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dövlət Qarabağ Tarixi Muzeyi}}) was a museum located in [[Shusha]], [[Azerbaijan]]. 

==History==
In February 1991, by the order of the Minister of Culture of the Republic of Azerbaijan, [[Polad Bulbuloglu]], the Museum of History of Karabakh was established in Shusha.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt;  Up to 550 exhibit funds were created at the preparatory stage and staff schedule was approved.&lt;ref name=" ondoqquzsifirbesh "/&gt;  

Originally, the house of [[Firidun bey Kocharli]] was used as the base for the museum. Later the museum was temporarily operated in one of the buildings in the Resort Sanatorium Union. The political situation and the Armenian occupation resulted in the suspension of the museum's activity.&lt;ref name="ondoqquzsifirbesh"/&gt; 

As a result of the occupation of Shusha by the [[Armenian Armed Forces]] about six hundred exhibits of the museum were destroyed and those could be carried were transported.&lt;ref name="ondoqquzsifirbesh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Dövlət Qarabağ Tarixi Muzeyi|url=http://1905.az/az%C9%99rbaycan-dovl%C9%99t-qarabag-tarixi-muzeyi|publisher=1905.az|language= az|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Later, when a group of Shusha intellectuals made suggestions for the restoration of the museum, the proposal was ignored. However, the approval of the relevant agencies on whether locating the museum in an empty building at the Alley of Martyrs or in ancient buildings located on top of other tourist routes for its activity was not obtained. At present, wages for museum employees are frozen.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dövlət Qarabağ Tarixi muzeyimiz də var….|url=http://modern.az/articles/11385/1/#gsc.tab=0|publisher=modern.az|language= az|access-date=3 February 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The first director of the State Museum of History of Karabakh was Emin Aghayev.&lt;ref name="ondoqquzsifirbesh"/&gt;

[[File:La Belle Sauvage Inn.jpg|thumb|The Bell Savage Inn – inner courtyard]]
The '''Bell Savage Inn''' was a former [[public house]] in [[London]], England, from the 15th century to 1873, originally located on the north side of what is now [[Ludgate Hill]], in the [[City of London]]. It was a [[Inn-yard theatre|playhouse]] during the [[Elizabethan Era]], as well as a venue for various other entertainments. It was also an important [[coaching inn]]. Other names by which it has been known throughout history include: Savage's Inn, The Bel Savage, Belle Savage, Belle Sauvage, Bell on the Hoop, Old Bell Savage, Belly Savage and others.

==History==

===15th century===
Written records allow the Inn's history to be traced back to at least 1420.&lt;ref name="berry"&gt;Herbert Berry. ''[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-155737782.html The Bell Savage inn and playhouse in London]'' (Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England – 1 January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1453 (in the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]), a [[deed]] gave the building's name (in translation) as "''Savage's Inn''" or "''The Bell on the Hoop''" and located within the parish of St. Bridget (Bride) in [[Fleet Street]]. "Savage" is thought to be the name of a former, perhaps the original, proprietor; a William Savage, who was recorded as having resided in Fleet Street in 1380, has been suggested as a possibility, which, would date the inn back to at least some time in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="cassell_19"&gt;Cassell,1922, p19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative name "Bell on the Hoop" may be explained by the fact that both symbols have commonly been used on English Inn signs of the period – the "hoop" refers to a garland of Ivy.&lt;ref name="berry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cassell_19" /&gt; The later name, "Bell Savage", could have arisen as a linguistic inversion of "Savage's Bell".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, 1909, p75.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the past it was rumored to be derived from the French phrase ''belle sauvage'', but [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]] considered that interpretation with scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=74|year=1855|issue=6|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th century===

In 1554, it is recorded that [[Thomas Wyatt the younger|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], leader of a popular [[Wyatt's rebellion|revolt]] against [[Queen Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], and his men, "came to Bell Savage, an Inn nigh unto [[Ludgate|Lud gate]]", but the gate was closed to prevent the rebels entering the [[City of London]]. Hence Wyatt "rested him awhile upon a stall over against the Bell Savage gate". Shortly afterwards he surrendered at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]].&lt;ref&gt;(Cassell,1922, 19–22)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1568, the Inn was bequeathed to the [[Worshipful Company of Cutlers|Cutlers' Company]], an old City [[Livery Company|trade guild]], for the purpose of exhibitions at [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] and the benefit of the poor of the parish of St. Bride's. At this time the property consisted of 2 [[Courtyard|courts]]: The entrance to the outer court was via an archway leading from the north side of Ludgate Hill; the entrance to the inner court was through another archway directly opposite the first. The Inn itself was the building surrounding the inner court, which was overlooked by 2 tiers of covered balconies, from which the guest rooms were accessed.&lt;ref name="cassell_22"&gt;Cassell, 1922, p22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belle Sauvage entrance 1782.jpg|thumb|Archway to the Bell Savage Yard from Ludgate Hill, 1782]]
The Bell Savage was one of the four inns of London that were used as [[Inn-yard theatre|playhouse]] in the late 16th century – in this case from 1575.  The balconies surrounding the inner court served as the [[Theater (structure)|upper and lower circles]], the rooms of the Inn became private "[[Box (theatre)|boxes]]" and the yard itself was the "pit". The stage would have been built against one side of the yard and curtained off. [[Richard Tarlton]], the well-known comedian, performed here. The inner courtyard of the Inn was also used for public displays of [[fencing]] from the mid-1560s to 1589, and as these displays took place on a stage it is quite possible that dramas could also have been enacted at this earlier period.&lt;ref name="berry" /&gt; The showman William Bankes and his trick horse "[[Bankes's Horse|Marocco]]" performed here. [[Bear-baiting]] also took place in the latter half of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="cassell_22" /&gt;

===17th century===

In 1616, [[Pocahontas]] and her retinue, who had come over from [[Virginia]], were boarded at the Bell Savage. The yard at this time was said to be the "haunt of thieves and conmen....noisy, dangerous and evil-smelling".&lt;ref&gt;Grace Steele Woodward. ''Pocahontas'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1969) p174-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Montgomery. ''1607: Jamestown and the New World'' (Colonial Williamsburg, 2007) p140.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666 the Inn was burnt to the ground, but rebuilt afterwards some time prior to 1676.&lt;ref name="berry" /&gt; In the outer court were some private houses; [[Grinling Gibbons]] lived here for a period before 1677, and the quack [[Richard Rock]] also resided here.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, 1909, p76.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1684, the inn was advertising a "Rhynoceros, lately brought from the East Indies" which could be seen by the public for a small fee – the first [[rhinoceros]] to be exhibited in England. Among the people to view it was [[Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford]], [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/ref_files/1215766029.pdf The first Rhino in Britain] (Rhino resource center) Accessed 18 Sep 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belle Savage yard and coach.jpg|thumb|Coach emerging from the "Belle Sauvage" yard into Ludgate Hill (engraving after [[James Pollard]])]]
The Bell Savage was an important coaching inn from at least the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and probably long before; a newspaper advertisement in 1674 states that the Inn had 40 rooms for guests and stabling for 100 horses.&lt;ref name="cassell_23"&gt;Cassell, 1922, p23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th–19th centuries===

The Inn declined with the growth of the railways and by the mid 19th century, parts had become very dilapidated. During the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851, a John Thorburn, took out a lease on part or all of the property and refurbished the accommodation for paying guests. In 1852, [[John Cassell]]'s publishing house and printing works moved into part of the premises. This adversely affected the hotel business as the noise and vibration from the [[Printing press|presses]] disturbed guests. In 1853, Cassell took over the rest of the property from Thorburn – to the latter's relief.&lt;ref name="cassell_23" /&gt;

During Cassell's tenure, the yard was progressively rebuilt; the Inn was finally demolished in 1873 to make way for a railway viaduct. No visible trace now remains. The Cassell &amp; Company's building was called La Belle Sauvage prior to 1914.

==The Bell Savage in art and literature==

The Bell Savage featured in Dickens's "[[Pickwick Papers]]"&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Matz. ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924013472794 The inns &amp; taverns of "Pickwick"]'' (London, C. Palmer, 1921) p61 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s [[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, 1922, p20.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst artists who drew or painted the inn were: [[Robert Laurie (engraver)|Robert Laurie]] (1755–1836),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotosearch.com/IST531/1618940/ Court of Equity, Belle Sauvage Inn, 1778] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301230727/http://www.fotosearch.com/IST531/1618940/ |date=1 March 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hosmer Shepherd]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotosearch.com/IST530/1237686/ Belle Sauvage Yard, c. 1850] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301230733/http://www.fotosearch.com/IST530/1237686/ |date=1 March 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matz, 1921, opp. p64.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Shepherd (artist)|George Shepherd]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_image.aspx The Belle Sauvage Inn yard] (British museum – 18 Sep 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Maggs]] (1819–1896),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allposters.co.uk/-sp/La-Belle-Sauvage-Inn-Ludgate-Hill-London-Posters_i2830708_.htm La belle Sauvage Inn].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Jameson Grant]] (fl. 1831–1846).

'''Bernard Natan''' (born '''Natan Tannenzaft'''; July 14, 1886&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; – October&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; 1942) was a [[France|Franco]]-Romanian film entrepreneur, director and actor of the 1920s and 1930s. He was once said by historians to be one of the earliest (if not the earliest) [[pornographic film]] directors and porn stars,&lt;ref name="Waugh"&gt;Waugh, Thomas. ''Hard To Imagine.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-231-09998-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade"&gt;Slade, Joseph. "Bernard Natan: France's Legendary Pornographer." ''Journal of Film and Video.'' 45:2–3 (Summer-Fall 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; although there is now considerable doubt about this.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; Natan certainly worked in  mainstream cinema from his youngest days, working his way up from projectionist and chemist to cinematographer and producer.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; He eventually acquired the giant French motion picture studio [[Pathé]] in 1929. Pathé collapsed in 1935, and Natan was convicted of fraud. However, he laid the foundation for the modern film industry in France and helped revolutionize film technology around the world.&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Natan was born Natan Tannenzaft (possibly Tanenzapf) to [[Jew]]ish parents in [[Iaşi]],&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; [[Romania]] in 1886. He moved to France in the early 1900s and, despite being a Romanian, volunteered to fight for France in [[World War I]]. In 1909 he married and subsequently had 2 children.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane"&gt;Cairns, David &amp; Duane, Paul. ''Natan.'' Screenworks, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he became a [[French nationality law|French citizen]], and at some point changed his name to "Bernard Natan."&lt;ref name="Waugh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt; His younger brother [[Emile Natan]] also moved to France and became a film producer.{&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen and Willems&lt;/ref&gt;}

==Mainstream film career==
Natan worked as a projectionist, film lab chemist, titles designer, cinematographer and producer during his early years in Paris. He was as a publicity [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for [[Paramount Pictures]] during the early 1920s. But by 1929, Natan's Rapid Film had become a major film producer and distributor. His reputation was such that in 1924 Natan became a member of the executive committee of the Cinematographic Employers' Federation. By 1926, his film laboratory was highly regarded, he had established a marketing firm, and he built two [[sound stage]]s. Natan was also a film producer, helping finance and produce motion pictures at other studios.&lt;ref name="Rapid-Film"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Rapid-Film et ses Branches Production." ''Pathé, Premier Empire du Cinéma.'' Jacques Kermabon, ed. Paris: Centre Georges Pompidou, 1994.  {{ISBN|2-85850-793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Les Origines du Groupe Pathé-Natan et le Modele Americain." ''Vingtième Siècle.'' 46 (April–June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Takeover of Pathé===
In late February 1929, Bernard Natan acquired the production and exhibition businesses of Pathé, then the largest French motion picture company. He agreed to merge his own studio, Rapid Film (then worth 25 million [[French franc|francs]]), with Pathé in exchange for 50 million francs in shares. The remaining shares were purchased with funding from a consortium of banks, bonds (to be paid with income from Pathé), and a 10 percent ownership in Pathé by the banks. After the merger, Natan renamed the company Pathé-Natan (sometimes also credited as Pathé-Cinéma).&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster"&gt;Abel, Richard. ''The Red Rooster Scare: Making Cinema American, 1900–1910.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-520-21478-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave"&gt;Abel, Richard. ''French Cinema: The First Wave 1915–1929.'' Paperback ed. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-691-00813-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble when Natan took control. Studio founder [[Charles Pathé]] had been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and "rooster" trademark to other companies in return for a mere 2 percent of revenues generated by them. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as the [[Great Depression]] convulsed the French economy.&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Les origines de Pathé-Natan." In ''Une Histoire Économique du Cinéma Français (1895–1995), Regards Croisés Franco-Américains.'' Pierre-Jean Benghozi and Christian Delage, eds. Paris: Harmattan, Collection Champs Visuels, 1997. English translation available at [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109223643/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm |date=January 9, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. Natan acquired another film studio, [[Société des Cinéromans]], from [[Arthur Bernède]] and [[Gaston Leroux]], which enabled Pathé to expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theaters and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks were [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and contained veiled [[homophobia|homophobic]] allusions to Natan's supposed sexuality.&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Pathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 million [[French franc|francs]] in profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreel [[Pathé News]], which had not been produced since 1927.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Natan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathe's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into [[sound film]]. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, ''Pathé-Revue'' and ''Actualités Féminines'', to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of [[Henri Chrétien]], who developed the [[anamorphic format|anamorphic lens]] (a technology which later led to the creation of [[CinemaScope]] and other [[widescreen]] film formats common today).&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Natan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. A year later, he purchased a radio station in Paris and formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

===Collapse of Pathé and imprisonment===
In 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring in.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The collapse of Pathé led French authorities to indict Bernard Natan on charges of fraud. Natan was accused of financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitious [[shell corporation]]s, and negligent financial mismanagement. Natan was even accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. Natan was indicted and imprisoned in 1939. This meant he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, while most other major Jewish filmmakers were able to flee the country or go into hiding. A second indictment was brought in 1941, and he was convicted shortly thereafter. His French citizenship was taken away, which required special legal manovres by the state, since he had been naturalized as a result of his WWI military servie and there was no existing legal means to render him stateless. He was transferred from prison in September 1942 to the [[Drancy internment camp|camp at Drancy]], and shortly afterwards deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==Adult film controversy==
In 1911, Natan and colleagues were convicted of making erotic films, he was jailed for a short time and fined 1,000 francs but due to his exceptional record fighting in World War I this was later removed from his record.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen and Willems, p. 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources have claimed that Natan's career in pornography did not end there. Joseph Slade suggests that Natan may have directed at least one [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic film in Romania&lt;ref name="Waugh" /&gt; and produced and acted in at least 20 hardcore [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[bisexual]] films between 1920 and 1927.&lt;ref name="Trumpbour"&gt;Trumpbour, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Slade wrote that nearly all French pornographic films from this period which include bisexual and homosexual content were produced by Natan. The same source states that Natan himself was bisexual,&lt;ref name="Waugh"/&gt; and engaged in intercourse in ''[[Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly]]'' (1920) and ''La Maîtresse du Capitaine de Meydeux'' (1924). Furthermore, Slade claimed that he introduced [[Sadomasochism|masochism]] into French pornographic film.&lt;ref name="Slade"/&gt;

Slade's claims are disputed by the historians of the French organization "Les Indépendants du Premier Siècle", who argue that the various actors in question are not Natan and that accusations at Natan's trial and in [[Paris-Match]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Pamela |date=14 December 2015 |title=In need of rehabilitation: Bernard Natan, the Holocaust victim who saved France's film industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/dec/14/bernard-natan-pathe-cinema-holocaust-victim-france-film-industry |location=The Guardian |access-date=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting him to the adult film industry were false.&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen, André and Willems, Gilles. "Bernard Natan à la direction de Pathé-Cinéma." ''1895''. 21 (December 1996). Paris: AFRHC (association française pour l'Histoire du cinéma).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lips.org/bio_natan.%20reponse_%C3%A0_Slade.asp Droit de réponse Mise au point Sur le grand producteur Bernard Natan], LIPS.org,&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natan'', a 2013 documentary film, compares stills from the adult films attributed to Natan with official headshots and shows that several pornographic actors have been mistaken for Natan but are not him.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; Joseph Slade now admits there is room for doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;

==Death==
[[World War II]] broke out while Natan was in prison awaiting trial, and [[Nazi Germany]] conquered France. After Natan's release from prison, the French government handed him over to the [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|occupying German authorities]]. Natan was sent to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] on September 25, 1942,&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; where it is believed he died in 1943.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;

==Importance to the film industry==
Bernard Natan's importance to the French film industry should not be underestimated. He pioneered the [[vertical integration]] of the French film industry, and adopted the "American model" of film-making and distribution. This model provides the underpinning of the French film industry even in the 21st century. Indeed, Pathé survived into the 1980s almost solely on revenues generated by the companies purchased and integration instituted by Bernard Natan.&lt;ref name="Rapid-Film" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

Natan also brought television to France, and established the first French radio holding and television companies.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Under Natan's leadership, the anamorphic film camera lens was developed. The anamorphic lens was not only a major advance in film technology, but helped [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] survive during the early years of television.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. ''Film Art.'' 4th ed. New York:  McGraw-Hill, 1993. {{ISBN|0-07-006446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monaco, James. ''How to Read a Film: The Art, Technology, Language, History and Theory of Film and Media.'' Rev. ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently there was no public acknowledgement of Natan at La Fémis, the French national film school, which is housed in one of his former studios. A plaque commemorating his work, and his death in Auschwitz in 1942, was unveiled in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Pamela |date=14 December 2015 |title=In need of rehabilitation: Bernard Natan, the Holocaust victim who saved France's film industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/dec/14/bernard-natan-pathe-cinema-holocaust-victim-france-film-industry |location=The Guardian |access-date=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Book of Proverbs''' ([[Hebrew]]: מִשְלֵי, ''Míshlê (Shlomoh)'', "Proverbs (of [[Solomon]])") is the second book of the third section (called Writings) of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and a book of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Old Testament]].{{sfn|Berlin|2011|p=588}} When translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], the title took on different forms: in the Greek [[Septuagint]] (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι ''Paroimiai'' ("Proverbs"); in the Latin [[Vulgate]] the title was ''Proverbia'', from which the English name is derived.

Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium.{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=438}} It is an example of the Biblical [[wisdom tradition]], and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=xiii–xvii}} The repeated theme is that "the fear of God (meaning submission to the will of God) is the beginning of wisdom."{{sfn|Longman|Garland|2009|p=}} Wisdom is praised for her role in creation; God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos; and since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.{{sfn|Boccaccini|2002|p=106}}

== Structure ==
[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|235px|Scroll of the Book of Proverbs]]

The superscriptions divide the collections as follows:
* Proverbs 1–9: "Proverbs of Solomon, Son of David, King of Israel"
* Proverbs 10–22:16: "Proverbs of Solomon"
* Proverbs 22:17–24:22: "The Sayings of the Wise"
* Proverbs 24:23–34: "These Also are Sayings of the Wise"
* Proverbs 25–29: "These are Other Proverbs of Solomon that the Officials of King Hezekiah of Judah Copied"
* Proverbs 30: "The Words of Agur"
* Proverbs 31:1–9: "The Words of King Lemuel of Massa, Which his Mother Taught Him"
* Proverbs 31:10–31: the ideal wise woman (elsewhere called the "woman of substance").{{sfn|Perdue|2012|pp=x–xi}}

== Contents ==

"Proverbs" translates to the Hebrew word ''mashal'', but "mashal" has a wider range of meaning than the short catchy sayings implied by the English word. Thus, while roughly half the book is made up of "sayings" of this type, the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types. These include "instructions" formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the "words of the wise" sayings, longer than the Solomonic "sayings" but shorter and more diverse than the "instructions".{{sfn|Farmer|1991|pp=17–20}}

The first section (chapters 1–9) consists of an initial invitation to young men to take up the course of wisdom, ten "instructions", and five poems on personified Woman Wisdom.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=48}} Proverbs 10:1–22:16, with 375 sayings, consists of two parts, the first contrasting the wise man and the fool (or the righteous and the wicked), the second addressing wise and foolish speech.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=58}} Chapters 25–29, attributed to editorial activity of "the men of [[Hezekiah]]," contrasts the just and the wicked and broaches the topic of rich and poor.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=67}} Chapter 30:1–4, the "sayings of Agur", introduces creation, divine power, and human ignorance.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=68}}

It is impossible to offer precise dates for the sayings in Proverbs, a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium.{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=438}} The phrase conventionally used for the title is taken from chapter 1:1, ''mishley shelomoh'', Proverbs of Solomon (the phrase is repeated at 10:1 and 25:1), is likely more concerned with labeling the material than ascribing authorship.{{sfn|Farmer|1991|p=25}}

The book is an anthology made up of six discrete units. The first, chapters 1–9, was probably the last to be composed, in the Persian or Hellenistic periods. This section has parallels to prior cuneiform writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=Robert William  |date=1912 |title=Cuneiform parallels to the Old Testament |edition=1st | chapter = 8. Fragment of Wisdom Literature | publisher= Eaton and Mains|  place = New York | url=https://archive.org/details/cunciformparalle00roge |access-date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, chapters 10–22:16, carries the superscription "the proverbs of Solomon", which may have encouraged its inclusion in the Hebrew canon. The third unit is headed "bend your ear and hear the words of the wise": a large part of it is a recasting of a second-millennium BCE Egyptian work, the [[Instruction of Amenemope]], and may have reached the Hebrew author(s) through an Aramaic translation. Chapter 24:23 begins a new section and source with the declaration, "these too are from the wise." The next section at chapter 25:1 has a superscription to the effect that the following proverbs were transcribed "by the men of [[Hezekiah]]", indicating at face value that they were collected in the reign of Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE. Chapters 30 and 31 (the "words of Agur," the "words of Lemuel," and the description of the ideal woman) are a set of appendices, quite different in style and emphasis from the previous chapters.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=183–85}}

The "wisdom" genre was widespread throughout the [[ancient Near East]], and reading Proverbs alongside the examples recovered from Egypt and Mesopotamia reveals the common ground shared by international wisdom.{{sfn|Smothers|2000|pp=167–68, 174}} The wisdom literature of Israel may have been developed in the family, the royal court, and houses of learning and instruction;{{sfn|Tucker|2000|pp=163–66}} nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is of instruction within the family in small villages.{{sfn|Crenshaw|2000|p=217}}

Along with the other examples of the Biblical [[wisdom tradition]] – [[Book of Job|Job]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] and some other writings – Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct. The three retain an ongoing relevance for both religious and secular readers, Job and Ecclesiastes through the boldness of their dissent from received tradition, Proverbs in its worldliness and satiric shrewdness. Wisdom is as close as Biblical literature comes to Greek philosophy, of which it was a contemporary; it shares with the Greeks an inquiry into values and reflections on the human condition, although there is no discussion of [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and the other abstract issues raised by the Greeks.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=xiii–xvii}}

Proverbs was almost excluded from the Bible because of its contradictions (the result of the book's origins as not just an anthology but an anthology of anthologies). The reader is told, for example, both to "not answer a fool according to his folly", according to 26:4, and to "answer a fool according to his folly", as 26:5 advises. More pervasively, the recurring theme of the initial unit (chapters 1–9) is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the following units are much less theological, presenting wisdom as a transmissible human craft, until with 30:1–14, the "words of Agur," we return once more to the idea that God alone possesses wisdom.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=183–85}}

"The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10 – the phrase implies submission to God's will{{sfn|Longman|Garland|2009|p=}}). Wisdom is praised for her role in creation ("God by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens" – Proverbs 3:19). God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos ("When [God] established the heavens...when he drew a circle on then face of the [[Tehom|Deeps]]...when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him" – Proverbs 8:27–31). Since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.{{sfn|Boccaccini|2002|p=106}} Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful (though see the words of Agur for a "fool" who has wisdom, and could be seen as playful).

For the most part Proverbs offers a simplistic view of life with few grey areas: life lived according to the rules brings reward, life in violation of them is certain to bring disaster. In contrast, [[Book of Job|Job]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] appear to be direct contradictions of the simplicities of Proverbs, each in its own way all but dismissing the assumptions of the "wise".{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=183}} Noteworthy also is the fact that the "mighty acts of God" ([[the Exodus]], the giving of the [[Torah]] at Sinai, the Covenant between God and Israel, etc.) which make up Israel's history are completely or almost completely absent from Proverbs and the other Wisdom books: in contrast to the other books of the Hebrew bible, which appeal to divine revelation for their authority ("Thus says the Lord!"), wisdom appeals to human reason and observation.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=130}}

==Later interpretation and influence==
The pre-Exilic (i.e. pre-586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to YHWH in heaven, despite the continued existence of an [[Heavenly host|assembly of subordinate servant-deities]].{{sfn|Page Lee|1990|pp=176–77}} The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition developed the idea that Wisdom existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe:{{sfn|Berlin|2011|p=188}} "Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields."{{sfn|Parrish|1990|p=183}} Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity.{{sfn|Kaiser|1997|p=28}} Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] calls Jesus "...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...", while the [[Gospel of John]] identifies him with the creative word ("In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God").{{sfn|Parrish|1990|pp=183–84}} 

In the 4th century, when Christianity was caught up in heresies and still developing the creeds which would define its beliefs, {{Bibleverse|Proverbs|8:22|NASB}} was used both to support and refute the claims of the [[Arian controversy|Arians]]. The Arians, assuming that Christ could be equated with the "Wisdom of God" ({{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|1:24}}), argued that the Son, like Wisdom, was "created" (Proverbs 8:22), and therefore subordinate to the Creator; their opponents, who argued that the relevant Hebrew word should be translated as "begot", won the debate, and the [[Nicene Creed]] declared that the Son was "begotten, not made", meaning that God and Christ were [[Consubstantiality|consubstantial]].{{sfn|Farmer|1991|pp=53–54}}

'''Book rebinding''' is the renewal or replacement of the [[book cover|cover of a book]].  Typically, this requires restitching or renewal of the glue which holds the pages in place.

Collectors of [[book_collecting#Antiquarian_book_collecting|antique books]] such as [[incunabula]] would often have them rebound.  This might be done to improve their appearance by rebinding in a more fashionable colour or to assert ownership by having the book rebound in uniform covers which were stamped with an insignia such as a coat of arms.  One prominent collector who had this done was [[George_Spencer,_2nd_Earl_Spencer#Book_collecting|Earl Spencer]].  For example, when he acquired a medieval [[psalter]] of 1457, which was bound in pigskin on wooden boards, he had it rebound in mauve velvet over cardboard.  The [[Bodelian Library]] rebound additions to its collection for functional reasons — to indicate value and importance.  The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] requested 6600 francs for bookbinding in the eighth year of the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]], "those which come from our conquests in Germany and Italy, and while infinitely precious, they have arrived to us in a deplorable state".&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQVHVBQP8IIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9781107000513&amp;hl=ent&amp;q=rebinding&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=rebinding&amp;f=false |title=Revolution and the Antiquarian Book: Reshaping the Past, 1780-1815 |chapter=Commemorating and obliterating the past |first1=Kristian |last1=Jensen |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=9781107000513 |pages=137-175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
===Birds of America===
[[File:Dendroica auduboni (Audubon).jpg|thumb|right|One of the plates painted by Audubon — ''[[Dendroica auduboni]]'']]
The four-volume copy of [[John James Audubon|Audubon]]'s ''[[The Birds of America|Birds of America]]'' held in the [[Royal Collection]] was rebound in 2011 by conservators at [[Windsor Castle]].  The volumes are especially large and heavy, being printed on [[double elephant]] paper of about 50 by 28 inches, and weighing over 50 pounds.  The plates, which were published loose, had been originally bound by the royal bookbinder, James Mackenzie, around 1840.  That leather cover had perished and the tight sewing of the pages made viewing difficult as the pages might tear.  The rebinding was done in nine stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/conservation/case-study-audubons-birds-of-america/the-rebinding-of-audubons-birds-of-america |title=The rebinding of Audubon’s 'Birds of America' |publisher=Royal Collection Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:# the volumes were taken apart by cutting away the spine, cords, stitching and removing the glue
:# the plates were separated, cleaned, repaired and pressed flat
:# paper guards were added to the spinal edge of the plates - strips of paper which would bear the new sewing
:# the plates were grouped into sections of four which were then sewn to linen tapes
:# the spines of the plates assembled for a volume were then rounded by beating with a hammer
:# new [[endband|headband]]s of linen-covered [[vellum]] were added
:# new [[book cover|covers]] were made in the original style — boards covered with book cloth and leather reinforcement on the spine and corners
:# the original pastedowns and endpapers of [[marbled paper]] were restored for the inside of the cover
:# the leather of the cover was then tooled with hot brass and gold leaf to restore the titles and decoration in the style of the original binding

A '''botanical illustrator''' is a person who paints, sketches or otherwise [[botanical illustration|illustrates botanical]] subjects. Typical illustrations are in watercolour, but may also be in oils, ink or pencil, or a combination of these. The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system.

Botanical illustration is sometimes used as a [[Biological type|type]] for attribution of a [[botanical name]] to a [[taxon]]. The inability of botanists to conserve certain dried specimens, or restrictions on safe transport, have meant illustrations have been nominated as the type for some names. Many minute plants, which may only be viewed under a microscope, are often identified by an illustration to overcome the difficulties in using slide mounted specimens. The standards for this are by international agreement (Art 37.5 of the Vienna Code, 2006)...


==History==
The use of illustrations was frequently seen in the herbals, seed catalogues and popular works of natural history. The illustrations produced during the eighteenth and nineteenth century are regarded as both appealing and scientifically valid. The finer detail of the printing processes, greatly improving at this time, allowed artists such as [[Franz Bauer|Franz]] and [[Ferdinand Bauer]] to depict the minute aspects of the subject. The use of exploded details would further illustrate the description given in the accompanying text.  These details allowed a non scientific audience to go some way in identifying the species, the widening interest in natural history and horticulture was an inducement to the production of many [[Flora]]s and regular publications.

Many books and publication continued to use the illustrators, even after printed matter began to incorporate photography.  It would be many years before the colour printing would equal the illustrators plates.  The accuracy and craft of the illustrators had developed in tandem with the botanists concerned, the work came to be accepted as important to the botanists and their institutions. The illustrated publication, [[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]] (1787), was to eventually appoint an official artist. The 230-year-old magazine, long associated with the [[Linnaean Society]] and [[Kew Gardens]], is now primarily one of finer botanical illustration. A stream of the finest illustrators to appear in print have been featured in the magazine.

The contribution of botanical illustrators continues to be praised and sought, very fine examples continue to be produced. In the 1980s, [[Celia Rosser]] undertook to illustrate every ''Banksia'' species for the masterwork, ''[[The Banksias]]''. When another species was described after its publication, ''[[Banksia rosserae]]'', it was named to honour her mammoth accomplishment. Other illustrators, such as the profuse illustrator [[Matilda Smith]], have been specifically honoured for this work. In 1972 the [[Smithsonian Institution]] hired its first botanical illustrator, [[Alice Tangerini]].&lt;ref name="Tangerini3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalcommunitynews.com/content/botanical-illustrator-alice-tangerini|title=Botanical Illustrator Alice Tangerini|last=Corson|first=Cheryl|date=March 9, 2017|publisher=Capital Community News Inc.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=[[Hill Rag]]|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chapbook''' is a type of [[popular literature]] printed in [[early modern Europe]]. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]].

The tradition of chapbooks arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tale]]s, ballads, [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tract]]s.

The term "chapbook" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are ''[[bibliothèque bleue]]'' (blue book) and ''Volksbuch'' (people's book), respectively. In Spain they were known as ''[[Cordel_literature|pliegos de cordel]]'' (Cordel sheets).&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[chapmen]]'', chap, a variety of [[peddler]], which folks circulated such literature as part of their stock.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Magaret Spufford|Spufford, Margaret]] |date=1984|title= The Great Reclothing of Rural England|publisher= Hambledon Press|location= London|isbn= 0-907628-47-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Leitch, R. |date=1990|title='Here Chapman Billies Take Their Stand': A Pilot Study of Scottish Chapmen, Packmen and Pedlars|work=Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquarians 120|pages= 173–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chapbook" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.&lt;ref name=mit.edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapbooks: Definition and Origins|url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.418/www/nhausman/chap1.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Chapbook'' is first attested in English in 1824, and seems to derive from the word for the itinerant salesmen who would sell such books: ''[[chapmen|chapman]]''. The first element of ''chapman'' comes in turn from Old English ''cēap'' ('barter, business, dealing').&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.vv. ''chap-book, n.'' and ''chapman, n.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fairies dancing in a ring woodcut.png|thumb|Woodcut of a [[fairy-circle]] from a 17th-century chapbook]]
[[Broadside ballads]] were popular songs, sold for a [[penny]] or [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] in the streets of towns and villages around Britain between the 16th century and early 20th centuries. They preceded chapbooks, but had similar content, marketing and distribution systems. There are records from [[Cambridgeshire]] as early as in 1553 of a man offering a scurrilous ballad ''"maistres mass"'' at an alehouse, and a pedlar selling ''"lytle books"'' to people, including a patcher of old clothes in 1578. These sales are probably characteristic of the market for chapbooks.

Chapbooks gradually disappeared from the mid-19th century in the face of competition from cheap newspapers and, especially in Scotland, religious tract societies that regarded them as "ungodly." Although the form originated in Britain, many were made in the U.S. during the same period.

Because of their flimsy nature such [[ephemera]] rarely survive as individual items. They were aimed at buyers without formal libraries, and, in an era when paper was expensive, were used for wrapping or baking. Paper has also always had hygienic uses; there are contemporary references to the use of chapbooks as [[toilet paper|''bum fodder'']]. Many of the surviving chapbooks come from the collections of [[Samuel Pepys]] between 1661 and 1688 which are now held at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]], [[Cambridge]].  [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] also collected 65 chapbooks, (including 20 from before 1660), which are now at The [[Bodleian Library]]. There are also significant Scottish collections, such as those held by the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = University of Glasgow: Scottish Chapbooks|url = http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/chapbooks/search/|website = special.lib.gla.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern collectors, such as [[Peter Opie]], have chiefly a scholarly interest in the form.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Production and distribution==
Chapbooks were cheap, anonymous publications that were the usual reading material for lower-class people who could not afford books. Members of the upper classes occasionally owned chapbooks, perhaps bound in leather with a personal monogram. Printers typically tailored their texts for the popular market. Chapbooks were usually between four and twenty-four pages long, and produced on rough paper with crude, frequently recycled, woodcut illustrations. They sold in the millions.

After 1696 English chapbook peddlers had to be licensed, and 2,500 of them were then authorized, 500 in London alone. In France, there were 3,500 licensed ''[[Colportage|colporteurs]]'' by 1848, and they sold 40 million books annually.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA. Getty Publications. (pp.121-122).&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre of chapbook and ballad production was [[London]], and until the [[Great Fire of London]] the printers were based around [[London Bridge]]. However, a feature of chapbooks is the proliferation of provincial printers, especially in [[Scotland]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].&lt;ref&gt;See the "Introduction" ''in'' Simons, John  (1998) ''Guy of Warwick and other Chapbook Romances'' University of Exeter Press, Exeter, England, {{ISBN|0-85989-445-2}}, for issues of definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Chapbook Jack the Giant Killer.jpg|thumbnail|left|The chapbook, ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'']]
Chapbooks were an important medium for the dissemination of popular culture to the common people, especially in rural areas. They were a medium of entertainment, information and (generally unreliable) history. In general, the content of chapbooks has been criticized, though, for their unsophisticated narratives which were heavily loaded with repetition and emphasized adventure through mostly anecdotal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoeveler|first=D.L.|title=Gothic Chapbooks and the Urban Reader|journal=Wordsworth Circle|year=2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=155–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are nonetheless valued as a record of popular culture, preserving cultural artifacts that may not survive in any other form.

Chapbooks were priced for sales to workers, although their market was not limited to the working classes. Broadside ballads were sold for a [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], or a few [[pence]]. Prices of chapbooks were from 2d. to 6d., when agricultural labourers wages were 12d. per day. The literacy rate in England in the 1640s was around 30 percent for males and rose to 60 percent in the mid-18th century (see [[Education in the Age of Enlightenment]]). Many working people were readers, if not writers, and pre-industrial working patterns provided periods during which they could read. Chapbooks were undoubtedly used for reading to family groups or groups in alehouses.

They even contributed to the development of literacy. The author and publisher [[Francis Kirkman]] wrote about how they fired his imagination and his love of books. There is other evidence of their use by [[Autodidacticism|autodidacts]].

Nevertheless, the numbers printed are astonishing. In the 1660s as many as 400,000 [[almanac]]s were printed annually, enough for one family in three in England. One 17th-century publisher of chapbooks in London had in stock one book for every 15 families in the country. In the 1520s the [[Oxford]] bookseller, John Dorne, noted in his day-book selling up to 190 [[ballads]] a day at a halfpenny each. The probate inventory of the stock of Charles Tias, of ''The sign of the Three Bibles'' on London Bridge, in 1664 included books and printed sheets to make c.90,000 chapbooks (inc. 400 reams of paper) and 37,500 ballad sheets. Tias was not regarded as an outstanding figure in the trade. The inventory of Josiah Blare, of ''The Sign of the Looking Glass'' on London Bridge, in 1707 listed 31,000 books, plus 257 reams of printed sheets. A conservative estimate of their sales in Scotland alone in the second half of the 18th century was over 200,000 per year.

These printers provided chapbooks to [[chapmen]] on credit, who carried them around the country, selling from door to door, at markets and fairs, and returning to pay for the stock they sold. This facilitated wide distribution and large sales with minimum outlay, and also provided the printers with feedback about what titles were most popular. Popular works were reprinted, pirated, edited, and produced in different editions. [[Francis Kirkman]], whose eye was always on the market, wrote two [[sequels]] to the popular ''Don Bellianus of Greece'', first printed in 1598.

Publishers also issued catalogues, and chapbooks are found in the libraries of provincial [[yeomen]] and [[gentry]].  John Whiting, a Quaker yeoman imprisoned at [[Ilchester]], [[Somerset]], in the 1680s had books sent by carrier from London, and left for him at an inn.

Pepys had a collection of ballads bound into volumes, under the following classifications, into which could fit the subject matter of most chapbooks: 
# Devotion and Morality
# History – true and fabulous
# Tragedy: viz. Murders, executions, and judgments of God
# State and Times
# Love – pleasant
# Ditto – unpleasant
# Marriage, Cuckoldry, &amp;c.
# Sea – love, gallantry &amp; actions
# Drinking and good fellowship
# Humour, frollicks and mixt.

The stories in many of the popular chapbooks can be traced back to much earlier origins. ''Bevis of Hampton'' was an Anglo-Norman romance of the 13th century, which probably drew on earlier themes. The structure of ''[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Sages of Rome]]'' was from the orient, and was used by [[Chaucer]]. Many jests about ignorant and greedy clergy in chapbooks were taken from ''The Friar and the Boy'' printed about 1500 by [[Wynkyn de Worde]], and ''The Sackfull of News'' (1557).

Historical stories set in a mythical and fantastical past were popular. The selection is interesting. [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], and [[Oliver Cromwell]] do not appear as historical figures in the Pepys collection, and [[Elizabeth I]] only once. [[The Wars of the Roses]] and the [[English Civil War]] do not appear at all. [[Henry VIII]] and [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] appear in disguise, standing up for the right with cobblers and millers and then inviting them to Court and rewarding them. There was a pattern of high born heroes overcoming reduced circumstances by valour, such as [[St George]], [[Guy of Warwick]], [[Robin Hood]] (who at this stage has yet to give to the poor what he was stealing from the rich), and heroes of low birth who achieve status through force of arms, such as Clim of Clough, and William of Cloudesley. Clergy often appear as figures of fun, and stupid countrymen were also popular (e.g., ''[[The Wise Men of Gotham]]''). Other works were aimed at regional and rural audience (e.g., ''The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse'').

From 1597 works appeared aimed at specific trades, such as [[cloth merchant|clothier]]s, [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] and [[shoemakers]]. The latter were commonly literate. Thomas Deloney, a weaver, wrote ''Thomas of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]'', about six clothiers from [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Gloucester]], [[Worcester]], [[Exeter]], [[Salisbury]] and [[Southampton]], travelling together and meeting at [[Basingstoke]] their fellows from [[Kendal]], [[Manchester]] and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. In his, ''Jack of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]'', 1600, set in [[Henry VIII]]'s time, an apprentice to a [[broadcloth]] weaver takes over his business and marries his widow on his death. On achieving success, he is liberal to the poor and refuses a knighthood for his substantial services to the king.

Other examples from the Pepys collection include ''The Countryman's Counsellor, or Everyman his own Lawyer'', and ''Sports and Pastimes'', written for schoolboys, including magic tricks, like how to "fetch a shilling out of a handkerchief", write invisibly, make roses out of paper, snare wild duck, and make a maid-servant fart uncontrollably.

The provinces and Scotland had their own local heroes. [[Robert Burns]] commented that one of the first two books he read in private was "the history of Sir [[William Wallace]] ... poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest".

==Influence==
They had a wide and continuing influence. Eighty percent of English [[folk songs]] collected by early-20th-century collectors have been linked to printed broadsides, including over 90 of which could only be derived from those printed before 1700. It has been suggested the majority of surviving ballads can be traced to 1550–1600 by internal evidence.

One of the most popular and influential chapbooks was Richard Johnson's ''Seven Champions of Christendom'' (1596), believed to be the source for the introduction of the character [[St George]] into English [[folk play]]s.

[[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s novel ''Dorastus and Fawnia'' (originally ''Pandosto'') (1588), the basis of Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', was still being published in cheap editions in the 1680s. Some stories were still being published in the 19th century, (e.g., ''Jack of Newbury'', ''Friar Bacon'', ''Dr Faustus'' and ''[[The Seven Champions of Christendom]]'').

==Modern chapbooks==
[[File:Chapbook.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A modern-day chapbook]]
''Chapbook'' is also a term currently used to denote publications of up to about 40 pages, usually [[poetry]] bound with some form of [[saddle stitch]], though many are [[perfect bound]], folded, or wrapped. These publications range from low-cost productions to finely produced, hand-made editions that may sell to collectors for hundreds of dollars. More recently, the popularity of fiction and nonfiction chapbooks has also increased. In the UK they are more often referred to as [[pamphlets]].

The genre has been revitalized in the past 40 years by the widespread availability of first [[mimeograph]] technology, then low-cost copy centers and digital printing, and by the cultural revolutions spurred by both [[zines]] and [[poetry slam]]s, the latter generating hundreds upon hundreds of self-published chapbooks that are used to fund tours. In New York, a joint effort of the Center for the Humanities at the Graduate Center, CUNY and their sponsors has come up with the NYC/CUNY Chapbook festival where, as it states in their about page, “The NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival celebrates the chapbook as a work of art, and as a medium for alternative and emerging writers and publishers… the festival features a day-long bookfair with chapbook publishers from around the country, workshops, panels, a chapbook exhibition, and a reading of prize-winning Chapbook Fellows.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival|url=http://chapbookfestival.org|access-date=2018-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917155034/http://chapbookfestival.org/#|archive-date=2017-09-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the recent popularity of blogs, online literary journals, and other online publishers, short collections of poetry published online are frequently referred to as "online chapbooks", "electronic chapbooks", "e-chapbooks", or "e-chaps".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[Stephen King]] wrote a few parts of an early draft of ''[[The Plant]]'' and sent them out as chapbooks to his friends, instead of [[Christmas card]]s, in 1982, 1983, and 1985. [[Philtrum Press]] produced just three installments before the story was shelved, and the original editions have been hotly sought-after collector's items.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Origins==
According to Jenny Holland and Jane Harris, "Circles started in 1979, partly as a response to an [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] exhibition on [[experimental film]]. Feeling that their work on women's involvement in this field was being marginalised, the women on the exhibition committee withdrew their painstakingly researched work and issued an explanatory statement. In many ways, this research was the cornerstone of Circles, which went on to distribute the films by [[Alice Guy]], [[Germaine Dulac]], [[Maya Deren]], and [[Lois Weber]] which were to have been discussed in the exhibition."&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite book|title=The women's Companion to international film|isbn=0-520-08879-4|editor-last =Kuhn 
 | editor-first =Annette 
 | editor2-last =Radstone
 | editor2-first =Susannah | first = Jenny
 | last = Holland
 |first2 = Jane
|last2= Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, "Women and the Formal Film," was published in the "Film as Film" exhibition catalogue and acted as a manifesto for the distribution collective that emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first3=Jane|author1=Annabel Nicolson|author2=Felicity Sparrow|author3=Jane Clarke|author4=Jeanette Iljon|author5=Lis Rhodes|author6=Mary Pat Leece|author7=Pat Murphy|author8=Susan Stein|authorlink1=Women and the Formal Film|editor1-last=Drummond|editor1-first=Phil|title=Film as Film|date=1979|publisher=Arts Council of Great Britain|location=London|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film Catalogue==
By the time of its closure, Circles' catalogue comprised over 200 titles, predominantly short and medium-length films, encompasses 90 years of women's film production and including a range of original formats, "offering tape recording, video tapes, slide/tape and performance works for hire alongside film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxonline.org.uk/histories/1970-1979/circles.html|title=''Circles'' formed to distribute women artists' film and video. |date=1979 |website=www.luxonline.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalogue editors described the films and their significance as: &lt;blockquote&gt;representing the visions, truths and ideas of women from a diverse range of cultural and political backgrounds. Each film/video breaks the monopoly of the male-defined culture, placing women at the centre of the images, the stories and the language; replacing male subjectivity with women's experiences as female eyes look through the camera.… These films and videos represent the voices of women who have been systematically silenced and abused, by a mainstream media and cinema, whose interest in ideas and people are based on commercial concerns of profit and the desire to maintain women as spectators. Women in refusing to be confined to this role have produced films and videos, often with low budgets or none at all; often under difficult personal circumstances, yet independently without the pressure to either compromise politically or aesthetically. Despite narrow ideas of content, form and 'entertainment', which have excluded and dismissed this body of work, women are producing films and videos on a larger scale than ever before and the demand for this material is increasing.&lt;ref name=catalogue&gt;{{cite book|title=CiRCleS: Womens Film + Video Distribution Catalogue|date=1987|publisher=Russel Press|editor-last =Holland | editor-first =Jenny | editor2-last =Harris | editor2-first =Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Circles was a membership organisation. "All women whose films Circles distribute automatically become members, which means they have the right to become involved in creating policy."&lt;ref name="Distribution Matters: Circles"/&gt; The selection of titles was carried out by a regular Viewing Committee, composed of an open panel with wide representation from women's groups involved in production and exhibition. [[Pratibha Parmar]] notes that, in 1987, this led to the foregrounding of films by women of colour, quoting Circles member June Givanni on the creation of the short films programme 'Black Women and Invisibility': "invisibility here is about the lack of recognition by the wider community, and to some extent the black community that there are black women film-makers working in Britain. The range of films and videos made by black women available in this country is growing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merz|first1=Caroline|last2=Parmar|first2=Pratibha|title=Distribution Matters: Circles|journal=Screen|date=1 December 1987|volume=28|issue=4|page=68|doi=10.1093/screen/28.4.66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
According to the catalogue, Circles organised women-only screenings at the Four Corners 50 seater cinema in [[Bethnal Green]], London, and also in association with other women's organisations across Britain. At these events, film/video producers were invited to talk about their work.&lt;ref name="catalogue"/&gt; Describing Circles' business model, Caroline Merz writes that "Circles [had a] commitment to returning the highest possible revenue to film-makers, many of whom are not waged for their work, and a refusal to undercut their rental prices by providing what would, in effect, be subsidised programming."&lt;ref name="Distribution Matters: Circles"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Many Circles titles continue to circulate in the UK via [http://www.cinenova.org/browse.php Cinenova], and Circles' content and history were prominent in the 2011 Cinenova exhibition "Reproductive Labour" at London's The Showroom gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=George|title=Cinenova: Reproductive Labour|journal=Afterall [online]|date=June 8, 2011|url=http://www.afterall.org/online/cinenova}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Holland and Harris comment that: "Circles has had an impact far out of proportion to its small size and chronic financial insecurity." &lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt;

'''''Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth – Rising Tide''''', is an official [[expansion pack]] for the [[turn-based strategy]] video game ''[[Civilization: Beyond Earth]]''. It was released on October 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/05/18/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide-emerges-from-the-deep.aspx?|title=Civilization: Beyond Earth – Rising Tide Emerges From The Deep|first=Daniel|last=Tack|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==
In the aftermath of the first wave of colonies, the people of Earth continue to struggle for existence. New factions have arisen and have launched a new wave of colonies off planet.&lt;ref name="Main Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.com/en/games/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide/|website=Civilization Beyond Earth- Rising Tide|publisher=Firaxis Games|accessdate=21 October 2015|title=Firaxis Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Rising Tide'' brings new features including expanded water gameplay (which includes floating cities), hybrid affinities, a completely revamped [[diplomacy]] system, and an expanded exploration system.

The expansion adds several new dimensions to aquatic gameplay. Unlike land based cities, or even ocean cities in previous iterations of the game, aquatic based cities can move. Movement, rather than culture, is the way aquatic cities expand their borders.&lt;ref name="The Verge"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick|first1=Rich|title=Alien Oceans are Familiar Territory For Civilization: Beyond Earth's First Expansion|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/16/9549127/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide-review|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=The Verge|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic cities produce less unhealth, produce more energy and culture, and can create naval units much faster than land based cities. However, they are much harder to defend, and are less efficient at producing land and air units as land based cities would. On top of these differences several wonders and buildings are exclusive to either land or aquatic cities. Workers in ''RT'' can build farms on aquatic tiles, and they have an expanded number of aquatic tile types they can improve. When viewing at ocean tiles, water is transparent rather than blue allowing players to see the ocean floor.  This graphical enhancement allows for players to see resources under the ocean.

Hybrid affinities add another twist to the Beyond Earth experience.&lt;ref name="GameAgent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Looney|first1=Russ|title=Rising Tide’s Hybrid Units Look Awesome|url=http://blog.gameagent.com/rising-tides-hybrid-units-look-awesome/|website=The GameAgent Blog|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original game, players are encouraged to earn points toward one of the affinities supremacy, harmony, or purity. The game favored choosing one affinity to level up while ignoring the other two.  In ''Rising Tide'', players are encouraged to level up all their affinities at the same time. Several new units of the game can only be built if the player has points from multiple affinities.

While the base ''Beyond Earth'' game used a diplomatic system derived straight from ''Civilization V'', diplomacy in ''Rising Tide'' is described as "completely rebuilt from scratch". Players can earn a new type of currency, diplomatic capital. Factions can earn this capital with certain buildings and wonders, and they can earn it trading with other factions.  Each faction can use this capital to buy personality trait bonuses. Diplomatic capital can also be used to build new units and buildings but it can not be used to buy new tiles. The AI has a respect and fear factor. Players who the AI deems high in respect or fear may enter more beneficial relationships. Players with low fear or respect ratings are more likely to go to war. When entering a war, players now earn a war score. When entering peace negotiations, the higher the war score a player earns, the more concessions a player may get from the losing faction.&lt;ref name="RPS2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meer|first1=Alec|title=iv BE Rising Tide Patch Makes Peace Less Ridiculous|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/30/beyond-earth-rising-tide-diplomacy-fix/|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration has an expanded role in ''Rising Tide''. Players can find three types of artifacts: Old World Relics, Alien Biology Artifacts, and Progenitor Artifacts. When a player receives an artifact they may cash in these artifacts early for quick bonuses, or they can combine different artifacts to unlock different wonders, buildings or unit bonuses. Players may also discover Planetary Marvels. When a Marvel is discovered a planetwide quest is unlocked, which when completed provides many bonuses. Each biome has a different marvel.&lt;ref name="RPS1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meer|first1=Alec|title=Wot I Think – Civilization: Beyond Earth – Rising Tide|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/08/beyond-earth-rising-tide-review/|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of these changes to exploration, explorers can perform expeditions on water tiles. Players can now leash Aliens using explorers allowing players to capture armies of aliens to fight for them.

''Rising Tide'' adds two new biomes: frigid, an ice world, and primordial, a geologically active world.&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt; Aliens have different color patterns in each biome and will behave differently depending on what biome they are in. For example, aliens in a frigid biome tend to be fewer in number but stronger while those in a lush biome would be larger in number yet weaker.

Four new sponsors have also been added: Chungsu, Al Falah, the North Sea Alliance, and INTEGR.&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt; Chungsu comes from the [[Korean Peninsula]]. This faction excels at [[espionage]] and can build its founding city on water tiles. Al Falah comes from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. Unlike the rest of the colonists, Al Falah colonists lived in [[Generation ship|generational ships]] rather than being [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] frozen on [[sleeper ship]]s. The colonists from this faction have never seen Earth, and its culture has evolved as such. This faction gets bonuses in City development. The North Sea Alliance comes from the [[British Isles]] and the [[Nordic countries|Nordic region]]. This faction gets bonuses in water tiles, and can build its founding city on water tiles. INTEGR comes from [[Germany]]. It gains bonuses in the new diplomacy system. The ''Beyond Earth'' spinoff game, ''[[Sid Meier's Starships]]'' does not include the new sponsors introduced in ''Rising Tide''.

==Development==
The development of ''Rising Tide'' was announced on May 18, 2015.&lt;ref name="PCG Announcement"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Phil|title=Civilization: Beyond Earth – Rising Tide expansion announced|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide-expansion-announced/|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=PC Gamer|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on October 9, 2015.  Several new features have been added post launch.  A spoils of war system has been added to allow victors in war to pick what they want from the defeated foes.  A black market has been added to allow players to buy or sell resources for diplomatic capital.  The AI is much more aggressive toward players close to the completion of wonders or to victory.&lt;ref name="RTNovpatch"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wonder War and Chungsu’s New Colors: Changes to Beyond Earth: Rising Tide|url=http://franchise.civilization.com/en/news/2015-11-the-wonder-war-and-chungsus-new-colors-upcoming-changes-to-beyond-earth-rising-tide/|website=franchise.civilization.com|publisher=Firaxis|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coleridge's notebooks''', of which seventy-two have survived, contain a huge assortment of memoranda set down by the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] from 1794 until shortly before his death in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cheshire |first1=Paul |editor1-first=Frederick |editor1-last=Burwick |title=The Oxford Handbook of Samuel Taylor Coleridge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8cLTvMdO7YC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=%22What+were+Coleridge's%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=18 November 2012 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199229536 |pages=289–290 |chapter=Coleridge's ''Notebooks'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleridge's biographer [[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]] summarised the range of material covered as "travels, reading, dreams, nature studies, self-confession and self-analysis, philosophical theories, friendships, sexual fantasies, lecture notes, observations of his children, literary schemes, brewing recipes, opium addiction, horrors, puns, prayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Richard |title=Coleridge: Early Visions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2q7gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22travels+reading+dreams%22&amp;dq=%22travels+reading+dreams%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=18 November 2012 |year=1990 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0140124403 |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this vast storehouse of material found its way into Coleridge's published works, and it is also believed to have directly influenced [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]'s poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lowes |first1=John Livingston |authorlink1=John Livingston Lowes |title=The Road to Xanadu: A Study in the Ways of the Imagination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhDxS2qL8mcC&amp;q=%22lodgement+later%22&amp;dq=%22lodgement+later%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=19 November 2012 |year=1978 |origyear=1927 |publisher=Pan |location=London |isbn=0330252704 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Duncan |authorlink1=Duncan Wu |title=Wordsworth's Reading 1800–1815 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOns6RdSSa8C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22provides+the+poem's+germ%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=19 November 2012 |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521496748 |pages=56–57, 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notebooks have been described as "unique in the annals of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] autobiography", and as "perhaps the unacknowledged prose masterpiece of the age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Richard |title=Coleridge: Early Visions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2q7gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22annals+of+romantic+autobiography%22&amp;dq=%22annals+of+romantic+autobiography%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=18 November 2012 |year=1990 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0140124403 |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Seamus |editor1-last=Perry |title=Coleridge's Notebooks: A Selection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aL-BSkk5uZIC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22unacknowledged+prose%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=19 November 2012 |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0198712014 |page=vii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==

Coleridge originally had no intention of making his notebooks public, but in his later years he came to think of them as a legacy to be passed down to his disciples. He even allowed his friend [[Robert Southey]] to use a number of extracts in their collaborative work ''Omniana'', published in 1812 and reprinted in an expanded form in 1836. In 1895 the poet's grandson [[Ernest Hartley Coleridge]] released a larger selection under the title ''Anima Poetæ'', and the following year the scholar Alois Brandl published in Germany an edition of the first notebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cheshire |first1=Paul |editor1-first=Frederick |editor1-last=Burwick |title=The Oxford Handbook of Samuel Taylor Coleridge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8cLTvMdO7YC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%22developing+into+a+legacy%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 November 2012 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199229536 |pages=292, 296 |chapter=Coleridge's ''Notebooks'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Southey |first1=Robert |last2=Coleridge |first2=S.

Coburn began work on this in the 1930s; the first volume appeared in 1957, and the fifth and final one (completed by Anthony John Harding) in 2002, 11 years after her death.

'''''El Rio de Luz''''' (Spanish for '''''The River of Light'''''; also known as '''''Morning in the Tropics''''') is an 1877 oil painting by American landscape artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. It is his last large-scale painting of South America, following pieces such as ''[[The Andes of Ecuador]]'' (1855) and ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859). Like them, the painting is a composite of the many sketches and drawings Church made while traveling in South America twenty years earlier. 

The work differs in important ways from Church's earlier, monumental South American canvases. While a high degree of realism and attention to detail remains, the landscape in ''The River of Light'' is more local; it no longer attempts to capture numerous topographies or climate zones in one image. As a result, the composition is more intimate than other South American works. The National Gallery of Art notes that "the tightly focused realism, the overall tonal harmony and restrained coloration, and the compositional unity all lend a remarkable cohesiveness to the work". The vantage point is no longer high and detached, but seemingly low enough that a viewer might stand there. Details include a canoeist, a flock of birds over the river and two others (possibly the [[amethyst woodstar]] hummingbird&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 67&lt;/ref&gt;) perched close to the viewer, and a hut on the right bank. 

Church's once-stellar reception by the 1870s had diminished, though he was still prominent; his work was often criticized for an excess of detail and a sense of melodrama. In 1880 art critic [[William Crary Brownell]] called it "a magnificent drop-curtain. A drop-curtain may be the work of incontestable genius; it may have a  thousand merits; ... it is simply not painting."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Church scholar David C. Huntington offered interpretive reminders of the symbolism of Church's art for its 19th-century American audience, who were Christians optimistic about the future of their young country (though the Civil War, a decade past, tempered these feelings):

{{quote|''Morning in the Tropics'' is the mystical re-creation and resurrection of earth and man. A fallen Adam and a suffering world are forgotten. This is the second dawn of human consciousness and the second coming of the cosmic savior: an Easter-Genesis on the Amazon. You, remade, redeemed, twice-born spectator, are the first new man to fix his eyes on that beatiful untouched and unnamed plant. You, self-made New World man, are to be its namer. You, American, are the New Adam. ''Morning in the Tropics'' was Church's last and perhaps his greatest psychic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, 106&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As in ''[[The Andes of Ecuador]]'', the sunlight forms a subtle cross. Huntington finds in the painting the influence of [[Gustave Doré]]'s [[:commons:Category:Illustrations of Paradise Lost by Gustave Doré|prints]] for ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', of engravings after [[J. M. W. Turner]] such as ''Bacchus and Ariadne'', and illustrated books on the tropics, such as those by Paul Marcoy.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, 105-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and provenance==

The painting was exhibited in New York in 1877 at the Century Association (called ''A Tropical Morning''), and in 1878 at ''[[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]]''.

[[William Earl Dodge, Jr.]] (1832–1903) was the first owner of the work and passed it to his descendants, who reported that the painting had once been called ''The Amazon''. In 1965, it was given to the [[Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island]], and purchased in December 1965 by the [[National Gallery of Art]]. The painting was restored in 1988.

The '''English Short Title Catalogue''' ('''ESTC''') is a [[Union catalog|union]] [[short-title catalogue]] of works published between 1473 and 1800, in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and its former colonies, notably those in North America, and primarily in [[English language|English]], drawing on the collections of the [[British Library]] and other libraries in Britain and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://estc.ucr.edu/ | title = English Short-Title Catalog (1473-1800) North America | work = University of California | accessdate = 2007-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-managed by the British Library and the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research (CBSR) at the [[University of California, Riverside]]. The database is freely searchable.

==History==
The ESTC began life as the '''Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue''', with the same abbreviation, covering only 1701 to 1800. Earlier printed works had been catalogued in [[Alfred W. Pollard|A. W. Pollard]] and [[Gilbert Richard Redgrave|G. R. Redgrave]]'s ''Short Title Catalogue'' (1st edn 1926; 2nd edn, 1976–91) for the period 1473 to 1640; and [[Donald Goddard Wing]]'s similarly titled bibliography (1945–51, with later supplements and addenda) for the period 1641 to 1700. These works were eventually incorporated into the database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15822">'''Everyday Aesthetics''' is a recent subfield of philosophical [[aesthetics]] focusing on everyday events, settings and activities in which the faculty of [[sensibility]] is saliently at stake. [[Alexander Baumgarten]] established Aesthetics as a discipline and defined it as ''scientia cognitionis sensitivae'', the science of sensory knowledge, in his foundational work ''Aesthetica'' (1750).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/aestheticascrip00baumgoog&lt;/ref&gt; This field has been dedicated since then to the clarification of [[fine arts]], [[beauty]] and [[taste]] only marginally referring to the aesthetics in [[design]], [[crafts]], urban environments and social practice until the emergence of everyday aesthetics during the ‘90s. As other subfields like environmental aesthetics or the [[aesthetics of nature]], everyday aesthetics also attempts to countervail aesthetics' almost exclusive focus on the philosophy of art.

== Grounding aesthetics in experience ==

Aesthetic inquiry on everyday life owes much of its approach to [[John Dewey]]’s (1934) pragmatist aesthetics, even if he was interested in grounding mainly artistic experience. Dewey pointed at a variety of circumstances in which sensibility is present emphasizing the importance of feeling, energy, and rhythm in every creature’s intercourse with its environment. He thus stressed not only the artistic but the everyday doings and undergoings that involve alertness and intensity of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John ''Art as Experience'' (New York: Perigee,1934)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey explored aesthetics from the subjects' experience rather than from objects' status as artworks and museum collections. This turn would allow overcoming object-centric approaches to aesthetics that hindered any consideration of the aesthetic beyond artistic and beautiful things justifiable by intrinsic qualities categorized as aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Updating Dewey’s pragmatism, [[Richard Shusterman]] validates aesthetic experience and emphasizes the role of the body in what he defines as ''soma-aesthetics'' also related to everyday life. C.F. Shusterman, Richard ''Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics'' ( Cambridge University Press 2008). See also Shusterman, Richard. 1992. ''Pragmatist Aesthetics: Living Beauty, Rethinking Art''. Cambridge: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social dimension of everyday aesthetics ==

The neglect of aesthetic theory to consider the role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by [[Katya Mandoki]] who in 1994 coined the word '''''Prosaics'''''&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Prosaica; introducción a la estética de lo cotidiano'' (México: Grijalbo, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing a distinction from [[Aristotle]]’s '''''Poetics'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Poetics (Aristotle)]]&lt;/ref&gt; focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ''Estética cotidiana y juegos de la cultura: Prosaica I'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006,  ''Prácticas estéticas e identidades sociales: Prosaica II'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006), ''La construcción estética del Estado y de la identidad nacional: Prosaica III'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2007), ''Estética y comunicación; de acción, pasión y seducción'' (Bogotá: Norma, 2007), “Quotidian Aesthetics” ''New Perspectives in Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art. Annales d’ esthétique''. Volume 42/2003-2004. Athens: Panayotis and Effie Michelis Foundation. Pp. 103-110. ISSN 1105-0462. "L'esthétique du quotidien"  ''Diogène'' 2011/1-2 (n° 233-234). [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/ca/7523862.0008.004?rgn=main;view=fulltext]
&lt;/ref&gt; consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to the whole range of sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and props, intonation and styles of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.

== Political dimension, violence and negativity in everyday aesthetics ==

An approach to everyday aesthetics involves both the positive and negative, the enriching and the toxic effects operating on sensibility. Joseph H. Kupfer brought to the attention of aesthetic inquiry the importance of focusing on the effects of violence and ultraviolence in modern society. Kupfer makes explicit the aesthetic ground of violence in society and emphasizes destruction as an aesthetic process producing vivid sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Kupfer Joseph H., ''Experience as Art: Aesthetics in Everyday Life'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He highlighted also the need of incorporating aesthetics to education not only by means of teaching art but aesthetically, i.e. in the manner itself of educating through the rhythm, organization of subject matter, and method of presentation to engage students with the content of study.  Mandoki points at the negative use of aesthetics for manipulating emotions in the political sphere and refers to Nazi propaganda as a case in point that exemplifies the deliberate use of aesthetics for exerting violence.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, "Terror and Aesthetics: Nazi Strategies for Mass Organisation," in Fascism: Critical Concepts in Political Science, vol. III, Fascism and Culture, Part 7: Fascism as the Negation or Revolution of Culture, ed. Roger Griffin (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 21-38.return to text&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of aesthetics for political agendas, specifically in the legitimation of the nation-state is dealt by this author.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, ''La construcción estética del estado y de la identidad nacional''. (Mexico: Siglo veintiuno editores, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Berleant]] has stressed the negative aspect of everyday aesthetics pointing at the importance of the aesthetic impact of terrorism as well as the use of aesthetics in the political sphere. Berleant brings up other extreme situations that provoke perceptual injury or damage as contemporary urban overcrowding and visual over stimulation, space pollution, claustrophobic and oppressive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold ''Sensibility and Sense; The aesthetic transformation of the human world'' ( Imprint Academic 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant, aesthetics implies active, intense aesthetic engagement and is thus involved in both positive and negative effects of everyday contemporary urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold. 1991. Art and Engagement. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant aesthetics of the environment has been a sustained object of research for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Berleant The Aesthetics of Environment (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992. Paperback edition, 1994). Greek trans., (Athens: Michelis Institute, 2004). Chinese trans. (Hunan Publishing Group, 2006). {{ISBN|978-1-56639-084-2}}.

Arnold Berleant ''Living in the Landscape: Toward an Aesthetics of Environment'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1970, he has insisted on the importance of aesthetics as a field of experience and active engagement in which our quality of life depends.&lt;ref&gt;The Aesthetic Field: A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience (Springfield, Ill.: C. C. Thomas 1970). 2nd edition (Cybereditions 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-877275-25-8}}, Arnold Berleant ''Art and Engagement'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1991.

== Beauty in daily life, environmental aesthetics and artification ==
[[Yi-Fu Tuan]] proposed that we should apply the traditional aesthetic categories of beauty, contemplation, disinterestedness, and distancing in valuing daily life through different non artistic objects and locations.[http://www.yifutuan.org/]&lt;ref&gt;Tuan Yi–Fu ''Passing Strange and Wonderful; Aesthetics, Nature and Culture'' (New York, Tokyo, London: Kodansha 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1974 he insisted on the need of paying due attention to the environment as object of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan,Yi–Fu. ''Topophilia; A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes and Values''(Englewood Cliff, N.J.: Prentice Hall 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  Along this line Crispin Sartwell also proposed in 1995 applying aesthetics to life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell, Crispin ''The Art of Living: Aesthetics of the Ordinary in World Spiritual Traditions''. (Albany: State University of New York Press 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Yuriko Saito, an environmentalist aesthetician specializing in Japanese aesthetics, argues for paying attention to weather as worthy of aesthetic appreciation and for making moral and aesthetic judgments on everyday artifacts, landscapes, lawns, and neighborhood eyesores&lt;ref&gt;[[Eyesore]]&lt;/ref&gt; that are conflicting with the harmony of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, Yuriko. 2008. ''Everyday Aesthetics''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Saito advocates a self-critical artification of everyday life and warns about the risks of artificating business.[http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=640] Paulina Rautio has performed qualitative analysis by interviews and epistolary exchange with women in regards to their experience of beauty through non artistic items and their contexts such as hanging laundry in Lapland where the opportunity of drying clothes under the sun is rare.&lt;ref&gt;Rautio, Pauliina, Rautio, P. (2010). Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives. ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', Vol 44, No4, Rautio, P. (2009). On hanging laundry. The place of beauty in managing everyday life. Contemporary Aesthetics, Vol 7, No9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common interest in this approach for understanding aesthetics as a theory of art and beauty following traditional categories and at the same time attempting to go beyond conventional borders of art by artificating the non art and extending its scope to everyday objects, environments and to living itself. That is the case of Horacio Pérez-Henao who tries to interpret literature under the scope of everyday aesthetics by pointing out how fictional characters experience aesthetics into their daily lives &lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Henao, Horacio. “Estética cotidiana y ficción: el clima como elemento
de significación en la novela Pequod de Vitor Ramil”. Anclajes XX. 1 (enero-abril
2016): 20-34.

== Sports and food as art ==

Every work of art has, since the Renaissance, tried to expand themes worthy of artistic expression and concepts of artistic value to include new subject matters, techniques and styles in painting and sculpture, new harmonies, consonances or dissonances in music, new attitudes, gestures, and different genres and requirements of quality. However the initiative of applying the concept of art literally to non artistic activities within a theoretical framework related to everyday aesthetics came from philosophers like David Best, Wolfgang Welsch and Lev Kreft proposing to consider sports as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;Best, David. 1988. “The Aesthetic in Sport,” in ''Philosophic Inquiry in Sport'', ed. William J. Morgan and Klaus V. Meier. Champaign: Human Kinetics Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsch, Wolfgang "Sport–Viewed Aesthetically, and Even as Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, Lev "Aesthetics of the beautiful game" ''Soccer &amp; Society'' 2012: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist aestheticians are also advocating for the inclusion of other senses beyond the two traditional sight and hearing, as in taste ([[Carolyn Korsmeyer]]) and smell (Emily Brady), that can render aesthetic experiences in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Emily "Sniffing and Savoring: The Aesthetics of Smells and Tastes" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press 2005); Korsmeyer, Carolyn ''Making Sense of Taste: Food &amp; Philosophy'' (New York: Cornell University Press 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
Carolyn Korsmeyer, M. Quinet and Glenn Kuehn argue for including food among aesthetically relevant objects and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Quinet, M.L. 1981. “Food as Art: The Problem of Function”. ''British Journal of Aesthetic''s. 21, 1: 159-171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn, Glenn "How Can Food Be Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The categories of the ordinary as aesthetic ==
Another line emerging from analytic aesthetics and the American Society of Aesthetics has been lately discussing the expansion of aesthetics’ category repertoire to include other qualities (cuteness, prettiness, messiness, neatness, cuddleness loveliness, organized, disorganized)&lt;ref&gt;Leddy, Thomas. 1995. 'Everyday Surface Aesthetic Qualities: "Neat", "Messy", "Clean", "Dirty"'''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', 53, 259-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Leddy, Thomas''The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (Broadview Press 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other types of ordinary experiences (i.e. scratching an itch, playing with a pencil).&lt;ref&gt;Irvin,Sherri “Scratching an Itch,” Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 66, 1 (2008), 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evita''''' is a documentary film on the life of [[Eva Duarte]] created by [[Eduardo Montes-Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667075/International Movie Data Base]&lt;/ref&gt; Conformed in its entirety with previously unseen historical footage and documents, the film reconstructs the life of the former Argentine first lady from an unbiased perspective. The film starts with a meticulous examination of Evita Duarte's origins, her relationship with her parents (particularly her father) and her siblings. ''Evita'' goes on to reveal intimate aspects of Duarte's early childhood and adolescence, leading to her resolving to flee her home in the countryside for the capital city of [[Buenos Aires]]. The latter segments of the film are highlighted by interviews with former teachers from her elementary schooling in [[Junín, Buenos Aires|Junin]], a small city in the province of Buenos Aires. Throughout the film, the director is steadily reminding the audience of the domestic and international context out of which Evita Duarte emerged, enhancing the viewer's understanding of the facts. The second act of the film concludes with her funeral in [[Buenos Aires]]. The third act exposes the macabre plot to have Evita Peron's corpse disappear, and looks at the curious series of events leading to the exchange of cadavers between the so-called [[Peronist]] youth and the military regime. ''Evita'' premiered in the US on WCVE Richmond-PBS, and WHTJ Charlottesville-PBS on July 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://ideastations.org/tv/schedules&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evita'' has been included in courses on [[Political Science]] and History.&lt;ref&gt;University of New Haven.

The '''Federation of Canadian Artists''' ('''FCA''') is an association of artists in Canada founded in Toronto in 1941. The FCA soon had chapters across the country, and was one of the main forces behind formation of the [[Canada Council]] in 1957. After this, the national organization withered, and only the British Columbia chapter remained active. A drive for expansion began in 1977, causing a renewal of activity that started in western Canada and then spread. Expansion stalled out in the late 1990s when funding cuts hit the Federation as hard as it hit other arts organization. Renewed vigor by volunteers and staff in recent years has brought new life to the Federation and expansion is again underway. The organization has about 2,700 paying members and 5,000 artist contacts throughout Canada as of the end of 2017, a permanent gallery in Vancouver, and organizes approximately 44 exhibitions every year. 

==Foundation==
[[File:Leaders of the Federation of Canadian Artists on Toronto in May 1942.png|thumb|Leaders of the Federation of Canadian Artists at a meeting in Toronto in May 1942. From left to right [[Arthur Lismer]], [[Frances Loring]], [[Lawren Harris]], [[André Charles Biéler]], [[A. Y. Jackson]] ]]
[[André Charles Biéler]] organized the first conference of Canadian artists in 1941.{{sfn|André Charles Biéler, Canadian Encyclopedia}}
This conference, held in [[Kingston, Ontario]], led to the foundation of the Federation of Canadian Artists.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=52}}
At his opening address at the Kingston conference Bieler insisted that "we should not try to unify ourselves or to attempt to make a school that would cover the whole country. 
On the contrary, I believe we must keep that regional aspect."{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=xvi}}
The Federation of Canadian Artists was founded in Toronto by a group of Canadian artists. Biéler was the first president.{{sfn|History, Federation of Canadian Artists}}

The Federation was divided into regions, each with a regional organizer. 
[[Lawren Harris]] of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] was head of the West Coast region.
The other organizers were [[Gordon Sinclair]] (Western region), [[Ernest Lindner]] (Saskatchewan), [[Byllee Lang]] (Manitoba), [[A. Y. Jackson]] (Ontario) and [[Walter Abell]] (Maritimes).{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=1}}

==Goals==

Writing in ''Maritime Art'' (February–March 1943) [[Arthur Lismer]] proposed that the goals of the Federation were to improve understanding of the role of artists in society, to encourage youth while supporting established artists and to bring art to the community.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=50}}
The FCA became a powerful national lobby for public patronage of the arts, recognized as the legitimate representative of Canadian artists.{{sfn|Brison|2005|p=70}}
J. Delisle Parker wrote in February 1945, "This is not just another art society, nor is it intended to replace any existing art society. It is an organization formed to unite all the artists in Canada, whether member of existing societies or not, in a federation which it is hoped will become a power in the country. The Federation hopes to bridge the isolation of artists in different parts of the country, discover talent and organize regional as well as country-wide activities and to publish an art magazine to serve the interests of art and artists in the country as a whole..."{{sfn|Parker|1945}}

==History==

Walter Abell's journal ''Maritime Art'' became ''[[Canadian Art (magazine)|Canadian Art]]'' in 1943 when Abell moved to Ottawa to join the staff of the Art Centre of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].{{sfn|Brison|2005|p=70}}
The Federation sponsored ''Canadian Art'', which was the only national art magazine in the 1940s.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=4}}
''Canadian Art'' became an important vehicle for communication between artists, curators and collectors.{{sfn|Cochran|1989|p=2}}
In June 1944 the Federation and other national art organizations prepared a brief on cultural aspects of Canadian post-war reconstruction. 
This led to the formation of the Canadian Arts Council.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=3}}
The FCA was a key member of the Canadian Arts Council after it was founded in 1944.{{sfn|Brison|2005|p=70}}
At first the FCA sponsored lectures and plays in addition to exhibitions and workshops. After about 1949 it began to focus on the visual arts.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=2}}

The FCA made a major presentation to the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, the Massey Commission, in Vancouver in 1949.
The presentation was instrumental in forming the [[Canada Council]], which came into being in 1957.
The FCA began to phase itself out as a national organization after this as communication across Canada became easier.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=194}}
By the 1960s there was little activity at the national level, although the regional branches persisted. In British Columbia there were 600 members.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=5}}

In 1977 Allan Edwards of the Vancouver branch, by now almost all that was left of the FCA, became president and began a drive for expansion.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=9}}
The FCA organized traveling exhibitions in British Columbia and Alberta, with some going to the east of Canada or the USA.
In the 1980s the FCA began to organize annual painting seminars on [[Saltspring Island]], which drew students from across western Canada and the USA.{{sfn|Poole|2008|p=10}}

[[Image:GaleriadelaRaza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Galería de la Raza, January 1, 2007]]'''Galería de la Raza''' ('''GDLR''') is a [[non-profit]] [[art gallery]] and [[artist collective]] that serves the heavily [[Latino]] population of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]]. GDLR mounts exhibitions, hosts [[poetry reading]]s, workshops, and celebrations, sells works of art, and sponsors youth and [[artist-in-residence]] programs. Exhibitions mounted at the Galería tend to feature the work of [[ethnic minority|minority]] and [[developing country]] artists and concern issues of ethnic history, identity, and social justice.

==History==
The Galería was founded by [[Chicano Movement]] artists [[Ralph Maradiaga]], Rupert García, Peter Rodriguez, Francisco X. Camplis, Gustavo Ramos Rivera, [[Carlos Loarca]], Manuel Villamor, Robert Gonzalez, [[Luis Cervantes]], Chuy Campusano, Rolando Castellón, and [[René Yañez]] in 1970 as a place for [[Mexican American]] and other Latino artists to show their work. It developed into a [[community art]]s center that painted many murals, sponsored youth programs, and gained national and international recognition for its commitment to serving underrepresented communities.

&lt;!-- removed copyvio content --&gt;

In the mid-nineties the ReGeneration Project was started to facilitate the involvement of the next generation of artists. ReGeneration provides emerging artists with exhibition and professional development opportunities as well as opportunity to help plan and manage of Galería activities. One of the most visible contributions of the ReGeneration Project is the updating of the temporary murals on the Bryant Street billboard. Through the new Digital Mural Project computer-generated images are created and displayed in lieu of the traditional painted murals.

==Programs and exhibitions==
Throughout its history, GDLR has given workshops in [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[mural]]ism, [[digital art]], and sponsored [[artists-in-residence]]. Important exhibitions have included "Cartelones del Cine Mexicano", which exposed [[Chicano art]]ists to the styles and techniques of Mexican commercial lithographers, "The Peter Rodriguez Collection of Santos from the Mexican Museum", an exhibition of early [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] [[santo (art)|santo]]s, and  "Low 'n Slow", a [[lowrider]]-themed exhibit.

GDLR was also instrumental in reviving the [[indigenous Mexican]] tradition of [[Day of the Dead]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and in popularizing the work of the Mexican artists [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[José Guadalupe Posada]] among movement activists.

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
'''Genre''' ({{ety|fr|genre|kind, sort}}) is any form or type of [[communication]] in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed upon conventions developed over time. Genre is most popularly known as a [[Category of being|category]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.

Genre began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[Poetry]] ([[ode]]s,  [[Epic poetry|epics]], etc.), [[prose]], and [[performance]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.

In later periods{{when?|date=March 2018}} genres proliferated and developed in response to changes in audiences and creators.  Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.

Genre suffers from the ills of any classification system. It has been suggested{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as because of the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents{{who?|date=March 2018}} argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

==Visual arts==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|A genre painting (''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder) ]]

The term ''genre'' is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in [[art history]] has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. [[Genre painting]] is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches{{spaced ndash}}in other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. These are distinguished from [[staffage]]: incidental figures in what is primarily a [[landscape art|landscape]] or architectural painting. ''Genre painting'' may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper, and other specialized types of paintings such as [[still-life]], landscapes, [[marine painting]]s and animal paintings.

The concept of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries.  It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the [[Académie française]] which held a central role in [[academic art]]. The genres in hierarchical order are:
* [[History painting]], including narrative religious mythological and allegorical subjects
* [[Portrait painting]]
* Genre painting or scenes of everyday life
* Landscape (landscapists were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]) and cityscape
* [[Animal painter|Animal painting]]
* [[Still life]]

==Literature==
{{Literature}}
{{Main article|Literary genre|List of literary genres}}
A literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by [[literary technique]], [[setting tone|tone]], [[Content (media)|content]], or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, [[young adult fiction|young adult]], or [[children's literature|children's]].  They also must not be confused with format, such as [[graphic novel]] or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) [[epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[comedy]], [[novel]], and [[short story]]. They can all be in the genres [[prose]] or [[poetry]], which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as [[satire]] might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general [[cultural movement]] of the [[historical period]] in which they were composed.  In [[popular fiction]], which is especially divided by genres, [[genre fiction]] is the more usual term.

In [[literature]], genre has been known as an intangible [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].  This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever.The earliest recorded systems of genre in [[Western world|Western history]] can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of ''The Architext'', describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and [[Epic (genre)|epic]] (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). [[Lyric poetry]], the fourth and final type of [[Greek literature]], was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse.  Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis.

Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]] (superior-dramatic dialogue), [[epic poetry|epic]] (superior-mixed narrative), [[comedy]] (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and [[parody]] (inferior-mixed narrative). Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the [[Romanticism|romantic period]], replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to "dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…" (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.

Genette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse" (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.

==Film==
{{main article|Film genre}}
The basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the [[feature film]] and most [[cartoon]]s, and [[documentary]].  Most dramatic feature films, especially from [[Hollywood]] fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the [[Western film|Western]], [[war film]], [[horror film]], [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy film]], [[musical film|musical]], [[crime film]], and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical.

==Music==
{{main article|Music genre}}
A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 "Genre"]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There are numerous genres in Western [[classical music]] and [[popular music]], as well as [[musical theatre]] and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern [[rock music]], that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the "appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them".&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. According to Green, "Beethoven's ''Op. 61'' and Mendelssohn's ''Op. 64'' are identical in genre&amp;nbsp;– both are violin concertos&amp;nbsp;– but different in form. However, Mozart's ''Rondo for Piano, K. 511'', and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his ''Mass, K. 317'' are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Form in Tonal Music |last=Green |first=Douglass M. |year=1965 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc |isbn=0-03-020286-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or "basic musical language".&lt;ref name=Pete&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music |last=van der Merwe |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist) |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-316121-4 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, Allan F.
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3526163 "Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre"]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.

Several music scholars have criticised the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that "music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds."&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"/&gt;

==Popular culture and other media==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as [[video game genres]]. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes.  The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.

==Linguistics==
In [[philosophy of language]], genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Bakhtin's basic observations were of "speech genres" (the idea of [[heteroglossia]]), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as "formal letter" and "grocery list", or "university lecture" and "personal anecdote"). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of [[Georg Lukács]] also touches on the nature of [[literary genre]]s, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. [[Norman Fairclough]] has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are "different ways of (inter)acting discoursally" (Fairclough, 2003: 26).

A text's genre may be determined by its:

# Linguistic function.
# Formal traits.
# Textual organization.
# Relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text (Charaudeau and Maingueneau, 2002:278–280).

==Rhetoric==
In the field of [[rhetoric]], genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, A. S., &amp; Mary Jo Reiff. (2010). [http://wac.colostate.edu/books/bawarshi_reiff/ Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.] chs. 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. R. (1984). Genre as social action. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 70(2), 151–167.&lt;/ref&gt; work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on [[Lloyd Bitzer]]'s concept of rhetorical situation,&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L. F. (1968). The Rhetorical Situation. Philosophy and Rhetoric, 1(1), 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on [[Alfred Schütz]],&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, A., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1973). The Structures of the Life-World. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; she reasons that these recurring responses become "typified" – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these "typified rhetorical actions" (p.&amp;nbsp;151) are properly understood as genres.

Building off of Miller, [[Charles Bazerman]] and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of "genre systems",&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, C. (1994). Systems of Genre and the Enactment of Social Intentions. In Genre and the New Rhetoric (pp. 79–101). London/Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of "genre ecologies".&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, C., &amp; Zachry, M. (2000). Genre Ecologies : An Open-System Approach to Understanding and Constructing Documentation. ACM Journal of Computer Documentation, 24(3), 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with [[activity theory]], David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. R. (1995). Activity theory and its implications for writing instruction. In J. Petraglia (Ed.), Reconceiving writing, rethinking writing instruction (pp. 51–78). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic "mutt genres" that are often of little use outside of composition courses.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, E. (2009). "Mutt Genres" and the Goal of FYC: Can we Help Students Write the Genres of the University? College Composition and Communication, 60(4), 765–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by [[Plato]]. Plato divided [[literature]] into the three classic genres accepted in [[Ancient Greece]]: [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[prose]]. [[Poetry]] is further subdivided into [[epic poetry|epic]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], and [[drama]]. The divisions are recognized as being set by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of [[poetry]].

===Classical and Romance genre theory===
The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle#Rhetoric and poetics|Aristotle]]. [[Gérard Genette]] explains his interpretation of the history of genre in "The Architext". He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the [[drama]]; pure narrative, the [[dithyramb]]; and a mixture of the two, the [[Epic (genre)|epic]]. Plato excluded [[lyric poetry]] as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of [[mode (literature)|mode]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], and [[Medium (communication)|medium]] can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]], [[Epic (genre)|epic]], [[comedy]], and [[parody]].

Genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. [[Lyric poetry]], once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third "Architext", a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to "dominate all the literary theory of [[German romanticism]]" (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel's]] triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse".

==Culture==
Genre is embedded in [[culture]] but may clash with it at times. There are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre. Anthony Pare's studied Inuit social workers in "Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions and Ideology". In this study, Pare described the conflict between the genre of Inuit social workers' record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre. Amy Devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay, "A Theory of Genre" by adding "culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible" (Devitt 24).

Genre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components. Genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously; people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society. Devitt touches on Miller's idea of situation, but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal. Individuals may find themselves shaping the rhetorical situations, which in turn affect the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation. Because the social workers worked closely with different families, they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field. Giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community.

==Audiences==
Although genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.

Genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as [[magazine]]s and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.

The term may be used in categorizing [[web page]]s, like "news page" and "fan page", with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like [[Vivísimo]] try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.

==Subgenre==
A subgenre is a [[Hierarchy|subordinate]] within a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subgenre|title=subgenre|publisher=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subgenre|title=Subgenre|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a [[fantasy]] story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of [[dark fantasy]]; whereas another fantasy story that features [[magic sword]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would belong to the subgenre of [[sword and sorcery]].

'''Gertrude Homan Thanhouser''' (April 23, 1882 – May 29, 1951), wife of co-founder [[Edwin Thanhouser]], worked at the [[Thanhouser Company]] film studio as actress, scenario writer, film editor, and studio executive. Her efforts made the studio one of the key independent US film studios in the nickelodeon and transitional era, praised for its erudite adaptations of Shakespeare and other "classical" stage dramas to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Qi7eCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Gertrude+Thanhouser&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title= The Silents of Jesus in the Cinema (1897–1927)|date= March 31, 2016|author= David Shepherd|publisher= Routledge|page= 111|isbn= 9781317806738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude Homan was born in 1882 (one family account gives the date as 1880) in [[Beauvoir, Mississippi]], one of ten children in her family. When she was very young, the family moved to [[Brooklyn, New York]], and she became involved in acting as a child, performing her first stage role at the age of six. As a [[child actress]], her theatrical parts included title roles in  ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'' and ''Editha's Burglar''. In the 1890s she was part of a stock company in [[Milwaukee]] that was managed by Edwin Thanhouser, whom she married in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thanhouser.org/people/thanhouserg.htm Gertrude Homan Thanhouser Biography entry on Thanhouser website], retrieved August 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the spring of 1909, Gertrude moved with her husband to [[New Rochelle, New York]] where they established [[Thanhouser Company]] as an independent motion picture studio; it was the first to be organized by leaders with strong theatrical training. Gertrude's acting career of fourteen years gave her the stagecraft to be a powerful and creative force in this new venture. She received co-scenario writing credit with brother-in-law, [[Lloyd Lonergan]], for the screen adaptation of Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''. Behind the scenes, Gertrude was heavily involved in scenario development, creation of mise en scène and film editing. In 1912, the Thanhousers sold their shares in the company to [[Charles J. Hite]] of [[Mutual Film Corporation]] for $250,000 and retired from the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=C0irCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Gertrude+Thanhouser&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title= The Art of Adapting Victorian Literature, 1848-1920|page= 49| author= Karen E. Laird|date= March 3, 2016|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 9781317044505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1914, Hite was killed in an automobile accident. In February 1915, the Mutual board of directors in an extraordinary move lured Edwin and Gertrude out of retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Mabel Condon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JnhJAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA731&amp;ots=fQJLBJbYRw&amp;dq=Ola%20Humphrey%20Hassan&amp;pg=PA407#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Thanhousers are Back on the Job"] ''Motography'' (March 13, 1915): 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrude immediately resumed her role as supervisor of the scenario department and was credited for writing the scenario for their first "new" release, ''[[Their One Love]]''. She remained active in company affairs including attending a meeting with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916. In the summer of 1916 the death of Thanhouser leading actress [[Florence LaBadie]] and the rise of feature films with stars such as [[Mary Pickford]] contributed to the decline in popularity of the studio's films. In 1918, the founders retired permanently from the film industry leaving the Thanhouser Film Corporation with a positive bank balance, unlike many others of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Thanhouser Films: An Encyclopedia and History, Q.

'''Helen Holmes''' (June 19, 1892 – July 8, 1950) was an American [[silent film]] actress, most notable for starring in the [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]''.

==Early life==
[[File:Helen Holmes on Baltimore and Ohio employees magazine.jpg|thumb|250px|Helen Holmes on ''Baltimore and Ohio employees magazine'', 1912.]]
'''Helen Holmes''' was born on June 19, 1892, in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;While some references state Holmes was born on July 7, 1892, and indicate she was born in either [[South Bend, Indiana]] or [[Louisville, Kentucky]] (e.g. Buck Rainey, ''Those Fabulous Serial Heroines: Their Lives and Films'' (Scarecrow Press, 1990):97.), her death certificate indicates her date of birth was June 19, 1892, and that she was born in [[Cook County, Illinois]]. See Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2004. Source Citation: Year: 1900; Census Place: Chicago Ward 15, Cook, Illinois; Roll: 264; Page: 3B; Enumeration District: 472; FHL microfilm: 1240264; and also see John J. McGowan, ''J.P. McGowan: Biography of a Hollywood Pioneer'' (McFarland, 2005), n2, 209. McGowan indicates: "The confusion seems to have arisen because the record of her birth was not filed until many years after her birth. The record was lodged by Helen's uncle in 1942".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes' gravestone indicates she was born in 1891. See [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=HO&amp;GSfn=h&amp;GSpartial=1&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSst=6&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GSsr=921&amp;GRid=18294&amp;df=all&amp; "Helen Holmes"]. See photo of gravestone: [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=18294&amp;PIpi=290899 Photo of Gravestone of Helen Holmes].&lt;/ref&gt; While there is uncertainty about her place of birth, Holmes stated in an interview that she was born on a farm in [[South Bend, Indiana]],&lt;ref&gt;''Photoplay'' 7 (1914):54.&lt;/ref&gt; but grew up in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. A 1917 article indicates Holmes was born on her father's private railroad car, "Estevan".&lt;ref&gt;''Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen's Magazine'', Vol. 62 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes was the daughter of Norwegian immigrant Louis A. Holmes (born in Norway in October 1862), a railroad clerk employed by the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], who had migrated to the United States in 1867,&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

Holmes (born June 1889 in Illinois) and Florence (born in May 1896 in Illinois), and two other siblings who died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;John J. McGowan, ''J.P.

Holmes was educated in St Mary's Convent in [[South Bend, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;"Helen of Kalem", ''The Atlanta Constitution'' (March 14, 1915):A3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'' (Baltimore, MD: April 11, 1915):3A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes began working as a photographer's model but turned to acting, performing in live theatre and making her Broadway debut in 1909. She became friends with film star [[Mabel Normand]].

Due to tuberculosis in the family, about 1910 Holmes and her widowed mother and siblings moved to California Valley, a few miles east of [[Shoshone, California|Shoshone]] in [[Death Valley, California]], where they lost their life savings in a real estate swindle buying a property by the [[Colorado River]].&lt;ref&gt;William Carruthers, ''Loafing Along Death Valley Trails: A Personal Narrative of People and Places'', 2nd ed. (Ontario, CA: Death Valley Publishing, 1951):126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Mabel Normand moved to Hollywood in 1912 to work at [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios]], and she encouraged Holmes, after her brother had died, to try the film business in the balmier climes of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

==Kalem Film Company==
[[File:Helen Holmes adv 1916.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement (1916)]]
Holmes began her film career in 1912 with Keystone in a bit part arranged by Mabel Normand. She made only a few more appearances in Keystone films and, although attractive, her lack of glamorous beauty relegated her to secondary roles until late 1913 when she signed with the [[Kalem Company]]'s new Hollywood studio.

Helen Holmes' first film at Kalem was directed by [[J.P. McGowan]], with whom she would develop a relationship and soon marry. In her first two years with Kalem Studios, Holmes appeared in more than thirty film shorts during which time her athletic ability to do physically demanding stunts led to her big break.

At a time when the [[women's suffrage]] movement was much in the news, in March 1914 Kalem Studios' competitor [[Pathé|Pathé Frères]] released an [[adventure film]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] titled ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]''. Starring [[Pearl White]] as a bold and daring heroine, the Pathé serial became an enormous [[box-office]] success. As a result, Kalem Studios jumped on the [[Bandwagon effect|bandwagon]] and in November 1914 released their own adventure series called ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]''.

Cast as the series star, during the twenty-six "thrill-a-minute" episodes in which Helen Holmes performed, she did almost all of her own stunts. Playing an independent, quick-thinking and inventive heroine, as part of her dangerous exploits Helen did such things as leap onto runaway trains or treacherously chase after [[villain|bad guy]] train robbers. While occasionally the plot called for Helen to be rescued by a handsome male hero, in most episodes it was the dauntless Helen herself who found an ingenious way out of her dire predicament and single-handedly collared the bad guys, bringing them to justice. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:HelenHolmes.jpg|thumb|200px|Helen Holmes in action, 1914 {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 27 November 2009}}]] --&gt;

''The Hazards of Helen'' made Holmes a major star and she and her now husband, director J.P McGowan, decided to capitalize on her fame and left Kalem to work for [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas H. Ince Productions]] and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. After a few films, Holmes and McGowan formed Signal Film Productions to make their own adventure films. Between late 1915 and early 1917, they made a dozen films together that met with reasonable success but financial and distribution problems ended the production partnership and Holmes did not appear in another film until 1919, this time as the star in another film company's production. In 1919 and 1920 she made only one film each year and only two in each of the next three years. Between 1924 and 1926 Helen Holmes made eighteen more short adventure films, but her popularity began to wane in a market over-saturated with female [[cliffhanger]] films. Holmes made several [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] opposite actor and rodeo performer [[Jack Hoxie]] in the mid-1920s.

Throughout her career Helen Holmes had occasionally gone back to performing in the theatre, and with the end of her marriage in 1925 she returned to the stage, making her last appearance on Broadway in 1935. She eventually married film stuntman Lloyd A. Saunders and as a result of the popularity of the [[Rin Tin Tin]] dog films, the two began training animals for use in the movies.

After retiring from movies Helen ran a small antique business in her San Fernando home. She had an extensive collection of rare dolls.

Lloyd died in 1946, and Helen died in 1950 as a result of heart failure. She had been ill for five years with a heart condition. She died in [[Burbank, California]] at her home, 1401 West Olive Street. She was 58 years old. Funeral services were conducted at Pierce Brothers Hollywood Chapel at 5959 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California. She was interred at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].

The '''Historic Cairo Restoration Project''' ('''HCRP''') is an effort by the governments of [[Egypt]] and [[Cairo]] to restore and renovate historic [[Islamic Cairo|Medieval Islamic Cairo]].  ''Al-Qahira'' (Cairo) was officially founded here in 969 CE by the [[Fatamid]] caliphs as an imperial capital and walled city, just to the north of the preceding capital [[Fustat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm|title=Cairo, a Millennial|accessdate=2007-08-09|author=Irene Beeson|pages=24, 26–30 |date=September–October 1969|publisher=[[Saudi Aramco World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldpress"&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/2343.cfm Worldpress.org; "Rescuing Cairo's Lost Heritage;" by Rose Aslan; May 10, 2006] .

==Concept==
The Historic Cairo Restoration Project is a project started by the governments of Egypt and Cairo. The main project's intention is to create new museums in a sequence of historical sites in an [[open-air museum]] district, that will be widely accessible to both the citizens of Cairo and tourists.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt; The project is currently focused on restoring historic landmarks from the medieval [[Fatamid]] era in Cairo (969 CE - 1250 CE). The number of potential historic monuments is estimated between 450 and 630 structures.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;

According to the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]], the HCRP  plan is to "''transform the whole area into an open-air museum.''" &lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt; The HCRP is first focusing on this [[Islamic art]]s district in order to be a part of the [[Museum With No Frontiers]]. This is a museum organized by the [[European Union]], and the Fatimid area project will be a part of its [[Euromed Heritage program]] — "Islamic Art in the [[Mediterranean]]." &lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

===Projects===
A primary concept of the project is to feature the actual historical sites as the main exhibits for this open-air museum by providing extensive information resources and catalogs on-site at each of them. Visitors would therefore be able to truly experience medieval Egyptian culture and history by seeing the structures and sites while concurrently learning more about them from the on-site resources.

As a part of this project, to increase pedestrian accessibility there are plans to create a paved walkway along al-Muizz li-Din Allah, the main ceremonial path of Fatimid Cairo. There are also plans to demolish less significant adjacent [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] structures to create large [[garden]] settings surrounding the landmarks.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Medieval context===
The HCRP has issued many plans, which have been met with resistance by some Cairens, the citizens of Cairo. For example, the plans to create gardens and walkways is seen by some as an assault on the original dense medieval layout and 'urban fabric' of Fatimid Cairo that diminishes the historical value of the retained sites.

The reasoning is that in [[History of Cairo|Medieval Cairo]], the context of a building was determined by its relationship to neighboring buildings. Buildings and monuments of importance were intentionally constructed adjacent to conventional ones, to convey and enhance their high stature and prestige. It is this urban clustering and juxtaposition that actually gives the landmark buildings authentic context and meaning for visitors to experience. Some Cairens think that by eliminating this context from the buildings  the HCRP is lessening the value  and historical understanding of their heritage sites.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

Some architectural conservation experts have claimed the HCRP has used incorrect building materials in its conservation work.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;  Other conservation experts counter that the massive and immediate intervention for landmarks, despite the inevitable mistakes, has stopped the threat of many just disappearing.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;

===Funding===
Some residents of historic Cairo have also become suspicious of the HCRP motives, questioning if the project really has historical preservation and interpretation as its true primary intention. Some believe that tourism and commerce are instead the main reason for the project's creation and funding.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt; The large amount of spending necessary for the intended project has also become a point of controversy, with some estimates as high as $350 million.&lt;ref name="cairocosmo"/&gt;  Some residents believe that the massive cost of creating the open-air museum and restoring its landmarks would be better spent for other local public social and economic needs.&lt;ref name="worldpress"/&gt;

[[File:Arvid Liljelund - Man Singing Hymn - A I 187 - Finnish National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[Arvid Liljelund]]'s ''Man Singing Hymn'' (1884)]]
A '''hymn''' is a type of [[song]], usually [[religious]], specifically written for the purpose of adoration or [[prayer]], and typically addressed to a [[deity]] or deities, or to a prominent figure or [[personification]]. The word ''hymn'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}} (''hymnos''), which means "a song of praise". A writer of hymns is known as a [[hymnodist]]. The singing or composition of hymns is called '''hymnody'''. Collections of hymns are known as [[hymnal]]s or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.

Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of [[Christianity]], hymns are also a fixture of other [[major religious groups|world religions]], especially on the Indian subcontinent. Hymns also survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.

==Origins==
Ancient hymns include the [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'', composed by [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]; the Hurrian [[Hymn to Nikkal]]; the ''[[Vedas]]'', a collection of hymns in the tradition of [[Hinduism]]; and the [[Psalms]], a collection of songs from [[Judaism]]. The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the [[Homeric Hymns]], a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religions]]. Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns ({{lang|grc|Ὕμνοι}}) by the [[Alexandria]]n poet [[Callimachus]].

[[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writers began applying the term {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, or ''hymnus'' in [[Latin]], to [[Christian]] songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for "[[Psalms|psalm]]".&lt;ref&gt;Entry on {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 8th edition 1897, 1985 printing), p. 1849; entry on 'hymnus,' Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1879, 1987 printing), p. 872.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian hymnody ==
Originally modeled on the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as "[[canticle]]s") in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]]. Many refer to [[Jesus Christ]] either directly or indirectly.

Since the earliest times, Christians have sung "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs", both in private devotions and in corporate worship ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:30|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse|Mark|14:26|esv}}; {{bibleverse|Acts|16:25|esv}}; {{bibleverse|1|Cor|14:26|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:19|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|3:16|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||James|5:13|nrsv}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Revelation|5:8–10|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|14:1–5|nrsv}}).

Non-scriptural hymns (i.e. not psalms or canticles) from the Early Church still sung today include '[[Phos Hilaron]]', '[[Sub tuum praesidium]]', and '[[Te Deum]]'.

One definition of a hymn is "...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last1=Eskew
 | last2=McElrath
 | title=Sing with Understanding, An Introduction to Christian Hymnology
 | year=1980
 | isbn=0-8054-6809-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and the Feast of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]], or during particular seasons such as [[Advent]] and [[Lent]]. Others are used to encourage reverence for the [[Bible]] or to celebrate Christian practices such as the [[eucharist]] or [[baptism]]. Some hymns praise or address individual [[saints]], particularly the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]; such hymns are particularly prevalent in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and to some extent [[High Church]] [[Anglicanism]].

A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist, and the practice of singing hymns is called ''hymnody''; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. "nineteenth century Methodist hymnody" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the 19th century). A collection of hymns is called a ''[[hymnal]]'' or ''hymnary''. These may or may not include music. A student of hymnody is called a ''hymnologist'', and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is [[hymnology]]. The music to which a hymn may be sung is a [[hymn tune]].

In many Evangelical churches, traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns. The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the [[Jesus movement]] and [[Jesus music]]. Of note, in recent years, Christian traditional hymns ''have'' seen a revival in some churches, usually more Reformed or [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] in nature, as modern hymn writers such as [[Keith Getty|Keith and Kristyn Getty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-praise-of-hymns/|title=In praise of hymns|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sovereign Grace Churches|Sovereign Grace]] Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies, revised old hymns and republished them, or simply written a song in accordance with Christian hymn standards &lt;sup&gt;[according to whom?]&lt;/sup&gt; such as the hymn, ''[[In Christ Alone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Songs of faith|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/songs-of-faith/|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music and accompaniment ===
In ancient and medieval times, [[string instrument]]s such as the [[harp]], [[lyre]] and [[lute]] were used with psalms and hymns.

Since there is a lack of [[musical notation]] in early writings,&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Hymn: 4. Hymn Sources and Transmission," Warren Anderson, et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/ Grove Music Online] (2007–2009) (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of [[Gregorian chant]] or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight [[church modes]], and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in [[Latin]], many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century ''[[Of the Father's Heart Begotten]]'' sung to the 11th century plainsong ''Divinum Mysterium''.

==== Western church ====
[[File:St Paul's Cathedral South Organ, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Hymns are often accompanied by [[pipe organ|organ]] music]]
Later hymnody in the [[Western church]] introduced four-part vocal [[harmony]] as the norm, adopting major and minor keys, and came to be led by [[organ (music)|organ]] and choir. It shares many elements with [[European classical music|classical music]].

Today, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations and ''[[a cappella]]'' congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison. In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published, in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four-part vocal score for their instrument of choice.

To illustrate [[Protestant]] usage, in the traditional services and liturgies of the [[Methodist]] churches, which are based upon [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] practice, hymns are sung (often accompanied by an organ) during the [[processional hymn|processional]] to the altar, during the receiving of communion, during the [[recessional hymn|recessional]], and sometimes at other points during the service. These hymns can be found in a common book such as the [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. The [[Doxology]] is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.

[[Contemporary worship|Contemporary Christian worship]], as often found in [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Pentecostalism]], may include the use of [[contemporary worship music]] played with [[electric guitar]]s and the [[drum kit]], sharing many elements with [[rock music]].

Other groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied ''[[a cappella]]'' congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the 'Brethren' (often both 'Open' and 'Exclusive'), the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Mennonites]], [[Primitive Baptists]], and certain Reformed churches, although during the last century or so, several of these, such as the [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] have abandoned this stance.

====Eastern church====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
[[Eastern Christianity]] (the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches) has a variety of ancient hymnographical traditions.

[[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] chant is almost always [[a cappella]], and instrumental accompaniment is rare. It is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship.

Instruments are common in Oriental traditions. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] tradition which makes use of the [[cymbal]]s and the [[Triangle (musical instrument)]]. The [[Indian Orthodox]] (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) use of the [[organ (music)|organ]]. The [[Tewahedo Church]]es use [[drum]]s, [[cymbal]]s and other instruments on certain occasions.

=== Development of Christian hymnody ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]], in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: "''Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita, prorumpens in vocem''." ("A hymn is the praise of God with song; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things, bursting forth in the voice.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]] resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the [[regulative principle of worship]], favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as [[exclusive psalmody]]. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the [[Scottish Presbyterian|Presbyterian churches of western Scotland]].

The other Reformation approach, the [[normative principle of worship]], produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. [[Martin Luther]] is notable not only as a reformer, but as the [[List of hymns by Martin Luther|author of many hymns]] including "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]"), which is sung today even by Catholics, and "[[Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ]]" ("Praise be to You, Jesus Christ") for Christmas. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the [[Unitas Fratrum]]. Count [[Zinzendorf]], the Lutheran leader of the [[Moravian Church]] in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly [[Psalm]]s; [[Isaac Watts]] followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Watts (1674–1748), whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts' first hymn, "Behold the glories of the Lamb".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Relying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called "the father of English hymnody", but Erik Routley sees him more as "the liberator of English hymnody", because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Later writers took even more freedom, some even including [[allegory]] and [[metaphor]] in their texts.

[[Charles Wesley]]'s hymns spread Methodist [[theology]], not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. Wesley wrote:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Where shall my wondering soul begin?
How shall I all to heaven aspire?
A slave redeemed from death and sin,
A brand plucked from eternal fire,
How shall I equal triumphs raise,
Or sing my great deliverer's praise.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Wesley's contribution, along with the [[Second Great Awakening]] in [[United States|America]] led to a new style called [[Gospel music|gospel]], and a new explosion of sacred music writing with [[Fanny Crosby]], [[Lina Sandell]], [[Philip Bliss]], [[Ira D. Sankey]], and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades. The tune style or form is technically designated "gospel songs" as distinct from hymns. Gospel songs generally include a refrain (or chorus) and usually (though not always) a faster tempo than the hymns. As examples of the distinction, "[[Amazing Grace]]" is a hymn (no refrain), but "[[How Great Thou Art (hymn)|How Great Thou Art]]" is a gospel song. During the 19th century, the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and to a lesser but still definite extent, in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship ''per se'' by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants (a type of hymn).

The [[Methodist Revival]] of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent names among Welsh hymn-writers are [[William Williams Pantycelyn]] and [[Ann Griffiths]]. The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and congregational four-part singing in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Wyn James, 'The Evolution of the Welsh Hymn', in ''Dissenting Praise'', ed. I. Rivers &amp; D. L. Wykes (OUP, 2011); E. Wyn James, ‘German Chorales and American Songs and Solos: Contrasting Chapters in Welsh Congregational Hymn-Singing’, ''The Bulletin of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', No. 295, Vol. 22:2 (Spring 2018), 43–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from [[Mozart]] to [[Monteverdi]], the [[Catholic Church]] continued to produce many popular hymns such as [[Lead, Kindly Light]], [[Silent Night]], O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers.

Many churches today use contemporary worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by [[popular music]]. This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants (see [[contemporary worship]]). This is not new; the Christian [[Contemporary Christian Music|pop music]] style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.

This long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), contemporary worship music (often directed to God) and [[gospel music]] (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.

====American developments====
[[African-American]]s developed a rich hymnody from [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s during times of slavery to the modern, lively black gospel style. The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns compiled by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition, and though he succeeded, he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996. 179/185-186/192/199/206. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hymn writing, composition, performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals were prolific in the 19th-century and were often linked to the abolitionist movement by many hymn writers. Surprisingly, [[Stephen Foster]] wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing.&lt;!-- references forthcoming --&gt;

Thomas Symmes{{clarify|date=January 2011}} spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns, in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this idea was opposed by the views of Symmes' colleagues{{who|date=January 2011}} who felt it was "like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[William Billings]], a [[singing school]] teacher, created the first tune book with only American born compositions. Within his books, Billings did not put as much emphasis on "[[common measure]]"{{clarify|date=January 2011}} which was the typical way hymns were sung, but he attempted "to have a Sufficiency in each measure"{{clarify|date=January 2011}}. Boston's [[Handel and Haydn Society]] aimed at raising the level of church music in America, publishing their "Collection of Church Music".{{when|date=January 2011}} In the late 19th century [[Ira D. Sankey]] and [[Dwight L. Moody]] developed the relatively new subcategory of [[gospel hymn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. ''Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings''. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the 19th century, the use of musical notation, especially [[Shape note|shape notes]], exploded in America, and professional singing masters went from town to town teaching the population how to [[Sight-reading|sing from sight]], instead of the more common [[lining out]] that had been used before that. During this period hundreds of tune books were published, including [[Benjamin Franklin White|B.F. White's]] ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', and earlier works like the [[The Missouri Harmony|''Missouri Harmony'']], ''[[Kentucky Harmony]]'', [[The Hesperian Harp|''Hesperian Harp'']], D.H. Mansfield's ''The American Vocalist'', ''The Social Harp'', the ''[[Southern Harmony]]'', [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''[[The Christian Harmony|Christian Harmony]]'', [[Jeremiah Ingalls]]' ''Christian Harmony'', and literally many dozens of others. Shape notes were important in the spread of (then) more modern singing styles, with tenor-led 4-part harmony (based on older English [[West gallery music|West Gallery music]]), [[Fuguing tune|fuging]] sections, [[Anthem|anthems]] and other more complex features. During this period, hymns were incredibly popular in the United States, and one or more of the above-mentioned tunebooks could be found in almost every household. It isn't uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune books, which was considered great fun, and there are surviving accounts of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his sweetheart singing together from the ''Missouri Harmony'' during his youth. 

By the 1860s musical reformers like [[Lowell Mason]] (the so-called "better music boys") were actively campaigning for the introduction of more "refined" and modern singing styles, and eventually these American tune books were replaced in many churches, starting in the Northeast and urban areas, and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler, more soothing tones of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] hymnody, and even adopted dedicated, trained [[Choir|choirs]] to do their church's singing, rather than having the entire congregation participate. But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on, not in churches, but in weekly, monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tunebooks. The most popular one, and the only one that survived continuously in print, was the ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was "re-discovered" by [[Alan Lomax]] in the 1960s (although it had been well-documented by [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[George Pullen Jackson]] prior to this). Indeed, "the most common book on . Since then there has been a renaissance in "Sacred Harp singing", with annual conventions popping up in [[United States|all 50 states]] and in a number of European countries recently, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]] and [[Poland]], as well as in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpbremen.org/|title=Sacred Harp Bremen|website=www.sacredharpbremen.org|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukshapenote.org.uk/|title=Welcome|last=Macadam|first=Edwin and Sheila|website=www.ukshapenote.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacredharp86.org/|title=Sacred Harp in Poland {{!}} Polish Sacred Harp Community Website|website=sacredharp86.org|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://sacredharpaustralia.com/] Today "Sacred Harp singing" is a vibrant and living tradition with thousands of enthusiastic participants all around the globe, drawn to the democratic principles of the tradition and exotic, beautiful sound of the music. Although the lyrics tend to be highly religious in nature, the tradition is largely secular, and participation if open to all who care to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fasola.org|title=fasola.org – Sacred Harp and Shape Note singing|website=www.fasola.org|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymn meters===
{{main|Meter (hymn)}}
The meter indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each [[stanza]] of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate [[hymn tune]] for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters (syllable count and stress patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.

The meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as "87.87.87", which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long meter, which is 88.88 (four lines, each eight syllables long); S.M. is short meter (66.86); C.M. is common metre (86.86), while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. (the "D" stands for double) are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn (e.g., the hymn "I Sing a Song of the Saints of God"), the meter is called Irregular.

In modern times, the archetype of the "[[sexy librarian]]" has also begun to gain some traction, introduced in an effort to subvert the popular matriarchal image and make them more appealing to the average consumer. Both archetypes boil down to a similar idea, however – an authoritative, implacable guardian of the books who, through either power or sex appeal, keep the library patrons in fear and thus maintain themselves as exclusive guardians of the otherwise obscure organization system in the library.&lt;ref name=LeadPipe/&gt;

==Popular literature==
Children's literature offers a generally positive portrayal of librarians as knowledgeable, helpful, amazing and friendly, becoming more positive over the course of the 20th century.  Adult literature, however, portrays the profession more negatively.  Between these, portrayals of librarians in young adult fiction are neutral to negative.  Here librarians are predominantly female, middle-aged, usually unattractive in some way, and mostly unmarried.  Personality is mixed between positive traits such as intelligence, likeability, and kind-heartedness; and negative traits such as strictness, timidity, excess fastidiousness, and eccentricity.  While some provide assistance to the main characters, several are the villains of the story.  Duties generally include reference, but may only show clerical tasks; however the amount of technology used by librarian characters has increased over time.&lt;ref name="Peresie"/&gt;

A disproportionate number of the librarians represented in novels are in the [[detective fiction]] genre, frequently as an amateur detective and protagonist.  Although the stereotype of the librarian as "passive bore" does not seem reconcilable with the intensity of a mystery, the stereotypical librarian does share many traits with the successful detective.  Their mindset is focused, calm, unbiased in considering viewpoints, and focused on the world around them.  By personality they are industrious perfectionists—and eccentric.  The drab and innocuous look of the stereotypical librarian is perfect for avoiding suspicion, while their research skills and ability to ask the right questions allow them to procure and evaluate the information necessary to solve the case.  The knowledge they have gained from wide reading successfully competes with a private investigator's personal experience.  For example, [[Jacqueline Kirby]] is drawn into the mystery in [[Elizabeth Peters]]' novel ''The Seventh Sinner'' (1972) due to her awareness of her surroundings.  Wearing the stereotypical bun, glasses, and practical clothes, together with an eccentrically large purse, she is self-possessed and resourceful, knowledgeable in a variety of fields and skilled at research.&lt;ref name="Reiman"&gt;{{cite journal

By the 1950s, movies had established the stereotype of librarians as "spinsters" and "eggheads".&lt;ref name="Peresie"/&gt;  Thus, female movie librarians are usually unmarried, prim, and introverted.  They are usually young and may be attractive, but dress drably and are sexually repressed.  The "fate-worse-than-death view of librarians"&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; is particularly evident in movies such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[The Music Man]]''.

Male movie librarians – mild, intelligent, and timid – have fewer and less important roles.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite journal

Seidl's documentary discusses such stereotypes as:
* A wretched alternate fate is revealed for Mary Hatch Bailey (played by [[Donna Reed]]) in the movie ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946): "She's an old maid. She never married...She's just about to close up the library!"
* The staggeringly rude and unhelpful librarian (John Rothman) in ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), who barks at Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep) "Do you want me to draw you a map?!"

in contrast with such more well-rounded characters as:
* Librarian Bunny Watson (played by [[Katharine Hepburn]]) who teaches Richard Sumner (played by [[Spencer Tracy]]) a few things about modern research methods in the movie ''[[Desk Set]]'' (1957).
* The no-nonsense "Marian the Librarian" ([[Shirley Jones]]) in the movie ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]''.

=== ''The Pagemaster'' (1994 film) ===
In 1994's live-action animated film ''[[The Pagemaster]]'', frightened and pessimistic Richard Tyler ([[Macaulay Culkin]]) is sent on an errand by his parents but ends up caught in a thunderstorm. He takes shelter in a library, where he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey ([[Christopher Lloyd]]), who encourages Richard to get a library card, despite Richard's protests that he doesn't want a book while he waits out the storm. Mr. Dewey tells Richard that a library card is a "passport to the wonderful and quite unpredictable world of books."

While Richard looks for a phone, he accidentally falls. When he awakens, the library art around him is melting and overtakes him - turning everything into animated illustrations. Richard befriends three books and has to overcome obstacles from classic literature to get back to his real life. At the end of the film, Mr. Dewey "bends the rules" and allows Richard to check out all three books (even though the library has a borrow policy of only two books). Mr. Dewey also smiles to Richard as he leaves, hinting that Mr. Dewey is actually the Pagemaster and none of the adventure was a dream. Mr. Dewey introduced Richard to the adventures possible in libraries and books as he "knows just how magical of a place a library can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/65173-11-of-the-coolest-librarians-from-pop-culture-because-not-every-librarian-is-like-the-one|title=11 Of The Coolest Librarians From Pop Culture, Because Not Every Librarian Is Like the One From Your High School|last=Trombetta|first=Sadie L.|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other examples ===
Librarians are usually ordinary people caught up in circumstances, rather than being heroes; likewise they are rarely villainous although they may have flaws, such as racism in ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]''.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

Other movie appearances of librarians noted in the literature include:
* Mary (played by [[Parker Posey]]) as the ultimate ''[[Party Girl (1995 film)|Party Girl]]'' (1995) who discovers, "I want to be a librarian!" in a notable exception to the prim librarian stereotype.&lt;ref name="Peresie"/&gt;
* Alicia Hull (Bette Davis), a small town librarian, who befriends young Freddie Slater (Kevin Coughlin) but is herself ostracised for refusing to remove a book on Communism from the public library during the height of the Red Scare in ''[[Storm Center]]'' (1956). This movie was inspired by the real-life dismissal of [[Ruth W. Brown|Ruth Brown]], a librarian in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;

In ''[[Only Two Can Play]]'' [[Peter Sellers]] plays the role of a poorly paid and professionally frustrated [[Wales|Welsh]] librarian and occasional drama critic, whose affections fluctuate between glamorous Liz and his long-suffering wife Jean.

The 1999 movie''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' has a main character, Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) who is a librarian. The character is awesomely clumsy and later moves away from her profession in the sequels. But a memorable quote from her, upon introduction to the other main character shows a more positive depiction of librarians:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Evelyn''': "Look, I... I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure-seeker, or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell, but I am proud of what I am."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Rick:''' "And what is that?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Evelyn:''' "I... am a librarian."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s 2013  film [[Monsters University]], Alison Nastasi of Flavorwire says the university librarian "isn’t fond of noise and doesn’t think twice about tossing rowdy students out the window into a pond below".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/424214/our-favorite-pop-culture-librarians/7|title=Our Favorite Pop Culture Librarians|last=Natasi|first=Alison|date=2013-11-09|work=|newspaper=Flavorwire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

The television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1997-2003) featured the character of [[Rupert Giles]] as school librarian at Sunnydale High and mentor for the main character of Buffy. At the start of the series Giles is often portrayed stereotypically, for example he wears old-fashioned clothes and spectacles, is intelligent and well-read though has a dislike for computers, and is overly concerned with following regulations. As the series progresses the character is given the opportunity to develop beyond these stereotypes as we learn that Giles was a rebellious and angry teenager who was partly responsible for the death of a friend after dabbling in dark magic. He is also depicted at being competent with weaponry and hand-to-hand combat and at playing the guitar and singing. Though Giles never has a long-lasting on-screen relationship and has never been married, he does have brief romances on screen and is acknowledged as an attractive man by other characters in the show; therefore at least partially refuting the usual stereotype.

From 2004-2008, the [[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]] fantasty-adventure television film franchise, [[The Librarian (franchise)|''The Librarian'']], aired on TNT. The three films focus on a librarian (portrayed by [[Noah Wyle]]) who protects secret artifacts in the Metropolitan Public Library in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/04/10/tnt-greenlights-the-librarians-franchise-as-a-series-with-rebecca-romijn|title=TNT greenlights 'The Librarians' franchise as a series|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film franchise led to the television series [[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|''The Librarians'']]  which began airing in 2014 on TNT. It follows a new team of librarians who solve mysteries, recover powerful artifacts, and fight against supernatural threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/04/10/the-librarians-tv-series-tnt-rebecca-romijn-noah-wyle/|title=TNT Orders Librarians Series Starring Rebecca Romijn, Leverage Fave; Noah Wyle to Recur|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|last2=|first2=|date=2014-04-10|website=TVLine|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 "[[Ron and Tammy]]" episode of the NBC comedy series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', Leslie Knope's dreams of a local park are almost squashed by Tammy, the new library director at the Pawnee Public Library and Ron Swanson's ex-wife. Tammy places a claim for the lot that Leslie intended to use for her park. Tammy then tries to sexually manipulate Ron into giving her the lot for the library. Leslie calls librarians "diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats" as well as "punk-ass book jockeys." In "[[Ron &amp; Tammy: Part Two|Ron and Tammy: II]]", Leslie says Tammy is "just a manipulative, psychotic, library book-peddling, sex-crazed, she-demon." Tammy also has books on "Approved" and "Rejected" shelves, which insinuate that the library operates in a biased manner. The depictions of the library on ''Parks and Recreation'' "illuminate the nature of library anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewell|first=Eamon|title="Punk-Ass Book Jockeys": Library Anxiety in the Television Programs Community and Parks and Recreation|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2587&amp;context=libphilprac|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season two episode six of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' entitled "Caged", actor [[Michael A. Goorjian]] plays Aaron Pratt, an autistic librarian who witnesses the death of a colleague.

In currently running SyFy show ''The Magicians'' (based on the series by Lev Grossman), the Library of the Neitherlands is an archive that contains all of the knowledge in the universe. Librarians formed the Order of the Librarians, a group that protects that knowledge. The Library is staffed by Zelda Schiff, a prim, glasses-and-cardigan wearing librarian whose biggest concern is possible defacement of library books.

| quote       = Although the spinster image of librarians persisted, the sexy librarian emerged as a formidable rival.  She found her way into advertisements and, surprisingly, into politics with the emergence of Sarah Palin.  Conservative yet fashionable in dress, she served as a voice for conventional values.  That coupled with her recognizable frames made her an example of what the sexy librarian looks like.

'''Malaparte''' was an American [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[theater company]] based in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==History==
While driving cross-country in 1991, actors [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] and [[Ethan Hawke]] and playwright [[Jonathan Marc Sherman]] decided to form a theater company.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Emma (February 8, 2013). [http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/jonathan-marc-sherman-clive/ "Life's a Baal for Jonathan Marc Sherman,"] ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''. Retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Actors [[Robert Sean Leonard]], [[Frank Whaley]], and [[Steve Zahn]] joined the fledgling enterprise, which Hawke named after an obscure novel.&lt;ref name="sternbergh"&gt;Sternbergh, Adam (January 31, 2010). [http://nymag.com/arts/theater/profiles/63419/ "The Ethan Hawke Actors Studio,"] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. Retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard later explained, "We would be sitting around New York a lot, and we bowled a lot, and eventually we thought, 'When we're not doing anything, why don't we see if we can put some new plays on?'"&lt;ref name="baltimore"&gt;Rousuck, J. Wynn (March 16, 1997). [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-03-16/news/1997075159_1_glass-menagerie-robert-sean-leonard-vasen/2 "Model Role Actor,"] ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. Retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaparte's first production was a new translation of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s 1918 play ''[[:it:Ma non è una cosa seria (Pirandello)|A Joke]]'' starring Hamilton, Hawke, Sherman, [[Cynthia Nixon]], and [[Austin Pendleton]], which ran from October 9–31, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, John, ed. ''Theater World: 1992-1993 Season.'' New York: Applause, 1995. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The company operated for three seasons in the 1990s as the members juggled film and television work; there were often disputes over fundraising, casting, and play selection.&lt;ref name="sternbergh"/&gt; Shows were performed in rented venues throughout Manhattan, with a flat $10 ticket price.&lt;ref name="baltimore"/&gt; In 1992, [[Jason Blum]] joined Malaparte as producing director and personally hawked fliers in Times Square, shouting, "Don't go see some Broadway show! Come see a new play by an American playwright!"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Amy (October 19, 2015). [http://www.laweekly.com/arts/can-budget-slasher-jason-blum-prove-the-way-hollywood-makes-movies-is-horrifyingly-wrong-6176088 "Can Budget-Slasher Jason Blum Prove the Way Hollywood Makes Movies Is Horrifyingly Wrong?,"] ''[[LA Weekly]]''. Retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' critic [[Hilton Als]] wrote that the Malaparte collective "brought a new take on male anxiety to the American theatre, and was not embarrassed by its love of women, or its romanticism."&lt;ref&gt;Als, Hilton (October 29, 2007). [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/10/29/boys-to-men "Boys to Men,"] ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaparte officially dissolved in 2000, in part because the members wanted to devote more time to their children.&lt;ref&gt;Landman, Beth, and Ian Spiegelman (May 15, 2000).

'''Midrash HaGadol''' or '''The Great Midrash''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''מדרש הגדול''')  was written by Rabbi [[David Adani]] of Yemen (14th century) compilation of [[aggadic midrashim]] on the [[Pentateuch]] taken from the two [[Talmuds]] and earlier [[Midrashim]] of Yemenite provenance.&lt;ref&gt;All of the extant manuscripts used in printing the ''Midrash HaGadol'' were taken out of Yemen, and/or are in the possession of Yemenite Jewish families. In the ''Midrash HaGadol''`s Introduction to the Book of Deuteronomy, it cites the various manuscripts used in reproducing its printed copy, one of which belonging to Yosef and Avraham Sharabi; one of which now in the Hebrew University Library collection; four of which in the ''[[Mossad HaRav Kook]]'' library collection; one of which belonging to the Ben-Zvi Institute library collection; one of which being a private collection belonging to Dr. Meir Benayahu; and the last one belonging to the Bodleian Library collection in Oxford, England (opp. add. 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 124a), all of which being of Yemenite Jewish provenance. There is another manuscript now in the Berlin ''Staatsbibliothek'' Library (Or. 1207), also of Yemenite Jewish provenance, as noted in its colophon. In the Introduction to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Numbers), ''Mossad Harav Kook'' edition, other manuscripts are also mentioned, one of which belonging to Azriel Abyadh-HaLivni; another belonging to the late Yisrael Yeshayahu; another belonging to Rabbi Yechiel Shelomo Kessar; another to Rabbi Shalom Tzabari; another to the Rambam Library in Tel-Aviv; and yet another to the Dr. Israel Mehlmann Library in Jerusalem, ''inter alia''. Other manuscripts were known to be in the possession of the late Rabbi Shalom b. Yosef Halevi Alsheikh and of the Hibshush brothers in Tel-Aviv, as well as private collections in the hand of the late Mordechai Margulies and of Rabbi Y. L. HaCohen Fishman, as noted in the Introduction to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Genesis), ''Mosad HaRav Kook'' edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it borrows quotations from the [[Targums]], and [[Maimonides]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the ''Midrash HaGadol'' on Exodus 30:34 (''Mossad HaRav Kook'' edition), s.v. '''נטף ושחלת וחלבנה''', the glosses makes note of the fact that the quotation used in the ''Midrash HaGadol'' on the Holy Incense has been taken directly from Maimonides' [[Mishneh Torah]] (''Seder Avodah''), ''Hil. Kelei HaMikdash'' 2:4, whose words are these: '''והשחלת היא הציפורן שנותנין בני אדם במוגמרות, וחלבנה כמו דבש שחור היא וריחה קשה והיא שרף אילנות בערי יון'''. There are many other scattered excerpts taken from Maimonides' Code of Jewish Law, and Zvi Meir Rabinowitz makes note of this anomaly in his Preface to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Numbers) in the ''Mossad HaRav Kook'' edition, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kabbalistic]] writings {{Harv|Oesterley|Box|1920}}, and in this aspect is unique among the various midrashic collections. This important work—the largest of the midrashic collections—came to popular attention only relatively recently (late 19th century) through the efforts of [[Jacob Saphir]], [[Solomon Schecter]], and [[David Zvi Hoffman]]. In addition to containing midrashic material that is not found elsewhere, such as the ''Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai'', the Midrash HaGadol contains what are considered to be more correct versions of previously known [[Talmudic]] and [[Midrashic]] passages.

== Discovery ==
The existence of the ''Midrash HaGadol'' was first brought to the attention of Jewish scholarship by [[Jacob Sapir]], who in his ''Even Sapir'' (1866) reports seeing a manuscript of the work in the possession of the Chief Rabbi of [[Jews of Yemen|Yemen]] {{Harv|Fish|1957}}. His remarks about the "discovery" are reproduced in {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}},&lt;ref&gt;''Midrash HaGadol'', on Book of Numbers, Forward written by Fish, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38104&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=5&amp;hilite= pp.5–ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a work on the entire [[Pentateuch]] containing "twice as much as our [[Midrash Rabbah]]". (It is worth noting that while this collection was new to European Jewry, it was probably well known to the [[Jews of Yemen]].) The first manuscript was brought from [[Yemen]] to [[Jerusalem]] and then to [[Berlin]] in 1878 by a certain Mr. Shapira, and this Midrash subsequently became the subject of much scholarly attention. There are currently approximately two hundred manuscripts of this work residing in various public and private Hebraica collections, according to the catalog of the ''Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts''.
[[File:Midrash hagadol manuscript.png|thumb|left|350 px|Manuscript page from '''Midrash HaGadol''' on Genesis.]]
The ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was first published by [[Solomon Schecter]] in 1902. A large portion of ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] was then published by [[David Zvi Hoffman]] in 1913. ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Numbers]] was published by S. Fisch in 1940 in a more accessible style than the previous efforts, which were principally arranged for a scholarly audience. More recent editions listed by {{Harvtxt|Strack|Stemberger|1991}} are those on Genesis and Exodus by M. Margulies (1967), on [[Leviticus]] by E.N. Rabinowitz (1932) and [[A. Steinsalz]] (1975), on Numbers by E.N. Rabinowitz (1973), and on [[Deuteronomy]] by S. Fish (1972). The [[Mossad HaRav Kook]] Institute in Jerusalem has also published a five-volume edition.

== Authorship ==
According to {{Harvtxt|Higger|1934}}, the work dates to the late 14th century. A discussion of its authorship is provided in {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}}, wherein he reviews the evidence in favor of the three then-prevailing opinions regarding authorship of the Midrash HaGadol, variously that it is the work of [[Rambam]], his son [[Abraham ben Rambam]], the author according to [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]] (an opinion disputed in later generations),&lt;ref&gt;See ''infra''., note on Avraham Al-Naddaf.&lt;/ref&gt; or David bar Amram al-Adeni.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Al-Naddaf]], in his book, ''Ḥoveret Seridei Teiman'' (חוברת שרידי תימן), published in Jerusalem in 1928, pp. 7a-b (letter "gimel"), and which contains an inventory of books of Yemenite Jewish provenance, attributes the book to David bar Amram al-Adeni. See ''Ḥoveret Seridei Teiman'', [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32338&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=14&amp;hilite= pp. 14–15] in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; After discounting [[Rambam]] as a possible author, and reviewing some compelling factors in favor of the other two possible authors, {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}} offers the conciliatory hypothesis that the work was composed in the [[Arabic language]] by [[Abraham ben Rambam]], and translated into Hebrew by David al-Adeni. While Dr. Fish offers possible explanations for how the work—if indeed authored by Abraham ben Rambam in [[Egypt]]—came first to be "lost" and then to be rediscovered in Yemen, {{Harvtxt|Strack|Stemberger|1991}} find the attribution to Abraham ben Rambam "only extremely weakly attested," and report that modern scholars almost uniformly attribute the work in its entirety to David bar Amram al-Adeni. S. Fish concedes this as well in his [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] article on the topic.

== Sources ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
The ''Midrash HaGadol'' contains material from [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon]], [[Sifre Zutta]], [[Mekilta le-Sefer Devarim|Mekhilta on Deuteronomy]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael]], [[Sifre]], and other unknown midrashic sources. In addition, the midrash makes use of the work of [[Rambam]] and [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]], as well as many [[geonic]] writings {{Harv|Strack|Stemberger|1991}}, but the sources are never cited—a unique characteristic of this midrash {{Harv|Fisch|1940}}. All these various sources are fused in such a way that the product is a new literary creation in which the original ingredients can frequently not be unambiguously discriminated.

A "Midrash HaGadol that was brought from [[Aden]]" is cited by [[Joseph Shalit Riqueti]] in ''Sefer Chochmat HaMishkan'' (1676), but it is not known whether this is the same as the work under consideration here.

==Governance and history==
One In Ten is overseen by a board of three officers and nine board members.  A full-time, paid executive director oversees the day-to-day operations of the organization.  All One In Ten programs, including Reel Affirmations, are conceived, organized and implemented by volunteers.

One In Ten was co-founded by Barry Becker, Mark Betchkal, Matthew Cibellis and Keith Clark, [[gay]] residents of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Plowman"&gt;Plowman, "Rehoboth Beach Film Fest Makes A Splash at the Box Office," ''Delaware Today,'' October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The four began meeting in 1990, and founded One In Ten as the parent organization for Reel Affirmations.&lt;ref name="Howe"&gt;Howe, "Gay and Lesbian Festival," ''Washington Post,'' October 16, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The four sought the advice and input of [[Frameline]], then the largest LGBT gay film festival in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Plowman" /&gt; With financial and administrative assistance from Frameline, the first Reel Affirmations film festival opened on October 11, 1991.

==Capital Pride==
In 1995, One In Ten assumed responsibility for organizing Washington, D.C.'s Gay Pride Day events after the festival's original sponsoring organization nearly went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Nguyen, "Celebrating the Right to Celebrate," ''Washington Post,'' June 10, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; One In Ten moved the street festival from Francis Junior High to [[Freedom Plaza]] near the [[White House]] on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue N.W.]]&lt;ref&gt;Loose, "Goal of Gay March Is Freedom Plaza," ''Washington Post,'' June 15, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization also changed the festival's parade route. Instead of traveling south from [[Meridian Hill Park]] and then westward on P Street N.W. to finish at Francis Junior High School, the parade now began at the school, moved east along P Street N.W. to 14th Street N.W., and then south on 14th Street to Freedom Plaza.&lt;ref name="Chibbaro"&gt;Chibbaro, "Politics Take Backseat at Pride," ''Washington Blade,'' June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Capital Pride Takes to the Streets," ''Washington Post,'' June 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the financial and organizational strain of producing the event proved too heavy for the arts group. In 1997, [[Whitman-Walker Clinic]] joined One In Ten as a co-sponsor of the festival, and the event was renamed [[Capital Pride (Washington)|Capital Pride]]. The street festival was moved off Freedom Plaza and onto [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] N.W. between 14th and 10th Streets N.W.&lt;ref name="Chibbaro" /&gt; Corporate sponsorships also rose dramatically, reflecting the festival's growing commercial nature. Corporate sponsorships reached $247,000 in 1999, up from $80,000 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Allam, "Taking to the Streets With Capital Pride," ''Washington Post,'' June 14, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Whitman-Walker Clinic became the sole co-sponsor of Capital Pride, although One In Ten continued to serve on the festival's community board along with other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, "At 25, Pride Hits Its Stride," Washington Post, June 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Children’s Art Archive''', popularly known as '''PapaInk''', served as the archival home of children's art between 1999-2006. Prior to its closing, the nonprofit organization's archival website documented and exhibited children's art collections from its own physical holdings as well as presenting works donated or shared by organizations and individuals worldwide. The result was to bring to public view collections that would otherwise remain largely unseen, and to bring together widely dispersed works of children's art in a single, dedicated context.

PapaInk made available an international sampling of historical children's art, works by contemporary children and the childhood work of professional artists. Selected holdings, from important partnerships the organization formed, such as the Jewish Museum in Prague's WWII era Terezín collection and the Christian Children's Fund collection spanning 60 years, provided works of established historical value a long-term broad-based public exposure for the first time through presentation on the organization’s online archive. Other holdings, such as works contributed by nonprofits, businesses, professional artists, educators and young artists themselves, were brought within the purview of historical and contemporary appreciation by virtue of The PapaInk’s exhibition and preservation efforts.

The depth and breadth of the organization’s holdings gave rise to an often noted unique and surprisingly profound experience of children's art which attracted the attention of important arbiters of culture and art such as the New York Times&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/technology/online-diary.html NY Times article]&lt;/ref&gt; and Art in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Art in America|date=July 2002|volume=66|issue=702|pages=64|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA87424560&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=20200&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dignity of each piece and each collection was heightened by its placement within—and relationship to – the organization’s substantial, respectfully presented body of children's work. The total effect was a transformed sense of children's art and of children's expressive capacities.
During its years of operation, PapaInk attracted in excess of 12 million visitors to digital archive. As the singularly rich resource of children's expression and experience during its time of operation, PapaInk attracted a world audience of libraries, schools, academicians, parents, children and members of arts communities.

In addition to its collection of children’s art, PapaInk’s online magazine dedicated to parenting contained a wealth of resources, included an eclectic blend of interviews conducted by the organization’s founder Marc Feldman, including interviews with Maurice Sendak (Where The Wild Things Are),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/maurice-sendak/about-maurice-sendak/701/ About Maurive Sendal]&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Kauffman (At Home In the Universe),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santafe.edu/about/people/profile/Stuart%20Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt; Max Oelschlaeger (The Idea of Wilderness)&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300053708&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taj Mahal]] (Señor Blues), Watts Whacker (The 500-Year Delta),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr7xxA2J0y8&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Kellogg (A Rose For Pinkerton),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readingrockets.org/books/interviews/kellogg/&lt;/ref&gt; and Walter Cronkite (CBS News).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/walter-cronkite/about-walter-cronkite/561/&lt;/ref&gt;

PapaInk!'s published interviews were part of its "iPapa Project," a project which PapaInk described as "an independent initiative that seeks to foster the fullest possible involvement by fathers and society in encouraging the creative spirit of children. The project recognizes the critical role that men play in children's lives. Interviews with noted individuals as well as excerpts from thinkers in different disciplines on the topics of fathering and creativity form the heart of this project. Fathering=Life!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PapaInk! - iPapa Project |url=http://www.papaink.org/ipapa/home/index.html |publisher=PapaInk! - iPapa Project |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202230231/http://www.papaink.org/ipapa/home/index.html |archivedate=December 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond engaging the public as viewers and appreciators of children's works, PapaInk provided a venue for young artists, their families and communities to exhibit and preserve their art. The organization also worked with 200+ businesses, nonprofits and libraries to sponsor children's art collections that were displayed and archived on PapaInk. Central to PapaInk's collection development activities was the efforts of a worldwide network of 500+ volunteers who contributed personal and institutional collections, and gathered children's art from their local communities for archival exhibition on PapaInk.  PapaInk provided its archival, display, marketing and PR services at no-cost
In helping to reconstitute the legacy of children's art, PapaInk furthered its vision of a world encouraging of and revitalized by the creative spirit of youth.

==Projects And Calls For Art==

'''...A Sense of Home'''
framed|left|Building A Sense of Home (A PapaInk! - Habitat for Humanity Project)
In 2003, following discussions with PapaInk's founder Marc Feldman and First Lady Rosalynn Carter of [[Habitat for Humanity]], PapaInk issued an international call for Children's Art and Youth Art in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity International and its worldwide affiliates.  
The project, "On the Map: Building a Sense of Home" was designed to bring "together young people's capacity to express a sense of home that is at once practical and visionary."  The stated goal of the project was to:

"...Establish a world historical transcription of home through the art of youth. Working through Habitat for Humanity's global volunteer and affiliate networks and PapaInk's worldwide volunteer base and network of non-profit organizations...involving young people from the widest possible range of communities and cultures...to take part by creating a piece of art that captures their sense of home—lived, wished or imagined.  Through the act of expressing a vision of home, young people give their vision a material force. Brought together in a serious archival setting, young people's articulations form a blueprint for building a shared sense of home grounded in the particulars of individual and community needs and warmed by the universals of comfort and care.   The On the Map: Building a Sense of Home art collection will stand as a dramatic living document that creatively re-maps the familiar terrain of home. It will make young people's expressions a vital part of cultural experience and social engagement. And the positive action the project aims to inspire will expand and deepen the sense of home children and youth carry into the future" (PapaInk Press Release)

'''...When They Were Children'''

In March 2002, PapaInk initiated its innovative and highly successful call for the childhood and early youth art of professional artists.
With the help of a well developed network of partners in the art and culture space, such as the high-traffic site [[World Wide Arts Resources Corp]] and the high-profile arts magazine [[Art in America]], PapaInk's "When They Were Children" became an annual call for the early child and youth artworks of professional artists. As described by PapaInk's founder Marc Feldman, in a press release, project, "Artists worldwide are invited take part in a historic rebuilding and recovery of a vital missing element in the cultural record--the creative expression of childhood."  ""When They Were Children" functions as the spirit and substance of artists' collective creative history, and as a material legacy and imaginative fuel for young artists today." (PapaInk Press Release - March 2002). The call to art was "open to all practicing artists with extant works from childhood or memories of epiphanic moments of early creative discovery. [With] All selected artwork and texts will be exhibited within the "When They Were Children" Collection [...] appearing within the online venue of PapaInk's world-noted archive of historical and contemporary children's art expected to attract over one million visitors in 2003."  (PapaInk Press release - March 2002).  The Project included not only the childhood works of professional artists, but commentaries and childhood writings submitted by the artists, such as Brent Hallard:

''"...I can see the hand move, at first nervous, touching paper, and then, drawing intricate circles within circles and marks inside. The shirt had five buttons showing. And the shirt on the person he had drawn had exactly the same number of buttons. He then, after checking that the number of buttons on paper and shirt correspond, goes on to draw shoes and laces, and later, legs that bend, run, and jump. This boy knew he had discovered in life—and on paper—a secret world."

==PapaInk! - The iCurate Project==

Well in advance of other art sites (whether children or adult oriented), Papaink!'s iCurate program invited for professional and non-professional art curators to "take part in a world historical project to collect and preserve the artwork of children contemporary and past. Children's Art Curators are at the heart of PapaInk's mission to reinject the creative spirit of children into human discourse and everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PapaInk! - iCurate Program |url=http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |publisher=PapaInk.org |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030413193930/http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |archivedate=April 13, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As described by PapaInk!, its "curators work within their local communities around the world to"

"Recognize the artistic accomplishments of children, and honor their works in a historically and culturally meaningful context"
"Rescue and archive children's works of art"
"Assemble collections of children's art that reflect and reinforce children's contributions to community life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PapaInk! iCurate Program |url=http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |publisher=PapaInk.org |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030413193930/http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |archivedate=April 13, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PapaInk's call for father's day art (papa's day art)'''

"June 2003 -- Call to young artists! Submit artwork related to fathers and father-figures for permanent digital exhibition on PapaInk. The Father's Day Art Collection will recognize and honor the bond between fathers/father-figures and children. Each submitted piece will be included in the collection and displayed to audiences worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call for Papa's Day Art! |url=http://www.papaink.org/icurator/fathers_day.html |publisher=PapaInk.org |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202221254/http://www.papaink.org/icurator/fathers_day.html |archivedate=December 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PapaInk is the archival home of children's art. The nonprofit organization's archival site documents and exhibits children's art collections from its own physical holdings and presents works donated or shared by organizations and individuals worldwide. The result is to bring to public view collections that would otherwise remain largely unseen, and to bring together widely dispersed works of children's art in a single, dedicated context.

PapaInk makes available an extensive international sampling of historical children's art, works by contemporary children and the childhood work of professional artists. Selected holdings, such as the Jewish Museum in Prague's WWII era Terezín collection and the Christian Children's Fund collection spanning 60 years, are works of established historical value given permanent, broad-based public exposure for the first time through presentation on PapaInk. Other holdings, such as works contributed by nonprofits, businesses, professional artists, educators and young artists themselves, are brought within the purview of historical and contemporary appreciation by virtue of PapaInk's exhibition and preservation efforts.

The depth and breadth of PapaInk's holdings give rise to a unique and surprisingly profound experience of children's art. The dignity of each piece and each collection is heightened by its placement within—and relationship to—PapaInk's substantial, respectfully presented body of children's work. The total effect is a transformed sense of children's art and of children's expressive capacities.

More and more people are experiencing this transformation first-hand. PapaInk expects to draw 1.5 million visitors to its digital archive this year alone. As a singularly rich resource of children's expression and experience, PapaInk attracts a world audience of libraries, schools, academicians, parents, children and members of arts communities.

Beyond engaging the public as viewers and appreciators of children's works, PapaInk provides a venue for young artists, their families and communities to exhibit and preserve their art.

'''New York Times Review'''
"For some, ''children's art'' is an oxymoron. Can the young create museum-worthy art? At PapaInk, the Children's Art Archive (papaink.org), an argument is made for children's art as a neglected part of our cultural heritage.

Founded in 1999 by Marc Feldman, a former philosophy professor, PapaInk displays more than 20,000 children's works of art and plans to triple in size this year. (Its name reflects the role of adults in nurturing children's creativity.) The goal is to build an audience for children's art by digitizing collections scattered across the world and displaying them in context at a central location. (Submissions are also welcome.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LiCalzi O'Connell|first=Pamela|title=Children's Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/technology/online-diary.html|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet Scout Review'''
"An amazing resource and unique tribute to the oft under-recognized value of children's art, PapaInk archives and makes available works that otherwise certainly would have been overlooked by everyone but the creators and their immediate loved ones. Founded in 1999 with a mission preserving and posting children's artwork, PapaInk has grown in significance and status ever since. Serving as a crossroads for art sharing and appreciation, the site features several collections, some arranged by theme, others by artists or gallery. Showcasing art from around the world, Papaink is a global forum. Visitors to the site can both view and forward links of what they appreciate to others. Many of the featured works offer detailed captions and descriptions, allowing visitors more intimate glimpses into the lives and minds of the young artists that created them. Convinced that what children see is every bit as valid as what adults do, Papaink is dedicated to helping preserve those visions and all they express."&lt;ref name="Internet Scout"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Papaink!

'''Peggy Stuart Coolidge''' (19 July 1913 – 7 May 1981)&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers'' says she died on 31 May 1981, but both the ''New York Times'' obituary and the Harvard University Library site say the date was 7 May 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[composer]] and [[conducting|conductor]].  She was one of the first female American composers to have a recording devoted to her symphonic works, and the first American composer (male or female) to have a concert devoted entirely to her works presented in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=liner&gt;Liner notes to the Vox recording "Peggy Stuart Coolidge: American Reflections"&lt;/ref&gt;  Although she does not [[musical quotation|quote]] particular melodies, her compositional style is accessible and influenced by American folk and popular idioms; her success at creating a distinctly American musical voice places her among such figures as [[Charles Ives]], [[Aaron Copland]] and [[George Gershwin]].

Peggy Stuart was born in [[Swampscott, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt;&lt;ref name=greene/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; She started piano lessons at age five, wrote her first song at age nine, and later studied with [[Heinrich Gebhard]] (a pupil of [[Teodor Leszetycki]] and teacher of [[Leonard Bernstein]]), privately with Raymond Robinson, and at the [[New England Conservatory]] with [[Quincy Porter]].  She originally planned to be a concert [[pianist]], and her early mature works are all for [[piano]].

In 1937, she wrote a ballet ''Cracked Ice'', for the Boston Skating Club.  This was the first ballet ever composed specifically for [[ice skating]].&lt;ref name=liner/&gt;  The work was scored, at her request, by [[Ferde Grofé]], who conducted it at [[Madison Square Garden]]; it was also played by the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] under [[Arthur Fiedler]].  Stuart then studied orchestration.  Her orchestral scores ''Night Froth'', ''The Island'' (sinfonietta), ''Smoke Drift'' and ''Twilight City'' (piano and orchestra) were all premiered by the Boston Pops.

During [[World War II]], she was involved in a housing bureau for servicemen stationed in [[Boston]], and often played for hospitalised soldiers.  She conducted an all-woman ensemble, and was pianist and assistant conductor of the [[Women's Symphony of Boston]].   She founded the [[Junior League Orchestra]] in Boston and conducted it for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0835827/bio IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; After the war she moved to [[New York City]], and started a research project in music [[psychotherapy]] at a mental institution.

In 1952 she married Joseph R. Coolidge, a freelance writer from Boston.  Together they wrote a number of children's stories with Peggy's background music, and other songs in traditional folk style.  She wrote her only film score for ''[[The Silken Affair]]'', starring [[David Niven]], in 1956.  She wrote [[incidental music]] for a New York production of [[Seán O'Casey]]'s ''[[Red Roses for Me (play)|Red Roses for Me]]'', and the music was later reworked as the orchestral suite ''Dublin Town''.  In 1963 and 1965, she was invited to [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Moscow]] for performances of her works, also sometimes appearing as piano soloist.  She and Joseph met [[Aram Khachaturian]] and his wife [[Nina Makarova]], becoming close friends.  A ballet ''An Evening in New York'' was written on her return to the United States.

''Rhapsody for Harp and Orchestra'' was written in 1965.  In 1967 her works were played in [[Tokyo]] in a concert of American music, and she was received by Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s brother, [[Prince Mikasa]].  In 1969 Peggy Stuart Coolidge wrote ''Spirituals in Sunshine and Shadow'', an orchestral work inspired by African-American [[blues]] and [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]].

In 1970 she wrote ''Pioneer Dances'', inspired by the 19th century settlers of America.  This was the only American work played at a 1975 [[Carnegie Hall]] concert to commemorate the 150th anniversary of [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigration to the United States.&lt;ref name=liner/&gt;

In 1970 also, at Khachaturian's instigation, she became the first American composer to have a concert devoted entirely to her works presented in the [[Soviet Union]].  She was awarded the medal of the Soviet Union of Workers in Art on this occasion.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~mus00007|title=Coolidge, Peggy Stuart. Collection of musical scores, 1924–1981: Guide|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name started to become better known, and she was featured in concerts in Western Europe and [[East Berlin]].

In 1971, at the request of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]], she composed a three-minute theme to complement the fund's visual symbol of a [[giant panda]] on a green field.  The theme became the basis for a ten-minute orchestral work with narration written by her husband, called ''Blue Planet''.  That year also saw ''New England Autumn'', a two-movement suite for chamber orchestra.

In 1975, the [http://www.classicsonline.com/orchestrabio/Westphalian_Symphony_Orchestra/ Westphalian Symphony Orchestra] conducted by [[Siegfried Landau]] recorded one of the first LPs ever devoted to the works of a single American female composer.  The works were the ''Rhapsody for Harp and Orchestra'' (with soloist [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/18/classified/paid-notice-deaths-von-wurtzler-aristid.html?sec=&amp;spon= Aristid von Würtzler]), ''New England Autumn'', ''Pioneer Dances'', and ''Spirituals in Sunshine and Shadow''.

She later wrote a song cycle to words by American poets, to honour the art patron [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]], her husband's great-aunt. ''American Mosaic'' was written in 1978 on a commission by the [[American Wind Symphony Orchestra|American Wind Symphony]].&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt;

Peggy Stuart Coolidge died of cancer in [[Cushing, Maine]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/01/obituaries/peggy-stuart-coolidge-composer-and-pianist.html New York Times obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her musical scores are held at the [[Harvard University Library]].&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt;

Many of her premieres took place in Europe, and she is better known overseas than she is in her own country.&lt;ref name=greene&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m3S7PIxe0mwC&amp;pg=PA1420&amp;lpg=PA1420&amp;dq=peggy+stuart+coolidge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KT7RyPUbX4&amp;sig=7yOkeZh75noDVXD1hWxdwUNNIAM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=73TmScWeKseGkQXCz4GBBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 David Mason Greene, ''Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers'']&lt;/ref&gt;  However, she is one of the few 20th century American women composers whose works were performed and recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosting.stormfrontproductions.net/~lafayett/nicks_notes/ Nick's Notes]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">'''Presentationism''' (from Latin ''prae-esse'', ''praesens'', present) is a philosophical term used in various senses deriving from the general sense of the term ''presentation''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Presentationism |volume=22 |page=298 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] (cf. ''Manual of Psychology'', i. 57), presentations are whatever constituents or our total experience at any moment directly determine the nature of the object as it is perceived or thought of at that moment. In [[James Mark Baldwin|Baldwin]]'s ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', vol. ii., a presentation is an object in the special form under which it is cognized at any given moment of perceptual or ideational process. This, the widest definition of the term, due largely to Professor [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]], thus includes both perceptual and ideational processes. The term has, indeed, been narrowed so as to include ideation, the correlative representation being utilized for ideal presentation, but in general the wider use is preferred.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

When the mind is cognizing an object, the object presents itself to the senses or to thought in one of a number of different forms (e.g. a picture is a work of art, a saleable commodity, a representation of a house, etc.). Presentation is thus essentially a cognitive process. Hence the most important use of the term presentationism, which is defined by Ward, in ''Mind'', N.S. (1893), ii. 58, as a doctrine the gist of which is that all the elements of psychical life are primarily and ultimately cognitive elements. This use takes precedence of two others: (1) that of Hamilton, for presentative as opposed to representative theories of knowledge, and (2) that of some later writers who took it as equivalent to [[Phenomenon|phenomenon]]. Ward traces the doctrine in his sense to [[David Hume]], to whom the mind is a kind of theatre in which perceptions appear and vanish continually (see Green and Grose edition of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;534). The main problem is as to whether psychic activity is presented or not. Ward holds that it is not presented or presentable save indirectly.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2009}}
The '''prompter''' (Fr., Ger. ''souffleur''; It. ''rammentatore'', ''suggeritore'') in an [[opera]] house gives the singers the opening words of each phrase a few seconds early. Prompts are mouthed silently or hurled lyrically in a half-voice, audible (hopefully) only on stage. (This is in contrast to the [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] in a [[Theatre (building)|theatre]] who aids actors who have forgotten their words or lines.)

Opera prompters are traditionally housed in a stuffy wooden box at the center-front edge of the stage, above the [[orchestra pit]]. They are visible to the performers and no one else. Technology has brought [[air conditioner|cool air]] and small display screens, among other advances, to support their work.

Effective prompting can be a challenge. The American prompter Philip Eisenberg recounts the story at a [[Maria Callas]] performance when she needed louder prompts. The famed diva swooped down in a curtsy right in front of the prompter’s box and — mid-curtsy, unnoticed by the audience — gave the Italian command "più forte!" (louder) to her boxed colleague.{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Prompters attend all rehearsals, mark up any adjustments or clarifications to the score, and generally "prepare" singers for a role. Their profile is low, and opera program books often credit them only under "musical preparation" or some similar moniker.

'''Public Netbase''' was a cultural media initiative, open access internet platform, and advocate for the development of electronic art. The project increasingly came into conflict with the Austrian political establishment{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} during the 1990s. It received awards and recognition by [[UNESCO]].

==Early development==
Public Netbase was founded by [[Konrad Becker]] and Francisco de Sousa Webber in Vienna's Messepalast (later renamed to [[Museumsquartier]]) in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use and critical analyses of information and communication technology. Its parent organization was the ''Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0'', founded in 1993.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Public Netbase / t0 |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the Institute's activities after 1994 occurred through Public Netbase, leading to the names and establishment dates being loosely applied, even in the organization's official material. The name of its [[World Wide Web]] server, ''t0'', was often appended to either name as well. During the first years of its existence, Public Netbase shared a space in [[Museumsquartier]] with the initiative ''Depot – Kunst und Diskussion''.&lt;ref&gt;http://depot.or.at/index.php?article_id=1&amp;clang=1. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; After it relocated to own rooms (also in [[Museumsquartier]]), the number of wokshops and instruction courses increased and the program of discursive events was now realized on an almost daily basis.

==Art and culture==
[[Image:Netbase 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2]]
Public Netbase focused on aiding the development of electronic art and the impact of the nascent World Wide Web on culture.  Its own online presence earned it an award for distinction at the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Prix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Ars Electronica 1995 World Wide Web Distinction |url=http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528# |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129084500/http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528 |archivedate=November 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the web space provided through Public Netbase supported Austrian artists, although some hosted projects, such as the [[Transformation Story Archive]], had wider recognition.  The physical location in the Museumsquartier was also used for sponsored events, ranging from art symposia to a conference of the [[Association of Autonomous Astronauts]]&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Association of Autonomous Astronauts' Intergalactic Conference in Vienna, Earth, June 21-22 1997 |date=1997-06-06 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1274&amp;page=1#660 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a "lecture/performance/event" by [[Critical Art Ensemble]] about biotechnology &lt;ref name="CAE"&gt;{{cite press release |title=FLESH MACHINE: A Genexploitation Project |date=1997-11-17 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1475&amp;page=1#940 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of conferences/exhibitions such as ROBOTRONIKA&lt;ref&gt;http://robot.t0.or.at/ Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; (1998) and SYNWORLD&lt;ref name="synworld.t0.or.at"&gt;http://synworld.t0.or.at/. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; (1999).

==Involvement in politics==
When the right-wing [[Austrian Freedom Party]] (FPÖ) and its leader [[Jörg Haider]] began to rise in power in Austria, Public Netbase took an increasingly political activist role while facing increasing government pressure.  Haider accused Public Netbase of sponsoring child pornography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.medialounge.net/lounge/workspace/crashhtml/cc/29.htm| publisher=Crash Media| title=Sex slaves to public opinion - Public Netbase kicks back...| first=Micz| last= Flor| date=1998-11-27| accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conflated Christina Göstl's hosted erotic art with a commercial porn site run from the British Virgin Islands during a speech in parliament.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | publisher=Salon | title=Is it Sex or is it Art? | first=Janelle | last=Brown | date=1998-09-06 | accessdate=2006-10-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901125303/http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | archivedate=2006-09-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Public Netbase sponsored a "virtual alternative to Austria's far right government" that offered Austrian Web Resistance Awards to web sites dedicated to opposing Haider's government.&lt;ref name="GAA"&gt;{{cite web |title=About government-austria.at |url=http://government-austria.at/index.php3?lang=&amp;menuid=about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute for Applied Autonomy]], recipient of an award for distinction in interactive art at the Prix Ars Electronica 2000,&lt;ref name="PAE2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Ars Electronica 2000 Interactive Art Distinction |url=http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2175 |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325043635/http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2175 |archivedate=March 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated their award to Public Netbase for its political efforts.&lt;ref name="PAE2002-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Netbase t0 ist überraschender Preisträger des Prix Ars Electronica 2000 |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about/press/20000905 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another t0-project begun during this period, World-information.org, described as "an ongoing effort to critically observe and investigate new technologies in a societal, economic and artistic context"&lt;ref name="WIO"&gt;{{cite web | title=World-information.org |publisher=Public Netbase |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/projects/wio |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to involvement with the UNESCO ''Digi-Arts'' program&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |title=World-information.org |publisher=UNESCO |date=2004-10-11 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23603&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of conventions across Europe.

However, the organization's successes were insufficient to stave off problems.  Its lease at the Museumsquartier was not renewed after the controversial remodelling period in 2000,&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wassermair |first=M. |title='In Austria, the Clock Ticks with a Different Beat': Short Story of Public Netbase t0, its International Success and Recent Political Struggles |journal=Cultivate Interactive |issue=2 |date=2000-10-16 |issn=1471-3225 |url=http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue2/netbase/ |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it faced a series of audits and other bureaucratic obstacles.  Financial difficulties and an inability to secure a permanent replacement location could not be resolved.&lt;ref name="Support"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Open letter to Michael Häupl, Mayor of Vienna, and the Vienna City Government |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about/press/20040506 |date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite significant community support and a reorganization effort in 2005 that shortened its name to Netbase, the City of Vienna stopped all funding effective January 11, 2006, leading to the immediate shut down of the organization.

The ''Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0'' is still active: Its projects are now mainly conducted through World-Information.Org and World-Information Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/en/. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 it has also been organizing Austria's most prominent online "polling booth" wahlkabine.at &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wahlkabine.at.

Central questions for the conference were: "Has the Internet still its original potential to foster a 'network democracy from below'? Aren't new media already too much compromised by the ever growing state and corporate influence? Can the Internet be reclaimed as a 'digital commons' or has the current crisis already reached a meta media level, beyond propaganda and its mirror counter-campaigns?"

The Free Media Camp aimed at raising public awareness about the extremely precarious situation of independent and participatory media initiatives in Vienna. The camp was established in public space at Vienn''s [[Karlsplatz]] and lasted for almost four months. In sum approximately 100 events (discussions, presentations, music events, screenings...) took place. The camp was organized by Public Netbase in co-operation with local cultural and media initiatives: Malmoe, IG Kultur Wien, Radio Orange 94.0 and Public Voice Lab.&lt;ref&gt;http://future-nonstop.org/c/7b93f0e13e6acf445f9fb66280e54d63.

*nikeground (2003)
This communication guerilla project, which was developed and conducted in co-operation with 0100101110101101.ORG, criticized the accelerating commercialization of public space. Faked announcements informed that [[Karlsplatz]], one of Vienna's historical squares, was going to be renamed to "Nikeplatz" and that as part of this process a 36 meter high monument in form of the Nike-logo would be erected. A two-story glass pavilion located on the square informed about the alleged plans and served as a highly visible sign in public space. The project led to discussions in the arts and cultural scene. At the same time it was sufficiently plausible and spectacular to trigger various forms of citizens' protests and a broad media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t0.or.at/nikeground.

'''Ringbang''' is variously a [[Caribbean]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[music genre]]s, a philosophy, and an [[aesthetic]]&lt;ref name="rollins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |title=Eddy Grant Talks About Ringbang |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811025314/http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |archivedate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; propounded by [[Eddy Grant]] in 1994.

In an interview circa 2000, Grant defined ringbang like this:
{{cquote|Ringbang is the thing that makes the soul quiet. That in a musical concept is [[rhythm]]. A child is given ringbang when a mother rocks it in her arms. Ringbang allowed the slaves to communicate. Ringbang is a bridge that allows us to stop being insular; it is a concept predicated on our being able to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;|1.5em|1.5em}}

In applying ringbang to music, Grant attempted to define a meta-style to encompass all Caribbean rhythms; it was to be a musical [[lingua franca]]. He wished this multicultural style to place no restrictions on [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and he said that he wanted no single country or culture to lay claim to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icerecords.com/ringbang.html |title=Welcome to ringbang! |last=Grant |first=Eddy |authorlink=Eddy Grant |date= |work=Ringbang |publisher=[[Ice Records]] |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among ringbang's stylistic influences are [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]], [[soca music|soca]], [[tuk band|tuk]], and [[zouk]].

Grant says that the word ''ringbang'' comes from vocalists [[scat singing]] "Ringa-ringa-ringbang!". He chose the word one day in 1993, while standing in recording engineer Frank Agarrat's backyard in [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;

==Ringbang music==
In an attempt to popularize ringbang music and its underlying philosophy, Grant asked various recording artists to apply the word (which he [[trademark]]ed)&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|76245553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|77388819}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some of their songs. [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artists [[Grynner]], [[Square One (band)|Square One]], Viking Tundah, and others recorded ringbang tracks for Grant's [[record label]]s, [[Ice Records]] and Blue Wave Records. Among the ringbang albums on these labels were ''Fire in de Wave'' (1994), ''Ringbang Rebel Dance'' (1995), ''Ringbang Souljah'' (1996), and ''Ringbang Revolution'' (1997).

On [[New Year's Eve]] 1999, Grant hosted a concert on [[Tobago]] called Ringbang Celebration 2000, at which he performed with the Frontline Orchestra. The event drew approximately 11,000 people, and featured performances from artists from [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref name="rollins2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang.html |title=Kofi Ayivor Goes to Celebrate the New Millenium [sic] |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso legend [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]]'s brief appearance at the event was his final time onstage, as he died the following February.

In March 2003, Ice Records published ''Ringbang 4 Kids'', a selection of songs intended for children of [[primary school]] age. The songs were performed by Barbadian singer Indra Rudder, who had previously sung backing vocals for several Ice Records tracks.

[[File:Gullager Salisbury.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Portrait of a woman wearing a heavily ruffled [[cap]], 1789]]
In [[sewing]] and [[dressmaking]], a '''ruffle''', '''frill''', or '''furbelow''' is a strip of [[textile|fabric]], [[lace]] or [[ribbon]] tightly [[gather (sewing)|gathered]] or [[pleat]]ed on one edge and applied to a [[clothing|garment]], [[bedding]], or other textile as a form of [[trim (sewing)|trimming]].&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, S.F.A. and B.C. Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', 1885, facsimile edition, Blaketon Hall, 1989, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''flounce''' is a particular type of fabric manipulation that creates a similar look but with less bulk. The term derives from earlier terms of ''frounce'' or ''fronce''.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield and Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; A wavy effect is achieved without gathers or pleats by cutting a curved strip of fabric and applying the inner or shorter edge to the garment. The depth of the curve as well as the width of the fabric determines the depth of the flounce. A [[godet (sewing)|godet]] is a circle wedge that can be inserted into a flounce to further deepen the outer floating wave without adding additional bulk at the point of attachment to the body of the garment, such as at the hemline, collar or sleeve.

Ruffles appeared at the [[draw-string]] necklines of full [[chemise]]s in the 15th century, evolved into the separately-constructed [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] of the 16th century. Ruffles and flounces remained a fashionable form of trim, off-and-on into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;For styles and construction of ruffles, frills and flounces through the centuries, see the Arnold, Baumgarten and Tozer volumes listed below&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seattle Fishermen's Memorial''''', or '''''Fisherman's Memorial''''', is an outdoor sculpture by Ronald Petty, installed at [[Fishermen's Terminal]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in the United States.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Seattle Fishermen's Memorial, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!317189~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was designed in 1987 and dedicated in October 1988. It commemorates Seattle fisherman who died since 1900.

==Description==
[[File:Seattle Fishermen's Memorial 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Corner of the memorial's base and the adjacent wall]]

Ronald Petty's ''Seattle Fishermen's Memorial'' is installed at Docks 8 and 9 at Seattle's [[Fishermen's Terminal]]. The monument features a {{Convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} cast stone column supporting a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] standing male figure, who holds a fishing line in his proper right hand. A fish is attached to the end of the line. The column's base is a bronze relief depicting 32 "sea creatures", including fish. Adjacent to the column is a concrete wall with bronze plaques displaying the names of around 460 Seattle fishermen who died since 1900.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Seattle Fishermen's Memorial 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wreath in memory of the dead of the ''Arctic Rose'', 2007]]

The memorial was designed in 1987 to "honor commercial fishermen from the Seattle area who have been lost at sea". It was dedicated on October 8, 1988. The sculpture was surveyed and deemed "well maintained" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in January 1994. It is administered by the Seattle Fishermen's Memorial Foundation.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5050">'''Sillage''' (\si.jaʒ\) in [[perfume]] refers to the aura or trail created by a perfume when it is worn on the skin. It comes from the word in French for "wake" and can best be described as how a fragrance diffuses around the wearer. Sillage or diffusion in fragrances can also be called the "projection" of a fragrance.

Compounds such as [[Hedione]] (methyl dihydrojasmonate) can be used to enhance the diffusivity of a fragrance. Hedione is a synthetic relative of [[methyl jasmonate]],  a naturally occurring compound in floral scents such as [[jasmine]], [[Polianthes tuberosa|tuberose]] and [[magnolia]]. Methyl jasmonate is also found in many other plant parts and is considered to be a signalling molecule. It is considered one of the compounds responsible for the projection of the scent in living flowers and was first fully characterised in between 1957 and 1962 in jasmine absolute (0.8%) by the fragrance chemist [[Edouard Demole]] who was working at [[Firmenich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theimer |first1=Ernst T |title=Fragrance Chemistry Science of the Sense of Smell, The. |date=2014 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=9780323138604 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1044713310 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful fragrance to utilise Hedione was [[Eau Sauvage]] by perfumer [[Edmond Roudnitska]] for [[Parfums Christian Dior|Christian Dior]] , launched in 1966. The addition of Hedione to a classically hesperidic fragrance construction created a dewy lemony magnolia-jasmine dimension without being directly floral, and gave it a new type of projection and transparency not experienced before in this type of perfume. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} This is considered to be the beginning of a new trend in perfumery towards transparency and projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Ralf Günter |title=Scent and Chemistry.

Compounds such as [[Damascone|damascones,]] Iso-E super, [[linalool]] and some of the synthetic musks such as [[cashmeran]] may also be added to fragrances to enhance their diffusion and sillage.

A fragrance does not need to be a heavy one to have a large sillage;   fragrances such as Giorgio Beverly Hills for women and Poison (Dior) are very good examples of this. Eau Sauvage and [[L'eau d'Issey]] ([[Jacques Cavallier|Jaques Cavallier]] for [[Issey Miyake]]) have a large sillage but may be considered much lighter examples of this.

Sillage in a perfume could also be considered to be how a fragrance is perceived by others around the wearer and is enhanced by motion, ambient temperature as well as the inherent qualities of the skin. According to an article by Mookerjee, a fragrance is perceived by the diffusion of individual fragrance molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mookerjee |first1=B. D |last2=Patel |first2=S.

Once a fragrance is applied to the skin, the skin itself becomes a substrate to the scent. The inherent scent of the individual skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenochová |first1=Pavlína |last2=Vohnoutová |first2=Pavla |last3=Roberts |first3=S.

'''St Ursula's''' is a building at 37 Watergate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It incorporates a section of [[Chester Rows]] and is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]] because of the quality of the [[undercroft]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376436|desc= Number 37 Street Number 45 Row St Ursulas, Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building originated somewhere between about 1180 and about 1280.  Alterations were made in the 16th&amp;nbsp;or 17th&amp;nbsp;century and it was largely rebuilt above the Row level in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century and altered again in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.  The building is in four storeys.  It is built in [[sandstone]] at the street (undercroft) and Row levels and above this is [[timber framing|timber-framed]].  The undercroft has 5½ bays and it is considered that the walls date from the late 12th&amp;nbsp;century, and are therefore the earliest features yet to have been dated in the structure of the Rows.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

The undercroft is currently in use as a storeroom for the neighbouring toy shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Toycraft|url=http://toycraft.co.uk/index.php/about_toycraft/|publisher=Toycraft|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teatro San Cassiano''' or '''Teatro di San Cassiano''' in [[Venice]] was the first public [[opera house]] when it opened in 1637.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kolodin |first=Irving |title=The Opera Omnibus: Four Centuries of  Critical Give and Take |year=1976 |publisher=Dutton |location=New York |isbn=0-8415-0438-5 | page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opap26"&gt;{{cite book |last=Apthorp |first=William Foster |title=The Opera Past and Present |year=1910 |publisher=Charles Scribner's and Sons |location=New York |isbn= | page=26}} Available at [https://archive.org/details/operapastpresent00apthuoft Project Gutenberg].&lt;/ref&gt; The theater was a stone building owned by the Venetian [[Tron family]], and took its name from the neighbourhood where it was located, the parish of [[San Cassiano (Venice)|San Cassiano]] near the [[Rialto]].&lt;ref name="opap26" /&gt; It was considered 'public' as it was directed by an [[impresario]], or general manager, for the paying public rather than for nobles exclusively.

==History==
The original theater, the first public theatre for spoken plays, was built in 1581. This structure succumbed to fire in 1629, and was soon after rebuilt by the owner, the Tron family.

The first operas of the commercially run venture were ''L'Andromeda'' and ''La Maga Fulminata''. These were produced in 1637 and 1638 respectively, by Romans [[Benedetto Ferrari]] and [[Francesco Manelli]]. Ferrari and company stayed until 1639 when the business was acquired by a new company managed by entrepreneur [[Francesco Cavalli|Francesco Caletti-Bruni]], with financial backing from Venetian nobleman Cavalli. Caletti-Bruni composed most of the operas performed here in the six years from 1639 to 1645. After the 1650s the theater was surpassed by others, and its number of performances declined. Impresario [[Marco Faustini]] managed the Teatro San Cassiano from 1657 to 1660.

Towards the end of the 17th century, Venice became the opera capital of the world as another ten opera houses had opened. At this point the Teatro San Cassiano could count first performances of 37 operas. The last performances were held in 1807 and it was demolished in 1812, mainly due to recurring fires. The operatic period ''[[dramma in musica]]'' coincided with the early years of the commercial San Cassiano and was influenced by its composers.

'''Tenga Rinpoche''' (1932–2012) was a [[Tibet]]an teacher ([[lama]]) in the [[Karma Kagyu]] tradition.&lt;ref name="benchen"&gt;[http://www.benchen.org/en/tenga-rinpoche.html Short Biography of the Tenga Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710011639/http://www.benchen.org/en/tenga-rinpoche.html |date=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Kham]] in 1932,&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; Tenga Rinpoche was recognized as a [[Tulku|reincarnation]] of Lama Samten&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"&gt;[http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/teachers/tea10.php Tenga Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601033101/http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/teachers/tea10.php |date=2013-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;

As he grew older, he studied at [[Benchen Monastery]]&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; and was eventually [[Dharma name|given the name]] Karma Tenzin Thinle Namgyal from [[Tai Situpa|Situ Rinpoche]].&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; Soon after, he was given ordination by Situ Rinpoche and entered a three-year retreat.&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

He was an expert in mandala painting and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tenga_Rinpoche Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Tenga Rinpoche left Benchen for [[Lhasa]]. After the [[14th Dalai Lama]] left Tibet in relation with the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], he escaped with [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and the brother of Dilgo Khyentse, the 9th [[Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche]].&lt;ref name="Tenga Brilliant Moon"&gt;Tenga Rinpoche, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0voLU0FgYy8C&amp;pg=PA193 Visions in Exile] p. 193-197, in ''Brilliant Moon: The Autobiography of Dilgo Khyentse''&lt;/ref&gt; He then eventually traveled to northern India.&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt; In India, he settled at [[Rumtek Monastery]], the main seat of [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa Lama|the 16th Karmapa]].&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; Tenga Rinpoche served the 16th Karmapa for seventeen years,&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt; nine of those years in the position of [[Dorje Lopön]].&lt;ref name="benchen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

In 1976 Tenga Rinpoche settled in [[Swayambhunath]], [[Nepal]], where he founded a second Benchen Monastery and a retreat center in [[Pharping]].&lt;ref name="Tenga Brilliant Moon" /&gt;

In 1986, Tenga Rinpoche established the new [[Benchen Monastery]] in [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

He visited France regularly, giving teachings at [[Kagyu-Dzong]] in Paris and [[Vajradhara-Ling]] in Normandy. On September 21, 2003, he laid the [[cornerstone]] of the [[Temple for Peace]] in Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727140515/http://www.oceandesagesse.org/doc/dossier_presse_FR.pdf Dalaï Lama France 2008], see page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2012, at 3:24 in the morning Nepali time, Tenga Rinpoche died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benchen.org/en/tenga-rinpoche/news/231-the-passing-of-tenga-rinpoche.html The passing of Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyima Döndrup, the yangsi (reincarnation) of the previous Tenga Rinpoche was born December 14, 2014 in Nepal. He was discovered in 2017 following the indications of the [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje|17th Karmapa]] who met him on March 21, 2017 in [[Bodhgaya]] for a ceremony at Tergar Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kagyuoffice.org/an-amazing-story-finding-the-reincarnation-of-tenga-rinpoche/ An Amazing Story: Finding the Reincarnation of Tenga Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The City''''' is a [[book]] by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]]. It was published posthumously in 1921.  In 1924 it was incorporated into a larger book, ''[[Economy and Society]]''.  An English translation was made in 1958 and several editions have been released since then.  It is still in print: a paperback edition was issued in Glencoe, Illinois by Free Press in 1986 with {{ISBN|0-02-934210-4}} .

It is likely that Weber compiled that research in 1911–1913, although it contains materials he found before that time.

The analysis of [[city]] consists of many different subjects—including study of [[religion]] (especially [[Protestantism]]), history of development of [[democracy]] in [[Western Europe]].

Weber argues that the development of cities in European [[culture]] ([[western culture|Occidental]] cities) as an [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] [[Voluntary association|associations]] with its own [[municipal]] [[officials]] was influenced by such factors as:

* the religion of [[Christianity]]
* the privileged legal position of the [[citizen]]s (based upon citizen's obligation for military service)
* the decline of religious sanctions of [[kinship]] solidarity that facilitated creation of unified urban community

That made the city's population easily influenced by later ideas of the [[Reformation|Reformers]].

In Weber's own words:

{{quote|The origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets [...] who developed in a social context which was alien to the Asiatic cultures. This context consisted of the political problems engendered by the bourgeois status-group of the city, without which neither Judaism, nor Christianity, nor the development of Hellenistic thinking are conceivable.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3462">'''The Red Ettin''' or '''The Red Etin''' is a [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]].  It was included by [[Andrew Lang]] in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
Two widows lived in a hut, and one had two sons and the other had one—or a single widow had three sons. One day the eldest son was told by his mother to fetch water for a cake, because it was time for him to seek his fortune, and the cake was all she could give him. The can was broken, the water he brought back little, and so the cake was small. The mother offered him all of it with her curse, or half with her blessing, and he took the whole. He left behind a knife, and said if the blade grew rusty, he was dead.

[[File:Page 138 illustration in English Fairy Tales.png|thumb|Illustration from Jacob's version by [[John D. Batten]]]]
He met a shepherd, a swineherd, and a goatherd; each of the [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] told him the Red Ettin of Ireland had kidnapped the king of Scotland's daughter, but that he was not the man to rescue her. The shepherd also told him to be wary of the beasts he would meet next. They each had two heads, with four horns on each head, and the man fled them and hid in a castle. An old woman told him that it was the castle of the Red Ettin, which had three heads, and he should leave, but he begged her to hide him as best she could, for fear of the beasts.

The Red Ettin returned, soon found him, and asked him three riddles; when he could answer none of them, the Ettin turned him to stone. At home, his knife grew rusty. In the variants with three sons, the younger brother went after the elder, and met the same fate. The youngest son, or the son of the other widow, set out after him, or them. First, a raven called over his head to look out as he brought the water, and so he patched up the holes and brought back enough water for a large cake. Then he left half with his mother for her blessing.

He met an old woman on the way who asked for a piece of his cake, and he gave it to her. She, being a [[fairy]], gave him a magical wand and a great deal of advice on what to do, and vanished. The shepherd, swineherd, and goatherd told him of the Red Ettin and the king of Scotland's daughter, and said that he was the man to defeat him. He walked boldly through the beasts to the castle, striking one dead with the wand, and stayed at the castle.

The Red Ettin asked him his riddle, but the man answered and cut off the Ettin's three heads. He restored the stone and freed the women the Red Ettin held prisoner, and the king married him to his daughter.

==Commentary==
Joseph Jacobs collected a version with the three men, but suppressed one because it was repetitious.  Andrew Lang included all three young men.

==Career==

=== Biography and early work ===
Jenson began painting animation cells at the age of 13.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;Hillary Atkin, "[https://variety.com/2001/biz/news/vicky-jenson-1117855807/ Vicky Jenson: Filmmaker]", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (November 14, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Academy of Art University]] in [[San Francisco]] and [[California State University Northridge]].&lt;ref name="ACME Film Works"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vicky Jenson|url=http://www.acmefilmworks.com/directors/vicky-jenson/|publisher=ACME Film Works|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She "started as a [[background artist]] at [[Hanna-Barbera]] in 1977, became a [[storyboard]] artist for [[Warner Bros.]], [[Marvel Studios|Marvel]] and [[Disney Television]], and variously worked as a production designer, art director and co-producer".&lt;ref name="Wallflower" /&gt; In the early 1980s, Jenson worked on the storyboard backgrounds on the ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' cartoon series for [[Filmation]]. She was also a design and color stylist on ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'', the influential Ralph Bakshi reboot of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', in the 1980s. She held the same position with ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' in the early 1990s, for creator [[John Kricfalusi]].&lt;ref name="Wallflower" /&gt; For both ''Mighty Mouse'' and ''Ren &amp; Stimpy'', Jenson was among those "responsible for the development of the visual style" of the series.&lt;ref name="Wallflower" /&gt; In 1992, Jenson was the [[art director]] for ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'',&lt;ref name="Wallflower" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Osmond, ''100 Animated Feature Films'' (2010), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and the production designer for ''[[Computer Warriors: The Adventure Begins]]'' and ''[[Playroom (film)|Playroom]]''. In 2000, Jenson began working for [[DreamWorks]] as a production designer and story artist for ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]''.&lt;ref name="Wallflower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;

===Directing career===
Having worked on ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]'' (2000) for DreamWorks, the studio initially hired Jenson to work on ''Shrek'' as a story artist, with the directors to be [[Andrew Adamson]] (also a first-time director) and [[Kelly Asbury]], who had joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]'', and Jenson was selected by producer [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] to be the new director of the film.&lt;ref name="Mallory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Jenson recalled her experience being brought into ''Shrek'', and eventually tapped to direct, as follows:

{{quote|For a long time, the movie didn’t know what it wanted to be. One problem was unavoidable: [[Chris Farley]] had died, and the story had been geared around him, so when he went, the story kind of went with him. It went through an upheaval while they tried to find the right tone for it. I think they were really close to shelving the project when a few of us came into story to try and find a tone that we could work with. When Kelly Asbury moved on to ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]'' I became head of story, along with Randy Cartwright. Along with Andrew Adamson, who stayed on as director, we started pulling little pieces together out of what remained, and part of the way through, Jeffrey decided that I should be directing. A few months later, we started production.&lt;ref name="Mallory"/&gt;}}

Jenson described the directing process as one in which "we didn't try to figure out how to make adolescents laugh. You have to use yourself as the best judge and use your own instincts. We figured if we laughed at it, chances are good someone else would too".&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt;  According to Adamson, the co-directors mutually decided to split the work in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific questions about the film's sequences: "We both ended up doing a lot of everything", "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Makin' Toons: Inside the Most Popular Animated TV Shows and Movies |last=Neuwirth |first=Allan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc |location= |isbn= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallflower"/&gt; Following the success of ''Shrek'', Jenson went on to co-direct ''[[Shark Tale]]''  with [[Bibo Bergeron]] and [[Rob Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sito, ''Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson'' (2006), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, while working on ''Shark Tale'', Jenson received the first annual Kiera Chaplin Limelight award given at the [[Women's Image Network Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Ryan|title=Kim Possible Wins WIN Awards|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/events/kim-possible-wins-win-awards/|accessdate=June 1, 2013|newspaper=[[Animation (magazine)|Animation]]|date=November 3, 2003|quote=The first annual Kiera Chaplin Limelight award was presented to Vicky Jenson, co-director of DreamWorks' animated blockbuster Shrek and the upcoming Shark Tale (formerly Sharkslayer).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, it was reported that Jenson was directing an untitled animated fantasy film slated for release in 2019. The film tells of a teenager who "comes of age using magical powers to defend her family when the opposing forces of light and darkness threaten to divide her kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/skydances-animation-movies-find-directors-1022425|title=Skydance Taps Directors for Two Animation Movies (Exclusive)|publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter''|date=July 19, 2017|accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Live action work ====
She directed a live-action short, ''Family Tree'', which "premiered at Sundance, screened at countless festivals, including Sundance, SXSW, Aspen and Malibu and went on to win multiple festival awards".&lt;ref name="ACME" /&gt; In 2009, she finished her first live-action feature directorial work for the [[Alexis Bledel]]-starring comedy, ''[[Post Grad]]''.&lt;ref name="IMDB" /&gt; The film received mixed reviews, but [[Roger Ebert]] awarded it three out of four stars, stating, "[i]f you're cynical or jaded, it might not get past you. But here is the first movie in a long time that had me actually admitting I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]].[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090819/REVIEWS/908199997 "''Post Grad''" (review)], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]], August 19, 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, Jenson directed all of the spots for the year-long "Modelquins" [[ad campaign]] for [[Old Navy]], including the "Supermodelquins Christmas" ads.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2009/old-navy-supermodelquins-christmas/ Old Navy Supermodelquins Christmas]", ''Inspiration Room'' (December 5, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; She was represented by the [[Anonymous Content]] agency for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.trustcollective.com/portfolio/content/anonymous_oldnavy.htm Anonymous Content Launches Web and TV Campaign For Old Navy]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Jenson directed a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] production of the play, ''[[Time Stands Still (play)|Time Stands Still]]'', by [[Donald Margulies]].&lt;ref name="Broadwayworld" /&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote of Jenson's stage directorial debut: "the staging by Vicky Jenson successfully captures the script's broad contours",&lt;ref&gt;Philip Brandes, "[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-theater-review-time-stands-still-at-secret-rose-theatre-20150120-story.html Unrealized potential in 'Time Stands Still']", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (January 23, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Broadway World'' praised the production, stating that "Vicky Jenson smoothly directs her uniformly skilled four-member cast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaan|first=Gil |title=BWW Reviews: Margulies' Intense TIME STANDS STILL Powerfully Provokes|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/article/BWW-Reviews-Margulies-Intense-TIME-STANDS-STILL-Powerfully-Provokes-20150119|work=Broadway World|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White''' is the [[lightness|lightest]] [[color]] and is achromatic (having no [[hue]]). It is the color of fresh snow, [[chalk]], and milk, and is the opposite of [[black]]. White objects fully [[diffuse reflection|reflect]] and [[light scattering|scatter]] all the [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]] of [[light]].  White on television and computer screens is created by a  mixture of red, blue and green light.

In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white [[unicorn]] symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the Kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century [[modern architecture]] as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.

According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets ets symboliques'', pp. 130–46&lt;/ref&gt; White is an important color for almost all world religions. The [[Pope]], the head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice.  In [[Islam]], and in the [[Shinto]] religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets ets symboliques'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[:wikt:white|white]]'' continues [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|hwīt}}'', ultimately from a [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|χ&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ītaz}}'' also reflected in [[Old High German|OHG]] ''{{lang|goh|(h)wîz}}'', [[Old Norse|ON]] ''{{lang|non|hvítr}}'', [[Gothic language|Goth.]] ''{{lang|got|ƕeits}}''. The root is ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language]] ''{{PIE|*k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;id-}}'', surviving also in [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|śveta}}'' "to be white or bright"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=jpg Sanskrit-Lexicon.uni-koeln.de] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213080141/http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=jpg |date=13 February 2010 }} (''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'', p. 1106).&lt;/ref&gt; and Slavonic ''{{lang|sla-Latn|světŭ}}'' "light".&lt;ref&gt;Max Vasmer, ''Этимологический словарь русского языка'', т.III, Москва 1971, 575–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]; {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word for white, ''{{lang|is|hvítur}}'', is directly derived from the [[Old Norse]] form of the word ''{{lang|non|hvítr}}''. Common Germanic also had the word *''blankaz'' ("white, bright, blinding"), borrowed into [[Late Latin]] as *''blancus'', which provided the source for [[Romance languages|Romance]] words for "white" (Catalan, Occitan and French ''blanc'', Spanish ''blanco'', Italian ''bianco'', Galician-Portuguese ''branco'', etc.). The antonym of white is black.

Some non-European languages have a wide variety of terms for white. The [[Inuit]] language has seven different words for seven different nuances of white. [[Sanskrit]] has specific words for bright white, the white of teeth, the white of [[sandalwood]], the white of the autumn moon, the white of silver, the white of cow's milk, the white of pearls, the white of a ray of sunlight, and the white of stars.  Japanese has six different words, depending upon brilliance or dullness, or if the color is inert or dynamic.{{sfn|Varichon|2005|pages=11–12}}

== History and art ==
=== Prehistoric and ancient history===
White was one of the first colors used in art. The [[Lascaux Cave]] in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [[paleolithic]] artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. [[Paleolithic]] artists used [[calcite]] or [[chalk]], sometimes as a background, sometimes as a highlight, along with charcoal and red and yellow ochre in their vivid cave paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau (2005), ''Le petit livre des couleurs,'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In [[ancient Egypt]], white was connected with the goddess [[Isis]]. The priests and priestesses of Isis dressed only in white linen, and it was used to wrap [[mummies]].&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon 2000 pg. 16"&gt;Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 16 .&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece and other ancient civilizations, white was often associated with mother's milk. In [[Greek mythology]], the chief god [[Zeus]] was nourished at the breast of the nymph Amalthea.  In the [[Talmud]], milk was one of four sacred substances, along with wine, honey, and the rose.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks saw the world in terms of darkness and light, so white was a fundamental color.  According to [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Natural History'', [[Apelles]] (4th century BC) and the other famous painters of ancient Greece used only four colors in their paintings; white, red, yellow and black;&lt;ref&gt;John Gage (1993) ''Color and Culture'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; For painting, the Greeks used [[lead white]], made by a long and laborious process.

A plain white [[toga]], known as a ''toga virilis'', was worn for ceremonial occasions by all Roman citizens over the age of 14–18. Magistrates and certain priests wore a ''toga praetexta'', with a broad purple stripe.
In the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]], no Roman man was allowed to appear in the Roman forum without a toga.

The ancient Romans had two words for white; ''albus'', a plain white, (the source of the word ''albino''); and ''candidus,'' a brighter white. A man who wanted public office in Rome wore a white toga brightened with chalk, called a ''toga candida'', the origin of the word ''candidate''. The Latin word ''candere'' meant to shine, to be bright. It was the origin of the words ''candle'' and ''candid''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Rome]], the priestesses of the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] dressed in white linen robes, a white [[palla (garment)|palla]] or shawl, and a white veil. They protected the sacred fire and the [[penates]] of Rome. White symbolized their purity, loyalty, and chastity.&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon 2000 pg. 16" /&gt;

=== Postclassical history ===
The early Christian church adopted the Roman symbolism of white as the color of purity, sacrifice and virtue. It became the color worn by priests during Mass, the color worn by monks of the [[Cistercian Order]], and, under [[Pope Pius V]], a former monk of the [[Dominican Order]], it became the official color worn by the pope himself. Monks of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] dressed in the white or gray of natural undyed wool, but later changed to black, the color of humility and penitence.

Postclassical history art, the white lamb became the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on behalf of mankind. John the Baptist described [[Christ]] as the [[lamb of God]], who took the sins of the world upon himself. The white lamb was the center of one of the most famous paintings of the Medieval period, the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', pp. 224–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

White was also the symbolic color of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]]. The [[Gospel of Saint Mark]] describes Jesus' clothing in this event as "shining, exceeding white as snow." Artists such as Fra Angelico used their skill to capture the whiteness of his garments. In his painting of the transfiguration at the Convent of Saint Mark in [[Florence]], Fra Angelico emphasized the white garment by using a light gold background, placed in an almond-shaped halo.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', pp. 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The white [[unicorn]] was a common subject of Postclassical history manuscripts, paintings and tapestries. It was a symbol of purity, chastity and grace, which could only be captured by a virgin. It was often portrayed in the lap of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', pp. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Postclassical history, painters rarely ever mixed colors; but in the Renaissance, the influential humanist and scholar [[Leon Battista Alberti]] encouraged artists to add white to their colors to make them lighter, brighter, and to add ''hilaritas'', or gaiety. Many painters followed his advice, and the palette of the Renaissance was considerably brighter.&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, (1993), ''Color and Culture'', pp. 117–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===

Until the 16th century, white was commonly worn by widows as a color of mourning. The widows of the kings of France wore white until [[Anne of Brittany]] in the 16th century. A white tunic was also worn by many knights, along with a red cloak, which showed the knights were willing to give their blood for the king or Church.

==== 18th and 19th centuries ====

White was the dominant color of architectural interiors in the [[Baroque]] period and especially the [[Rococo]] style that followed it in the 18th century. Church interiors were designed to show the power, glory and wealth of the church. They seemed to be alive, filled with curves, asymmetry, mirrors, gilding, statuary and reliefs, unified by white.

White was also a fashionable color for both men and women in the 18th century. Men in the aristocracy and upper classes wore powdered white wigs and white stockings, and women wore elaborate embroidered white and pastel gowns.

After the [[French Revolution]], a more austere white (''blanc cassé'') became the most fashionable color in women's costumes which were modeled after the outfits of Ancient Greece and Republican Rome. Because of the rather revealing design of these dresses, the ladies wearing them were called ''les merveilleuses'' (the marvellous) by French men of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Chronique des métropoles:Paris, p. 83, publ. Dargaud 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire style]] under Emperor Napoléon I was modeled after the more conservative outfits of Ancient Imperial Rome. The dresses were high in fashion but low in warmth considering the more severe weather conditions of northern France; in 1814 the former wife of Napoleon, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], caught [[pneumonia]] and died after taking a walk in the cold night air with Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Andrew, ''Napoleon – A Life'', (2014), Viking Press, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02532-9}}, pp. 723–24&lt;/ref&gt;

White was the universal color of both men and women's underwear and of sheets in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was unthinkable to have sheets or underwear of any other color. The reason was simple; the manner of washing linen in boiling water caused colors to fade. When linen was worn out, it was collected and turned into high-quality paper.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau (2005), ''Le petit livre des couleurs'', pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century American painter [[James McNeill Whistler]] (1834–1903), working at the same time as the French impressionists, created a series of paintings with musical titles where he used color to create moods, the way composers used music. His painting ''Symphony in White No. 1 – The White Girl'', which used his mistress Joanna Hiffernan as a model, used delicate colors to portray innocence and fragility, and a moment of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 20th and 21st centuries ====


The [[White movement]] was the opposition that formed against the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], which followed the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917. It was finally defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1921–22, and many of its members emigrated to Europe.

At the end of the 19th century, lead white was still the most popular pigment; but between 1916 and 1918, chemical companies in [[Norway]] and the United States began to produce [[titanium white]], made from [[titanium oxide]]. It had first been identified in the 18th century by the German chemist [[Martin Klaproth]], who also discovered [[uranium]]. It had twice the covering power of lead white, and was the brightest white pigment known. By 1945, 80 percent of the white pigments sold were titanium white.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball (2001), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', pp. 484–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absoluteness of white appealed to modernist painters. It was used in its simplest form by the Russian suprematist painter [[Kazimir Malevich]] in his 1917 painting 'the white square,' the companion to his earlier 'black square.' It was also used by the Dutch modernist painter [[Piet Mondrian]]. His most famous paintings consisted of a pure white canvas with grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of primary colors.

Black and white also appealed to modernist architects, such as [[Le Corbusier]] (1887–1965). He said a house was "a machine for living in" and called for a "calm and powerful architecture" built of reinforced concrete and steel, without any ornament or frills.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier. ''Toward an Architecture''. Translated by John Goodman. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the buildings of contemporary architect [[Richard Meier]], such as his museum in [[Rome]] to house the ancient Roman [[Ara Pacis]], or Altar of Peace, are stark white, in the tradition of Le Corbusier.

== Scientific understanding (Color science) ==
&lt;!-- Physics was linked from redirect [[White light]] --&gt;

Light is perceived by the human visual system as white when the incoming light to the eye stimulates all three types of color sensitive [[cone cell]]s in the eye in roughly equal amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author  = Wyszecki &amp; Stiles
| title   = Color Science
| edition = Second
| page    = 506
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials that do not emit light themselves appear white if their surfaces reflect back most of the light that strikes them in a [[Diffuse reflection|diffuse way]].

=== White light ===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=" 200px" &gt;
File:Synthese+.svg||In the [[RGB color model]], used to create colors on TV and computer screens, white is made by mixing red, blue and green light at full intensity.
File:Dispersion prism.jpg|[[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|White light]] [[refract]]ed in a [[prism]] revealing the color components.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
In 1666, [[Isaac Newton]] demonstrated that [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]] could be broken up into its composite colors by passing it through a [[prism]], then using a second prism to reassemble them.  Before Newton, most scientists believed that white was the fundamental color of [[light]].

White light can be generated by the sun, by stars, or by earthbound sources such as [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] lamps, [[Light-emitting diode#White light|white LEDs]] and [[Incandescent lamps|incandescent bulbs]]. On the screen of a color television or computer, white is produced by mixing the [[primary color]]s of light: red, green and blue ([[RGB]]) at full intensity, a process called [[additive mixing]] (see image below). White light can be fabricated using light with only two wavelengths, for instance by mixing light from a red and cyan laser or yellow and blue lasers. This light will however have very few practical applications since color rendering of objects will be greatly distorted.

The fact that light sources with vastly different [[spectral power distribution]]s can result in a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system. One color that arises from two different spectral power distributions is called a [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]].

Many of the light sources that emit white light emit light at almost all visible wavelengths (sun light, incandescent lamps of various [[Color temperature]]s). This has led to the notion that white light can be defined as a mixture of "all colors" or "all visible wavelengths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This widespread idea is a misconception,{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  and might originally stem from the fact that [[Isaac Newton#Optics|Newton]] discovered that ''sunlight'' is composed of light with wavelengths across the visible spectrum. Concluding that ''since "all colors" produce white light then white must be made up of "all colors"'' is a common logical error called [[affirming the consequent]], which might be the cause of the misunderstanding.

A range of spectral distributions of light sources can be perceived as white—there is no single, unique specification of "white light".  For example, when you buy a "white" light bulb, you might buy one labeled 2700K, 6000K, etc., which produce light having very different spectral distributions, and yet this will not prevent you from identifying the color of objects that they illuminate.&lt;ref name=illuminantIndep /&gt;

=== White objects ===
Color vision allows us to distinguish different [[Color#Color of objects|''objects'' by their color]]. In order to do so, [[color constancy]] can keep the perceived color of an object relatively unchanged when the illumination changes among various broad (whitish) spectral distributions of light.&lt;ref name=illuminantIndep&gt;Convex and non-convex illuminant constraints for dichromatic colour constancy, G.D. Finlayson and G. Schaefer, in ''Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. CVPR 2001'' http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990528/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008232830/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990528/ |date=8 October 2017 }} "the perceived colour of an object is more or less independent of the illuminant; a white paper appears white both outdoors under bluish daylight and indoors under yellow tungsten light, though the responses of the eyes' colour receptors ... will be quite different for the two cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

The same principle is used in photography and cinematography where the choice of [[white point]] determines a transformation of all other color stimuli. Changes in or manipulation of the white point can be used to explain some optical illusions such as [[The dress (viral phenomenon)|The dress]].

While there is no single, unique specification of "white light", there is indeed a unique specification of "white object", or, more specifically, "white surface".
A perfectly white surface [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflects]] ([[light scattering|scatters]]) all visible light that strikes it, without [[light absorption|absorbing]] any, irrespective of the light's wavelength or spectral distribution.&lt;ref name="mirror1"&gt;Program of Color Science / Munsell Color Science Laboratory, Rochester Institute of Technology, ''Complete Color FAQ''. "A perfect mirror reflects all of the light that strikes it... A perfect white also reflects all the light incident on it, but reflects that light diffusely. In other words, the white scatters the incident light in all directions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Appearance Analysis, Richard W. Harold, in ''GATFWorld, the magazine of the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation'', SS Number 84. "The typical reference is a white standard that has been calibrated relative to the perfect white reflecting diffuser (100% reflectance at all wavelengths)."&lt;/ref&gt;
Since it does not absorb any of the incident light, white is the lightest possible color.
If the reflection is not diffuse but rather [[specular reflection|specular]], this describes a mirror rather than a white surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reflection of 100% of incident light at all wavelengths is a form of uniform reflectance, so white is an achromatic color, meaning a color without [[hue]].&lt;ref&gt;"Does hue affect the perception of grayness?", R Shamey, W Sawatwarakul, Sha Fu, 13 May 2014, DOI: 10.1002/col.21894,

Color constancy is achieved by [[chromatic adaptation]].

=== Why snow, clouds and beaches are white ===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=" 200px" &gt;
File:Snow-covered fir trees.jpg|thumb|Snow is composed of ice and air; it scatters or reflects sunlight without absorbing other colors of the spectrum.
File:Cumulus clouds in fair weather.jpeg||[[Cumulus cloud]]s look white because the water droplets reflect and scatter the sunlight without absorbing other colors.
File:White Cliffs of Dover 02.JPG|The [[White Cliffs of Dover]], made of [[limestone]]
File:Hyams Beach 002.jpg|thumb|[[Hyams Beach]], [[New South Wales]] appears white because the sunlight is reflected or scattered by the quartz or limestone sand 
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Beaches with [[sand]] containing high amounts of [[quartz]] or eroded [[limestone]] also appear white, since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight, rather than absorbing it. Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white [[calcium carbonate]] from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/38163-where-beach-sand-comes-from.html "Science of summer – where does beach sand come from?"] ''Livescience.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White Cliffs of Dover]] take their white color from the large amount of [[chalk]], made of [[limestone]], which they contain, which reflects the sunlight.

[[Snow]] is a mixture of air and tiny [[ice]] crystals. When white [[sunlight]] enters snow, very little of the spectrum is absorbed; almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules, so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight, white. Sometimes the light bounces around inside the ice crystals before being scattered, making the snow seem to sparkle.&lt;ref name="weather.about.com"&gt;{{cite web

| title      = Why Snow is White (Even Though Water is Clear)
| accessdate = 30 December 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[glacier]]s, the ice is more tightly pressed together and contains little air. As sunlight enters the ice, more light of the red spectrum is absorbed, so the light scattered will be bluish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Cloud]]s are white for the same reason as ice. They are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air, very little light that strikes them is absorbed, and most of the light is scattered, appearing to the eye as white. Shadows of other clouds above can make clouds look gray, and some clouds have their own shadow on the bottom of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many mountains with winter or year-round snow cover are named accordingly: [[Mauna Kea]] means ''white mountain'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Mont Blanc]] means ''white mountain'' in French. [[Changbai Mountains]] literally meaning ''perpetually white mountains'', marks the border between China and Korea.

==== White materials ====

File:Titanium(IV) oxide.jpg|thumb|Titanium white, made with [[titanium dioxide]], is the brightest white paint available. It also colors most toothpaste and sunscreen.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Chalk]] is a kind of [[limestone]], made of the mineral [[calcite]], or [[calcium carbonate]]. It was originally deposited under the sea as the scales or plates of tiny micro-organisms called [[Coccolithophore]]. It was the first white pigment used by prehistoric artists in cave paintings. The chalk used on blackboards today is usually made of [[gypsum]] or calcium sulphate, a powder pressed into sticks.

''Bianco di San Giovanni'' is a pigment used in the Renaissance, which was described by the painter [[Cennino Cennini]] in the 15th century. It is similar to chalk, made of calcium carbonate with calcium hydroxide. It was made of dried lime which was made into a powder, then soaked in water for eight days, with the water changed each day. It was then made into cakes and dried in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Lead white]] was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described is [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Vitruvius]] and the ancient Greek author [[Theophrastus]]. Pieces of lead were put into clay pots which had a separate compartment filled with [[vinegar]]. The pots in turn were piled on shelves close to cow dung. The combined fumes of the vinegar and the cow dung caused the lead to corrode into [[lead carbonate]]. It was a slow process which could take a month or more. It made an excellent white and was used by artists for centuries, but it was also toxic. It was replaced in the 19th century by [[zinc white]] and [[titanium white]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball (2000), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titanium white]] is the most popular white for artists today; it is the brightest available white pigment, and has twice the coverage of lead white. It first became commercially available in 1921. It is made out of [[titanium dioxide]], from the minerals [[brookite]], [[anatase]], [[rutile]], or [[ilmenite]], currently the major source. Because of its brilliant whiteness, it is used as a colorant for most [[toothpaste]] and [[sunscreen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Zinc white]] is made from [[zinc oxide]]. It is similar to but not as opaque as titanium white. It is added to some breakfast cereals,{{cn|date=March 2018}} since zinc is an important [[nutrient]]. [[Chinese white]] is a variety of zinc white made for artists.

Some materials can be made to look "whiter than white", this is achieved using [[optical brightener]] agents (OBA). These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the [[ultraviolet]] and violet region (usually 340–370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420–470 nm). OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white. This is due to the fact that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive.

==== Bleach and bleaching ====
[[Bleaching]] is a process for whitening fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years. Sometimes it was simply a matter of leaving the fabric in the sun, to be faded by the bright light. In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of [[chlorine bleach]], including [[sodium hypochlorite]] and [[calcium hypochlorite]] (bleaching powder).&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

| edition      = 9th Edition (1875) and 10th Edition (1902)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on [[peroxide]]s, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[sodium percarbonate]] and [[sodium perborate]]. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are [[reducing agents]] such as [[sodium dithionite]].

Bleaches attack the [[chromophore]]s, the part of a molecule which absorbs light and causes fabrics to have different colors. An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the [[chemical bond]]s that make up the chromophore. This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore, or contains a chromophore that does not absorb [[visible light]]. A reducing bleach works by converting [[double bond]]s in the chromophore into [[single bond]]s. This eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight acts as a bleach through a similar process. High energy [[photon]]s of light, often in the [[violet (color)|violet]] or [[ultraviolet]] range, can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore, rendering the resulting substance colorless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some detergents go one step further; they contain [[fluorescent]] chemicals which glow, making the fabric look literally whiter than white.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Its faint [[luminosity]] comes from the [[Thermal radiation|emission]] of stored [[heat|thermal energy]]. A white dwarf is very hot when it is formed, but since it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate away its energy and cool down. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high [[color temperature]], will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at which it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and it will become a cold [[black dwarf]].&lt;ref name="rln"&gt;{{cite web

White is an important symbolic color in most religions and cultures, usually because of its association with purity.  

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], white is associated with [[Jesus Christ]], innocence and sacrifice. Since the [[Middle Ages]], priests wear a white [[cassock]] in many of the most important ceremonies and religious services connected with events in the life of Christ. White is worn by priests at [[Christmas]], during [[Easter]], and during celebrations connected with the other events of the life of Christ, such as Corpus Christi Sunday, and [[Trinity Sunday]]. It is also worn at the services dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], and to those Saints who were not martyred, as well as other special occasions, such as the ordination of priests and the installation of new bishops. Within the hierarchy of the church, the lighter the color, the higher the rank. Ordinary priests wear black; bishops wear violet, cardinals wear red, and outside a church, only the [[Pope]] will wear white.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000). ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Popes occasionally wore white in the Middle Ages, but usually wore red. Popes have worn white regularly since 1566, when [[Pope Pius V]], a member of the [[Dominican Order]], began the practice.  White is the color of the [[Dominican Order]].

In Islam, white clothing is worn during required pilgrimage to Mecca, or ''[[Ihram]]'' [[pilgrimage]] (''[[Hajj]]'').[[Hajj]]. Called [[Ihram clothing]], men's garments often consist of two white un-hemmed sheets (usually towelling material). The top (the ''riḍā'') is draped over the torso and the bottom (the ''izār'') is secured by a belt; plus a pair of sandals. Women's clothing varies considerably and reflects regional as well as religious influences. Ihram is typically worn during [[Dhu al-Hijjah]], the last month in the [[Islamic calendar]].

White also has a long history of use as a religious and political symbol in Islam, beginning with the white banner that tradition ascribes to the [[Quraysh]], the tribe to which [[Muhammad]] belonged. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad dynasty]] also used white as its dynastic colour, following the personal banner of its founder, [[Mu'awiya I]], while the [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] also chose white to highlight their opposition to the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid Caliphate]], whose colour was black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In Judaism, during the rituals of [[Yom Kippur]], the ceremony of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]], the [[rabbi]] dresses in white, as do the members of the congregation, to restore the bonds between God and his followers.

In the traditional Japanese religion of [[Shinto]], an area of white gravel or stones marks a sacred place, called a ''niwa''. These places were dedicated to the ''kami'', spirits which had descended from the heavens or had come across the sea. Later, temples of [[Zen Buddhism]] in Japan often featured a [[Zen garden]], where white sand or gravel was carefully raked to resemble rivers or streams, designed as objects of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;David and Michigo Young (2005), ''The Art of the Japanese Garden'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

In the temples of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or also known as Mormon), White clothing is worn inside once they have been officially dedicated, due to white symbolizing purity.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, William J. ''The Latter Day Saints in the Modern Day World'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions symbolize heaven by using a sky with white clouds. This phenomenon is not limited to western culture; in [[Yoruba religion]], the orisha [[Obatala]] in the [[Ifá]] tradition is represented by white. Obatala is associated with calmness, morality, old age, and purity.

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and similar religions, the [[deity|deities]] called the [[Great White Brotherhood]] are said to have white [[aura (paranormal)|auras]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare ''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America'' Summit University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Asian and Slavic cultures, white is considered to be a color that represents death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also represented death in [[ancient Egypt]], representing the lifeless desert that covered much of the country; black was held to be the color of life, representing the mud-covered fertile lands created by the flooding of the [[Nile]] and giving the country its name (''Kemet'', or "black land").

In China, Korea, and some other Asian countries, white, or more precisely, the whitish color of undyed linen, is the color of mourning and funerals.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Eva, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', Pyramyd. pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional China, undyed linen clothing is worn at funerals. As time passes, the bereaved can gradually wear clothing dyed with colors, then with darker colors. Small sacks of [[quicklime]], one for each year of the life of the deceased are placed around the body to protect it against impurity in the next world, and white paper flowers are placed around the body.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China and other Asian countries, white is the color of reincarnation, showing that death is not a permanent separation from the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, white is associated with the masculine (the ''yang'' of the ''yin'' and ''yang''); with the [[unicorn]] and [[tiger]]; with the fur of an animal; with the direction of west; with the element metal; and with the [[autumn]] season.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, undyed linen white robes are worn by pilgrims for rituals of purification, and bathing in sacred rivers. In the mountains, pilgrims wear costumes of undyed [[jute]] to symbolize purity. A white kimono is often placed in the casket with the deceased for the journey to the other world, as white represents death sometimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In India, it is the color of purity, divinity, detachment and serenity. In Hindi, the name Sweta means white.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], white robes were reserved for the lama of a monastery.

In the [[Bedouin]] and some other pastoral cultures, there is a strong connection between milk and white, which is considered the color of gratitude, esteem, joy, good fortune and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp. 16–35.&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Political movements ===
[[File:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|A [[cross burning]] by the racist [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Florida in the early 20th century.]]
White is often associated with [[monarchism]]. The association originally came from the white flag of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty of France. White became the banner of the royalist rebellions against the [[French Revolution]] (see [[Revolt in the Vendée]]).

During the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] which followed the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the White Army, a coalition of monarchists, nationalists and liberals, fought unsuccessfully against the [[Red Army]] of the [[Bolsheviks]]. A similar battle between reds and whites took place during the [[Civil War in Finland]] in the same period.

The Ku Klux Klan is a [[racist]] and [[anti-immigrant]] organization which flourished in the [[Southern United States]] after the [[American Civil War]]. They wore white robes and hoods, burned crosses and violently attacked and murdered black Americans.

In Iran, the [[White Revolution]] was a series of social and political reforms launched in 1963 by the last [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah]] of [[Iran]] before his downfall.

White is also associated with peace and passive resistance. The [[white ribbon]] is worn by movements denouncing [[violence against women]] and the [[White Rose]] was a non-violent [[Widerstand|resistance]] group in [[Nazi Germany]].

=== Selected national flags featuring white ===
White is a common color in national flags, though its symbolism varies widely.  The white in the [[flag of the United States]] and [[flag of the United Kingdom]] comes from traditional red [[St George's Cross]] on a white background of the historic [[flag of England]]. The white in the [[flag of France]] represents either the monarchy or "white, the ancient French color" according to the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].

Many flags in the Arab world use the colors of the [[flag of the Arab Revolt]] of 1916; red, white, green and black. These include the flags of [[Egypt]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Iraq]].

[[Philippines]] also use white as their symbol for unity in [[Flag of the Philippines|their flag]].

== Associations and symbolism ==
=== Innocence and sacrifice ===
In Western culture, white is the color most often associated with innocence, or purity.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques''.&lt;/ref&gt; In Biblical times, lambs and other white animals were sacrificed to expiate sins.  In Christianity Christ is considered the "lamb of God," who died for the sins of mankind. The white [[lily]] is considered the flower of purity and innocence, and is often associated with the [[Virgin Mary]].

=== Beginning and new ===
White is the color in Western culture most often associated with beginnings and the new. In Christianity, children are baptized wearing white, and, wear white for their first [[Eucharist|communion]]. Christ after his Resurrection is traditionally portrayed dressed in white. Eggs, another symbol of the new, are used to celebrate Easter.

The Queen of the United Kingdom traditionally wears white when she opens the session of Parliament. In high society, [[debutantes]] traditionally wear white for their first ball.

=== Weddings ===
White has long been the traditional color worn by brides at royal weddings, but the white wedding gown for ordinary people appeared in the 19th century. Before that time, most brides wore their best Sunday clothing, of whatever color.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp. 144–48&lt;/ref&gt; The white lace wedding gown of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1840 had a large impact on the color and fashion of wedding dresses in both Europe and America down to the present day.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Cleanliness ===
White is the color most associated with cleanliness. Objects which are expected to be clean, such as refrigerators and dishes, toilets and sinks, bed linen and towels, are traditionally white. White was the traditional color of the coats of doctors, nurses, scientists and laboratory technicians, though nowadays a pale blue or green is often used. White is also the color most often worn by chefs, bakers, and butchers, and the color of the aprons of waiters in French restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

White is the color associated with [[ghost]]s and phantoms. In the past the dead were traditionally buried in a white shroud.  Ghosts are said to be the spirits of the dead who, for various reasons, are unable to rest or enter heaven, and so walk the earth in their white shrouds. White is also connected with the paleness of death. A common expression in English is "pale as a ghost."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman in white, Weiße Frau, or ''dame blanche'' is a familiar figure in English, German and French ghost stories. She is a spectral apparition of a female clad in white, in most cases the ghost of an ancestor, sometimes giving warning about death and disaster. The most notable Weiße Frau is the legendary ghost of the German [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty.

Seeing a white horse in a dream is said to be presentiment of death.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Revelation]], the last book in the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] are supposed to announce the [[Apocalypse]] before the [[Last Judgement]]. The man on a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]] with a bow and arrow. according to different interpretations, represents either War and Conquest, the [[Antichrist]], or Christ himself, cleansing the world of sin. Death rides a horse whose color is described in ancient Greek as ''khlōros'' ([[wikt:χλωρός|χλωρός]]) in the original [[Koine Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codex-sinaiticus.net/en/manuscript.aspx?book=59&amp;chapter=6&amp;lid=en&amp;side=r&amp;verse=8&amp;zoomSlider=0 Codex Sinaiticus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030011038/http://www.codex-sinaiticus.net/en/manuscript.aspx?book=59&amp;chapter=6&amp;lid=en&amp;side=r&amp;verse=8&amp;zoomslider=0 |date=30 October 2013 }}, Rev 6:8.&lt;/ref&gt; which can mean either green/greenish-yellow or pale/pallid.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxlwro%2Fs A Greek-English Lexicon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406225630/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxlwro%2Fs |date=6 April 2014 }}'': χλωρός.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black and white ===
{{Further information|Black-and-white dualism}}
[[File:Yin and Yang.svg|thumb|In [[Taoism]], white represents the ''yang'' or male energy, one of the two complementary natures of the universe.]]
Black and white often represent the contrast between light and darkness, day and night, male and female, good and evil.

In [[taoism]], the two complementary natures of the universe, [[yin and yang]], are often symbolized in black and white, Ancient games of strategy, such as [[Go (game)|go]] and [[chess]], use black and white to represent the two sides.

In the French monarchy, white symbolized the King and his power ''par la grâce de Dieu'' ("by the grace of God") and in contrast black was the color of the queen who according to the Salic Law which excluded women from the throne (and thus from power) could never become the ruling monarch.

Black and white also often represent formality and seriousness, as in the costumes of judges and priests, business suits, of formal evening dress. Monks of the [[Dominican Order]] wear a black cloak over a white habit. Until 1972 agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] were informally required by FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to wear white shirts with their suits, to project the correct image of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Lydon, Christopher, "J. Edgar Hoover Made the FBI Formidable With Politics, Publicity and Results," ''The New York Times'' obituary, 3 May 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names taken from white ===
White is the source of more names for women in western countries than any other color.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Names taken from white include Alba, Albine (Latin). Blandine, Blanche and Blanchette (French); Bianca (Italian); Jennifer (Celt); Genevieve, Candice (from Latin Candida); Fenela, Fiona and Finola (Irish); Gwendoline, Gwenael, Nol(g)wen (''white woman'') (Celt), Nives (Spanish) and Zuria (Basque).{{Sfn|Heller|2000|pages=133–34}}

In addition many names come from white flowers: Camille, Daisy, Lily, Lili, Magnolie, Jasmine, Yasemine, Leila, Marguerite, Rosalba, and others.

Other names come from the white [[pearl]]; Pearl, Margarita (Latin), Margaret, Margarethe, Marga, Grete, Rita, Gitta, Marjorie, Margot.

=== Temples, churches and government buildings ===
Since ancient times, temples, churches, and many government buildings in many countries have traditionally been white, the color associated with religious and civic virtue. The [[Parthenon]] and other ancient temples of Greece, and the buildings of the [[Roman Forum]] were mostly made of or clad in white marble, though it is now known that some of these ancient buildings were actually brightly painted.&lt;ref&gt;John Gage (1993), ''Couleur et Culture'', pp. 11–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman tradition of using white stone for government buildings and churches was revived in the Renaissance and especially in the [[neoclassic style]] of the 18th and 19th centuries. White stone became the material of choice for government buildings in Washington D.C. and other American cities. European cathedrals were also usually built of white or light-colored stone, though many darkened over the centuries from smoke and soot.

The Renaissance architect and scholar [[Leon Battista Alberti]] wrote in 1452 that churches should be plastered white on the inside, since white was the only appropriate color for reflection and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'' (2012), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Reformation, [[Calvinist]] churches in the [[Netherlands]] were whitewashed and sober inside, a tradition that was also followed in the [[Protestant]] churches of New England, such as [[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]].

=== Ethnography ===
People of the [[Caucasian race]] are often referred to simply as white. The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines [[white people]] as those "having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who reported "white" or wrote in entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish."&lt;ref name=Census&gt;{{cite web

=== White flag ===
A [[white flag]] has long been used to represent either surrender or a request for a truce.  It is believed to have originated in the 15th century, during the [[Hundred Years' War]] between France and England, when multicolored flags, as well as firearms, came into common use by European armies.  The white flag was officially recognized as a request to cease hostilities by the [[Geneva Convention]] of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vexillology and heraldry ===
In English [[heraldry]], white or [[silver (color)|silver]] signified brightness, purity, virtue, and innocence.&lt;ref&gt;''American Girls Handy Book: How to Amuse Yourself and Others'', by Adelia Beard. {{ISBN|978-0-87923-666-3}}, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
