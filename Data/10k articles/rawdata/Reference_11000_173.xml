The '''adze''' is a [[vampire|vampiric]] being in [[Ewe people|Ewe]] [[folklore]]. The Ewe are located in [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]]. In the wild, the adze takes the form of a [[firefly]], though it will transform into human shape upon capture. When in human form, the adze has the power to possess humans.

People, male or female, possessed by an adze are viewed as witches ("abasom" in the Ewe language). The adze's influence would negatively affect the people who lived around their host. A person is suspected of being possessed in a variety of situations, including: women with brothers (especially if their brother's children fared better than their own), old people (if the young suddenly started dying and the old stayed alive) and the poor (if they envied the rich). The adze's effects are generally felt by the possessed victim's family or those of whom the victim is jealous.

In firefly form, the adze would pass through closed doors at night and suck blood from people as they slept. The victim would fall sick and die. Tales of the creature and its effects were probably an attempt to describe the potentially deadly effects of [[mosquito]]es and [[malaria]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There is no defense against an adze.

James West, a graduate of Edinburgh University, is the CEO of Alamy and co-founded the company with [[Mike Fischer]] in 1999. Fischer, the current chairman and co–founder of the firm, was also co-founder and CEO of [[RM Education|RM plc]].

*In 2002, Alamy won an EMMA (Electronic Multimedia Awards) award for technical excellence. The purpose of the award is to recognize excellence in digital media content creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/pressreleases/2002/stock-photography-emma-award-121202.asp|title=Alamy in the news|first=Alamy|last=Limited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced a 24/7 [[high-resolution]] download tool for customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphics.com/news-old/image-search-and-purchase-now-five-times-faster-alamycom |title=Image Search and Purchase Now Five Times Faster on Alamy.com |date=29 August 2002 |work= |publisher=Graphics |accessdate= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical innovation continued with virtual CDs becoming a replacement for RF image CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphics.com/news-old/alamy-launches-virtual-alternative-royalty-free-cds |title=Alamy Launches Virtual Alternative to Royalty Free CDs |date=2 September 2003 |work= |publisher=Graphics.com |accessdate= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2003, the firm introduced an international distribution network. Based on the resulting increased sales, it increased the royalty payments for its contributors in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weareoca.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/royalties-information-sheet.pdf |title=Alamy 100% royalties |date= |work= |publisher= Weareoca |accessdate= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epuk.org/news/alamy-under-fire-over-new-search-engine |title=Alamy CEO: AlamyRank "not disadvantaging specialist contributors" |date=16 November 2006 |work= |publisher=Editorial Photographers UK (EPUK) |accessdate= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 Alamy has paid out over $100 million to its contributors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

*In 2017, Alamy announced their new CEO, Andy Harding.

==Criticism==
On 16 February 2015 Alamy informed its members of changes to the contributor contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112424/http://www.alamy.com/contributor/contract/amendments/160215.asp?utm_source=Adestra&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Key%20Changes%20to%20Contributor%20Contract&amp;utm_campaign=Contractual%20ammendments%20-%20Jan%202015&amp;utm_term=Contributors Alamy.com, Changes to the Agreement, Amendments - 16th February 2015 (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were condemned by the photography industry bodies, the [[National Union of Journalists]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/photographers-council-questions-alamy-contracts/ Photographers’ council concerned by Alamy contracts]&lt;/ref&gt; and Editorial Photographers UK (EPUK) who said "Alamy, it seems is trying to establish a perpetual and irrevocable contract with images that they have previously sold on our behalf at a time when this was not the case, which allows them to continue selling them even after the contract with the photographer has been terminated. ... The provision would last for the full term of copyright and we see it as unreasonably extensive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epuk.org/news/an-open-letter-from-epuk-to-alamy-regarding-the-new-contributor-contract-terms An open letter from EPUK to Alamy regarding the new contributor contract terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epuk.org/news/alamy-in-the-rear-view-mirror |title=Alamy in the rear view mirror |date=27 May 2015 |author= David Hoffman |publisher= Editorial Photographers UK (EPUK) |accessdate= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alamy responded by stating that the changes only reflect the company work style and do not represent a significant shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epuk.org/news/alamy-responds-to-epuk-s-open-letter |title=Alamy responds to EPUK's open letter |date=5 March 2015 |work=  |publisher= EPUK |accessdate= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cepic.org/news/alamy-makes-change-its-commission-structure  |title=Alamy Makes a Change to its Commission Structure |date=20 November 2012 |work=  |publisher=Centre of the Picture Industry (CEPIC)   |accessdate= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reply, in turn, was characterized by the documentary photographer and Alamy contributor David Hoffman as "misleading and evasive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epuk.org/opinion/alamy-s-defence-misleading-and-evasive|title=Why I'm leaving Alamy|date=11 March 2015|publisher=EPUK|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carol M. Highsmith]] sued Alamy in July 2016 for selling photographs without attribution she had donated to the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2016/11/court-dismisses-1-billion-copyright-claim-getty.html Court Dismisses $1 Billion Copyright Claim Against Getty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2999596/Gov-Uscourts-Nysd-460787-1-0.pdf Carol M.

(archive.org)]&lt;/ref&gt; License Compliance Services, part of Alamy, had also sent an e-mail to the "This is America!" foundation, a foundation that was founded by Highsmith herself. The e-mail stated "We have seen that an image or image(s) represented by Alamy has been used for online use by your company. According to Alamy’s records your company doesn’t have a valid license for use of the image(s)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/gov.uscourts.nysd.460787/gov.uscourts.nysd.460787.1.1.pdf Unauthorized Use of Alamy Image(s) - Case Number 380913878 (Ref: 1031-7385-3953)]&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded to pay a settlement fee of $120 for the infringement Highsmith was accused of. The photograph in question was not an infringement but an original work of authorship of Highsmith. Highsmith's claim was dismissed because she had signed away her copyrights, putting the photographs in the public domain.

The '''Anjou Legendarium''' is a [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[illuminated manuscript]] of a collection of stories from the life of saints important to the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] of [[Hungary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6341">The '''attribution-value model''' is a framework for understanding individual differences in prejudice, developed by Chris Crandall and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Crandall, C. S., D’Anello, S., Sakalli, N., Lazarus, E., Wieczorkowska, G., &amp; Feather, N. T. (2001). An attribution-value model of prejudice: Anti-fat attitudes in six nations. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27, 30-37.&lt;/ref&gt; It states that not only do minorities possess undesirable characteristics incongruent with the majority, but also that minorities are also responsible for them. For example, overweight individuals are viewed as “lazy” and unable to control themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, B.E.; Kite, M.E. (2010), The psychology of prejudice and discrimination, Belmont, CA: Whitley, B.E.; Kite, M.E. (2010), The psychology of prejudice and discrimination, Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt; This belief that targeted groups should be held accountable for their status arouses negative emotional reactions towards them.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, B. (1995). Judgments of responsibility: A foundation for a theory of social conduct. New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical Support ==

A study by Crandall and his colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Crandall, C. S., D’Anello, S., Sakalli, N., Lazarus, E., Wieczorkowska, G., &amp; Feather, N. T. (2001). An attribution-value model of prejudice: Anti-fat attitudes in six nations. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27, 30-37.&lt;/ref&gt; found that dislike towards the overweight was in fact correlated with beliefs that weight is a matter of choice (e.g. “if fat people would only choose to not eat so much, they would not be fat”). Similarly, Willian Dejong (1980) asked participants to give their impression of a woman who was either overweight because of a medical condition, overweight for no apparent reason, or average weight. The woman depicted as overweight for no apparent reason was rated less favorably than both the woman of average weight and the overweight woman with a medical cause. 

The model can also extend to prejudices against homosexuality. Sakalli&lt;ref&gt;Sakalli, N. (2002). Application of the attribution-value model of prejudice to homosexuality. The Journal of Social Psychology, 142 (2), 264 – 271.&lt;/ref&gt; had Turkish undergraduates complete a homophobia scale and answer questions about the origins of homosexuality, cultural attitudes toward homosexuality, and their own gender and sexual preferences. In general, the participants were prejudiced against gay men and lesbians; the participants who thought that homosexuality was controllable had more negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians than did those who thought that homosexuality was uncontrollable. In a similar study, Nierman&lt;ref&gt;Nierman, A. (2003). Cross-cultural differences in the attribution-value model. Psi-chi Journal of Undergraduate Research, (8) 3, 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the same prejudices existed in American undergraduates, but controllability and cultural value, accounted for only 25.3% of the U.S. variance, while they accounted for 53% in the Sakalli study. Further, those who believe that homosexuality is a result of biology rather than choice express lower levels of anti-homosexual beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Matchinsky, D. J., &amp; Iverson, T. G. (1996). Homophobia in heterosexual female undergraduates. Journal of Homosexuality, 31(4), 123-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical Extension ==

As an accommodation to this model, Haslam et al.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, N., Rothschild, L., &amp; Ernst, D. (2002). Are essentialist beliefs associated with prejudice? British Journal of Social Psychology, 441, 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that two dimensions people use to categorize social groups may also account for differences in attributions. According to these dimensions, groups may be categorized based on a dimension of naturalness or entitativity.  The dimension of naturalness refers to the degree that group membership is identified on a biological level.  The dimension of entitativity refers to the degree that group membership is defined based on group members being similar to each other.
 
Some groups such as racial or gender related groups are noted as being high on both dimensions of categorization, however, other groups may possess strength in one dimension over the others.  Gay men and lesbians are seen high in the dimension of entitativity but low in the dimension of naturalness.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, B.E.; Kite, M.E. (2010), The psychology of prejudice and discrimination, Belmont, CA: Whitley, B.E.; Kite, M.E. (2010), The psychology of prejudice and discrimination, Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, p.&amp;nbsp;394&lt;/ref&gt;   
Ultimately, findings from Haslam et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, N., Rothschild, L., &amp; Ernst, D. (2002). Are essentialist beliefs associated with prejudice? British Journal of Social Psychology, 441, 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt; show that when attribution values towards prejudice are regarding the naturalness dimension group members can’t be held accountable for membership related to a biological factor that can not be controlled.  However, groups such as gays or lesbians relate more to the entitativity dimension, and attribution value related to prejudice show a stronger association between prejudice and these groups due to cultural beliefs or stigmatization of negative groups.   

Following Gordon Allport (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, B.E.; Kite, M.E. (2010), The psychology of prejudice and discrimination, Belmont, CA: Whitley, B.E.; Kite, M.E. (2010), The psychology of prejudice and discrimination, Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt;  Haslam et al.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, N., Rothschild, L., &amp; Ernst, D. (2002). Are essentialist beliefs associated with prejudice? British Journal of Social Psychology, 441, 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt; looked to see if beliefs with a fixed social category related with prejudice towards blacks, women, and gay men.  He found that strong relationships exist between these beliefs and anti-gay attitudes, while the relationship to women and blacks was weak by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, N., Rothschild, L., &amp; Ernst, D. (2002). Are essentialist beliefs associated with prejudice? British Journal of Social Psychology, 441, 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Año Cristiano''''' is a series of books published annually during the 19th century. An [[almanac]] of sorts, each volume (or set of volumes) offers a complete calendar for a particular [[Roman Catholic]] year.

It was compiled by Jean Croiset (1656-1738) and published at Toulouse from 1812.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Année chrétienne, ou Exercices de piété pour tous les jours, dimanches et fêtes de l'année... par le P. Croiset,... Janvier (-Décembre). L'Année chrétienne, ou Exercices de piété pour tous les dimanches et les fêtes mobiles de l'année... par le P. Croiset,... T. I (-V). - L'Année chrétienne, ou Exercices de piété. T. XVIIIme, contenant la Vie de N.-S. Jésus-Christ... et celle de la très-sainte Vierge Marie,... par le P. Croiset''. 1812 &amp;c. (recorded in the catalogue of the Bibliothèque nationale de France)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Año Cristiano'' is a Spanish translation published at Barcelona, 1835-55.&lt;ref&gt;''Año Cristiano, ó Ejercicios devotos para todos los dias del año ... Traducido al Castellano por el P. José Francisco de Isla (tom. 13-16 por D. José María Diaz Jimenez) ... Adicionado con las vidas de los santos y festividades que celebra la iglesia de España, y que escribieron los PP. Fr. Pedro Canteno y Fr. Juan de Rojas ... Última y completa edicion, aumentada con el Martirologio Romano'' (recorded in the British Library catalogue)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Harvard University]] visiting scholar Carl Klarner conducted a study for Ballotpedia which found that state legislative elections have become less competitive over time, with 2014's elections being the least competitive elections in the past 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Reid|title=Study: State elections becoming less competitive|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/05/07/study-state-elections-becoming-less-competitive/|accessdate=14 May 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballotpedia has helped spotlight the unnecessarily complex language used in various U.S. ballot measures. In 2017, with a sample of 27 issues from nine states, the group determined that, on average, ballot descriptions required a graduate-level education to understand the complex wording of issues, with the average American adult only reading at a 7th to 8th grade reading level. A Georgia State University analysis of 1200 ballot measures over a decade showed that voters were more likely to skip complex issues altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-rhode-island-ballot-measures-language.html|title=Unless You Went to Grad School, You Probably Won't Understand What's on Your Ballot|last=Wogan|first=J.B.|date=2017-11-06|website=www.governing.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some ballot language confuses potential voters with the use of double negatives. A few states require plain-language explanations of ballot wording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/study-finds-complex-maine-ballot-questions-a-puzzle-even-for-college-graduates/|title=Study: Maine ballot questions too confusing even for college graduates - Lewiston Sun Journal|last=Collins|first=Steve|date=2017-11-16|work=Lewiston Sun Journal|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Big City Plan''' is a major development plan for the [[city centre]] of [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

Stage 2 of the Big City Plan, the '''City Centre Masterplan''' was launched on 29 September 2010. This masterplan sets out how the city centre of Birmingham will be improved over the next 20 years. The plan identifies five key areas of development potentially worth £10 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/mixed-reactions-to-birminghams-big-city-plan/8606409.article#Scene_1 Architects Journal Overview of Masterplan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of this ambitious plan will be to increase the size of the city core by 25%, improving transport connectivity throughout the seven ‘quarters’ that make up the city centre. It identifies how the city centre population will grow providing more than 5000 new homes and 50,000 new jobs, as well as the £600 million redevelopment of [[Birmingham New Street railway station|New Street station]], opened in  September 2015, a new [[Library of Birmingham]] which opened in September 2013 and [[Eastside City Park]] which was opened in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/eastsidepark&lt;/ref&gt; the first new city centre park since Victorian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2010/09/30/work-to-start-on-13m-green-oasis-in-birmingham-city-centre-97319-27368751/2|title=Birmingham Mail report on Stage 2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003074645/http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2010/09/30/work-to-start-on-13m-green-oasis-in-birmingham-city-centre-97319-27368751/2/|archivedate=2010-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also sets out visionary proposals in which each of the seven 'quarters' will be able to evolve.

==Origins==
[[File:BirminghamCentralLibrary.jpg|thumb|[[Birmingham Central Library]].]]
The city was subject to a widespread regeneration effort following the [[Birmingham Blitz]] during [[World War II]]. This public demand for modern buildings, combined with Victorian architectural styles falling out of favour, resulted in dozens of fine Victorian buildings like the intricate glass-roofed [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street station]],&lt;ref name=aerialnewstreet&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=89806&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=10277 |publisher=Birmingham City Council |title=Aerial View of New Street Station 1963 |accessdate=2007-09-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930221007/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=89806&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=10277  |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the old Central Library being destroyed in the 1950s and 1960s by the city planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=46357&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=260 |publisher=Birmingham City Council |title=Central Library - from old to new |accessdate=2007-09-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702174842/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=46357&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=260  |archivedate = 2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These planning decisions were to have a profound effect on the image of Birmingham in subsequent decades, with the mix of concrete [[ring road]]s, [[shopping mall|shopping centres]] and [[tower block]]s giving Birmingham a 'concrete jungle' tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2701829.stm |title=Tackling congestion in Birmingham |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-02-13 |accessdate=2007-09-23 |first=Louise |last=Scrivens}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Herbert Manzoni]] was made city engineer of Birmingham and his work included the construction of the [[A4400 road|Inner Ring Road]], [[A4540 road|Middle Ring Road]] and the [[A4040 road|Outer Ring Road]], which necessitated the purchase and clearance of vast areas of land. As well as this, he designated large areas of land redevelopment areas and set about clearing large areas of slums.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/research/cpp/membersfiles/phil/biggerbetter.pdf |title=Bigger is Better?

In the mid-1980s, [[Birmingham City Council]] decided that they needed to change the image Birmingham had to the public, and improve the [[World's most livable cities|livability]] of the city.&lt;ref name=MJT&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael J. Thomas|author2=Peter Brand|title=Urban Environmentalism: Global Change and the Mediation of Local Conflict|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-30480-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first main aim was to target the areas in the city centre that had not been developed following World War II, such as the canals. The council worked closely with Argent, a developer, who redeveloped the area around the canals into a mixed use scheme [[Brindleyplace]], which began in 1994 and was completed in early 2009. This development followed the construction of the [[National Indoor Arena]] and the [[International Convention Centre, Birmingham|International Convention Centre]], which were both completed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brindleyplace.com/media-office/history Brindleyplace: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major part of the plan was to redevelop the skyline of the city. The skyline mainly consisted of postwar office buildings and through the creation of the "High Places" document, the council aimed to encourage highrise development in the city once more.

In 2007, a report was commissioned by the Leader of the Council, Councillor [[Mike Whitby]]. The result was ''The Birmingham City Centre Masterplan: The Visioning Study'' by [[Professor Michael Parkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/EIUA/EIUA_Docs/Birmingham_report_2.pdf|title=The Birmingham City Centre Masterplan: The Visioning Study|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=25 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229232654/http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/EIUA/EIUA_Docs/Birmingham_report_2.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big City Plan was launched in February 2008. Between December 2008 and February 2009 there was an extensive public consultation stage, engaging with citizens in a variety of ways: a website, newspaper supplements, leaflets, posters, a conference, and even an exhibition on a bus that toured inner-city residential districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3145405#ixzz0dltKlzQO|title=Article describing Birmingham's Big City Plan|publisher=Birmingham Post|accessdate=26 January 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the removal of the [[Birmingham Inner Ring Road|Inner Ring Road]], which acted as a 'concrete collar' preventing expansion, the city centre is newly defined as being the area within the [[A4540 road|Middle Ring Road]].&lt;ref name=udp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/EIUA/EIUA_Docs/Birmingham_report_2.pdf |title=Birmingham Unitary Development Plan Chapter 15 - City Centre |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=2008-01-11 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229232654/http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/EIUA/EIUA_Docs/Birmingham_report_2.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/eastside |title=Eastside |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=2008-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905185859/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/eastside |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big City Plan divided the now much bigger city centre into seven districts, each with its own distinct character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/areas.php |title=Designated Areas of the City Centre |publisher=Big City Plan |accessdate=26 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124044815/http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/areas.php |archivedate=24 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bull Ring===
{{main|Bull Ring, Birmingham}}
[[File:Old Bullring.jpg|thumb|The old Bull Ring Centre, added to the "concrete jungle" image of Birmingham.]]
A large part of the scheme was the redevelopment of the Bull Ring, which has been an important feature of Birmingham since the [[Middle Ages]], when its market was first held. It has been developed into a [[Shopping mall|shopping centre]] twice, first in 1964, but its Brutalist architecture became much disliked by the public and the building was seen as a major part of Birmingham's "concrete jungle" image.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/magazine/3082216.stm New adventures in concrete]'' - BBC Magazine, 5 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Realising the need for major changes to the city centre, an alliance of investment and development companies was formed called the [[Birmingham Alliance]] who put the finance together to design and construct the new £500 million Bull Ring shopping centre, which was completed in 2003.&lt;ref name="Remaking Birmingham"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kennedy|title=Remaking Birmingham: The Visual Culture of Urban Regeneration|pages=17–18|year=2004|publisher=Routledge Ltd.|isbn=0-415-28839-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wspgroup.com/en/Sectors/All/Property/Birmingham-Bullring---UK/ WSP Group: Birmingham Bullring UK] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620114822/http://www.wspgroup.com/en/Sectors/All/Property/Birmingham-Bullring---UK/ |date=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/post/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=14600178%26siteid=50002-name page.html UK's busiest shopping centre]'' - icBirmingham, September 3, 2004 (Accessed March 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is amongst the busiest shopping centres in the [[United Kingdom]] with 36.5 million visitors in 2004. It houses one of only four [[Selfridges]] department stores and the largest [[Debenhams]] outside [[London]].The area is said to bring in around £1 billion per year, and has a footfall of around 36.9 million a year.

The Rotunda was refurbished by [[Urban Splash]] into residential apartments from an office building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2005/10/15/rotunda_skyline_for_sale_feature.shtml Skyline for Sale] - BBC Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; The building was stripped to the core and floorplates&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.locatebirmingham.com/news_and_media/news/2006/8/9 Birmingham's Rotunda Development Naked at 40] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215222845/http://www.locatebirmingham.com/news_and_media/news/2006/8/9 |date=December 15, 2007 }}'' - Locate Birmingham, August 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; before new full-height windows and cladding were added, plus two LED boards to the top of the building.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/news/tm_headline=rotunda-keeps-an-eye-on-the-city&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19187468&amp;siteid=50002-name_page.html Rotunda keeps an eye on the city]'' - Birmingham Post, May 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Street Station===
{{Main|Gateway Plus}}
Designs were shown to the public in mid-February 2006 for a new Birmingham New Street station in a project known as [[Gateway Plus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewstreet.co.uk/default.asp Re-New Street: Change at New Street] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218030002/http://www.renewstreet.co.uk/default.asp |date=December 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans featured a foyer of open space with a multi-storey entrance. The roof was composed completely of glass to allow natural light to enter the entrance hall. The façade will have rounded edges and the [[Grand Central, Birmingham|Pallasades Shopping Centre]] above the station will remain.

A planning application for outline planning permission was submitted to the council in August 2006 which shows a glass façade with rounded edges. The entrance on Station Street originally included two curved 130 metre tall towers on the site of Stephenson Tower. Due to the economic slowdown, the office space is not needed, and the "twin towers" plan has been shelved until the market picks up.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2009/08/24/twin-towers-plan-for-new-street-station-shelved-due-to-economic-downturn-97319-24517039/ Twin towers plan for New Street station shelved&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Work began on the new station in September 2009. The building work will be done in phases in an attempt to minimise disruption to passengers and shoppers. Building work is expected to last until at least 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/localtravel/localtravelnews/2009/08/19/work-set-to-start-on-new-street-station-97319-24479987|title=Work set to start on New Street Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2009/08/11/new-street-revamp-work-close-to-starting-97319-24370064/ Revamp work close to starting&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snowhill===
{{main|Snowhill}}
[[File:Snowhill Phase 2 in August 2008.JPG|thumb|One Snowhill.]]
The Snowhill scheme adjacent to [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Snow Hill station]] is a large mixed-use development. Developed by Ballymore, it will feature two office blocks, a hotel tower and a 137-metre residential tower.

===Arena Central===
The Arena Central project includes offices, apartments, leisure facilities, bars and restaurants on Broad Street on the site of the former ATV / Central Television Studios which had closed in 1997. Construction has been delayed due to the property market slump.

The [[V Building]] is a proposed 51 storey landmark residential skyscraper. It will be located next to [[Alpha Tower]], one of the tallest buildings in Birmingham, on what is currently a multi-level underground car park. The total cost of the entire scheme is expected to be £400 million, and the tower, £150 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arena-central.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315155259/http://www.arena-central.com/index.html |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }} Official Arena Central website&lt;/ref&gt; Planning permission was granted in 2005, however developers Miller Developments and Bridgehouse Capital have been granted a five-year extension on planning permission for the V Building meaning it must be built by 2015.

Provision has been made for 256 serviced apartments, although these could become additional hotel space. It is estimated it will cost £125million to construct, and when completed, it will become the tallest building in the city at 200m.

===Park Central===
[[Lee Bank]] was a large inner-city council estate, which was one of five areas designated as a redevelopment area following World War 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/research/cpp/membersfiles/phil/leebankabstract.pdf Tower Block Modernism vs. Urban Morphology: An analysis of Lee Bank, Birmingham] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227084303/http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/research/cpp/membersfiles/phil/leebankabstract.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally slum housing, it was cleared by the council who constructed numerous tower blocks and low rise maisonettes. Lee Bank began to deteriorate following poor construction which led to inadequate maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcen.net/uploads/briefings/Optima_28_SEPT05.pdf Birmingham Community Empowerment Network: BRIEFING 28 SEPT 05] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010228/http://www.bcen.net/uploads/briefings/Optima_28_SEPT05.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was purchased by [[Optima Housing]] who aimed to redevelop the site.

The development, known as [[Park Central]], is phase one of a larger area Optima are developing called [[Attwood Green]].

===Paradise, Birmingham===
{{Main|Paradise, Birmingham}}
Paradise, Birmingham, previously known as Paradise Circus, is a large site in the city centre in which the council has investigated options for redeveloping the site following the imminent demolition of [[Birmingham Central Library]]. At present, it is home to the Central Library, [[Birmingham Conservatoire]] (including the [[Adrian Boult Hall]]), Birmingham Library Theatre and [[Paradise Forum]]. It was designed by [[John Madin]] and the [[Brutalist]] architecture of the conglomerate of buildings is seen by many as contributing to Birmingham's [[wiktionary:Concrete jungle|concrete jungle]] image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/your_birmingham/restoration/trash_or_treasure.shtml|title=Trash or Treasure?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastside==
{{Main|Eastside, Birmingham}}
[[File:Matthew Boulton College.jpg|left|thumb|[[Birmingham Metropolitan College]] Matthew Boulton campus after completion in 2005.]]
Eastside is a new area of Birmingham city centre made possible by the demolition of a large elevated road junction called [[Masshouse Circus]] and the [[A4400 road|Inner Ring Road]]. This was known as the "concrete collar". The council drew up plans to develop the former industrial area into a vibrant area. They also aimed to create a technology quarter, due to the proximity to [[Aston Science Park]], and to create an education quarter, due to the proximity of [[Aston University]].

The area has been sold to various developers who are being encouraged to build large mixed use schemes. The first building to be completed in Eastside was [[Millennium Point (Birmingham)|Millennium Point]] in the education quarter. This has since been followed by the completion of the [[New Technology Institute]] and the new [[Birmingham Metropolitan College]] Matthew Boulton campus.

===Eastside City Park===
[[Eastside City Park]] is a proposed [[urban park]] in Birmingham, [[United Kingdom]], projected to cover at least {{convert|8|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref name="BCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=66143&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=0|title=Eastside City Park - news and information|accessdate=2008-11-09|publisher=Birmingham City Council|year=2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609160442/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=66143&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=0  |archivedate = 2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the existing Park Street Gardens.  The scheme is part of the [[Eastside, Birmingham|Eastside regeneration programme]], and is expected to be completed in 2013.&lt;ref name="BCC" /&gt; It is the first city centre park created in Birmingham for 125 years and will double the amount of open space in the city centre.

===City Park Gate===

The City Park Gate scheme located immediately adjacent to [[Birmingham Moor Street railway station|Moor Street station]] will deliver over {{convert|450000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of Grade A offices, a 200-room hotel, 250 residential apartments, and {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail. The scheme will also include a major new public square. An outline planning application for the development, designed by [[Make Architects]], received consent on 10 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=1069 Make Architects get green light for City Park Gate project]'' - World Architecture News (Monday 14 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Construction is expected to begin in early 2008.

===Masshouse===
{{main|Masshouse}}
[[File:Masshouse block M -Birmingham -UK.jpg|thumb|Masshouse Block I after it had been topped out.]]
Masshouse is a development with the construction of 13 new highrise blocks intended for public services, commerce and residential purposes. When completed, the blocks will have a prominent position on the Eastside skyline. Also planned for location at Masshouse was [[Birmingham Magistrates' Court (building)|Birmingham Magistrates' Court]], which was scheduled to begin building in March 2010 to be completed in early 2013, but has since been cancelled by the Conservative-LibDem Coalition government.

In mid-2010, city planners approved proposals for a nine-storey, 174 bed hotel beside the existing Masshouse building. The Hotel La Tour group plans to open the four star in February 2012, creating 100 full and part-time jobs in the area. The development will include a restaurant, bar, gym and conference facilities.

===Martineau Galleries===
[[Martineau Galleries]] is a proposed mixed-use development which will connect the Eastside to the city centre core and is also located on the High Street, a major retail area. The design contains residential and office blocks as well as an open area surrounded by shops. There are also five rooftop gardens. There is also a block with two towers protruding one of which is estimated to be 110 metres in height with 29 floors and a sloped roof with two rooftop gardens either side of these. The other is shorter however also has the sloped roof. It is proposed that there are eight buildings in total on site.

===High Speed 2===
Eastside is the planned location for the city centre terminus station for ''[[High Speed 2]] (HS2)'' phase one at [[Curzon Street railway station]]. It is expected that once HS2 is complete journey times from London into Birmingham City Centre will be reduced to 45 minutes with the potential to bring £1.4 billion of economic value ([[Gross value added|GVA]]) into the region.{{dubious|date=April 2012}}  Birmingham City Council's Gross value added, sets out how investment in the Curzon area will enable the city to benefit from the improved connectivity with London (phase one 2026) and northern cities in phase two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

==Digbeth==

===Beorma Quarter===
[[File:Beormatower.jpg|thumb|How the controversial Beorma Tower will look from the Bullring.]]
The [[Beorma]] Quarter is planned for construction from 2010 onwards, as a multimillion-pound 27-storey city-within-a-city development on a site at the end of [[Digbeth]] High Street, directly opposite Birmingham's already iconic [[Selfridges]] building (it will occupy the site of the city's last seven [[burgage]] plots &lt;ref name="burgage plots"&gt;[http://www.e-architect.co.uk/birmingham/beorma_quarter_digbeth.htm e-architect]&lt;/ref&gt;). Complete with state-of-the-art environmental and energy systems, the final development is likely to consist of a [[Marriott Hotel]], apartments, green spaces, a niche shopping centre, a public space intended to house Birmingham's historic [[John F. Kennedy]] memorial and two refurbished cold storage buildings which will be redeveloped as creative industries business incubation and innovation hubs.&lt;ref name="Beorma Quarter"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beormaquarter.com/city.html |title=Beorma Quarter |access-date=2010-10-30 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117205603/http://www.beormaquarter.com/city.html |archive-date=2013-01-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning permission was granted for the Beorma Quarter in August 2009, despite the fact that the project contravenes at least two of the City Council’s own planning policies. It is outside the city's designated tall building area and is also in the middle of a conservation area. The tower was described as "abominable" and "like a punch in the face by an architectural fist" by the city’s Conservative and Heritage Panel.

Preliminary work on the construction of the Beorma Quarter began in December 2010. Work started with stripping out the listed Cold Store building opposite St. Martin's Church. The conversion of the historic, {{convert|35,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building will create an innovation centre for businesses.

By February 2011, a question mark remained over the development of the site's 27-storey tower block, as construction will only commence once occupiers are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2009/02/10/birmingham-beorma-quarter-tower-block-plan-panned-97319-22893205|title=Birmingham Beorma Quarter tower block plan panned}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birmingham Coach Station===
Digbeth Coach Station underwent a £15 million redevelopment in 2009 and was renamed [[Birmingham coach station]]. It is a major coach interchange offering services to destinations throughout [[Great Britain]] and also to [[Belfast]], [[Dublin]] and [[Poland]]. [[National Express Coaches|National Express]], the largest scheduled coach service provider in [[Europe]], has its national headquarters on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsh.co.uk/pages/news_detail.asp?id=1251|title=LSH plays integral role in £15m redevelopment of Birmingham Coach Station|publisher=LSH|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009121948/http://www.lsh.co.uk/pages/news_detail.asp?id=1251|archivedate=2011-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_objectid=17241328%26method=full%26siteid=50002-name_page.html|title=Green light for coach station rebuild|accessdate=2006-06-16 |publisher=Birmingham Mail|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other developments===
The completion of [[South Birmingham College|South Birmingham College: Digbeth]] and the renovation of the [[Custard Factory]] also attracted interest to the area economically with the opening of a [[Cadillac]] [[automobile]] showroom in the area in early 2006, despite the council naming the area as a media quarter. The Custard Factory is again set for an expansion with the refurbishment of the adjacent Devonshire House being approved by Birmingham City Council in August 2007. Scaffolding has been erected around the structure. A further planning application has been submitted for the installation of artwork on one of the railway arches making up the Digbeth Viaduct. Opposite the Custard Factory is a five-storey office development named Rhubarb designed by Bryant Priest Newman Architects which was completed in February 2010.

[[Deritend]] is also expected to witness a vast amount of redevelopment. A large number of low-rise residential schemes have been proposed with several beginning construction in 2005 and 2006. Deritend Bridge (so called because of its location near a bridge which crossed the [[River Rea]] called Deritend Bridge) was a large residential development planned for the area. It received outline planning consent however the land was then sold by the developers to another company. The site is now set to be developed into a large mixed-use scheme named Connaught Square by the Naus Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=19634466%26siteid=50002-name_page.html|title=£150m makeover for Irish quarter unveiled|date=2007-08-15|publisher=The Birmingham Post|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development in Deritend extends towards the [[Bordesley, West Midlands|Bordesley]] area which borders Eastside.

An area between Fazeley Street and the [[Grand Union Canal]] in Digbeth, named [[Warwick Bar]], has become the focus of redevelopment itself with the construction of new modern buildings and a restoration project of an old Victorian storage facility. Proposals are also being planned for the area including a little-known project known as "''The Needle''". Its location is not known according to a developments document issued however it would most likely be at Warwick Bar.

==Southside and Highgate==

===Southside BID===
The Southside Business Improvement District (BID) is a plan for the local business community to come together to develop projects and services that will benefit the environment of Southside.

=== Gay Village ===
At the end of May 2009, the City Council approved plans for a £530,000 environmental improvement scheme at the heart of the city’s Gay Village area. The proposals include extending the avenue of street trees to the full length of [[Hurst Street]] and parts of Kent Street; widening pavements to create space for café bars to provide outdoor seating and brighter street lighting with decorative lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/documents/BCP_news_autumn2009.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=Cyberbot II |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan may now be funded by Southside BID.

== Jewellery Quarter ==

===Golden Square===
In August 2010, planning permission was granted for a new £1.5 million square at the heart of Birmingham’s historic [[Jewellery Quarter]]. Created by Birmingham-based architects, Capita Lovejoy, the ‘Golden Square’ will provide a focal point for visitors and shoppers within the Quarter. Construction is due to start in Autumn 2011, with completion in Spring 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldensquarebirmingham.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115131222/http://goldensquarebirmingham.com/ |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }} Golden Square Website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newhall Square ===
[[Newhall Square, Birmingham|Newhall Square]] is a vibrant new mixed use development on the site of the former [[Museum of Science and Industry, Birmingham|Museum of Science and Industry]] on Newhall Street. It will include a range of new and restored listed buildings set around a major new square fronting the canal.

==High rise development==
[[File:Orion and Holloway Buildings Birmingham -UK.JPG|thumb|upright|Holloway Circus Tower (right) and the Orion Building (left) from Centenary Square.]]
To improve the skyline of Birmingham, the "High Places" document was produced by the council to outline appropriate places for highrise buildings and to explain what the council expects from their design.&lt;ref name="High Places" /&gt; Birmingham city centre is located on a sandstone ridge and is about 100 metres above sea level meaning that towers no taller than 40 storeys are advised due to [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]] height restrictions.&lt;ref name="High Places" /&gt;

Several towers have been proposed for Birmingham since. [[Beetham Tower, Birmingham|Beetham Tower]] was originally proposed at 191 metres, however, the height restrictions meant the height was cut down to 122 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=153 Skyscrapernews.com: Holloway Circus Tower]&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been completed. [[V Building]], first known as Arena Central Tower, was first proposed at 245 metres&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=117 Skyscrapernews.com: Arena Central Tower]&lt;/ref&gt; but was also shortened to 175 metres. The building was redesigned by [[Eric Kuhne and Associates|Eric Kuhne]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.building.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=736&amp;storycode=3083190&amp;c=3&amp;encCode=00000000012b6a3f Kuhne's Arena Central tower unveiled at MIPIM]'' - Building, March 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and is proposed at 152 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=5155 Skyscrapernews.com: The V Building]&lt;/ref&gt;

One building, [[Broad Street Tower]], surpasses the height restrictions. It received planning approval in 2006 when [[Birmingham International Airport (United Kingdom)|Birmingham International Airport]] withdrew objections to the tower.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/news/tm_objectid=17840747%26method=full%26siteid=50002%26headline=planners%2dgive%2dgo%2dahead%2dto%2d40%2dstorey%2dbirmingham%2dtower%2d-name_page.html Planners give go-ahead to 40-storey Birmingham tower]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' - Birmingham Post (Sep 29 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside of the City Centre==

The new [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham]] is the city's first superhospital, completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhb.nhs.uk/blogs/NewHospital/2009/03/birminghams-new-hospital-named.html|title=Birmingham's new hospital named|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311010340/http://www.uhb.nhs.uk/blogs/NewHospital/2009/03/birminghams-new-hospital-named.html|archivedate=2010-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completion cost was £545 million. The new hospital replaces [[Selly Oak Hospital]] and the old [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (1933–2010)]].

The [[City of Birmingham Stadium]] was a proposed multi-purpose stadium in the [[Saltley]] area of Birmingham for [[Birmingham City F.C.]], to replace the current [[St Andrews (stadium)|St Andrews Stadium]] in [[Bordesley Green]]. The original proposal was the centrepiece of a larger scheme to create a £300 million sports village on a {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} site, however, plans for the sports village fell through when plans for a proposed supercasino for the site also fell through. The stadium plans will rejuvenate a contaminated site currently used by [[Birmingham Wheels]].&lt;ref name="May 18"&gt;''[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=19125215%26siteid=50002-name_page.html New super stadium a step closer]'' - Birmingham Mail, May 18, 2007 (Accessed May 29, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban Splash also developed [[Fort Dunlop]], a former factory building next to the [[M6 motorway]], which opened in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortdunlop.com/FortDunlop.html Fort Dunlop website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518131113/http://www.fortdunlop.com/FortDunlop.html |date=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bournville College has relocated to Longbridge on the former site of the MG Rover works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14926">The '''Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/galleries/world-cultures/bishop-white-gallery-chinese-temple-art&lt;/ref&gt; is one of four galleries in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM) that are dedicated to Chinese art and archaeology. It contains one of the most important collections of Chinese temple art in the world,&lt;ref&gt;http://romlx6.rom.on.ca/exhibitions/wculture/bishop.php{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including three [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271 – 1368 AD) temple wall paintings from [[Shanxi Province]] that adorn the three walls of the Gallery, and several wooden sculptures depicting bodhisattvas from the 12th to the 15th centuries. These are some of the earliest acquisitions and most [[Royal Ontario Museum Iconic Objects|iconic objects in the ROM]].[[File:Bishop White Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|thumb|Temple statues and mural in the Gallery]]

==Name of the Gallery==

The Gallery is named in honour of [[William White (Bishop of Honan)|Bishop William Charles White]] (1873-1960), an [[Anglican]] missionary, educated at Wycliffe College in the [[University of Toronto]], who became Bishop of [[Henan province|Honan Province]], China (1909-1934). Bishop White was chiefly responsible for building and interpreting the ROM's Chinese collection in the early days and, in particular, for the acquisition of the Buddhist wall painting on the north wall of this Gallery and the H.H. Mu &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://guides.library.utoronto.ca/content.php?pid=457463&amp;sid=3847487# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117032139/http://guides.library.utoronto.ca/content.php?pid=457463&amp;sid=3847487# |archive-date=2014-01-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far Eastern Library . [[File:Bishop White on wheelbarrow.jpg|right|thumb|Bishop White in China]] He was also the first curator of the East Asian galleries (1934-1948) and founder of the School of Chinese Studies (later the East Asian Studies Department) at the University of Toronto in 1934. The Bishop White Committee in the Royal Ontario Museum was founded shortly after his death to promote the collections of the East Asian Galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley L, Bishop in Honan. Toronto: University of Toronto Press (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the Bishop White Gallery==

The collections of this Gallery are mostly [[Buddhist]], including the wall painting on the north wall of the Gallery, The Paradise of Maitreya, and the wooden sculptures, which are mostly of a later provenance; but the other two wall paintings, both entitled Homage to the First Principle, are from the [[Daoist]] tradition.

=== The Paradise of Maitreya (1298 AD)===
[[File:Paradise of Maitreya, Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|thumb|Paradise of Maitreya]]
The wall painting depicts Maitreya, the Buddha  of the future and successor to the historical Buddha, enthroned in heaven and awaiting his incarnation on earth where he will save the souls of lost humanity. Maitreya himself is the central figure but he is joined by a goodly retinue of greater and lesser bodhisattvas and monks (arhats, or 'luohan' in Chinese). According to the Indian Buddhist tradition, Maitreya will be born in to the Kingdom of Ketumati, whose King and Queen are depicted here, at the far left and right, 'taking the tonsure' (i.e., having their heads shaved) as a sign of their conversion to Buddhism.

The [[Paradise of Maitreya]], which measures approximately 16 (height) x 36 (width) feet, is known to have come from the Monastery of Joyful Conversion (Xinghua Si) in southern [[Shanxi Province]], which has long since been destroyed after falling into ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, "The Paradise of Maitreya: A Yuan Dynasty Mural from Shanxi Province" in Orientation: The Magazine for Collectors and Connoisseurs of Asian Art. (Spring 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The painting remained in situ and was undisturbed until the 1920s, when social and political unrest in China led to the destruction of many temples in the northern part of the country. To protect the wall paintings from war lords who were looting the northern monasteries, the Buddhist monks resolved to cut the painting in to 63 sections and hid them.&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley L, Bishop in Honan, p. 153. Toronto: University of Toronto Press (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually sold the painting in 1923 to a syndicate of Chinese art dealers from Beijing from whom Bishop White purchased it in 1928 for the Royal Ontario Museum where it was installed in 1933 after being reassembled.&lt;ref name="ROM"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum. The Bishop White Gallery: Wall Paintings and Wood Sculptures from Shanxi Province, China. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired through the generosity of the Sir Joseph Flavelle Foundation, in memory of Sir [[Joseph Flavelle]], a prominent Toronto businessman and Trustee of the ROM.&lt;ref name="ROM"/&gt;

The Paradise of Maitreya is currently dated as having been composed in 1298 and is one of the best surviving examples of its kind from late Yuan period, but there has been much scholarly debate about the exact date of composition. Bishop White himself contributed a monograph on the subject,&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White W., Chinese Temple Frescoes (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; arguing for a slightly earlier date, and suggesting that the painting should be attributed to Zhu Haogu, whose name Bishop White procured from the temple records before it was destroyed.  This attribution has been accepted by subsequent scholars and has been a useful point of reference for research into the development of a Buddhist-Daoist style of temple art in southern Shanxi Province.&lt;ref&gt;Stenhardt, N. "Zhu Haogu Reconsidered: A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Daoist Style," in Artibus Asiae (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sculptures (12-15th Centuries)===

These Buddhist sculptures are [[bodhisattvas]], enlightened beings who have remained on earth rather than entering paradise in order to help others attain enlightenment. These sculptures also come from Shanxi Province, though not from the same temple as the Paradise of Maitreya, and were intended as icons by which to evoke the presence of the divine, with the wall paintings serving as a background. The most famous of these are a pair of bodhisattvas, [[Guanyin]] and Dashiji, who are almost identical except for some of their accoutrements, like the diadems they wear. Their creation is attested as being in the year 1195 by an inscription set into the lower back of Guanyin, which makes them unique, as only a very few wooden sculptures of this kind dated to the 12th century are known to have survived. Many of the sculptures in the Bishop White Gallery have openings in their backs where devotees would leave offerings (e.g., printed prayers, small images or precious gems and metals) at the time of dedication to ensure their efficacy as objects of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, Homage to Heaven, Homage to Earth: Chinese Treasures of the Royal Ontario Museum. P.178. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop White surmised that most of the statues in this Gallery were sculpted from a variety of catalpa, either in pieces or from a single block.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt; All of these sculptures were acquired through the efforts of George Crofts, a fur merchant who was also instrumental as an agent in the Chinese art market of the early 20th century, and arrived to the ROM before 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, Homage to Heaven, Homage to Earth: Chinese Treasures of the Royal Ontario Museum. P.9. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homage to the First Principle (1271 - 1368 AD)===
[[File:Homage to the Highest Principle (1 of 2), Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Homage to the Highest Principle]]
On the east and west walls of the Bishop White Gallery are a pair of two slightly smaller paintings, [[Homage to the Highest Power|Homage to the Highest Principle]], that depict a procession of Daoist deities and their celestial attendants, sometimes referred to as Chaoyuan tu or the 'Heavenly Court'. These deities, whose court is modeled on the bureaucratic structure of the earthly world, are said to maintain the order of nature and to govern the welfare of human beings.  In their original monastic context, these processional paintings would have led up to a great picture at the end of the room, probably depicting the heavenly host.&lt;ref&gt;Currely, C. I Brought the Ages Home. Toronto: Ryerson Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bishop White Gallery, the north wall is occupied by the Paradise of Maitreya, a Buddhist painting but with a similar motif and treatment of the subject matter as what would have been seen in the original Daoist temple. By the time that these paintings were being produced in the 13th or 14th century, Buddhism had been assimilated into the Chinese philosophical system, and this syncretism had long since begun to influence iconography.&lt;ref name="ROM"/&gt;

The provenance of these paintings, which both measure approximately 10 (height) x 34 (width) feet, is not known with certainty. It is thought that they came from a Daoist temple in southern [[Shanxi]], whose name and exact location are unknown, but the stylistic similarity between these and other paintings found in another Shanxi Daoist temple, Yongle Gong, suggests that they might have come from the same workshop and be roughly contemporaneous, dating from the early 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, K., Gesterkamp, L and Ruitenbeek, K. Beyond Clouds and Waves: Daoist paintings in the Royal Ontario Museum. P. 45-63. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the paintings in Yongle Gong bear the inscription of the master Zhu Haogu, the same painter whom Bishop White first identified as being responsible for the Paradise of Maitreya, it has been inferred that all three wall paintings in the Bishop White Gallery, both Buddhist and Daoist, might have been executed by the same man or, at least, in the same workshop.&lt;ref name="ROM"/&gt;
                                               
The Daoist murals were acquired through the well-known art dealership of [[Yamanaka &amp; Co.]] in 1937. [[Charles Trick Currelly|Charles Currelly]], the founding Director of the ROM, relates in his autobiography how the paintings were offered to the Museum by a certain Mr. Tanaka, who, being particularly impressed by the quality of the Buddhist wall painting already in the ROM's possession, thought it desirable that the pair of Daoist paintings should also come to the ROM, so that there would be in North America at least one complete representation of what these early Northern Chinese temples would have been like.&lt;ref&gt;Currelly, C. I Brought the Ages Home, p. 254. Toronto: Ryerson Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design of the Bishop White Gallery==

The Bishop White Gallery is located in the original wing of the ROM, constructed in 1914, where it has remained since the wall paintings were installed in the 1930s. The design of the Gallery, however, has changed dramatically over the years, beginning with a fairly prosaic display of the objects around the circumference of the room, later progressing in the 1980s to a recreation of an authentic temple setting and, since the mid-2000s, receiving a more modern treatment with an 'open concept' layout.

In the early 1980s, the Bishop White Gallery was redesigned to give the effect of a Chinese Buddhist temple of the 14th century. This was not an attempt to reproduce a particular site but rather a thoughtful way of utilizing the space to combine a number of roughly contemporary artefacts into a coherent unit. This was done by imitating a few features of what remains from the Yongle Gong temple complex, long roof beams terminating in curved brackets and a coffered ceiling, together with the same general layout of a rectangular space where devotees could participate in rituals such as meditative circumambulation around a raised altar supporting sculpted images of bodhisattvas.
[[File:The Temple Reconstruction, Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|thumb|Temple Statues]]
The choice of a temple environment was appropriate not only thematically, since both the wall paintings and the statues were originally used as temple art, but also in terms of the provenance of these artefacts, which originated in geographic proximity to each other in northern China. It might be objected that the contents of this Gallery are not exactly contemporaneous, dating from 1195 to the late 14th century, but yet it would not have been uncommon for a temple to contain devotional objects that its community had accumulated throughout many generations. Although the wall paintings displayed in this 'temple' setting are both Buddhist and Daoist, it was decided that this too would not be inappropriate, because there had long since been a blending of these two religious belief systems. Indeed, from the 10th century onwards the syncretism of Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian beliefs – 'The Three Teachings' - was reflected even in the similarity of artistic style, which is certainly evidenced in the examples presented in the Bishop White Gallery. The renovated Gallery was reputed to be as close as one could come outside China to a major North Chinese monastery hall.&lt;ref&gt;Nagai-Berthrong, E. "The Bishop White Gallery," p. 12, in Rotunda. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (Fall 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present Design==

The current incarnation of the Gallery, which opened in 2005, dates from the renovations that were undertaken during the first phase of the 'Renaissance ROM' building project. Several other galleries were also renovated, including the other galleries of the Far Eastern collection, and the construction of the Michael-Lee Chin Crystal, designed by [[Daniel Libeskind]], was completed in 2007. Like the Crystal, the renovation of gallery space in the historic buildings was also intended to be modern in style - quite austere, with a minimum of colour and helpful signage, and an 'open-concept' layout that minimizes visual barriers between adjoining galleries, purportedly so that audience might appreciate the collections as 'works of art,' with little indication of the context for which objects – particularly religious objects – were originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;Ruitenbeek, K. "Light from and for the East: The New East Asian Galleries in the ROM", p.39-44, in Orientations: The Magazine for Collectors and Connoisseurs of Asian Art. (Spring 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; That said, the general organization of the artefacts remains much as it was during the Gallery's previous incarnation as a temple reconstruction, with the murals surrounding the wooden sculptures situated in the middle of the space, but the decorative elements of the temple setting have been stripped away to focus one's attention on the objects themselves.

'''Cape Bowling Green Light''' is an active [[lighthouse]] located on Cape Bowling Green, a lengthy [[headland]] ending with a long low [[Spit (landform)|sandspit]], about {{convert|30|km}} from [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The lighthouse is at the end of the headland, near the base of the sandspit. The first lighthouse at the location, established 1874, was moved multiple times. It was prefabricated in [[Brisbane]], shipped to the location, moved twice due to [[coastal erosion]] and finally transferred for display at the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] at [[Darling Harbour]] in [[Sydney]].{{sfn|Rowlett NSW}}{{Sfn|Museum}}

==History==
Many ships wrecking at Cape Bowling Green necessitated the construction of a lighthouse at the cape. The first Cape Bowling Green Light was constructed in 1874, one of 22 lighthouse of similar design constructed in Queensland around that time. It was a round conical tower, constructed of local [[hardwood]] [[Timber framing|frame]] [[cladding (construction)|clad]] with [[galvanization|galvanized]] iron plates imported from Britain. The lighthouse was [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] in Brisbane, then dismantled and shipped to the location to be erected again.{{Sfn|Museum}} The construction was done by the brothers John and Jacob Rooney of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], which also constructed [[Sandy Cape Light]], [[Cowan Cowan Point Light]], [[Cape Capricorn Light]], [[Lady Elliot Island Light]]{{sfn|QLD601712}} and [[Booby Island Light]].{{sfn|QLD601724}}

The original lens was a 3rd order [[Chance Brothers]] [[dioptric]] lens, and the light source was a [[kerosene]] wick lamp with an intensity of 13,000&amp;nbsp;[[candela|cd]], visible for {{convert|14|nmi}}. The apparatus was rotated with a [[clockwork]] mechanism and the station was operated by four [[lighthouse keeper]]s, a chief and three assistants.{{Sfn|Museum}}

In 1878 beach erosion threatened the lighthouse for the first time and it was moved for the first time. In 1908 the tower had to be relocated further away for the same reason.{{Sfn|Museum}}{{Sfn|Rowlett NSW}}

In 1913 an [[incandescent gas mantle]] operated by vaporised kerosene was installed, raising the power to 64,000&amp;nbsp;cd. In 1920 a fixed automatic [[acetylene gas]] lamp ([[carbide lamp]]) with a [[sun valve]] was installed. As a result, the lighthouse was demanned and all other buildings were demolished.{{Sfn|Museum}}

In 1985 a [[racon]] was installed.  In 1987 the lighthouse was replaced by the current skeletal tower. With the sponsorship of the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]], the lighthouse was dismantled, and sections were lifted by a [[Department of Transport and Main Roads|Department of Transport]] [[helicopter]] to a site where they were numbered, crated, and shipped to Sydney. By 1994 the lighthouse was reassembled at the Australian National Maritime Museum where it is now on display. {{Sfn|Museum}} The lighthouse is still operational, using the original 3rd order lens and a typical 1913 clockwork mechanism, and it maintains its original [[light characteristic]], four white flashes every twenty seconds (Fl.(4)W. 20s).{{Sfn|Rowlett NSW}}

==Current structure and display==
The current tower is a square steel skeletal tower. It is topped by a square lantern structure with a gallery. It is painted white with a red horizontal band at the top.{{sfn|Rowlett}}
The light characteristic shown is four white flashes every twenty seconds (Fl.(4)W. 20s), visible for {{convert|11|nmi}}.&lt;ref name=LoL&gt;''List of Lights''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site operation and visiting==
The current lighthouse is operated by the AMSA. The visiting status is unclear.{{sfn|Rowlett}} The original lighthouse is owned and operated by the Australian National Maritime Museum,{{sfn|Rowlett NSW}} and it is open for guided tours daily.{{sfn|Guided Tours}}

VII, ff. 31r-52r]) is a [[medieval]] [[Latin]] manuscript relating the early history of the [[Isle of Man]].

==Dating==
The main part of the manuscript is believed to have been composed and written in 1261 or 1262 at [[Rushen Abbey]] on the island, shortly after the time of the [[Cistercian]] abbey's dedication in 1257, which is the final event retold by the original scribe. The manuscript is written in ink on [[vellum]], with pages roughly {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}}.

==Contents==
The ''Chronicles'' are a look back, year-by-year from 1016, over the significant events in [[Manx history]] of that time. Written in Latin, it records the island's role as the centre of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]], and the influence of its kings and religious leaders, as well as the role of [[Rushen Abbey]] itself – which was founded at the invitation of [[Olaf I Godredsson]], one of the Norse kings. The original scribe also wrote a list of popes (ff. 3r-14r) which ends with [[Pope Urban IV]] (1261–4). It is probable that the ''Chronicles'' were written for the new abbey on its foundation.

Entries for the earlier years are notably shorter than those towards the end of the original section of the manuscript, no doubt due to later events having occurred within living memory of the time of writing, and thus more detail being available. Many of the dates of the earlier annals are put around 15 years earlier than the actual event, and none of these entries before 1047 are directly related to the Isle of Man, having been copied from a source shared with the ''[[Chronicle of Melrose]]''.

Several further notes were later added by the abbey's [[Cistercian monks]], taking the ''Chronicles'' up to 1316. The manuscript also contains a copy of [[Bonizo of Sutri]]'s ''Cronica Romanorum pontificum'' (ff. 15r-30r) and a territorial survey (ff. 53r-54v).&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite web|title=Cotton MS Julius A VII|url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?index=0&amp;ref=Cotton_MS_julius_a_vii|work=Digitised Manuscripts|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A record of the bishops of the Western Isles to [[John Dongan|John Donkan]] ([[Bishop of Sodor and Man|Bishop of Man]] and [[Bishop of the Isles|the Isles]] from 1374 to 1387) is appended to the ''Chronicles''.&lt;ref name=DM /&gt;

==Provenance==
After the abbey was dissolved in 1540 the manuscript is thought to have passed through a number of private hands until being presented by [[Roger Dodsworth]] (d. 1654) to Sir [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]] (d. 1631) in 1620/1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanities Research Institute Online|url=http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/cotton/mss/jul1.htm|publisher=University of Sheffield|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton's collection of medieval and early modern manuscripts was one of the founding collections of the [[British Museum]] and is now cared for by the [[British Library]] in London.

==Repatriation==
There have been campaigns to move the ''Chronicles'' permanently to the [[Isle of Man]].

In 2014 it was confirmed that the [[Celtic League]] will be demanding the return of the Chronicles to the [[Isle of Man]].

{{cleanup|reason="Account expiration (inactivity)"
* The article doesn't explain "Account expiration". Is it (just) a deletion of e-mails, or a removal of the account which means the user would have to re-register if he wants to use it again? Sometimes it's (just) an email expiration, but not an account expiration: One's mails get deleted, but one can still sign-in.

== Description of the Dipylon krater in New York ==
The Met's Dipylon krater is {{convert|43|in|cm}} tall and has a circumference of {{convert|25.5|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The monumental vase is hollow, with a hole at the bottom, indicating that it was not used as a mixing bowl like regular kraters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the Dipylon Cemetery, where it was found, kraters marked the graves of men.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/courses/greekpast/4880.html|title=Dipylon vases|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decorations occupy the entire vase, separated into registers containing abstract motifs or figural designs in a dark-on-light style.

A key-patterned meander fills the top registers, while funerary iconography sits below. The figural scenes describe two of the three parts of a proper burial: a prothesis and an ekphora.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dbag/hd_dbag.htm|title=Death, Burial, and the Afterlife in Ancient Greece {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prothesis is the laying out of a body for mourning, and an ekphora is the transportation of the body to the grave. The third step in a burial would be the actual burial of the body or its ashes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The prothesis scene on the Met's Dipylon Krater features standing women with triangular torsos surrounding a prostrate body underneath a checkered burial shroud.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The women raise their arms to their head, tearing out their hair as a sign of mourning for the deceased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Abstract geometric motifs and animals fill space in between the figures in a dense style characteristic of the Late Geometric Period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Underneath, the ekphora scene displays warriors with chariots and hourglass-shaped shields transporting the body in a funeral procession.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The horses overlap each other without clear distinctions, in a stiff profile featured across the vase. The elaborate procession, complete with soldiers and horses indicates the importance this family placed on a proper burial,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MOORE|first=MARY B.|date=2007|title=ATHENS 803 AND THE EKPHORA|jstor=41321236|journal=Antike Kunst|volume=50|pages=9–23|doi=10.2307/41321236}}&lt;/ref&gt; a value also featured in canonical Greek texts like the [[Iliad]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The similarity of this vase's iconography to that of the Dipylon Amphora, attributed to the same artist, reveals that the rituals displayed were not isolated but were part of a larger tradition of Greek funerary rites in Geometric Period Athens.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

He is perhaps best known for his [[radio program]], ''The Talk of Gasoline Alley'', broadcast annually throughout the [[Indianapolis 500 traditions#Month of May|"Month of May"]] on [[WFNI]] in [[Indianapolis]], as well as his long tenure as a part of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]].

Davidson is a member of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame|Auto Racing Hall of Fame]], the Richard M. Fairbanks Indiana Broadcast Pioneers Hall of Fame,&lt;ref name="IBHOP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/news/show/52354-indiana-broadcasting-hall-to-induct-ims-historian-davidson/|title=Indiana Broadcasting Hall To Induct IMS Historian Davidson|publisher=IndianapolisMotorSpeedway.com|date=2013-09-25|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usacracing.com/news/silver-crown/item/6381-8-initial-2017-usac-hall-of-fame-inductees-announced|title=8 Initial 2017 USAC Hall of Fame Inductees Announced|publisher=USAC Racing|date=June 19, 2017|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he was named a [[Sagamore of the Wabash]] by [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Mike Pence]].

==Personal history==
[[British people|British]] born, Davidson was from [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]] in [[South West England]].&lt;ref name="seniorlife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="One on One"&gt;{{cite episode|title=One on One With Mark Montieth|url=http://www.1070thefan.com/oneonone/|network=[[WFNI]]|airdate=2009-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717160855/http://www.1070thefan.com/oneonone/|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a [[Movie theater|cinema]] [[projectionist]]&lt;ref name="Star05-26-1984"&gt;{{cite news|title=Davidson's memory still in demand at Speedway|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5861920/donald_davidson_indianapolis_motor/|first=Robin|last=Miller|author-link=Robin Miller (journalist)|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=18|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 26, 1984|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley|station=[[WFNI]]|airdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first learned of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] when he became passionately interested in [[Formula One|Grand Prix]] [[motor racing]] in the mid-1950s. Part of that interest stemmed from viewing highlight films of auto races. It did not take long for his interest to transfer over to the [[Indianapolis 500]], plus other forms of [[United States|American]] oval track racing. Davidson sought out books, magazines, and other various publications relating to auto racing. He then proceeded to memorize, in great detail, the results of every [[Indianapolis 500]]. He has been described as having [[Selective retention|Selective Retentive]] Easy-Access Memory.&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemmings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2010/12/01/hmn_feature12.html|title=Donald Davidson Guardian of the Indianapolis 500's history as its centennial nears|publisher=Hemmings|first=Jim|last=Donnelly|date=2012-12-01|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson saved up his own money and first visited Indianapolis in May 1964.&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt; He had relatives in [[Chicago]], with whom he arranged to stay during part of the trip. He had written to [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS]] [[radio announcer]] [[Sid Collins]] and amazed the crowd by being able to recite the record of every [[race car driver|driver]] who had ever competed in the "500." He was quickly and warmly welcomed by the Speedway staff as well as participants, and within hours of his arrival, he was given free credentials.&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemmings"/&gt; Collins invited Davidson to make a brief appearance as a guest on the radio broadcast of the [[1964 Indianapolis 500|1964 race]].&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt;

===USAC years===
Davidson returned to the Speedway to attend the [[1965 Indianapolis 500]]. He reunited with [[Sid Collins]] and the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|Radio Network]] staff. He joined the staff as a popular fixture, and sought permanent employment in Indianapolis. 

A few days after the 1965 race, Davidson was hired by [[Henry Banks]] to work at [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] as a [[statistician]], a position he would hold for 31 years. He also worked as a publicist, writing the USAC newsletter and other related publications. Davidson left USAC in 1997, and worked briefly for IMS Productions, the in-house television division at the Speedway. In January 1998 he officially became the full-time [[historian]] of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and maintains an office at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum|Museum]]. He is also now the longest-serving commentator on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]] staff, having served in at least some capacity on every radio broadcast of the Indianapolis 500 since 1965 (not including his guest appearance in 1964).&lt;ref name="IBHOP"/&gt;

Parallel to his work on the IMS Radio Network, Davidson also worked on the local radio coverage of practice and time trials on [[WIBC (FM)|WIBC]].

==''The Talk of Gasoline Alley''==
===Origins===
In 1966, [[Sid Collins]] arranged for Davidson to host 15-minute semi-daily radio program on [[WIBC (FM)|1070 WIBC]] during the month of May. The program was called "Dial Davidson," and allowed phone-in callers to ask Davidson questions about the Indianapolis 500.&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt;

In 1967, Davidson was unable to continue the program because he was going through [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]] at [[Fort Rucker]] in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]].&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt; He missed a considerable part of the month of May at Indy in 1967, but was able to attend the race itself and serve on the radio network broadcast.

After management changes at [[WIBC (FM)|1070 WIBC]] in 1970, the station vastly increased their coverage of the Indianapolis 500 for 1971. Davidson was invited back to host a one-hour nightly [[quiz show]] about the Indy 500. The show was unnamed for the first two to three years, but for a brief time it was called "Stump the chump".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley|station=[[WFNI]]|airdate=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lou Palmer (motorsport broadcaster)|Lou Palmer]] called the program "Do it to Donald"&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt; and Chuck Riley called it "Stymie the [[Limey]]."&lt;ref name="One on One"/&gt; Callers won prizes if Donald did not know the answer.

===Show format===

[[Image:Fan1.JPG|thumb|right|1070 WFNI Studios]]
[[File:IndianapolisMotorSpeedwayPressBuilding.jpg|thumb|Currently, most episodes of ''The Talk of Gasoline Alley'' originate from the press center at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which overlooks the track on the mainstretch.]]
After a few seasons, the show evolved from a "rapid fire" call-in quiz show to a more long form caller-based question &amp; answer [[Talk radio|talk show]], with Davidson taking the role of [[raconteur]]. Davidson fields the callers' questions, preferably of a [[Nostalgia|nostalgic]] nature, about the history of the [[Indianapolis 500]]. Furthermore, he prohibits himself from using any sort of reference material during the show, relying only on his own memory. Not only does he answer questions, but he adds various anecdotes, [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]], statistics, driver biographies, and may recount other related stories, typically of personal experiences regarding the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.16thandgeorgetown.com/2009/06/q-with-great-donald-davidson.html|title=Q&amp;A With The Great Donald Davidson|publisher=16thandGeorgetown|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics for discussion are broad, but are often focused on biographies of drivers, team owners, mechanics, and other personalities associated with the race or the track. Other popular topics include track lore, famous cars, race recaps, members of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]], the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum|museum]] and its exhibits, and specific events from a particular year. Discussions regarding non-race winners and drivers of relative obscurity (particularly drivers from the very early years) are warmly received, as it offers "fresh" content to the program. 

Controversial topics are frowned upon, and a small list of oft-repeated subjects that have been answered [[ad nauseam]] are usually avoided (the [[STP-Paxton Turbocar|Turbines]], [[Leon Sirois|Jigger Sirois]], the [[Jim Hurtubise]] [[1972 Indianapolis 500#Bump Day – Sunday May 21 (Jim Hurtubise "Beer engine")|"beer engine" incident]], the [[1911 Indianapolis 500#Controversy|1911 controversy]], and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley|station=[[WFNI]]|airdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, shows that air during [[Brickyard 400]] week invite questions about [[NASCAR]] and [[USAC Stock Car]] history, both of which Davidson is also well-versed.

===WIBC years===
By the late-1970s, the program adopted the name ''The Talk of Gasoline Alley'' (in reference to the nickname of the garage area at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]). Starting around 1983, the show moved from the downtown studios of WIBC to the track itself, and for one year was set up in the lobby of the Speedway Motel. The following year, the show moved to the garage area. Eventually Davidson was invited to broadcast the program from one of the team's garages, and mechanics were usually heard in the background working on the cars. In many years, the show was done from the garages of the Jonathan Byrd team. Starting in 1990, a special post-race drive home show has also been aired, immediately following the conclusion of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]] race broadcast. In recent years, the program has originated from the media center at the Speedway, or from the WFNI studios downtown.

For much of its run on 1070 WIBC-AM, the hour-long show aired daily at 6:00 p.m. local time. That coincided with the time of the day the track closed for practice (or time trials) each evening. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the show was jointly produced as a part of [[Dave Wilson (radio personality)|Dave "The King" Wilson's]] nightly [[Drive time|drive-home]] show. Consistent with airing on a traditionally [[news radio|news]]/[[talk radio|talk]] station, the show was frequently at the mercy of numerous breaks for news, traffic, and weather reports, and occasional pre-emption for [[breaking news]] and other live sports coverage.

For a brief period, the show was expanded to two hours, with the second hour carried on ''Network Indiana'', a syndicated feed that was picked up by several stations around the state.

Starting in 1994, the program expanded to new events at Indy. The show was added the week in July/August for the [[Brickyard 400]] (1994–2009, 2013–2016), the weekend involving the [[Formula One|F1]] [[United States Grand Prix|U.S. Grand Prix]] (2000–2007), as well as the [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Moto G.P.]] Around 2001, WIBC began streaming over the internet, effectively exposing the show to a nationwide/worldwide listening audience. In 2006, the program became available in [[podcast]] form.

Davidson's other radio experiences included regular appearances on WIBC's Sunday morning program "The First Day" in 1976–1984, and a nostalgic radio program titled "Looking Back with Davidson" on [[WIAN]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="IBHOP"/&gt;

===WFNI years===
In 2008, after 37 years on [[WIBC (FM)|1070 WIBC]], the station was reorganized, and the program moved to [[WFNI|1070 The Fan]]. The show moved to the 8 p.m. timeslot. It is currently part of a two-hour daily block, with ''Trackside with Curt Cavin &amp; Kevin Lee'' serving as a lead-in during the 7 o'clock hour. Typically either Lee or Cavin sits in to serve as host/[[call screener]]. Since having moved to a dedicated [[Sports radio|sports talk]] station, the program enjoys more leeway in the broadcast window, and is no longer burdened by news reports and the like. However, the program is still occasionally interrupted by [[Indiana Pacers|Pacers]] games, as WFNI is the flagship for the team. In some cases, the program has been simulcast or [[Reverse mirror|mirrored]] over to sister station 107.5 FM to avoid preemption.

Along with the traditional telephone calls, questions are now also accepted via e-mail and [[Twitter]]. In some cases discussion topics are pre-planned by the hosts, particularly for the opening segment, or follow-ups from previous night's question(s) kick off the program. A short list of longtime frequent callers complement the show, including Dave from [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]], Paul in [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], Mike in [[Vernon Hills, Illinois|Vernon Hills]], Jerry in [[Delphi, Indiana|Delphi]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wishtv.com/blog/2011/05/04/preserving-history/comment-page-1/|title=Preserving History|publisher=WISH-TV|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The show is traditionally aired live, however, on rare occasions when Davidson (or the co-host) has prior commitments, the show will be pre-recorded. In those cases, no phone calls will be taken, instead the topics will be culled from e-mail or Twitter requests. As of 2017, the show has aired for 46 consecutive seasons, and has produced upwards of 1,275 episodes.

In 2010, Davidson was inducted as a member of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum#Hall of Fame|Auto Racing Hall of Fame]] at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In 2013, he was inducted into the Richard M. Fairbanks Indiana Broadcast Pioneers Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="IBHOP"/&gt; In 2016, ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' named Davidson to the list of the 100 most influential people in the history of the Indianapolis 500,&lt;ref name="SVRA6-7-16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://svra.com/news/donald-davidson-named-brickyard-invitational-grand-marshal/|title=Donald Davidson Named Brickyard Invitational Grand Marshal|publisher=SVRA.com|date=June 7, 2016|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise [[WFNI]] ranked him #10 on the list of Top Ten Influential People (Non-Drivers) in Indy history. In June 2016, Davidson was named the [[grand marshal]] of the [[Indy Legends Charity Pro–Am race]].

==Books and media==
[[File:Donald Davidson 20120519.jpg|thumb|right|Donald Davidson in 2012.]]
As chief historian for USAC and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Davidson has written, or contributed to numerous books about auto racing and the Indianapolis 500. His earlier contributions include the annual 500 Yearbooks and magazine articles. In 1974 and 1975, he wrote a short-lived series of Indianapolis 500 [[Annual publication|annuals]] entitled "Donald Davidson's 500 Annuals." During the month of May for numerous years, Davidson penned a daily column in the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' about Indianapolis 500 history. In addition to his work on the radio Davidson also co-hosted local Indy 500 practice and qualifications coverage on [[WNDY-TV|WTTV]] (1984–1989) and [[WNDY-TV]] (1995–1997).&lt;ref name="IBHOP"/&gt;

After many years of helping others with their books on the Indianapolis 500, Davidson wrote his own, put out through the publishers of ''[[Autocourse]]'', entitled ''Autocourse Official History of the Indianapolis 500'', co-authored by Rick Shaffer.&lt;ref name = "Autocourse"&gt;{{cite book|title=Autocourse Official Illustrated History of the Indianapolis 500 |author=Mr. Donald Davidson and Mr. Rick Schaffer |ISBN=978-1-905334-20-9|publisher=Crash Media Group|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated [[Edition (book)|second edition]] was published in 2013.

Davidson has appeared on numerous television programs, including ''[[NASCAR on TBS|Motorweek Illustrated]]'', ''[[SportsCentury]]'' on [[ESPN]], and ''Indy 500 The Classics'' on [[Speedvision]].

Davidson has served as a lecturer at [[IUPUI]] and for many years taught a [[Continuing education|course]] in motorsports history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Motorsports history | author = [[IUPUI]] | work = 2011 IUPUI Community Learning Network | url = http://www.cln.iupui.edu/content/cs/Catalog_Fall11.pdf | page = 22 | accessdate = 2011-08-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110062713/http://www.cln.iupui.edu/content/cs/Catalog_Fall11.pdf | archivedate = 2011-11-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Jaguars Spirit |url= http://www.iupui.edu/spirit/legends/ |accessdate= 2011-08-21 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110806090154/http://www.iupui.edu/spirit/legends/ |archivedate= 2011-08-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a frequent guest speaker at various engagements including trade shows, civic and social events, banquets, and awards ceremonies. Davidson lives within walking distance of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], and has an office inside the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum|museum]]. In 2003, a house fire swept through his basement, destroying some items from his personal collection, including a photograph of himself with [[1911 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Ray Harroun]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TcNJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vRANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6814,6133407&amp;dq=donald+davidson+speedway+house+fire&amp;hl=en Speedway Historian loses personal treasures in fire]&lt;/ref&gt; On his radio program, though he is guarded of his age, Davidson mentioned that he shares a birthday with Indy 500 winners [[Jimmy Bryan]] and [[Takuma Sato]], as well as driver [[Gene Hartley]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Talk of Gasoline Alley'' – [[WIBC (FM)|1070-AM WIBC]]/Network Indiana, May 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Dongguk Jeongun''''' ('''''Standard Rhymes of the Eastern States''''') is a [[Korea]]n dictionary of [[rhyme]]s which sets out a standard practice for pronouncing Chinese characters in Korean. It was compiled between 1446 and 1448 under the instructions of [[Sejong the Great]], and serves as a companion volume to his ''[[Hunminjeongeum]]''.&lt;ref name=JoongAng&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Rhymes of the Eastern State|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2999505|publisher=Korea JoongAng Daily|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHAK&gt;{{cite web|title=Dongguk jeongun (Standard Rhymes of the Eastern State)|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza_new/ECulresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,01420000,11&amp;queryText=*&amp;requery=0&amp;mc=EN_03_02|website=Heritage Information|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the first printed books in Korea, using both woodblock printing and metal type printing. Woodblocks were used for the larger characters (whose calligraphy is attributed to Prince Jinyang) and metal for the smaller text.&lt;ref name=JoongAng/&gt;&lt;ref name="清州古印刷博物館2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=清州古印刷博物館|title=Chikchi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtFAAQAAIAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Cheongju Early Printing Museum|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">'''European Component Oriented Architecture''' (ECOA) is an open specification for a software framework for mission system software comprising components that are both [[Real-time computing|real-time]] and [[Service-oriented architecture|service-oriented]].

ECOA is managed by the [[France|French]] [[Direction générale de l'armement]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]] (through the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] - DSTL) with the help of the following [[Working group|industry partners]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Dassault Aviation]]
* [[Thales Group]] (Air forces branch)

==History==
The initial study began in January 2008 with French partners, but work on the standard really began in January 2011. In August 2015, the first version of the standard was publishers as a UK Defense standard (DEFSTAN). In December 2015, the standard was republished as a [[Bureau de normalisation de l'aéronautique et de l'espace|BNAE]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.ecoa.technology/news.html#news
| title=News and history
| publisher=www.ecoa.technology
| accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, an updated specification has been made available.

==Concepts==
ECOA defines an architecture framework based on a [[Service-oriented architecture]]. ECOA Software Components (ASCs) are composed of modules which contain the application code and may run in parallel. ECOA provides mechanisms to make these software components portable across computing platforms through use of an interfacing layer called a ''container''. Components  communicate with other components  using [[Event (computing)|events]], [[request–response]] and [[Data|versioned data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The application can be downloaded and installed on a server.

Feng Office could also be categorized as [[collaborative software]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://obsessivecollaborator.com/2008/03/more_updates_opengoo_eyeos.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902040901/http://obsessivecollaborator.com/2008/03/more_updates_opengoo_eyeos.html |archivedate=2008-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[personal information manager]] software.

== Features ==
Feng Office Community Edition main features include [[project management]], [[document management]], [[contact management]], [[e-mail]] and [[time management]]. Text documents and presentations can be created and edited [[online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkofit.com/webconf/workspaces.htm#groupware |title=Web Collaboration Software &amp; Services |publisher=Thinkofit.com |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Files can be uploaded, organized and shared, independent of [[file formats]].

Organization of the information in Feng Office Community Edition is done using [[Workspace#Online applications|workspaces]] and [[Tag (metadata)|tags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artduszynski.com/?p=31 |title=OpenGoo: A Sticky Application &amp;#124; Art Imitates Life |publisher=Artduszynski.com |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application presents the information stored using different [[User interface|interfaces]] such as lists, [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]] and [[calendar]] views.

== Licensing ==
Feng Office Community Edition is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.

== Technology used ==
Feng Office uses [[PHP]], [[JavaScript]], [[AJAX]] ([[ExtJS]]) and [[MySQL]] technology.

Several open source projects served as a basis for development. [[Active Collab|ActiveCollab's]] last open sourced release was used as the initial [[code base]]. It includes [[CKEditor]] for online document editing.

== System requirements ==
The server could run on any operating system. The system needs the following packages:
* [[Apache HTTP Server]] 2.0+
* [[PHP]] 5.0+
* [[MySQL]] 4.1+ ([[InnoDB]] support recommended)

On the client side, the user is only required to use a modern [[Web browser]].

== History ==
[[File:Logo opengoo.png|thumb|Former logo]]
OpenGoo started as a degree project at the faculty of Engineering of the [[University of the Republic, Uruguay]]. The project was presented and championed by Software Engineer Conrado Viña. Software Engineers Marcos Saiz and Ignacio de Soto developed the first prototype as their thesis. Professors Eduardo Fernández and Tomás Laurenzo&lt;ref&gt;http://laurenzo.net&lt;/ref&gt; served as tutors. Conrado, Ignacio and Marcos founded the OpenGoo community and remain active members and core developers. The thesis was approved with the highest score.

Currently there is a second project for OpenGoo at the same University being developed by students Fernando Rodríguez, Ignacio Vázquez and Juan Pedro del Campo. Their project aims to build an open source [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[spreadsheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opengoo.org/who.html |title=OpenGoo is now Feng Office |publisher=Opengoo.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916073759/http://www.opengoo.org/who.html |archivedate=2012-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2009 the OpenGoo name was changed to Feng Office Community Edition.

The '''Getty Center''', in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], is a campus of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum]] and other programs of the [[J. Paul Getty Trust|Getty Trust]]. The $1.3 billion Center opened to the public on December 16, 1997&lt;ref name=10Years&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/about/10years.html The Getty Center: Reflecting on 10 Years.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is well known for its architecture, gardens, and views overlooking Los Angeles. The Center sits atop a hill connected to a visitors' parking garage at the bottom of the hill by [[Getty Center Monorail|a three-car, cable-pulled]] [[hovertrain]] [[funicular]]. 

Located in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, the Center is one of two locations of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] and draws 1.8 million visitors annually. (The other location is the [[Getty Villa]] in the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].) The Center branch of the Museum features pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, and decorative arts; and photographs from the 1830s through present day from all over the world&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/museum/about.html Retrieved March 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/art/photographs/ Retrieved March 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the Museum’s collection at the Center includes outdoor sculpture displayed on terraces and in gardens and the large Central Garden designed by [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]]. Among the artworks on display is the [[Vincent Van Gogh]] painting [[Irises (painting)|''Irises'']]. 

Designed by architect [[Richard Meier]], the campus also houses the [[Getty Research Institute]] (GRI), the [[Getty Conservation Institute]], the [[Getty Foundation]], and the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]]. The Center's design included special provisions to address concerns regarding earthquakes and fires.

==Location and history==
[[File:Getty USGS.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] satellite image of the Getty Center. The circular building to the left is the Getty Research Institute. The two buildings at the top are the Getty Trust administrative offices and the rest is the Museum.]]
Originally, the Getty Museum started in [[J. Paul Getty]]'s house located in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] in 1954. He expanded the house with a museum wing. In the 1970s, Getty built a replica of an Italian villa on his home's land to better house his collection, which opened in 1974. After Getty's death in 1976, the entire property was turned over to the Getty Trust for museum purposes. However, the collection outgrew the site, which has since been renamed the [[Getty Villa]], and management sought a location more accessible to Los Angeles.

== Architecture ==
[[File:GettyCenterGarden031903.jpg|thumb|right|Cactus Garden perched on the south of the Getty Center, with [[West Los Angeles (region)|West Los Angeles]] in the background]]
[[Richard Meier|Meier]] has exploited the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve to define the space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the [[Getty Research Institute]] (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.

[[File:Getty Center fountain California from NW on 2009-02-08.png|thumb|right|The fountain in the court of the Getty Center]]

The main axes of the museum grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through the edge of the stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns supporting the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing to the center of the entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building. Although all of the Museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north-south axis as a reminder that both grids are present in the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=25|title=Building type basics for museums|first= Arthur |last=Rosenblatt|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-34915-1|accessdate=2010-11-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTggWMQ42qQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Richard+Meier+Getty+Center+visual+axis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RFzxTM2iBIOC8gaVk7zlDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Getty%20Center&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.reed.edu/getty/designaxes.html|title=Design Axes and Diagrams|publisher=Reed College|accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary grid structure is a {{convert|30|in|mm|sing=on}} square; most wall and floor elements are {{convert|30|in|mm|sing=on}} squares or some derivative thereof. The buildings at the Getty Center are made from [[concrete]] and [[steel]] with either [[travertine]] or [[aluminium]] cladding.&lt;ref name=Architecture/&gt; Around {{convert|1200000|sqft|m2}} of travertine was used to build the Center.&lt;ref name=Architecture/&gt;

Throughout the campus, numerous fountains provide white noise as a background. The initial design has remained intact; however benches and fences have been installed around the plaza fountains to discourage visitors from wading into the pools. Some additional revisions have been made in deference to the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].
[[File:Getty Center Tram Station Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|left|Tram station at the arrival plaza]]
The north [[promontory]] is anchored by a circular grass area, which serves as a [[heliport]] in case of emergencies, and the south promontory is anchored by a [[succulent plant]] and [[cactus]] garden. The complex is also encircled by access roads that lead to loading docks and staff parking garages on both the west and east sides of the buildings. The hillside around the complex has been planted with California Live Oak ([[Quercus agrifolia]]) trees.

The Museum has a seven-story deep underground parking garage with over 1,200 parking spaces. Its roof has an outdoor sculpture garden.&lt;ref name=outdoor/&gt; An automated three-car, cable-pulled [[hovertrain]] [[funicular]], the "[[Getty Center Monorail|Getty Center Tram]]", takes passengers between the parking garage at the bottom of the hill and the Museum at the top of the hill.

==Arrival court and central rotunda==
[[File:2003-12-15 Getty Center panorama.jpg|thumb|right|A stairway leading down to the Central Garden]]
Visitors typically arrive at a tram station in the arrival plaza located between the administrative buildings and the Museum entrance. A large set of steps leads to the main doors of the rotunda building. The rotunda building houses information desks, two orientation theatres and Museum shops. It also holds a grand staircase that starts a path toward the paintings located on the second floor of each art pavilion. The rotunda opens to the south to a terrace that links all five of the Museum pavilions. A separate building to the west of the arrival plaza and stairs holds a cafeteria and restaurant. Next to the restaurant is a stone arch, which separates the Museum from the GRI. Stairs from the terrace connecting the GRI and the restaurant lead down to the central garden.

== Parking Garage ==
The Getty Center also has a 7-story underground parking garage for visitors use as they visit the Center. Parking is $15 per vehicle or $10 after 3pm. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/plan/parking.html Retrieved 3 December 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum building consists of a three-level base building that is closed to the public and provides staff workspace and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and the Exhibitions Pavilions. The Exhibitions Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/visit/see_do/art.html|title=Art on View|publisher=Getty Trust|accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house light-sensitive art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled skylights on the second-floor galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second floors are connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces, both of which offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Getty Center Map.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Getty Center Museum quality Center's largest 'exhibit' will surely grow on visitors. ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', November 30, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Water plays a major role in the garden. A fountain near the restaurant flows toward the garden and appears to fall into a [[grotto]] on the north garden wall. The resulting stream then flows down the hillside into the [[azalea]] pool. The designers placed rocks and boulders of varying size in the stream bed to vary the sounds from the flowing water. A tree-lined stream descends to a plaza, while the walkway criss-crosses the stream, which continues through the plaza, and goes over a stone waterfall into a round pool.&lt;ref name=Gardens/&gt; A maze of azaleas floats in the pool, around which is a series of specialty gardens.&lt;ref name=Gardens/&gt; More than 500 varieties of plant material are used for the Central Garden, but the selection is "always changing, never twice the same".&lt;ref name=Gardens/&gt;

Meier also designed three other buildings located next to the north promontory and offset at a 22.5 degree angle from the main axis of the Museum pavilions. The north-most building is an auditorium. Next to it is the North Building, with the East Building sitting between the North Building and the rotunda. The main entrance to the East Building is flanked by two round silos that hold its elevators. A bridge over a sunken courtyard links the main entrance of the East Building to the main walkway that connects the auditorium and North Buildings to the rotunda.

[[File:Penn Station2.jpg|thumb|[[Demolition]] of the former [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Penn Station]] concourse raised public awareness about preservation]]
&lt;!--the term historic preservation is seemingly almost exclusively found in United States English; other terms are used in other English speaking cultures, though certain non-English phrases may directly transliterate as "Historic Preservation"; as a result of the ambiguous usage of the term, this was chosen as the primary article; other potential meanings are referenced in the hatnote; see discussion pages for details.--&gt;

'''Historic preservation''' (US), '''heritage preservation''' or '''heritage conservation''' (UK), is an endeavour that seeks to preserve, conserve and protect buildings, objects, landscapes or other artifacts of historical significance.
This term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===England===
In [[England]], [[Antiquary|antiquarian]] interests were a familiar gentleman's pursuit since the mid 17th century, developing in tandem with the rise in scientific curiosity. Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] were often also Fellows of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

[[File:Castle Berkhamsted cz.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of Berkhamsted from the Norman Castle's Motte|The ruins of Berkhamsted castle (viewed from its Norman motte) and Berkhamsted Common were the location of two successful early preservation events in the nineteenth century. (Enlarged: A train passes Berkhamsted castle, on an embankment that was once part of the castle's outer defences.)]]Many historic sites were damaged as the railways began to spread across the UK; including [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity Hospital]] and its church in Edinburgh, [[Furness Abbey]], [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]] and [[Northampton Castle]], and the ancient walls of York, Chester and Newcastle. In 1833 [[Berkhamsted Castle]] became the first historic site in England officially protected by statute under the London and Birmingham Railway Acts of 1833{{ndash}}1837, though the new railway line in 1834 did demolish the castle's gatehouse and outer earthworks to the south.&lt;ref name="Wheeler1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wheeler|title=Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-cloud of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNxRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4377-2|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early preservation event also occurred at [[Berkhamsted]]. In 1866, Lord Brownlow who lived at [[Ashridge]], tried to enclose the adjoining Berkhamsted Common with {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=on}} steel fences in an attempt to claim it as part of his estate. In England from early Anglo-Saxon times, [[Common land]] was an area of land which the local community could use as a resource. Across England between 1660 and 1845, 7 million acres of Common land had been [[enclosure|enclosed]] by private land owners by application to parliament. On the night of 6 March 1866, [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus Smith]] MP led gangs of local folk and hired men from London's East End in [[direct action]] to break the enclosure fences and protect Berkhamsted Common for the people of Berkhamsted in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.&lt;ref name=Cobb1893p26&gt;{{harvnb|Cobb|1883|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood2006p245&gt;{{harvnb|Sherwood|2008|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birtchnell1988psNone&gt;{{harvnb|Birtchnell|1988|ps=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]] (later co-founder of the [[National Trust]] in 1895) and the [[Commons Preservation Society]] succeed in legal action that ensured protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.&lt;ref name="commons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Shaw-Lefevre on the Preservation of Commons|newspaper=The Times|date=11 December 1886|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashbrook |first=Kate |url=http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kate-Ashbrook.pdf|title=Modern commons: a protected open space?|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/news/more-news/exhibition-and-commemorative-walk-marks-anniversary-of-battle-to-save-berkhamsted-common-1-7006636 | title=Exhibition and commemorative walk marks anniversary of battle to save Berkhamsted Common | publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd. | work=Hemel Gazette | date=12 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Lubbock72.jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|[[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], MP was a moving force behind the implementation of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882.]]By the mid 19th century, much of [[UK|Britain's]] unprotected cultural heritage was being slowly destroyed. Even well-meaning archaeologists like [[William Greenwell]] excavated sites with virtually no attempt at their preservation, [[Stonehenge]] came under increasing threat by the 1870s. Tourists were chipping off parts of the stones or carving their initials into the rock. The private owners of the monument decided to sell the land to the [[London and South-Western Railway]] as the monument was "not the slightest use to anyone now"{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], an MP and botanist emerged as the champion of the country's national heritage. In 1872 he personally bought private land that housed ancient monuments in [[Avebury]], [[Silbury Hill]] and elsewhere, from the owners who were threatening to have them cleared away to make room for housing. Soon, he began campaigning in Parliament for legislation to protect monuments from destruction. This finally led to the legislative milestone under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[William Gladstone]] of the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]]. The first government appointed inspector for this job was the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt-Rivers]]. This legislation was regarded by conservative political elements as a grave assault on the individual rights of property of the owner, and consequently, the inspector only had the power to identify endangered landmarks and offer to purchase them from the owner with his consent. The Act only covered ancient monuments and explicitly did not cover historic buildings or structures. In 1877 the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] was founded by the [[Arts and Crafts]] designer [[William Morris]] to prevent the destruction of historic buildings, followed by the [[National Trust]] in 1895 that bought estates from their owners for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Bill. "At Home: A Short History of Private Life" Transworld Publishers, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had only given legal protection to prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] took this further by empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. Further updates were made in [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910|1910]].

[[File:Tattershall Castle, 2006.jpg|left|200px|upright|thumbnail|[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], preserved at personal expense by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] and a catalyst for [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913|broader heritage protection laws]].]]
[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], [[Lincolnshire]], a medieval [[manor house]] had been put up for sale in 1910 with its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, still intact. However, when an American bought the house they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. The former viceroy of [[India]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]], was outraged at this cultural destruction and stepped in to buy back the castle and reinstall the fireplaces. After a nationwide hunt for them they were finally found in London and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468|title=The man who demolished Shakespeare's house|publisher=BBC News Magazine|author=Denise Winterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle&lt;ref name=Adrian&gt;{{cite book|title=English Castles: A Guide by Counties|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|author=Adrian Pettifer|pages=145–7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] on his death in 1925. His experience at Tattershall influenced Lord Curzon to push for tougher heritage protection laws in Britain, which saw passage as the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].

The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term "monument" was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Trust====
{{one source section|date=October 2017}}
The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] was founded in 1894 by [[Octavia Hill]], [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]], and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Hardwicke Canon Rawnsley]] as the first organisation of its type in the world. Its formal purpose is: &lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and [[Tenement (law)|tenements]] (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest and, as regards lands, for the preservation of their natural aspect, features and animal and plant life. Also the preservation of furniture, pictures and chattels of any description having national and historic or artistic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/documents/download-national-trust-acts-1907-1971-post-order-2005.pdf | title=The National Trust Acts  1907 - 1971, as varied by a Parliamentary Scheme implemented by  The Charities (National Trust) Order 2005 | publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] | accessdate=10 November 2017 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings; its first property was [[Alfriston Clergy House]] and its first [[nature reserve]] was [[Wicken Fen]]. Its first archaeological monument was [[White Barrow]]. The focus on [[English country house|country houses]] and gardens, which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties, came about in the mid 20th century, when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them.

The Town and Country Planning Act 1944 and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] took steps toward historic preservation on an unprecedented scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Concern about the demolition of historic buildings arose in institutions such as the pressure group [[the Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings]], which appealed against demolition and neglect on a case by case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sphb.org.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104238/http://www.sphb.org.uk/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-21 |title=The Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings (SPHB)|publisher=sphb.org.uk|accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Heritage====
[[English Heritage]] formed in 1983, is a registered charity that looks after the National Heritage Collection in England.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Era for English Heritage|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/new-era-for-englands-heritage1|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprises over 400 of England's historic buildings, monuments and sites spanning more than 5,000 years of history. Within its portfolio are [[Stonehenge]], [[Dover Castle]], [[Tintagel Castle]] and the best preserved parts of [[Hadrian's Wall]].

Originally English Heritage was the operating name of an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]], officially titled the [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]], that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties.&lt;ref name="EH History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-history/|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999 the organisation merged with the [[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]] and the National Monuments Record (England), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England's historic environment. On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: [[Historic England]], which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new [[English Heritage Trust]], a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph EHT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|title=Does our history have a future in the hands of the English Heritage Trust?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11441254/Does-our-history-have-a-future-in-the-hands-of-the-English-Heritage-Trust.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government gave the new charity an £80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state.

===United States===

[[File:MountVernonrear.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Mount Vernon]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]], near [[Alexandria, Virginia]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the United States one of the first historic preservation efforts was the
[[Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site]], in [[Newburgh, New York]]. This property has the distinction of being the first-ever property designated and operated as a historic site by a U.S. state, having been so since 1850.

Another early historic preservation undertaking was that of George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Diane. "America's Preservation Ethos: A Tribute to Enduring Ideals." ''A Richer Heritage: Historic Preservation in the Twenty-First Century.'' ed. Robert Stipe. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1889, the Richmond, Virginia-based [[Preservation Virginia]] (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Helium Studio |url=http://apva.org/aboutus/ |title=Preservation Virginia |publisher=Apva.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008020715/http://www.apva.org/AboutUs/ |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, James Michael. ''Preserving the Old Dominion: historic preservation and Virginia traditionalism''. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1993. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society]] was formed in 1895 as the first American organization of its kind in the United States that did not limit its activities to a single historic place or object. The Society operated as a national organization to: protect the natural scenery and the preservation of historic landmarks; to preserve landmarks and records of the past or present; to erect memorials and promote appreciation of the scenic beauty of America.&lt;ref&gt;"Scenic and Historic America: Bulletin of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society." ASHPS 2.1 (March 1930):3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles E. Peterson]] was an influential figure in the mid-20th century establishing the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS), advising on the establishment of [[Independence National Historical Park]], helping with the first graduate degree program in historic preservation in the United States at [[Columbia University]], and author.

The architectural firm of Simons &amp; Lapham (Albert Simons and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]) was an influential supporter of the nation's first historic preservation ordinance in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1930, affording that city a regulatory means by which to prevent the destruction of its historic building stock. In 1925, efforts to preserve the historic buildings of the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]] led to the creation of the Vieux Carré Commission and later, to the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins, ''Documentation of the Architecture of the Architecture of Samuel Lapham and the Firm of Simons &amp; Lapham'', Masters of Fine Arts in Historic Preservation Thesis, Savannah College of Art &amp; Design, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Scott S. (2010). Madame Vieux Carré: the French Quarter in the Twentieth Century. University of Mississippi. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1601 14th Street NW montage.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The preservation of this historic building in Washington, D.C. resulted in an award for Excellence in Historic Preservation by the local government.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dgs.dc.gov/release/dgs-mayor-gray-announces-winners-historic-preservation-awards |title=Mayor Gray Announces Winners of Historic Preservation Awards |publisher=Government of the District of Columbia |accessdate=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The US [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], another privately funded [[non-profit organization]], began in 1949 with a handful of structures and has developed goals that provide "leadership, education, advocacy, and resources to save America's diverse historic places and revitalize our communities" according to the Trust's mission statement.  In 1951 the Trust assumed responsibility for its first museum property, [[Woodlawn Plantation]] in [[northern Virginia]]. Twenty-eight sites in all have subsequently become part of the National Trust, representing the [[cultural diversity]] of American history.  In New York City, the destruction of [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in 1964 shocked many nationwide into supporting preservation. The 1960s proved advantageous with new laws and international agreements extending preservation "from ancient monuments to whole districts and buildings a few decades old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an international level, the New York-based [[World Monuments Fund]] was founded in 1965 to preserve historic sites all over the world.

Under the direction of [[James Marston Fitch]], the first advanced-degree historic preservation program began at [[Columbia University]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Murtagh, William J. ''Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in America''. New York: Sterling Publishing, Co., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It became the model on which most other graduate historic preservation programs were created.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomlan. "Historic Preservation Education: Alongside Architecture in Academia." ''Journal of Architectural Education'', Vol. 47, No. 4. (1994): 187-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other programs were to follow before 1980: M.A. in Preservation Planning from Cornell (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation from [[University of Vermont|the University of Vermont]] (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation Studies from [[Boston University]] (1976); M.S. in Historic Preservation from [[Eastern Michigan University]] (1979) and M.F.A. in Historic Preservation was one of the original programs at [[Savannah College of Art &amp; Design]]. James Marston Fitch also offered guidance and support towards the founding of the Master of Preservation Studies Degree within the Tulane School of Architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.tulane.edu|title=Tulane School of Architecture -|website=architecture.tulane.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.tulane.edu/programs/degrees/mps-master-preservation-studies|title=Master of Preservation Studies|website=Tulane School of Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M.Sc. in Building Conservation degree program is offered by the School of Architecture at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in Troy, New York. In 2005, Clemson University and the College of Charleston created an M.S. degree program based in Charleston, SC. The first undergraduate programs (B.A.) appeared in 1977 from [[Goucher College]] and [[Roger Williams University]] (then called Roger Williams College), followed by [[Mary Washington College]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;''Preservation News'' (Oct 1, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}} there were more than fifty historic preservation programs offering certificates, associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpe.us/academic-programs/#.UqsZqvSry-M|title=Home Page|date=13 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Heritage conservation in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the phrase "heritage preservation" is sometimes seen as a specific approach to the treatment of historic places and sites, rather than a general concept of conservation. "Conservation" is taken as the more general term, referring to all actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life.

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|central government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organisation for heritage buildings and landscapes.

=== The Netherlands ===
[[Victor de Stuers]] is widely considered the man who started historic preservation in the Netherlands. In 1875 the first national department for conservation was established&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/stuersv|title=Dictionary of Art Historians|website=arthistorians.info|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and de Stuers was  appointed as the first legal secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs as chief of the brand new Department of Arts and Sciences. He was the driving force behind ''[[Monumentenzorg]]'' (Foundation for Historic Preservation), helped found the ''[[Rijksmuseum]]'' (National Museum) and the ''Rijksarchief'' (National Archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerkindenhaag.nl/agendaberichten/victor-de-stuers-vader-van-monumentenzorg-en-rijksmuseum/|title=Victor de Stuers, vader van Monumentenzorg en Rijksmuseum - Kerk in Den Haag|website=www.kerkindenhaag.nl|language=nl|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/stuers|title=Stuers, jhr.

However, it was not until the 20th century that there was national legislation on historic preservation. In 1961 the [[:nl:Monumentenwet|''Monumentenwet'']] (“Monuments Act”) was passed. It defined that any physical building or space that was at least fifty years old and “which are of general interest because of their beauty, their meaning to science or their social value” and must thus be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/till014sche01_01/till014sche01_01_0031.php|title=J.A.C.

In 1973, the NGO ''Monumentenwacht'' (“Monument Watch”) was founded with the purpose of providing preventative measures of maintenance for historic buildings. As the majority of the historic preservation programs in the Netherlands, this program is decentralized, managed on the provincial level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcmt.org.uk/sites/default/files/migrated-reports/629_1.pdf|title=Devlin, H. (2005). European initiatives in preventative maintenance for historic buildings.

The costs are covered through a combination of national and provincial subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weaver |first=Martin E. |authorlink=Martin E.

A special kind of preservation that takes place in the Netherlands is the preservation of maritime heritage. Maritime trade was the Dutch specialty which shaped much of their culture and as a country that is 50% under sea level the Dutch history is closely intertwined with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24|title=Flood Risk Management in Europe|first1=L.M.|last1=Bouwer|first2=P.|last2=Vellinga|date=20 October 2018|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=469–484|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are maritime museums in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam that tell the story of the Dutch maritime heritage, but there is not much legal documentation on how to preserve it. For example, according to Sarah Dromgoole, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/people/sarah.dromgoole&lt;/ref&gt; shipwrecks from [[Dutch East India Company|The Dutch East India Company]] are found all around the world, which are still property of the Netherlands, but the Dutch government rarely takes responsibility for this property that is found outside of their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=nuSwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=monumentenwet+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4JlsRABjN&amp;sig=wZoBBeGGK6nlqU1VABsCB6PPbfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrruD1h67XAhWEl5QKHZP_CjsQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=monumentenwet%201961&amp;f=false|title=The Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage: National Perspectives in Light of the UNESCO Convention 2001 - Second Edition|last=Dromgoole|first=Sarah|date=2006-06-30|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789047410454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macedonia ===
In Macedonia, historic preservation falls under the overarching category of cultural heritage preservation according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage (Закон за заштита на културното наследство). According to this law, which the Macedonian Parliament approved in March 2004, there are three types of cultural heritage: immovable, movable, and intangible. Historical preservation is represented by the protection of monuments and monumental entireties under immovable cultural heritage, and historical items under movable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzkn.gov.mk/dokumenti/Law%20on%20Cultural%20Heritage.pdf “Закон за заштита на културното наследство” (PDF)]. „Сл. Весник на Република Македонија“ бр.20/04. (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this Law was the first nation-wide establishment of regulations for historic preservation since the Republic of Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, several organizations throughout the 20th century have encompassed efforts of historic preservation.

The “Central office for protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia” has existed since 1949. In 1960, the Central Office was renamed to “National office for protection of cultural monuments”, and granted the status of an independent cultural institution, with authority to execute activities of historic preservation. After the establishment of the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage in 2004, the Ministry of Culture once again renamed the office to “National center for conservation” and narrowed down its responsibilities to dealing solely with preservation of immovable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jovcevska, Biljana.

Other organizations which have contributed to the efforts of historic preservation are the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS and the NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum-Ohrid.

The [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)]] established their branch in Macedonia in 1995 through the initiative of 43 conservationists from Macedonia. The guiding principles of the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS are raising the national consciousness about the importance of historic and cultural heritage, decentralization of the discourse about heritage, and effective monitoring of the status of cultural and historic heritage in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org.mk/AboutUs.aspx “ICOMOS Macedonia About Us”]. icomos.org.mk (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum - Ohrid is the second oldest institutions for historical preservation established in 1952. In 1956 the Institute was granted authority to protect movable and immovable cultural and historic heritage in the Ohrid region. The Institute has since executed numerous efforts for historic preservation, most notably aiding the recognition of the city of Ohrid as a UNESCO site of cultural heritage in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muzejohrid.mk/istorija “Историја”].

Today, the main authority for historic preservation is the Cultural Heritage Protection Office (Управа за заштита на културно наследство). The Office is an independent governmental organization under the Ministry of Culture, divided into three departments:
#Identification, Protection and Use of Cultural Heritage
#Prevention and Supervision
#Documentation, International Cooperation and Administrative Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001881/188172eo.pdf "Cultural Heritage in South-East Europe: Macedonia (Former Yugoslav Republic of)" (PDF)].

=== Israel ===
In Israel, there are currently two laws concerning historic preservation, [[Antiquities Law of the State of Israel of 1978|Antiquities Law of the State of Israel]] (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000490|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planning and Building Law (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/1998/Pages/Planning%20and%20Building%20Law-%201965.aspx|title=Summay of the law in English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws were adapted from the British law that was implemented during the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]].

However, these laws are not comprehensive and limited in scope: the Antiquities Law only applies itself to buildings or artifacts dated before 1700 BC. So while efforts discovering and protecting anything older than 1700 BC are well protected, anything from later historical periods is not under the protection of this law. The Planning and Building Law discusses the overall management and regulation of land use in Israel. It has been through several changes and amendments specifically regarding preservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000613|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; but over the years it hasn't been enforced and many historical sites were destroyed, as the state was prioritizing developmental and economic interests.

During the 1960s, the issue of preservation was gaining public awareness, and as a response to the destruction of [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] (one of the first educational institutions in Israel) in 1959, a wave of shock and anger led to extensive public debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yossi Klein Halevi|Klein Halevi, Yossi]] (2011). [http://www.kotar.co.il/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=96782691#6.2693.6.default האמרקניזציה של תל אביב].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was established, at the recommendation of the Knesset and the Committee of Education. Its aims include locating remains of historic settlements, protect and conserve them as well as developing conservation principles that are specific to Israel’s historic situations and are aligned with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.shimur.org/viewStaticPage.aspx?pageID=258|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council used to operate under the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]] but in 2008 registers as an independent non-profit. Today, it is the organization responsible for the most historical preservation endeavors as well as efforts to add amendments to existing laws to provide a comprehensive and effective framework for preservation in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shimur.org/viewArticle.aspx?articleID=165|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites: Historical context on the Council's work and outline of future plans [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different, separate effort in preservation comes from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF). The IDF surveyed 94 military bases and found that about 80 of them include sites worth preserving, and for each of these bases there is a preservation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.il/building/engineering/Pages/preservation.aspx The Ministry of Defense statement regarding preservation within IDF bases [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF is working towards maintaining these building as well as communicating their value to the soldiers in these bases. Buildings include [[Knights Templar]] sites, old military bases used by the British or German or buildings from the Ottoman period.

A historic district in the [[United States]] is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, [[Contributing property|contributing]] and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] designates historic districts through the [[U.S. Department of Interior]], under the auspices of the [[National Park Service]]. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm Federal, State and Local Historic Districts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015030933/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm |date=2006-10-15 }}, TOOLBOX, FAQ, National Park Service. Retrieved 19 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Historic districts allows rural areas to preserve their characters through historic preservation programs. These include "Main Street" programs that can be used to redevelop rural downtowns. Using historic preservation programs as an economic development tool for local governments in rural areas has enabled some of those areas to take advantage of their history and develop a tourism market that in turn provides funds for maintaining an economic stability that these areas would not have seen otherwise.&lt;ref name="rdp"&gt;[http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=IND20529991 Stenberg, Peter L.

A similar concept exists in the United Kingdom: a [[Conservation area]] is designated in accordance with the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]] in order to protect a zone in which there are buildings of architectural or [[cultural heritage]] interest.

==National Parks==
{{main|National Park}}

In 1835, the English poet [[William Wordsworth]] described the [[Lake District]] as a "sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Guide+through+the+District+of+the+Lakes%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sort%20of%20national%20property%20in%20which%20every%20man%20has%20a%20right%20and%20interest%20who%20has%20an%20eye%20to%20perceive%20and%20a%20heart%20to%20enjoy&amp;f=false|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, the United States that led the world in the creation of [[United States National Park|National Parks]], areas of unspoiled natural wilderness, where the intrusion of civilization are intentionally minimal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The department of the interior designated several areas of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] as the first historic park in the United States national park system. It became designated as the [[Morristown National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/morr/ |title=Morristown National Historical Park - Morristown National Historical Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community had permanent settlements that date to 1715, is termed the military capital of the American Revolution, and contains many designations of sites and locations. The park includes three major sites in Morristown.

In the United Kingdom, [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] the [[ambassador]] to the US praised the system of National Parks and campaigned to have them introduced in Great Britain. Little came of it until mounting public pressure during the early 20th century from the [[Ramblers' Association]] and other groups led to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].

== UNESCO ==
According to UNESCO’s 1972 World Heritage Convention, landscapes and sites of outstanding universal value can be designated as [[World Heritage Site]]s. The World Heritage Convention encompasses historic preservation under the category of “cultural heritage”. According to Article 1 of the Convention, monuments, groups of buildings, and sites “which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science” are to be designated cultural heritage.

A requirement of such designation is that the designating nation has appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures in place to identify, protect, conserve, present, and rehabilitate world heritage sites. However, according to Article 6 of the Convention, while sovereignty of the State where the site is located is not to be compromised, the State acknowledges that protection of heritage sites is a duty of the entire international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage convention’s counterpart, The World Heritage Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/committee/ The World Heritage Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt; is the body responsible for the practical implementation of the Convention as well as managing and deciding how to use the World Heritage Fund. The Committee also gets to have the final say when determining whether a property will be included in the World Heritage List.

The Committee meets once a year and includes representatives from 21 states that are part of the States Parties. Yearly reports are available to the public on the World Heritage website and include outlines of decisions made, outcomes, working documents and various reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/ All available reports of the Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential challenges ==
Although preservation efforts can have benefits for the owners of historical buildings, such as tax cuts and subsidies, there are also drawbacks.

One such drawback is that after a neighborhood has been designated to be historically preserved, there is less construction. On the long term this can affect the value of property and investment in housing, both in the neighborhood itself and the neighborhoods directly surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nber.org.ccl.idm.oclc.org/papers/w20446.pdf)%20(http://readings.sipx.com/in-efa1d268-3446-11e4-b0d4-22000a890e29/c-a5bb0b99-34dc-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b/x-18c7cf2c-4b0a-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b.pdf?Expires=1510044499&amp;Signature=OYOvpPRjsvsdxGk8mFJuuvpqTmeZ2aWRa5PyPPJ3HEyNSDr36kObybQETDowEcAnOP10WnB82VVejixBL~YiqGuKe6ZJ-fFchJ2tcVcrt4A7QNKhALWi1jE0z2XkqC8tZxb6picEAwMJ3MhUCtEHoA8-kajtxQQaA9QgAjfzX~4_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIVBE35QX7A7QYJEA|title=Preserving History or Hindering Growth? The Heterogeneous Effects of Historic Districts on Local Housing Markets in New York City|last=Been, Gould Ellen, Gedal, Glaeser, &amp; McCabe|first=Vicki, Ingrid, Michael, Edward, Brian J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second concern that has been raised is that buildings that need to be historically preserved are sometimes still inhabited. In some cases their inability to make changes to the building can lead to dangerous or unhealthy situations for residents.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. (2012). The politics and heritage of race and space in San Francisco’s Chinatown. In D. F. Ruggles (Ed.), ''On location'' (pp. 37–59). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not true that nothing could be changed or renovated, but the owner of the building would need to ask permission at the appropriate preservation society, slowing the process down severely. The exact policies are country dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. (2016). Getting Away From “No”: Straight Talk to Local Advocates. ''Forum Journal'' 30(2), 46-49.

==Careers==
Although volunteers continue to play a large role in historic preservation activities, the field has seen an increased level of professionalization. Today, there are many career options in historic preservation in the public, non-profit and private sectors. Institutes of secondary education (universities, colleges, etc.) in the United States offer both certificate and degree ([[Associate in Applied Science|A.A.S]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]], [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]], [[Masters of Design Studies|M.D.S]], [[Master of Historic Preservation|M.H.P.]], [[Master of Science|M.S.]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) programs in historic preservation. Some pupils—at schools with such programmes available—choose to enroll in "joint degree" programs, earning a degree in historic preservation along with one in another, related subject, often an [[Master of Architecture|MArch]], [[Master of Urban Planning|MUP]] or [[Juris Doctor|JD]] degree.

Possible career fields include:
;Architectural conservator: Focus specifically on the physical conservation of building materials.
;Architectural historian/historian: Primarily researches and writes statements expressing the historical significance of sites.
;Historic preservation planner: Most are employed by local, county, state or federal government planning agencies to administer tax abatement programs, ensure compliance with local ordinances and state and Federal legislation, and conduct design reviews to ensure that proposed projects will not harm historic and archaeological resources.

The '''Hovden Cannery''' in [[Cannery Row]], [[Monterey, California]] was among the oldest, largest [[canneries]] of the [[Pacific Sardine Fishery]]. In the first half of the 20th century, it marked one of the most lucrative national [[fisheries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/CA1292/ |title=Hovden Cannery, 886 Cannery Row, Monterey, Monterey County, CA |work=Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2016-01-30 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a source for literary inspiration in the works of [[John Steinbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Phyllis J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5479">'''Jellyfish.com''' was a [[reverse auction]] online shopping site website. The [[Middleton, Wisconsin]]-based company was acquired by [[Microsoft]] in 2007. On May 22, 2008, Microsoft officially announced the cash back service as part of their [[Live Search]] group of tools.  The site was shut down at midnight, February 16, 2009.

==History==

Jellyfish launched the first beta version of service in June 2006, after receiving an initial seed round of investment from its founders, Brian Wiegand and Mark McGuire, and Kegonsa Capital Partners.&lt;ref name="raised"&gt;[http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2006/10/30/0610300162.phpz ''Wisconsin State Journal'', "Jellyfish.com Raises $5 Million In Funding"], retrieved 13 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release, Kegonsa Capital Partners said that it acquired 25 percent of Jellyfish.com's stock for about $600,000 in February 2006, and made 15 times its seed investment with the deal.&lt;ref name="big_time"&gt;[http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2007/10/02/0710020399.php ''Wisconsin State Journal'': "Jellyfish goes big time"], retrieved 13 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2006, Jellyfish raised an additional 5 million dollars in funding. According to their founders, Jellyfish has 1,000 retailers advertising more than 5 million products, from shoes to electronics to home appliances. It was expected to have 20 employees by the end of October 2006, at the Old Sauk Trails business park, on the Far West Side.&lt;ref name="raised" /&gt;

Kegonsa, a [[Fitchburg, Wisconsin]] group with 42 Wisconsin investors, led the second round of investment on October 2006,&lt;ref name="buys"&gt;[http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/wsj/2007/10/02/0710020280.php ''Wisconsin State Journal'', "Microsoft Buys Online Shopper Jellyfish.com"], retrieved 13 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with more than $1 million in October 2006 through the Kegonsa Co-Invest fund, for a total of $5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanventuremagazine.com/news.php?newsid=1859 ''American Ventures'', "Jellyfish.com Secures $5 Million in Funding"], retrieved 18 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024091827/http://www.americanventuremagazine.com/news.php?newsid=1859 |date=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://austin.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2006/10/23/daily44.html ''Milwaukee Business Journal'': "Madison Internet firm secures $5M in funding"], retrieved 18 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The second round investors more than doubled their investment in less than a year.&lt;ref name="big_time" /&gt;

In an interview in July 2007, Wiegand said Jellyfish had sold nearly $5 million worth of products, "everything from bicycles to shoes".&lt;ref name="buys" /&gt;

McGuire explained that the name Jellyfish was chosen because they wanted to be completely transparent.&lt;ref name="watcher"&gt;[http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2006/08/jellyfish_pione.php SiliconValleyWatcher: "Jellyfish pioneers a new type of online business model"], retrieved March 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Padilla''' (born October 18, 1970), also known as '''Abdullah al-Muhajir''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Abdullah Al-Muhajir from U.S. pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|ɑː|b|ˈ|d|ʌ|l|ə|_|ɑː|l|_|m|ʊ|ˈ|h|ɑː|dʒ|ɪər}} {{respell|ahb|DUL|ə|_|ahl|_|moo|HAH|jeer}}) or '''Muhajir Abdullah''', is a [[United States citizen]] from [[Brooklyn, New York]], who was convicted in federal court of aiding [[terrorism|terrorists]].

Padilla was arrested in [[Chicago]] on May 8, 2002, on suspicion of plotting a [[radiological weapon|radiological bomb]] ("dirty bomb") attack. He was detained as a [[material witness]] until June 9, 2002, when [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] designated him an [[enemy combatant]] and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a [[military prison]] in South Carolina. Padilla was held for three and a half years as an enemy combatant. Upon pressure and lawsuits from civil liberties groups, he was transferred to a civilian jail in 2006.

In August 2007, a federal jury found him guilty of conspiring to commit murder and fund terrorism. Government officials had earlier claimed Padilla was suspected of planning to build and explode a "[[dirty bomb]]" in the United States, but he was never charged with this crime. He was initially sentenced to 17 years in prison, which was increased on appeal to 21 years. His lawsuits against the military for allegedly torturing him were rejected by the courts for lack of merit and jurisdictional issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=The justices let stand a U.S. appeals court ruling that dismissed the lawsuit by Jose Padilla on the grounds his allegations lacked merit. The appeals court said he had no right to sue for the alleged constitutional violations and the judiciary could not review such sensitive military decisions.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-padilla-idUSBRE85A0X920120611|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=December 7, 2016|title=Top court rejects Padilla torture lawsuit appeal|first=James|last=Vicini|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jose Padilla was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to Estella Obregon and her husband,&lt;!-- name?? --&gt; both of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] descent. The family later moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. As a youth, Padilla joined the [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]] [[street gang]] and was arrested several times. During his gang years, he maintained several [[pseudonym|aliases]], such as José Rivera, José Alicea, José Hernandez, and José Ortiz. As a 14-year-old juvenile, he was convicted of aggravated assault and [[manslaughter]] after a gang member, whom he had kicked in the head, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Debra J.|last=Saunders|title=Padilla's Life and Times|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/04/27/EDG7H6ABSQ1.DTL|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2004-04-27|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving his last [[Prison|jail]] sentence, Padilla converted to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="record"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/US/06/11/muhajir.background/index.html ["'Dirty Bomb' Suspect's Criminal Record"], cnn.com, June 11, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his early religious instructors was an Islamic teacher who professed a nonviolent philosophy and Padilla appeared at the time to be faithful to his mentor's teachings.&lt;ref name="sontag"&gt;Sontag, Deborah. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/national/25PADI.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=f1d6a0b81ebc88ff&amp;ex=1398312000&amp;partner=USERLAND "Terror Suspect's Path From Streets To Brig"], ''New York Times'', April 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], Padilla attended the Masjid Al-Iman mosque, as did [[Adham Hassoun|Adham Amin Hassoun]], "for most of the 1990s and [they] were reportedly friends."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Candiotti|author2=Mark Potter|title=Feds arrest man linked to 'dirty bomb' suspect|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/06/15/padilla.associate|work=[[CNN]]|date=2002-06-15|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. authorities accused Hassoun of associating with radical Islamic fundamentalists, including [[Al-Qaeda]]. Hassoun, a Lebanese-born Palestinian, was arrested in 2002 for overstaying his [[visa (document)|visa]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and was charged in 2004 with [[providing material support to terrorists]].&lt;ref name="hassoun-booked"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2004/September/04_crm_625.htm "Two Defendants Charged in Florida with Providing Material Support to Terrorists"], ''[[United States Department of Justice]]''; accessed May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, Hassoun had already been charged with perjury, a weapons offense, and other offenses.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Marriage and family==
[[Broward County, Florida]] court records show that on July 1, 1994, Padilla changed his name to one word: "Ibrahim". He was married under that name to Cherie Maria Stultz on January 2, 1996. They divorced in March 2001, according to court records. In January 2001, she had placed an ad in a local business newspaper, serving notice that she was seeking divorce. Their divorce papers identify him as Jose Ibrahim Padilla.&lt;ref name="record"/&gt;

Padilla married an Egyptian woman named Shamia'a, and they had two sons together. When he was arrested in 2002, the boys were infants. At his bail hearing, his wife and children were believed to be overseas.&lt;ref name="sontag"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,185239,00.html "Judge Refuses To Set Bail For Padilla"], ''Fox News'', February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodnough, Abby.

According to press reports in 2002, Padilla had been in the [[Afghanistan]]–[[Pakistan]] region in 2001 and early 2002.&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes2002-07-13&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/DG13Ak02.html|title=PART 4: Tracking al-Qaeda in Europe|publisher=[[Asia Times]]|date=2002-07-13|author=Pepe Escobar|accessdate=2010-10-20|quote=Suspected "dirty bomber" [[Jose Padilla (detainee)|Jose Padilla]], alias Abdullah al-Muhajir, an American citizen, took a bomb-making course in an al-Qaeda safe house in Lahore and met key al-Qaeda operatives in Karachi last March.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FindlawMariner2008-08-25&gt;{{cite news|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/mariner/20080825.html56|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102144425/http://writ.news.findlaw.com/mariner/20080825.html56|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-02|title=A UK Window into CIA Abuses|publisher=[[Findlaw]]|date=2008-08-25|author=Joanne Mariner|accessdate=2010-10-20|quote=The military commission charges that have been sworn against [Binyam] Mohamed allege that he attended an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, and later received training in building remote-controlled explosive devices in Pakistan.

Although Padilla's role was not known at the time, U.S. and Pakistani officials raided the Lahore safe house where he had stayed as well as suspected Al Qaeda compounds in several other cities March 28. Abu Zubeida [Abu Zubaydah], Al Qaeda's operations chief, and several of his senior aides were captured after a shootout that night at a house in Faisalabad.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padilla was alleged to have been trained in the construction and employment of radiologic weapons – "[[dirty bomb]]s" – at an [[al-Qaeda safe house]] in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. Padilla and [[Binyam Mohammed]], a [[United Kingdom]] resident, were alleged to have been recruited at the [[Lahore safe house]] to travel to the United States to launch terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=TheWeeklyStandard2009-03-18&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/289rvdch.asp?pg=2|title=Gitmo's General: The U.S. can't risk releasing detainee Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi|publisher=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=2009-03-18|author=[[Thomas Joscelyn]]|accessdate=2010-10-20|quote=As Gordon Cucullu explains in his book 'Inside Gitmo: The True Story Behind the Myths of Guantánamo Bay,' al Sharbi translated the dirty bomb instructions for Mohamed and Padilla at an al Qaeda safe house in Lahore, Pakistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent evidence suggests that the "dirty bomb" plot was likely a ruse to get out of Pakistan and based on an internet joke website purporting to describe how to build an H-bomb by swinging buckets of uranium as fast as possible. A 2003 [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] memo notes that the satirical article "is filled with countless technical inaccuracies which would likely result in the death of anyone attempting to follow the instructions, and definitely would not result in a nuclear explosion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/12/09/the-cia-claimed-its-interrogation-policy-foiled-a-dirty-bomb-plot-but-it-was-too-stupid-to-work|title=The CIA claimed its interrogation policy foiled a 'dirty bomb' plot.

==Arrest==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
Padilla traveled to [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], Afghanistan, Pakistan, and [[Iraq]]. On his return, he was arrested by [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]] agents at [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s [[O'Hare International Airport]] on May 8, 2002, and held as a [[material witness]] on a warrant issued in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] stemming from the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

On June 9, 2002, two days before District Court Judge [[Michael Mukasey]] was to issue a ruling on the validity of continuing to hold Padilla under the material witness warrant, President George Bush issued an order to Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] to detain Padilla as an "enemy combatant." Padilla was transferred to a military [[brig (prison)|brig]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] without any notice to his attorney or family. The order "legally justified" the detention using the 2001 AUMF passed in the wake of September 11, 2001 (formally [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|"The Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution" (Public Law 107-40)]]) and opined that a U.S. citizen detained on U.S. soil can be classified as an [[enemy combatant]]. (This opinion is based on the decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'', a case involving the detention of [[Operation Pastorius|eight German spies]] operating in the United States while working for [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.syr.edu/academics/centers/insct/Military%20Force%20-%20Padilla.asp "Authorization for Use of Military Force: ''Padilla v. Bush:'', Jose Padilla under the Joint Resolution"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203134623/http://www.law.syr.edu/academics/centers/insct/Military%20Force%20-%20Padilla.asp |date=2009-02-03 }}, ''The Syracuse Journal of International Law and Commerce, [[Syracuse University]] College of Law''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the text of the ensuing decision from the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], Padilla's detention as an "enemy combatant" (pursuant to the President's order) was based on the following reasons:
# Padilla was "closely associated with [[al Qaeda]]," a designation for loosely knit insurgent groups sharing common ideals and tactics, "with which the United States is at [[war]]";
# He had engaged in "war-like acts, including conduct in preparation for acts of international terrorism";
# He had [[intelligence]] that could assist the United States in warding off future terrorist attacks; and
# He was a continuing threat to American security.

==2002 memos==
Shortly after September 26, 2002, the top political appointees [[David Addington]], [[Alberto Gonzales]], [[John A. Rizzo]], [[William Haynes II]], two Justice Department lawyers, [[Alice S. Fisher]] and [[Patrick F. Philbin]], and then-Special Counsel to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense [[Jack Goldsmith]] flew to [[Camp Delta]] to view [[Mohammed al-Kahtani]], then to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], to view Padilla, and finally to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to view [[Yaser Esam Hamdi]], who had been subjected to coercive techniques including solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="mayer"&gt;[[Jane Mayer|Mayer, Jane]], "[[The Dark Side (book)|The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals]]," 2008. p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; It was later learned that top administration officials had earlier discussed and approved the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] for the CIA. They were consulting with DOD agents to discuss techniques that might be used against the detainees in military custody. Later that year, additional "harsh techniques" were used on these three and other prisoners.&lt;ref name="mayer"/&gt;

In October 2008, 91 pages of memos drafted in 2002 by officers at the [[Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston]] were made public.&lt;ref name=Cnn2008-10-08&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Carol Cratty|Cratty, Carol]]|title=Military concerned for detainee's sanity, records show|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/10/08/detainee.treatment|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2008-10-08|accessdate=2018-05-14|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2008%2FUS%2F10%2F08%2Fdetainee.treatment%2F&amp;date=2008-10-09|archivedate=2008-10-09|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NavyConsolidatedBrigEmails2002&gt;{{cite news|title=2002 Navy Consolidated Brig emails about the captives' mental health|url=http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/images/10/08/aclu.foia.doc.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|year=2002|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.turner.com%2Fcnn%2F2008%2Fimages%2F10%2F08%2Faclu.foia.doc.pdf&amp;date=2008-10-09|archivedate=2008-10-09|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memos indicate that officers were concerned that the isolation of solitary confinement and lack of stimuli were causing the prisoner [[Yasser Hamdi]] mental anguish and threatened his sanity. The memos also state that Padilla and a third prisoner, [[Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri]], were held in similar conditions at the Brig.&lt;ref name=Cnn2008-10-08/&gt;

==Habeas corpus==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
Because Padilla was being detained without any criminal charges being formally made against him, he, through his lawyer, made a petition for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' to the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], naming then Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] as the respondent to this petition. The government filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that:
# Padilla's lawyer was not a proper "[[next friend|next Friend]]" to sign and file the petition on Padilla's behalf.
# Commander Marr of the South Carolina brig, and not U.S. Secretary Rumsfeld, should have been named as the respondent to the petition.
# The New York court lacked personal jurisdiction over the named respondent Secretary Rumsfeld who resides in Virginia.

The New York District Court disagreed with the government's arguments and denied its motion. However, the court declared that President Bush had constitutional and statutory authority to designate and detain American citizens as "enemy combatants." It held that Padilla had the right to challenge his "enemy combatant" designation and detention in the course of his ''habeas corpus'' petition, although immediate release was denied. Both Padilla and the government made an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

On December 18, 2003, the Second Circuit declared that
# Padilla's lawyer is a proper "next friend" to sign and file the ''habeas corpus'' petition on Padilla's behalf because she, as a member of the bar, had a professional duty to defend her client's interests. Further, she had a significant attorney-client relationship with Padilla and was far from being some zealous "intruder" or "uninvited meddler," as described by the government.
# Secretary Rumsfeld can be named as the respondent to Padilla's ''habeas corpus'' petition, although South Carolina's Navy Commander Marr had immediate physical custody of Padilla, because there have been past cases where national-level officials have been named as respondents to such petitions.
# The New York District Court had personal jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld although Rumsfeld resided in Virginia and not New York because New York's "[[long-arm jurisdiction|long-arm statute]]" is applicable to Secretary Rumsfeld, who was responsible for Padilla's physical transfer from New York to South Carolina.
# Despite the legal precedent set by ''[[ex parte Quirin]],'' "the president lacked inherent constitutional authority as commander in chief to detain American citizens on American soil outside a zone of combat." The Second Circuit relied on the case of ''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'', 343 U.S. 579 (1952), where the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that President [[Harry Truman|Truman]], during the [[Korean War]] years, could not use his position and power as commander in chief, created under Article 2, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, to seize the nation's steel mills on the eve of a nationwide steelworkers strike. The extraordinary government power to curb civil rights and liberties during crisis periods, such as times of war, lies with [[United States Congress|Congress]] and not the president. Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, and not the president, the power to suspend the right of ''habeas corpus'' during a period of rebellion or invasion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Declaring that without clear congressional approval (per {{uscsub|18|4001|a}}), President Bush cannot detain an American citizen arrested in the United States and away from a zone of combat as an "[[illegal enemy combatant]]," the court ordered that Padilla be released from the military brig within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Reynolds|last=Holding|title=Courts affirm rights of terror suspects/Judges reject Bush policies on prisoners in Cuba and U.S.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/19/MNGHL3QVFA1.DTL|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|page=A1|date=2003-12-19|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court had stayed the release order pending the government's appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===U.S. Supreme Court===
On February 20, 2004, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] agreed to hear the government's appeal. The Supreme Court heard the case, ''[[Rumsfeld v. Padilla]]'', in April 2004, but on June 28, 2004, the court dismissed the petition on technical grounds because
# It was improperly filed in federal court in New York instead of South Carolina, where Padilla was being detained.
# The Court held that the petition was incorrect in naming the secretary of defense as the respondent for ''habeas corpus'' purposes instead of the commanding officer of the naval brig who was Padilla's direct custodian.

===District Court for South Carolina===
[[File:Jose Padilla at the Navy Consolidated Brig.jpg|thumb|Photo of Jose Padilla on [[Sensory deprivation|sensory-deprived]] trip to the dentist; it caused shock when published by the ''New York Times'' in December 2006.]]
The case was refiled in the [[United States District Court for the District of South Carolina|U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina]], and on February 28, 2005, the court ordered that the government either charge or release Padilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal judge: Charge Padilla or release him|date=March 1, 2005|publisher=[[CNN]]|first=Phil|last=Hirschkorn|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-03-01/justice/padilla.ruling_1_jose-padilla-donna-newman-enemy-combatant-case|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711153824/http://articles.cnn.com/2005-03-01/justice/padilla.ruling_1_jose-padilla-donna-newman-enemy-combatant-case|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wt_09sep05"&gt;{{cite news|title=Court upholds Padilla detention|date=September 9, 2005|publisher=[[Washington Times]]|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/sep/9/20050909-113106-7643r|accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 2005, the Supreme Court denied the government's petition to have his case heard directly by the court, instead of the appeal being first heard by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. On September 9, 2005, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit ruled that President Bush had the authority to detain Padilla without charges.&lt;ref name="wt_09sep05"/&gt; An opinion written by judge [[J. Michael Luttig]] cited the joint resolution by Congress authorizing military action following the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], as well as the June 2004 ruling concerning [[Yaser Hamdi]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Attorneys for Padilla and civil liberties organizations, filing ''amicus curiae'' briefs, argued that the detention was illegal. They said it could lead to the military holding anyone, from protesters to people who check out what the government considers the wrong books from the library. The Bush administration denied the allegations. The defense argument noted that the congressional military authorization (the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]]) pertained only to nations, organizations, or persons whom the president "determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], or harbored such organizations or persons."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

They advanced a reading of this language would suggest a Congressional limitation to the military power would assure an appropriately narrow range of detainees and that the power to detain would last only so long as the Congressional authorization was not revoked or remained in effect by its terms. Similarly, they noted that the [[Yaser Hamdi]] Supreme Court case (''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'') upon which the court relied, required a [[habeas corpus]] hearing for any alleged enemy combatant who demands one, claiming not to be such a combatant, which would require additional judicial or military tribunal oversight over each such detention.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The argument in the general public concerning the legality of Padilla's detention examined one of the provisions of the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] enacted on October 17, 2006, which states:

{{Blockquote|Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and ''notwithstanding any other law'' [emphasis added] (including section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, or any other habeas corpus provision), no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause of action whatsoever, including any action pending on or filed after the date of enactment of this chapter, relating to the prosecution, trial, or judgment of a military commission convened under this section, including challenges to the lawfulness of the procedures of military commissions under this chapter.}}

The [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] does not apply by its terms to Padilla as he is a U.S. citizen. Other provisions of the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] may provide civil and criminal amnesty to those involved in his case, who might otherwise face civil rights lawsuits or criminal liability for unlawfully detaining someone. The immunity provisions may be tested in a civil suit brought by Padilla against [[John Yoo]] of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] ([[#Civil proceedings|discussed below]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Indictment==
On November 22, 2005, [[CNN]] reported that Padilla had been indicted in federal court on charges he "conspired to murder, kidnap, and maim people overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kelli|last=Arena|author2=Terry Frieden|author3=Phil Hirschkorn|title=Terror suspect Padilla charged|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/11/22/padilla.case/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|date=2005-11-22|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padilla's lawyer correlated the indictment's timing as avoidance of an impending Supreme Court hearing on the Padilla case: "The administration is seeking to avoid a Supreme Court showdown over the issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Fred|last=Barbash|title=Padilla's Lawyers Suggest Indictment Helps Government Avoid Court Fight|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/22/AR2005112201061.html|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=2005-11-22|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the original allegations made by the U.S. government three years prior, which had contributed to Padilla's being held the majority of the time in [[solitary confinement]], was part of the indictment, nor was there any charge related to incidents within the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[Democracy Now!]] further asserted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] announced Padilla is being removed from military custody and charged with a series of crimes" and "There is no mention in the indictment of Padilla's alleged plot to use a [[dirty bomb]] in the United States. There is also no mention that Padilla ever planned to stage any attacks inside the country. And there is no direct mention of [[Al-Qaeda]]. Instead the indictment lays out a case involving five men who helped raise money and recruit volunteers in the 1990s to go overseas to countries including [[Chechnya]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Somalia]] and [[Kosovo]]. Padilla, in fact, appears to play a minor role in the conspiracy. He is accused of going to a [[jihad]] training camp in [[Afghanistan]] but his lawyers said the indictment offers no evidence he ever engaged in terrorist activity.&lt;ref name="democracy_now_interview"&gt;{{cite video|people=Amy Goodman, Andrew Patel, Bill Goodman|date=2005-11-23|title=Why did the Bush Administration Hold Jose Padilla for 3 Years as an Enemy Combatant?

Padilla was held for years in military custody with no formal charges. Critics said such a process would allow the U.S. government to detain citizens indefinitely without presenting the case that would eventually be tried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Shannon|last=McCaffrey|title=Indictment of Padilla unveiled|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_852377.php|work=OC Register|date=2005-11-23|accessdate=2007-01-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523084309/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_852377.php|archivedate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] refused to authorize a transfer from the Navy brig to civil court.&lt;ref name="nyt_05jan06"&gt;{{cite news|first=Linda|last=Greenhouse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/05/politics/politicsspecial1/05padilla.html|title=Justices Let U.S. Transfer Padilla to Civilian Custody|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2006-01-05|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn_05jan06"&gt;{{cite news|first=Phil|last=Hirschkorn|title=Court rejects government request to move 'enemy combatant'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/22/enemy.combatant/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|date=2005-12-22|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court suggested that the administration was manipulating the federal court system with "intentional [[Mootness|mooting]]" in order to avoid Supreme Court review. It said that the "shifting tactics in the case threatens [the government's] credibility with the courts."&lt;ref name="meyer"/&gt;

The Solicitor General [[Paul Clement]] said that the federal appeals court decision "defies both law and logic." He asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] authorize immediate transfer on December 30, 2005.&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Meyer|title=U.S. asks justices to transfer Padilla|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002709447_padilla29.html|work=[[Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2005-12-29|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place one day after Padilla's lawyers filed a petition charging the [[George W.

On January 3, 2006, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] granted a Bush administration request to transfer Padilla from military to civilian custody.&lt;ref name="nyt_05jan06"/&gt; He was transferred to a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] in [[Miami]] while the Supreme Court decided whether to accept his appeal of the government's authority to keep US citizens it designates "enemy combatants" in open-ended military confinement without benefit of trial.

On April 3, 2006, the Supreme Court declined, with three justices dissenting from denial of [[certiorari]], to hear Padilla's appeal from the 4th Circuit Court's decision. It left the 4th Circuit court's ruling that the president had the power to designate and detain him as an "enemy combatant" without charges and with disregard to ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Justices, 6-3, Sidestep Ruling on Padilla Case|first=David|last=Stout|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=April 3, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/us/03cnd-scotus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal proceedings==
[[File:Florence ADMAX.jpg|thumb|[[ADX Florence|"Supermax"]], where Padilla is held in [[Florence, Colorado]]]]
Padilla was indicted on three criminal counts in the Miami, Florida, criminal proceeding. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The trial commenced on May 15, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,135780,00.html|title=Jose Padilla Trial Begins|publisher=military.com|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted for 3 months.

===Partial dismissal of counts against Padilla===
Two weeks after the presiding judge claimed prosecutors were "light on facts" in their conspiracy allegations, the government dismissed one of its three charges against Padilla and dismissed another in part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13462968|title=Judge agrees Padilla terror case 'light on facts'/Prosecutors ordered to back up their assertion defendants conspired to injure, kill|work=[[MSNBC]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=2006-06-21|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The count of conspiracy to murder (punishable by life imprisonment) was dismissed on August 16, 2006, on the grounds that it was duplicative of the other two counts pending against him. The second count was conspiracy to materially aid terrorists under {{USC|18|371}} (punishable by five years in prison) and the third was {{USC|18|2339A}} (punishable by 15 years in prison). The trial court ordered that the government elect a single criminal statute in its second count of the indictment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

However, on January 30, 2007, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit]] reversed the ruling and reinstated a charge of conspiracy to "murder, kidnap, and maim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=St. Onge|title=Appeals Court Renews Charge Against Padilla|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/47699|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=2007-01-31|accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delays in prosecution===
Two additional motions filed in October 2006 argued that the case should be dismissed because the government took too much time between arresting Padilla and charging him, violating Padilla's constitutional right to a [[speedy trial]] as the arrest took place prior to his detention as an enemy combatant and not when he was transferred to civilian custody.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Mental competency hearing===
{{wikisource|Report of Psychiatric Assessment of José Padilla}}
{{wikisource|FORENSIC EVALUATION REPORT}}
In January 2007, a [[competence (law)|mental competency hearing]] was scheduled for Padilla for February 22, 2007. Two mental health experts hired by the defense to conduct a [[competency evaluation (law)|competency evaluation]] concluded Padilla was not mentally fit for trial; a third evaluation submitted by the [[Bureau of Prisons]] found him mentally competent. The judge ordered that Sandy Seymour, technical director of the Charleston brig; Craig Noble, brig psychologist; Andrew Cruz, brig social worker; four employees of the Miami federal detention center; and a Defense Department lawyer appear at the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Vanessa|last=Blum|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-216dirtybomber,0,1684842.story?coll=sfla-home-headlines|title=Judge says 3 from Navy brig must testify at terror suspect's sanity hearing|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=2007-02-16|accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2007, at the competency hearing, Dr. Angela Hegarty, a psychiatrist hired by Padilla's defense, said that after 22 hours of examining Padilla, she believed that he was mentally unfit to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/8/16/exclusive_an_inside_look_at_how|date=2007-08-16 |title=Interview with forensic psychiatrist Dr. Angela Hegarty: An Inside Look at How U.S. Interrogators Destroyed the Mind of Jose Padilla|publisher=DemocracyNow |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said he exhibited "a facial tic, problems with social contact, lack of concentration and a form of [[Stockholm syndrome]]."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; She diagnosed his condition as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD)&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6388339.stm|date=2007-02-22|title=Padilla 'not fit to stand trial'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jay|last=Weaver|title=Terror suspect hearing gets under way|url=http://www.bradenton.com/mld/bradenton/news/nation/16760156.htm|work=Miami Herald|date=2007-02-22|accessdate=May 14, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225102124/http://www.bradenton.com/mld/bradenton/news/nation/16760156.htm|archivedate=2007-02-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told the court, "It's my opinion that he lacks the capacity to assist counsel. He has a great deal of difficulty talking about the current case before him."&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt;

In cross examination, federal prosecutor John Shipley noted that Padilla had a score of zero on Hegarty's post-traumatic stress disorder test and pointed out that this information was omitted in her final report. Hegarty stated that the omission was an error on her part.&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt; Another psychiatrist hired by the defense testified along the same lines. The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' reported that a "U.S. Bureau of Prisons psychiatrist who believes Padilla is fit to face trial and Defense Department officials—are expected to testify at the ongoing hearing before U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke."&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt;

===Conviction and sentencing===
On August 16, 2007, after a day and a half of deliberations, the jury found Padilla guilty on all counts. He was scheduled to be sentenced on December 5, 2007, but his sentencing was postponed to January due to the death of a family member of the judge scheduled to sentence him. He was sentenced on January 22, 2008, to 17 years and 4 months in federal prison.&lt;ref name=sentcd&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22784470 "Padilla sentenced on terror charges"], MSNBC.com; accessed May 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His three co-defendants received sentences of 15 years, eight months, and 12 years and 8 months.&lt;ref name=sentcd/&gt;

Before receiving his permanent prison assignment, Padilla was placed in the Federal Detention Center facility in [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Paula and Tonya Alanez.

===Direct appeal of criminal conviction===
As of February 28, 2008, Padilla had appealed his conviction and sentence and the government had cross-appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sdfla.blogspot.com/2008/02/lets-get-ready-to-rumble.html|title=Southern District of Florida Blog: Let's get ready to rumble!|first=David|last=Markus|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=sdfla.blogspot.com|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' said in an editorial, "the lawyers suing for Padilla aren't interested in justice. They're practicing 'lawfare', which is an effort to undermine the war on terror by making U.S. officials afraid to pursue it for fear of personal liability." In January 2012, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and his case has been ruled on numerous times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203718504577181191271527180 "'Lawfare' Loses Big"], ''Wall Street Journal''; accessed May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence ruled too lenient===
On September 19, 2011, a three-judge panel of the [[11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] threw out the 17-year prison sentence imposed on Padilla, ruling that the sentence was too lenient. They sent the case back to the lower court for a new sentencing hearing. The Court said, "Padilla's sentence of 12 years below the low end of the [sentencing] guidelines range reflects a clear error of judgment about the sentencing of this career offender."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwinnipeg.com/world/us+court+says+17-year+prison+sentence+for+terror+plotter+jose+padilla+is+too+short/6442484691/story.html "US court says 17-year prison sentence for terror plotter Jose Padilla is too short"], ''Global Winnipeg''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court says Padilla sentence too lenient|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/19/us-usa-security-padilla-idUSTRE78I49120110919?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2011|date=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 2014, the district court sentenced Padilla to 21 years.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-jose-padilla-prison-sentence-20140909-story.html "Jose Padilla Prison Sentence"], ''Chicago Tribune'', September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of his conviction==
Andrew Patel, Padilla's lawyer, said after the guilty verdict,
&lt;blockquote&gt;What happened in this trial, I think you have to put it in the context of federal conspiracy law, where the government doesn't have to prove that something happened, but just that people agree that something should happen in the future. In this case, it was even more strained. The crime charged in this case was actually an agreement to agree to do something in the future. So when you're dealing with a charge like that, you're not going to have—or the government's not going to be required to produce the kind of evidence that you would expect in a normal criminal case.&lt;ref&gt;"Jose Padilla's Attorney Calls Guilty Verdict 'Huge Tragedy', Vows Appeal", Interview with Democracy Now, August 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American economist [[Paul Craig Roberts]] criticized the jury's verdict in the Padilla case as having "overthrown" the Constitution and done far more damage to U.S. liberty than any terrorist could.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Paul Craig [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/roberts/roberts219.html "Padilla Jury Opens Pandora’s Box"], lewrockwell.com; accessed May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Andy Worthington]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Seventeen] years and four months seems to me to be an extraordinarily long sentence for little more than a thought crime, but when the issue of Padilla's three and half years of suppressed torture is raised, it's difficult not to conclude that justice has just been horribly twisted, that the president and his advisers have just got away with torturing an American citizen with impunity, and that no American citizen can be sure that what happened to Padilla will not happen to him or her. Today, it was a Muslim; tomorrow, unless the government's powers are taken away from them, it could be any number of categories of 'enemy combatants' who have not yet been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, Andy [http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/?p=207 Andy Worthington "Why Jose Padilla's 17-year prison sentence should shock and disgust all Americans"], andyworthington.co.uk; accessed May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Timothy Lynch of the [[Cato Institute]] raised several issues related to the Padilla seizure in an ''[[Amicus curiae|amicus]]'' brief he filed to the Supreme Court. In it, he asks questions such as whether the president can lock up any person in the world and then deny that person access to family, defense counsel, and civilian court review; and objects to the use of "harsh conditions" and "environmental stresses". He questioned whether such techniques can be employed against anyone once the president gives an order. Those legal questions remain unsettled. Lynch argued that, by abruptly moving Padilla from the military brig and transferring him into the civil criminal justice system, the Bush administration was able to forestall Supreme Court review of the president's military powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/legalbriefs/rumsfeldvpadilla.pdf "Brief of the Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae in Support of Respondents"], cato.org; accessed May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenn Greenwald]], journalist and former constitutional law and civil rights litigator, wrote a highly critical piece in the online magazine ''Salon.com'' in September 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2011/09/20/padilla_8/singleton/ "Jose Padilla and how American justice functions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427070053/http://www.salon.com/2011/09/20/padilla_8/singleton/ |date=2012-04-27 }}, ''Salon''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The treatment Padilla has received in the justice system is, needless to say, the polar opposite of that enjoyed by these political elites ... Literally days before it was required to justify to the U.S. Supreme Court how it could imprison an American citizen for years without charges or access to a lawyer, the Bush administration suddenly indicted Padilla -- on charges unrelated to, and far less serious than, the accusation that he was A Dirty Bomber -- and then successfully convinced the Supreme Court to refuse to decide the legality of Padilla's imprisonment on the grounds of 'mootness'&lt;/blockquote&gt;, Greenwald opined.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

A 2012 editorial in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' describes efforts of the [[ACLU]] and others on Padilla's behalf as "[[lawfare]]". It said that the court ruling throwing out a lawsuit filed for Padilla as a "victory for legal sanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203718504577181191271527180|title='Lawfare' loses big|accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil proceedings==
On January 4, 2008, Padilla and his mother filed suit against [[John Yoo]] in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Case Number CV08 0035).&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournal20080119&gt;{{cite news|author=[[John Yoo|Yoo, John]]|title=Terrorist Tort Travesty|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120070333580301911?mod=sphere_ts|page= A13|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=2008-01-19|accessdate=2008-02-10|quote=Last week, I (a former Bush administration official) was sued by José Padilla—a 37-year-old al-Qaeda operative convicted last summer of setting up a terrorist cell in Miami. Padilla wants a declaration that his detention by the U.S. government was unconstitutional, $1 in damages, and all of the fees charged by his own attorneys.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complaint sought damages based on the alleged torture of Padilla, and attributed this treatment as having been authorized by Yoo's legal opinions issued in August 2002, known as the [[Torture memos]]. The claim was that Yoo caused Padilla's damages by authorizing his alleged torture through his memoranda.&lt;ref name=AP20080210&gt;{{cite news|author=Anderson, Curt|title=Padilla Sues Ex-Bush Official Over Memos|url=http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/ap/o/632/01-04-2008/20080104145005_23.html|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=2008-01-04|accessdate=2008-02-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107103852/http://news.findlaw.com/ap_stories/ap/o/632/01-04-2008/20080104145005_23.html|archivedate=2008-01-07|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FindlawPadilla20080210&gt;{{cite news|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/cassel/20080114.html|title=Jose Padilla's Suit Against John Yoo: An Interesting Idea, But Will It Get Far?|publisher=[[Findlaw]]|author=Cassell, Elaine|date=2008-01-04|accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2009, the trial court held that the complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim, because if everything stated in the complaint was taken as true, it stated grounds for Yoo to be liable to Padilla for civil damages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090617182229/http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/padilla-yoo.pdf Order Denying In Part and Granting In Part Defendant's Motion to Dismiss], lawprofessors.typepad.com; accessed May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; But on February 17, 2011, the District Court dismissed another suit by Padilla against other former officials (including Leon Panetta who was Secretary of Defense at the time of the hearing) that had been brought on February 9, 2007. ''Lebron v. Rumsfeld'', 764 F.Supp.2d 787 (D.S.C.). On January 23, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150211202102/http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/116480.P.pdf ''Lebron v. Rumsfeld''], uscourts.gov; accessed May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Yoo could not be held accountable for Padilla's treatment because, though his treatment might have amounted to torture, it was not defined as such legally in 2002–2003 when it occurred.&lt;ref name="rosenthal"&gt;Rosenthal, Andrew, [http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/tortured-logic "Tortured Logic"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
According to his attorney and others, Padilla has changed the pronunciation of his surname from the typical {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|d|iː|j|ə}} {{respell|pə|DEE|yə}} to {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|d|ɪ|l|ə}} {{respell|pə|DIL|ə}}.&lt;ref name="democracy_now_interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Donna Newman|date=2005-11-22|title=Does Not Rhyme With "Tortilla"|url=http://media2.washingtonpost.com/media/slate/Podcasts/20051122_Padilla.wma|format=[[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] audio|accessdate=2007-01-25|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padilla's [[Arabic name]] Abdullah al-Muhajir, which he began using during his jail sentence, literally means "Abdullah the migrant". "Al-Muhajir" is a ''[[laqab]]'' ([[epithet]]) rather than an adopted family name. Padilla is not related to or known to be connected in any way to [[Abu Hamza al-Muhajir]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

'''KEGG''' ('''Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes''') is a collection of databases dealing with [[genome]]s, [[biological pathway]]s, [[disease]]s, [[drug]]s, and [[chemical substance]]s. KEGG is utilized for [[bioinformatics]] research and education, including data analysis in [[genomics]], [[metagenomics]], [[metabolomics]] and other [[omics]] studies, modeling and simulation in [[systems biology]], and [[translational research]] in [[drug development]].

==Introduction==

The KEGG database project was initiated in 1995 by [[Minoru Kanehisa]], Professor at the Institute for Chemical Research, [[Kyoto University]], under the then ongoing Japanese [[Human Genome Project|Human Genome Program]].&lt;ref name="pmid10592173"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kanehisa M, Goto S | title=KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | year=2000 | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=27–30 | pmid=10592173 | doi=10.1093/nar/28.1.27 | pmc=102409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9287494"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kanehisa M | title=A database for post-genome analysis | journal=Trends Genet | year=1997 | volume=13 | issue=9 | pages=375–6 | pmid=9287494 | doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(97)01223-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreseeing the need for a computerized resource that can be used for biological interpretation of [[genome project|genome sequence data]], he started developing the KEGG PATHWAY database. It is a collection of manually drawn KEGG pathway maps representing experimental knowledge on [[metabolism]] and various other functions of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] and the [[organism]]. Each pathway map contains a network of molecular interactions and reactions and is designed to link [[gene]]s in the genome to [[gene product]]s (mostly [[protein]]s) in the pathway. This has enabled the analysis called KEGG pathway mapping, whereby the gene content in the genome is compared with the KEGG PATHWAY database to examine which pathways and associated functions are likely to be encoded in the genome.

According to the developers, KEGG is a "computer representation" of the [[biological system]].&lt;ref name="pmid16381885"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kanehisa M, Goto S, Hattori M, Aoki-Kinoshita KF, Itoh M, Kawashima S, Katayama T, Araki M, Hirakawa M | title=From genomics to chemical genomics: new developments in KEGG | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | year=2006 | volume=34 | issue=Database issue | pages=D354–7 | pmid=16381885 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkj102 | pmc=1347464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates building blocks and wiring diagrams of the system — more specifically, genetic building blocks of genes and proteins, chemical building blocks of [[small molecule]]s and reactions, and wiring diagrams of molecular interaction and reaction networks. This concept is realized in the following databases of KEGG, which are categorized into systems, genomic, chemical, and health information.&lt;ref name="pmid24214961"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kanehisa M, Goto S, Sato Y, Kawashima M, Furumichi M, Tanabe M | title=Data, information, knowledge and principle: back to metabolism in KEGG | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | year=2014 | volume=42 | issue=Database issue | pages=D199–205 | pmid=24214961 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1076 | pmc=3965122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Databases==

=== Systems information ===

The KEGG PATHWAY database, the wiring diagram database, is the core of the KEGG resource. It is a collection of pathway maps integrating many entities including genes, proteins, RNAs, chemical compounds, glycans, and chemical reactions, as well as disease genes and drug targets, which are stored as individual entries in the other databases of KEGG. The pathway maps are classified into the following sections:

* [[Metabolism]]
* Genetic information processing ([[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]], [[DNA replication|replication]] and [[DNA repair|repair]], etc.)
* Environmental information processing ([[membrane transport]], [[signal transduction]], etc.)
* Cellular processes ([[cell growth]], [[cell death]], [[cell membrane]] functions, etc.)
* Organismal systems ([[immune system]], [[endocrine system]], [[nervous system]], etc.)
* Human [[disease]]s
* [[Drug development]]

The metabolism section contains aesthetically drawn global maps showing an overall picture of metabolism, in addition to regular metabolic pathway maps. The low-resolution global maps can be used, for example, to compare metabolic capacities of different organisms in genomics studies and different environmental samples in metagenomics studies. In contrast, KEGG modules in the KEGG MODULE database are higher-resolution, localized wiring diagrams, representing tighter functional units within a pathway map, such as subpathways conserved among specific organism groups and molecular complexes. KEGG modules are defined as characteristic gene sets that can be linked to specific metabolic capacities and other [[phenotype|phenotypic]] features, so that they can be used for automatic interpretation of genome and metagenome data.

Another database that supplements KEGG PATHWAY is the KEGG BRITE database. It is an [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] database containing hierarchical classifications of various entities including genes, proteins, organisms, diseases, drugs, and chemical compounds. While KEGG PATHWAY is limited to molecular interactions and reactions of these entities, KEGG BRITE incorporates many different types of relationships.

=== Genomic information ===

Several months after the KEGG project was initiated in 1995, the first report of the completely sequenced [[bacteria]]l genome was published.&lt;ref name="pmid7542800"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM | title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd | journal=Science | year=1995 | volume=269 | issue=5223 | pages=496–512 | pmid=7542800 | doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then all published complete genomes are accumulated in KEGG for both [[eukaryote]]s and [[prokaryote]]s. The KEGG GENES database contains gene/protein-level information and the KEGG GENOME database contains organism-level information for these genomes. The KEGG GENES database consists of gene sets for the complete genomes, and genes in each set are given [[genome annotation|annotation]]s in the form of establishing correspondences to the wiring diagrams of KEGG pathway maps, KEGG modules, and BRITE hierarchies.

These correspondences are made using the concept of [[ortholog]]s. The KEGG pathway maps are drawn based on experimental evidence in specific organisms but they are designed to be applicable to other organisms as well, because different organisms, such as human and mouse, often share identical pathways consisting of functionally identical genes, called orthologous genes or orthologs. All the genes in the KEGG GENES database are being grouped into such orthologs in the KEGG ORTHOLOGY (KO) database. Because the nodes (gene products) of KEGG pathway maps, as well as KEGG modules and BRITE hierarchies, are given KO identifiers, the correspondences are established once genes in the genome are annotated with KO identifiers by the [[genome annotation]] procedure in KEGG.&lt;ref name="pmid24214961" /&gt;

=== Chemical information ===

The KEGG metabolic pathway maps are drawn to represent the dual aspects of the metabolic network: the genomic network of how genome-encoded [[enzyme]]s are connected to catalyze consecutive reactions and the chemical network of how chemical structures of [[enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]]s and [[product (biology)|product]]s are transformed by these reactions.&lt;ref name="pmid23816707"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kanehisa M | title=Chemical and genomic evolution of enzyme-catalyzed reaction networks | journal=FEBS Lett | year=2013 | volume=587 | issue=17 | pages=2731–7 | pmid=23816707 | doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2013.06.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of enzyme genes in the genome will identify enzyme relation networks when superimposed on the KEGG pathway maps, which in turn characterize chemical structure transformation networks allowing interpretation of [[biosynthetic]] and [[biodegradation]] potentials of the organism. Alternatively, a set of [[metabolite]]s identified in the metabolome will lead to the understanding of enzymatic pathways and enzyme genes involved.

The databases in the chemical information category, which are collectively called KEGG LIGAND, are organized by capturing knowledge of the chemical network. In the beginning of the KEGG project, KEGG LIGAND consisted of three databases: KEGG COMPOUND for chemical compounds, KEGG REACTION for chemical reactions, and KEGG ENZYME for reactions in the enzyme nomenclature.&lt;ref name="pmid9847234"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Goto S, Nishioka T, Kanehisa M | title=LIGAND database for enzymes, compounds and reactions | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | year=1999 | volume=27 | issue=1 | pages=377–9 | pmid=9847234 | doi=10.1093/nar/27.1.377 | pmc=148189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are additional databases: KEGG GLYCAN for glycans&lt;ref name="pmid16014746"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hashimoto K, Goto S, Kawano S, Aoki-Kinoshita KF, Ueda N, Hamajima M, Kawasaki T, Kanehisa M | title=KEGG as a glycome informatics resource | journal=Glycobiology | year=2006 | volume=16 | issue=5 | pages=63R–70R | pmid=16014746 | doi=10.1093/glycob/cwj010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two auxiliary reaction databases called RPAIR (reactant pair alignments) and RCLASS (reaction class).&lt;ref name="pmid23384306"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Muto A, Kotera M, Tokimatsu T, Nakagawa Z, Goto S, Kanehisa M | title=Modular architecture of metabolic pathways revealed by conserved sequences of reactions | journal=J Chem Inf Model | year=2013 | volume=53 | issue=3 | pages=613–22 | pmid=23384306 | doi=10.1021/ci3005379 | pmc=3632090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; KEGG COMPOUND has also been expanded to contain various compounds such as [[xenobiotic]]s, in addition to metabolites.

=== Health information ===

In KEGG, diseases are viewed as perturbed states of the biological system caused by perturbants of genetic factors and environmental factors, and drugs are viewed as different types of perturbants.&lt;ref name="pmid19880382"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kanehisa M, Goto S, Furumichi M, Tanabe M, Hirakawa M | title=KEGG for representation and analysis of molecular networks involving diseases and drugs | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | year=2010 | volume=38 | issue=Database issue | pages=D355–60 | pmid=19880382 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkp896 | pmc=2808910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KEGG PATHWAY database includes not only the normal states but also the perturbed states of the biological systems. However, disease pathway maps cannot be drawn for most diseases because molecular mechanisms are not well understood. An alternative approach is taken in the KEGG DISEASE database, which simply catalogs known genetic factors and environmental factors of diseases. These catalogs may eventually lead to more complete wiring diagrams of diseases.

The KEGG DRUG database contains [[active ingredient]]s of [[approved drug]]s in Japan, the USA, and Europe. They are distinguished by chemical structures and/or chemical components and associated with [[drug target|target]] molecules, [[drug metabolism|metabolizing enzymes]], and other molecular interaction network information in the KEGG pathway maps and the BRITE hierarchies. This enables an integrated analysis of drug interactions with genomic information. [[Crude drug]]s and other health-related substances, which are outside the category of approved drugs, are stored in the KEGG ENVIRON database. The databases in the health information category are collectively called KEGG MEDICUS, which also includes [[package insert]]s of all marketed drugs in Japan.

== Subscription model ==

In July 2011 KEGG introduced a subscription model for FTP download due to a significant cutback of government funding. KEGG continues to be freely available through its website, but the subscription model has raised discussions about sustainability of bioinformatics databases.&lt;ref name="pmid22144685"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Galperin MY, Fernández-Suárez XM | title=The 2012 Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue and the online Molecular Biology Database Collection | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | year=2012 | volume=40 | issue=Database issue | pages=D1–8 | pmid=22144685 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkr1196 | pmc=3245068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatureNews&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayden|first=EC|title=Popular plant database set to charge users|url=http://www.nature.com/news/popular-plant-database-set-to-charge-users-1.13642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide''''' was a book-format collection of movie [[capsule review]]s that began in 1969, was updated biennially after 1978, and then annually after 1986. The final edition was published in September 2014.&lt;ref name="hammond20140819"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hammond |first=Pete |date=August 19, 2014 | title=Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide Ending After 45 Years – Internet Kills Iconic Print Paperback |url=http://deadline.com/2014/08/r-i-p-leonard-maltins-movie-guide-internet-kills-iconic-print-paperback-after-45-years-821849/ | website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]| accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called '''''TV Movies''''', which became '''''Leonard Maltin's TV Movies and Video Guide''''', and then '''''Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide''''', before arriving at its final title. Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] edited it and contributed a large portion of its reviews.

==Features==
The book used a [[star (classification)|star rating]] system. The lowest rating was "BOMB", followed by one and a half stars, rising in half-star increments to a maximum of four stars, 
and 
frequently giving out two-and-a-half star ( **1/2 ) reviews. The sole exception to this was ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'', which was rated with two and one third stars out of four, referencing the film's title.

Maltin did not cover [[direct-to-video]] films because of their great number (six released each week by 1994).&lt;ref name="alvarez19941230"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-12-30/entertainment/9412300287_1_direct-to-video-video-store-r-rated |title=Big Names Look For Bright Lights In Videoland |last=Alvarez |first=Max J. |date=1994-12-30 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-07-22 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Made-for-television film]]s were included in the guides for many years, though in the early 2000s, Maltin gradually began to phase them out to make room for current feature film releases. All had been removed by the early 2010s, and no TV movies made after 2004 were included in new editions. Maltin used a different system for rating TV movies: "Below average", "Average" or "Above average", with select variants for highly rated films, including "Way above average" for ''[[The Day After]]'' and ''[[Special Bulletin]]'', and "Outstanding" for ''[[Minstrel Man (1977 film)|Minstrel Man]]''. Certain theatrically-released films (usually low budget, obscure, foreign, concert, or [[serial film]]s), as well as the majority of films based on [[Edgar Wallace]] novels,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} were also removed from the guide over time to allow the inclusion of new titles.

Another notable feature of the Guide was that each review included a reference to the source material for the film if it was based on previously published material. Films were listed alphabetically letter-by-letter, ignoring punctuation and spaces. [[Article (grammar)|Articles]] were also ignored and transposed to the end of the title.

The Guide was notable for containing what the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' calls the world's shortest movie review. His 2 out of 4 star review of the 1948 musical ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic?]]'' consisted of the word "No".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |year=2004 |title=Leonard Maltin's 2005 Movie Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=akMCIHi4MPUC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Isn't+It+Romantic%3F%22 |location=New York |publisher=Signet Books |isbn=0-451-21265-7 |page=700 |access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another very short review concerned the film ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' where Maltin wrote, "It is what it is." Yet another was of ''[[Are Husbands Necessary? (1942 film)|Are Husbands Necessary?]]'' in which he wrote "And what about this film?", and one more right behind these is ''[[Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol]]'' where, in comparing it to the previous installments, he commented, "More of the same, only worse."

==Bombs==
Along with typically listed worst pictures of all time, the hundreds of films Maltin designated as a "BOMB" in his guide also included ''[[3000 Miles to Graceland]]'', ''[[88 Minutes]]'', ''[[College (2008 film)|College]]'', ''[[Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever]]'', ''[[American Gigolo]]'', the [[Woody Allen]]-directed ''[[Anything Else]]'', ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', ''[[Bobby Deerfield]]'', ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', ''[[Captain Ron]]'', ''[[Celtic Pride]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'', ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way but Loose]]'', ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Four Rooms]]'', 2010's ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'', ''[[Mame (film)|Mame]]'', ''[[The Missouri Breaks]]'', ''[[Popeye (1980 film)|Popeye]]'', ''[[Prêt-à-Porter (film)|Prêt-à-Porter]]'', 1998's remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'', 2007's remake of ''[[Sleuth (2007 film)|Sleuth]]'', ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' and ''[[Your Highness]]''.

==History==
High-school senior [[Leonard Maltin]] was a film fan and publisher of ''Fanzine Monthly''. In spring 1968 a teacher introduced him to an editor at [[Signet Books]], which wanted a competitor to [[Steven H. Scheuer]]'s ''[[Movies on TV]]''; impressed by Maltin's ideas for the book the editor hired him immediately, without telling others that he had hired a 17-year-old. The first edition of Maltin's book appeared in 1969; a second edition appeared five years later. After a third in 1978, new editions appeared every two years, and after 1986 every year.{{r|hammond20140819}} In 2005, logistical problems of a single book prompted him to launch a companion volume, ''Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide'', restricted to films from 1960 and earlier, several of which no longer appear in the annual publication (some had been deleted over the years to make room for newer films, others removed at this point because the additional venue allowed it) and many others that never had. The latter category includes the "complete" (according to Maltin's introduction) Saturday matinee cowboy programmers of [[John Wayne]], [[William Boyd (actor)|William "Hopalong Cassidy" Boyd]], [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]].

The second edition of the ''Classic Movie Guide'', published in 2010, moved the cut-off date to 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leonard |last=Maltin|date=1 December 2011 |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/a-new-home-for-old-movies |title=A New Home for Old Movies |publisher=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Scheuer's ''Movies on TV'', similar books include ''[[Halliwell's Film Guide]]'', by [[Leslie Halliwell]], and ''The Good Film and Video Guide'', by [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]]. Scheuer's guide was the first published, in 1958, preceding Maltin's by ten years, and the two were competing titles until the early 1990s. Scheuer's books had a similar format to Maltin's, except with more listings for made-for-television productions.

Maltin announced in August 2014 that the 2015 edition, to be published in September 2014, would be the last: "An entire generation has been raised to acquire all their information online from their mobile devices or computers. These are not the likely customers for a physical paperback reference book. Our sales have sharply declined in recent years."&lt;ref name="hammond20140819"/&gt;

==App==
The mobile application version of the guide was released, in 2009, to the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rollins |first=Mark |date=15 October 2009 |title=Leonard Maltin Movie Guide, Now on iPhone |url=http://www.mobilewhack.com/leonard-maltin-movie-guide-now-on-iphone/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930061924/http://www.mobilewhack.com/leonard-maltin-movie-guide-now-on-iphone/ |archivedate=30 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |publisher=MobileWhack.com |access-date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the app was taken down in 2014 due to [[Penguin Group]] being unable to come to an agreement with [[Mobile Age]], the creator of the app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leonard |last=Maltin |date=17 February 2014 |title=Bye, Bye, 'Movie Guide' App—For Now |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/bye-bye-movie-guide-appfor-now |publisher=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microsoft Outlook''' is a [[personal information manager]] from [[Microsoft]], available as a part of the [[Microsoft Office]] suite. Although often used mainly as an [[email]] application, it also includes a [[Calendaring software|calendar]], [[Time management#Software applications|task manager]], [[contact manager]], [[note taking]],  [[Journal (computing)|journal]], and web browsing.

It can be used as a [[Computer software|stand-alone application]], or can work with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] and [[Microsoft SharePoint Server]] for multiple users in an organization, such as shared mailboxes and calendars, Exchange public folders, SharePoint lists, and meeting schedules.  Microsoft has also released mobile applications for most mobile platforms, including iOS and Android.  Developers can also create their own custom software that works with Outlook and Office components using [[Microsoft Visual Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/159204/top_10_reasons_to_use_outlook.html|title=Top 10 Reasons to Use Outlook|date=February 10, 2009|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[Windows Phone]] devices can synchronize almost all Outlook data to [[Outlook Mobile]].

== Versions ==
Microsoft Outlook has replaced Microsoft's previous scheduling and mail programs, [[Microsoft Schedule Plus|Schedule+]] and [[Microsoft Exchange Client|Exchange Client]].

=== Macintosh ===
Microsoft also released several versions of Outlook for [[classic Mac OS]], though it was only for use with Exchange servers. It was not provided as a component of Microsoft Office for Mac, but instead made available to users from administrators or by download. The final version was Outlook for Mac 2001, which was fairly similar to Outlook 2000 and 2002 apart from being exclusively for Exchange users.

[[Microsoft Entourage]] was introduced as an Outlook-like application for Mac OS in Office 2001, but it lacked Exchange connectivity. Partial support for Exchange server became available natively in [[macOS|Mac OS X]] with Entourage 2004 Service Pack 2. Entourage is not directly equivalent to Outlook in terms of design or operation; rather, it is a distinct application which has several overlapping features including Exchange client capabilities. Somewhat improved Exchange support was added in Entourage 2008 Web Services Edition.

[[File:Microsoft Outlook 2011.png|thumb|250px|Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011]]
Entourage was replaced by Outlook for Mac 2011, which features greater compatibility and parity with Outlook for Windows than Entourage offered. It is the first native version of Outlook for macOS.

Outlook 2011 initially supported Mac OS X's [[iSync|Sync Services]] only for contacts, not events, tasks or notes. It also does not have a Project Manager equivalent to that in Entourage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macworld.com/reviews/product/671493/review/outlook_for_mac_2011.html | title=Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 | last=Welsh | first=John C. | work=[[Macworld]] | publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | date=October 1, 2010 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Service Pack 1 (v 14.1.0), published on April 12, 2011, Outlook can now sync calendar, notes and tasks with Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010.

On October 31, 2014, [[Microsoft]] released Outlook for Mac (v15.3 build 141024) with [[Office 365]] (a [[software as a service]] licensing program that makes Office programs available as soon as they are developed). Outlook for Mac 15.3 improves upon its predecessors with:&lt;ref name="outlook-for-mac-15.3" /&gt;
* Better performance and reliability as a result of a new threading model and database improvements.
* A new modern user interface with improved scrolling and agility when switching between Ribbon tabs.
* Online archive support for searching Exchange (online or on-premises) archived mail.
* Master Category List support and enhancements delivering access to category lists (name and color) and sync between Mac, Microsoft Windows and OWA clients.
* Office 365 push email support for real-time email delivery.
* Faster first-run and email download experience with improved Exchange Web Services syncing.&lt;ref name="outlook-for-mac-15.3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.office.com/2014/10/31/new-outlook-mac-available-office-365-customers/ | title=New Outlook for Mac available to Office 365 | work=Office Blogs | date=October 31, 2014 | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== iOS and Android ===

==== Outlook for phones and tablets ====
In January 2015, [[Microsoft]] released Outlook for phones and for tablets (v1.3 build) with [[Office 365]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
This was the first Outlook for these platforms with email, calendar, and contacts.

== Internet standards compliance ==

=== HTML rendering ===
Outlook 2007 was the first Outlook to switch from Internet Explorer rendering engine to [[Microsoft Word 2007]]'s. This means [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] items not handled by Word are no longer supported. On the other hand, HTML messages composed in Word look as they appeared to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.email-standards.org/clients/microsoft-outlook-2007/ |title=Microsoft Outlook 2007 Report &amp;#124; Email Standards Project |work=email-standards.org |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects publishing newsletters and reports, because they frequently use intricate HTML and CSS to form their layout. For example, forms can no longer be embedded in email.

=== Support of CSS properties and HTML attributes ===
Outlook for Windows has very limited CSS support compared to various other e-mail clients. Neither [[Cascading Style Sheets#CSS 1|CSS1 (1996)]] nor [[Cascading Style Sheets#CSS 2|CSS2 (1998)]] specifications are fully implemented and many CSS properties can only to be used with certain HTML elements for the desired effect.&lt;ref name="campaignmonitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/|title=CSS Support Guide for Email Clients – Campaign Monitor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some HTML attributes help achieve proper rendering of e-mails in Outlook, but most of these attributes are already deprecated in the [[HTML#HTML versions timeline|HTML 4.0 specifications (1997)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/|title=HTML 4.0 Specification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve the best compatibility with Outlook, most HTML e-mails are created using multiple boxed tables, as the table element and its sub-elements support the width and height property in Outlook. No improvements have been made towards a more standards-compliant email client since the release of Outlook 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3769/a-designers-guide-to-outlook-2013|title=A designer’s guide to Outlook 2013 and Office 365|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format ===
{{Main|Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format}}
Outlook and Exchange Server internally handle messages, appointments and items as objects in a data model which is derived from the old proprietary [[Microsoft Mail]] system, the [[Rich Text Format]] from [[Microsoft Word]] and the complex [[Object linking and embedding|OLE]] general data model.&lt;ref&gt;Outlook Data Model Reference (page on the MailItem object class members), MSDN development documentation, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff861252.aspx], retrieved May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  When these programs interface with other protocols such as the various Internet and X.400 protocols, they try to map this internal model onto those protocols in a way that can be reversed if the ultimate recipient is also running Outlook or Exchange.&lt;ref name="tnefphilosophy"&gt;Preface of the TNEF specification, Outlook 2010 edition, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc815562%28v=office.14%29.aspx], retrieved May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on the possibility that emails and other items will ultimately be converted back to Microsoft Mail format is so extreme that if Outlook/Exchange cannot figure out a way to encode the complete data in the standard format, it simply encodes the entire message/item in a proprietary binary format called Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) and sends this as an attached file (usually named "winmail.dat") to an otherwise incomplete rendering of the mail/item.  If the recipient is Outlook/Exchange it can simply discard the incomplete outer message and use the encapsulated data directly, but if the recipient is any other program, the message received will be incomplete because the data in the TNEF attachment will be of little use without the Microsoft software for which it was created.&lt;ref name="tnefphilosophy" /&gt;  As a workaround, numerous tools for (partially) decoding TNEF files exist.&lt;ref&gt;See list of some TNEF decoders in the main [[TNEF]] article&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calendar compatibility ===
Outlook does not fully support data and syncing specifications for calendaring and contacts, such as [[iCalendar]], [[CalDAV]], [[SyncML]], and [[vCard]] 3.0. Outlook 2007 claims to be fully iCalendar compliant; however, it does not support all core objects, such as VTODO or VJOURNAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/compare.mspx#EBAA|title=Microsoft Office 2003 editions comparison|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Outlook supports vCard 2.1 and does not support multiple contacts in the vCard format as a single file. Outlook has also been criticized for having proprietary "Outlook extensions" to these Internet standards.

== Security concerns ==
As part of its [[Trustworthy Computing]] initiative, Microsoft took corrective steps to fix Outlook's reputation in Office Outlook 2003. Among the most publicized security features are that Office Outlook 2003 does not automatically load images in HTML emails or permit opening executable attachments by default, and includes a built-in Junk Mail filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwec.edu/help/outlook03/MAIL-junk.htm |title=Microsoft Outlook 2003: Using Junk E-mail Filters |work=uwec.edu |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire }}&lt;/ref&gt; Service Pack 2 has augmented these features and adds an anti-[[phishing]] filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/email/outlook_sp2_filters.mspx|title=Microsoft Internet Safety and Security Center|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outlook add-ins ==
Outlook add-ins are small helping programs for the Microsoft Outlook application. The main purpose of the add-ins is to add new functional capabilities into Microsoft Outlook and automate some routine operations. The term also refers to programs where the main function is to work on Outlook files, such as synchronization or backup utilities. Outlook add-ins may be developed in [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] or third-party tools such as Add-in Express. Outlook add-ins are not supported in [[Outlook Web App]].

From Outlook 97 on, Exchange Client Extensions are supported in Outlook. Outlook 2000 and later support specific [[Component Object Model|COM]] components called Outlook AddIns. The exact supported features (such as [[.NET Framework|.NET]] components) for later generations were extended with each release.

=== SalesforceIQ Inbox for Outlook ===
In March 2016, [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]] announced that its relationship intelligence platform, [[SalesforceIQ]], would be able to seamlessly integrate with Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/10/salesforce-microsoft-love-grows-with-salesforceiq-outlook-integration/|title=Salesforce-Microsoft love grows with SalesforceIQ-Outlook integration {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Miller|first=Ron|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; SalesforceIQ works from inside the Outlook inbox providing data from CRM, email and customer social profiles. It also provides recommendations within the inbox on various aspects like meeting scheduling, contacts, responses etc.

=== Hotmail Connector ===
[[File:Outlook connector.png|thumb|Hotmail Connector setup screen]]
''Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector'' (formerly ''Microsoft Office Outlook Connector''), is a discontinued and defunct free add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2003, 2007 and 2010, intended to integrate [[Outlook.com]] (formerly Hotmail) into Microsoft Outlook. It uses [[DeltaSync]], a proprietary Microsoft communications protocol that Hotmail formerly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx|title=Microsoft Office Outlook Hotmail Connector overview|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128151603/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx|archive-date=28 January 2013|dead-url=|work=[[Microsoft Office website]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In version 12, access to tasks and notes and online synchronization with [[MSN Calendar]] is only available to MSN subscribers of paid premium accounts. Version 12.1, released in December 2008 as an optional upgrade, uses [[Windows Live Calendar]] instead of the former [[MSN Calendar]]. This meant that calendar features became free for all users, except for tasks synchronization which became unavailable. In April 2008, version 12.1 became a required upgrade to continue using the service as part of a migration from [[MSN Calendar]] to [[Windows Live Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ask.officelive.com/smallbusiness/blogs/team/archive/2009/04/02/outlook-connector-users-you-must-upgrade-to-a-new-version.aspx |title=Transition information for former Office Live Small Business customers – Manage Office 365 – Office 365 – Microsoft Office 365 Community |publisher=Ask.officelive.com |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft Outlook 2013 and later have intrinsic support for accessing Outlook.com and its calendar over the [[Exchange ActiveSync]] (EAS) protocol,&lt;ref name="connector integrated"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's new in Outlook 2013|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179110(v=office.15)|work=[[Microsoft TechNet#Library|TechNet Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while older versions of Microsoft Outlook can read and synchronize Outlook.com emails over the [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-your-Outlook-com-account-in-Outlook-for-Windows-642c1902-bdd9-4dc3-abe7-76d60b148b23|title=Add your Outlook.com account in Outlook for Windows|last=|first=|date=|website=Office Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Connector ===
''Outlook Social Connector'' was a free add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2003 and 2007 by Microsoft that allowed integration of social networks such as [[Facebook]], [[Linkedin]] and [[Windows Live Messenger]] into Microsoft Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Doug|title=How to install the Outlook Social Connector (video)|url=http://blogs.office.com/b/office_casual/archive/2010/08/24/how-to-install-the-outlook-social-connector.aspx|work=Office Casual blog|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first introduced in November 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing the Outlook Social Connector|url=http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2009/11/18/announcing-the-outlook-social-connector.aspx|work=Outlook Blog|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with Microsoft Office 2010, Outlook Social Connector is an integral part of Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes in Outlook 2010 (for IT pros)|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179110%28office.14%29|work=[[Microsoft TechNet#Library|TechNet Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CardDAV and CalDAV Connector ===
Since Microsoft Outlook does not support CalDAV and CardDAV protocol along the way, various 3rd-party software vendors developed Outlook add-ins to enable users synchronizing with [[CalDAV]] and [[CardDAV]] servers. [[CalConnect]] has a list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caldav.calconnect.org/implementations/clients.html|title=CalDAV Clients|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523203324/http://caldav.calconnect.org/implementations/clients.html|archivedate=May 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; of software that enable users to synchronize their calendars with CalDAV servers/contacts with CardDAV servers.

== Importing from other email clients ==
Traditionally, Outlook supported importing messages from [[Outlook Express]] and [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]]. In addition, Microsoft Outlook supports [[POP3]] and [[IMAP]] protocols, enabling users to import mails from servers that support these protocols, such as [[Gmail]] or [[Rackspace Email]]. Microsoft Hotmail Connector add-in (described above) helps importing email from [[Hotmail]] accounts. Outlook 2013 later integrated the functionality of this add-in and added the ability to import email (as well as calendar) through [[Exchange ActiveSync]] protocol.&lt;ref name="connector integrated" /&gt;

There are some ways to get the emails from [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]; the first is to use a tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broobles.com/imapsize/index.php|title=IMAPSize|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can convert a Thunderbird folder to a format that can be imported from Outlook Express. This method must be processed folder by folder. The other method is to use a couple of free tools that keep the original folder structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nektra.com/main/2009/04/14/export-messages-and-folders-from-thunderbird-to-outlook-outlook-express/|title=Export messages and folders from Thunderbird to Outlook / Outlook Express / Windows Mail|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Exchange is available, an easier method is to connect the old mail client (Thunderbird) to Exchange using IMAP, and upload the original mail from the client to the Exchange account.

'''Museum''' is a [[List of Toronto subway stations|subway station]] on [[Line 1 Yonge–University]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It opened in 1963 and is located under Queen's Park at Charles Street West, beside the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] after which it is named. Wi-Fi service is available at this station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2016/11/theres_now_free_wifi_at_over_40_ttc_subway_stations/ |title=There's now free WiFi at over 40 TTC subway stations |newspaper=blogTO|access-date=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Museum TTC tunnel nb in.jpg|thumb|left|South of the station, the tunnel can be seen curving to the east.]]
The station structure was created in the middle of the road using [[cut and cover]], while immediately south of the station the line goes into a [[tunnel boring machine|bored tunnel]] to run under [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen’s Park]], passing east of the [[Ontario Legislative Building]] to reach [[Queen's Park station (Toronto)|Queen's Park station]]. The concourse is located under the roadway, one level above the north end of a [[centre platform]], with entrances from either side of the road. There are two stairways on the west side adjacent to the southern end of the Royal Ontario Museum and two on the east, just south of Charles Street. Pedestrians are encouraged to use the station as a [[pedestrian underpass]] to cross Queen's Park, a wide and busy thoroughfare without a centre median. This station does not have an elevator and is not wheelchair accessible.

When plans for the adjacent and now closed [[McLaughlin Planetarium]] were drawn up in the mid-1960s, a tunnel that would lead directly to the Planetarium was contemplated, but this plan was scrapped as being too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Thomas, "Stars in the Ceiling", ''Rotunda'', Summer 1982, Volume 15, Number 2, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The station is rated as high priority in the requirement for a second exit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/postings/gso-comrpt/documents/report/f2037/_conv.htm |title=Fire Safety and Second Exits at Subway Stations |author=Richard C. Ducharme |date=April 14, 2004 |work= |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, plans were made to include additional exits at the south end of the platform at Queen's Park Crescent where the "prison" bars are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spadina.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2005/Aug_31_2005/Other/Fire_Ventilation_Upg.jsp |title=Fire Ventilation Upgrade – Second Exit Program – Four Stations Conceptual Layouts |author= |date=August 31, 2005 |work= |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|12}}, construction has not been scheduled.
&lt;!-- ==="Prison" bars===
The southern end of the platform is sealed off using "prison" bars. This is to allow for ventilation, while partially sealing off the less-trafficked part of the platform. Sometimes, the section behind bars is used for storage. The bars were installed as a response to the murder of a schoolgirl in [[St. Patrick station]] in late 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/04/why-part-of-ttcs-st-patrick-station-is-still-sealed-off-after-1975-murder.html |last=Brait |first=Ellen |date=January 4, 2017 |access-date=April 5, 2017 |website=[[Toronto Star]] |title=Why part of TTC's St. Patrick station is still sealed off after 1975 murder}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Connection to Line 2 Bloor–Danforth===
{{ttcs|Bay}} and {{ttcs|St. George}} stations each have four parallel tracks, two above two.  Between these stations and Museum is a full double-track, grade-separated [[Wye (railroad)|wye junction]]. The tracks to/from Museum connect to the upper St. George and [[Lower Bay]] stations, while the tracks along Bloor use lower St. George and upper Bay.

The decision by Metro Council in 1960 to build a wye from the University line to the eastbound Bloor line between Museum and Bay stations was a controversial one. TTC Chairman Clarence Downey opposed the construction, estimated to cost about $10 million, saying that $10 million would build an extra mile of subway on the Bloor–Danforth line. The construction was estimated to cost $3 million for the basic interchange, and $7 million for the “intricate trackage system”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Alden |title="$1,000,000 Subway Link May Never be Used" |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=September 6, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From February to September 1966, all three sides of the wye were used in regular service: from each of three terminals—{{ttcs|Eglinton}}, {{ttcs|Keele}}, and {{ttcs|Woodbine}}—trains ran alternately to the other two (between Eglinton and Museum via {{ttcs|Union}}). Thereafter, [[Line 2 Bloor–Danforth]] became a separate route, Lower Bay was closed, and upper St. George became a terminus for the Yonge–University line until it was extended to {{ttcs|Wilson}} in 1978. The tunnel to Lower Bay is visible from northbound trains shortly after they leave Museum Station.

==Architecture and art==
[[File:Museum TTC Old Livery.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Original cream and blue tiles]]
The station opened with the same tile scheme which would become standard on [[Line 2 Bloor–Danforth]], whose first phase was completed three years later in 1966. Smooth, unadorned cream-coloured rectangular tiles were predominant, with a strip of narrower blue tiles near the ceiling. The unique TTC font was used for the station name, sandblasted to the wall and painted in the same shade of blue as the narrower strip of tiles.

Designed by [[Diamond and Schmitt Architects]] and constructed by Jeviso Construction Corporation, renovations to the station's platform level were completed in April 2008 to evoke exhibits in the Royal Ontario Museum. Supporting columns have been remade to resemble the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] [[Egyptian pantheon|deity]] [[Osiris]], as well as [[Tula, Hidalgo|Toltec warriors]], [[Doric order|Doric columns]] found in the [[Parthenon]], China's [[Forbidden City]] columns, and [[First Nations]] house posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=2145 |title=Revitalized Museum Subway Station unveiled |author= |date=April 11, 2008 |work= |publisher=World Architecture News |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This renovation purged Museum Station's original tile scheme from the platform level. Walls were reclad with mauve aluminum plate panels by Ontario Panelization of London, Ontario. They incorporated painted 1/4" fire-rated [[Lexan]] into the panels composing the large "MUSEUM" lettering on the walls with a historical [[hieroglyphic]] inscription from the ROM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontariopanelization.com/ttc-museum-station-renovation |title=TTC Museum Station Renovation |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ontario Panelization |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of Korea''' is the flagship museum of [[Korean history]] and [[Korean art|art]] in [[South Korea]] and is the cultural organization that represents [[Korea]]. Since its establishment in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/play/seouls-best-museums-060516 "Seoul's best museums"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928105016/http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/play/seouls-best-museums-060516 |date=2012-09-28 }} ''CNN Go''. 27 October 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-03&lt;/ref&gt; the museum has been committed to various studies and research activities in the fields of archaeology, history, and art, continuously developing a variety of exhibitions and education programs.

In 2012, it was reported that since its relocation to [[Yongsan District]] in 2005, the museum had attracted an attendance of 20 million visitors, or over 3 million annually which makes it one of the [[List of most visited museums|most visited museums in the world]] and [[Asia]] and the most visited in South Korea.&lt;ref name=ArtnewsApril2014&gt;[http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheArtNewspaper2013_ranking.pdf Visitor Figures 2013: Museum and exhibition attendance numbers compiled and analysed], ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', International Edition, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Museum of Korea Welcomes 20-Millionth Visitor since Its Relocation to Yongsan|url=http://www.museum.go.kr/program/board/detail.jsp?boardTypeID=80&amp;searchSelect=&amp;keyWord=&amp;boardCategory=&amp;currentPage=2&amp;menuID=002006006&amp;finishIsYN=&amp;boardText1=&amp;boardLines=10&amp;boardID=17512&amp;mode=detail&amp;boardnum=121&amp;totalcount=132|access-date=2012-11-08|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218211048/http://www.museum.go.kr/program/board/detail.jsp?boardTypeID=80&amp;searchSelect=&amp;keyWord=&amp;boardCategory=&amp;currentPage=2&amp;menuID=002006006&amp;finishIsYN=&amp;boardText1=&amp;boardLines=10&amp;boardID=17512&amp;mode=detail&amp;boardnum=121&amp;totalcount=132|archive-date=2013-02-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors, conducted by the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] in November 2011, stated that visiting the museum is one of their favorite activities in Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mt.

==History==
[[Image:Korea National Museum of Korea.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Exterior of Museum]]
Emperor [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]] established Korea's first museum, the Imperial Household Museum, in 1909. The collections of the Imperial Household Museum at [[Changgyeonggung]] and the Japanese Government General Museum administered during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule of Korea]] became the nucleus of the National Museum's collection, which was established when South Korea regained independence in 1945.

During the [[Korean War]], the museum's 20,000 pieces were safely moved to [[Busan]] to avoid destruction. When the museum returned to Seoul after the war, it was housed at both Gyeongbokgung and [[Deoksugung]] Palace. In 1972, the museum moved again to a new building on the grounds of the Gyeonbokgung Palace. The museum was moved again in 1986 to the Jungangcheong, the former [[Japanese General Government Building, Seoul|Japanese General Government Building]], where it was housed (with some controversy and criticism) until the building's demolition in 1995. In December 1996, the museum was opened to the public in temporary accommodations in the renovated Social Education Hall, before officially reopening in its grand new building in Yongsan Family Park on October 28, 2005.

In October 2005, the museum opened in a new building in Yongsan Family Park in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. The museum is situated on what used to be a golf course that was part of the [[Yongsan Garrison]], the central command of the United States Forces stationed in Korea.  The US Army returned a part of the land in 1992 to the Korean government, which went on to become the Yongsan Family Park. While the plans for the museum inside the park began in 1993, its opening was delayed repeatedly by a helipad, which was eventually relocated in 2005 by agreement. The museum contains over 310,000 pieces&lt;ref name=museumkr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/program/relic/relicRepresentListEng.jsp?menuID=002005001&amp;langCodeCon=LC2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117190302/http://www.museum.go.kr/program/relic/relicRepresentListEng.jsp?menuID=002005001&amp;langCodeCon=LC2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-17 |title=Director's Message &amp;#124; About the Museum &amp;#124; 국립중앙박물관 |publisher=Museum.go.kr |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in its collection with about 15,000 pieces on display at one time. It displays relics and artifacts throughout six permanent exhibition galleries such as Prehistory and Ancient History Gallery, Medieval and Early Modern History Gallery, Donation Gallery, Calligraphy and Painting Gallery, Asian Art Gallery, and Sculpture and Crafts Gallery. It is the sixth largest museum in the world in terms of floor space, now covering a total of {{convert|295,551|m2|sqft|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/main/publish/view.jsp?menuID=002006003001 |title=Site Map &amp;#124; 국립중앙박물관 |publisher=Museum.go.kr |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220055924/http://www.museum.go.kr/main/publish/view.jsp?menuID=002006003001 |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to protect the artifacts inside the museum, the main building was built to withstand a magnitude 6.0 [[Richter Scale]] earthquake. The [[display case]]s are equipped with shock-absorbent platforms. There is also an imported natural lighting system which utilizes sunlight instead of artificial lights and a specially designed air-conditioning system. The museum is made from fire-resistant materials and has special exhibition halls, education facilities, a children's museum, huge outdoor exhibition areas, restaurants, cafes, and shops.

==Layout==

[[Image:Gate of Special Exhibiton Gallery.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Special Exhibition Hall]]
The museum is divided into three floors. Symbolically, the left of the museum is supposed to represent the past, while the right side of the museum represents the future. The ground floor contains parks; gardens of indigenous plants; waterfalls and pools; and a collection of pagodas, stupas, lanterns, and steles (including [[National Treasures of Korea|National Treasure of Korea]] No. 2, the Great Bell of Bosingak, the exemplar of Korean bells of the Joseon period).

===First floor===
On the first floor is the Prehistory and Ancient History Gallery, which contains approximately 4,500 artifacts from the [[Paleolithic]] to the [[Unified Silla]] era excavated from sites across Korea. The nine exhibition rooms in the gallery are the Palaeolithic Room, the [[Jeulmun Pottery Period|Neolithic]] Room, the [[Mumun Pottery Period|Bronze Age]] &amp; [[Gojoseon]] Room, the [[Proto Three Kingdoms]] Room, the [[Goguryeo]] Room, the [[Baekje]] Room, the [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]] Room, and the [[Silla]] Room. Ranging from chipped stone handaxes to luxurious ancient royal ornaments, the relics displayed here show the long journey taken by early settlers on the Peninsula towards developing their unique culture.

Artifacts from important prehistoric sites and settlements such the [[Bangudae Petroglyphs]] and [[Songgung-ni]] are found in the [[Jeulmun Pottery Period|Neolithic]] and [[Mumun Pottery Period|Bronze Age]] Rooms.

Also on the first floor is the Medieval and Early Modern History Gallery, which showcases the cultural and historical heritage throughout the Unified Silla, Balhae, Goryeo, and Joseon periods. The eight rooms of the gallery include the [[Unified Silla]] Room, [[Balhae]] Room, [[Goryeo]] Room, and the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] Room.

===Second floor===
The second floor contains the Donation Gallery and the Calligraphy and Painting Gallery, which contains 890 pieces of art that showcase the traditional and religious arts of Korea in line and color. The Calligraphy and Painting Gallery is divided into four rooms: the Painting Room, the [[Calligraphy#Eastern Asian calligraphy|Calligraphy]] Room, the Buddhist Paintings Room, and the Sarangbang (Scholar's Studio).

The Donation Gallery holds 800 pieces of art donated from the private collections of collectors. The gallery is divided into eleven rooms: the Lee Hong-kun Collection Room, the [[Kim Chong-hak]] Collection Room, the Yu Kang-yul Collection Room, the Park Young-sook Collection Room, the Choi Young-do Collection Room, the Park Byong-rae Collection Room, the Yoo Chang-jong Collection Room, the Kaneko Kazushige Collection Room, the Hachiuma Tadasu Collection Room, the Iuchi Isao Collection Room, and the Other Collection Room.

===Third floor===
The third floor contains the Sculpture and Crafts Gallery, with 630 pieces that represent Korean Buddhist sculpture and craftwork. Highlights of the gallery include Goryeo [[Celadon]] wares and [[National treasures of Korea|National Treasure of Korea]] No. 83, [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]] (or Pensive Bodhisattva). The five rooms of the gallery are the Metal Arts Room, the Celadon Room, the [[Buncheong]] Ware Room, the [[Joseon white porcelain|White Porcelain]] Room, and the Buddhist Sculpture Room.

Also on the third floor is the Asian Arts Gallery, which contains 970 pieces that explore the similarities and divergences of Asian art and the confluence of Asian and Western art via the [[Silk Road]]. The five rooms are the Indian &amp; Southeast Asian Art Room, the Central Asian Art Room, the Chinese Art Room, the [[Sinan, Jeollanam-do|Sinan]] Undersea Relics Room, and the Japanese Art Room.

==Collection==

===Gold Crown, National Treasure of Korea No. 191===
[[File:Korea-Silla kingdom-Gold crown from Hwangnam Daechong-No.191-01C.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Silla]] Golden Crown]]
The Fifth-century Silla gold crown was excavated from the North tomb of Hwangnamdaechong in Gyeongju. More ornaments, including a silver belt ornament inscribed (보인대)'Buindae ("Madame's belt"), were found in the North tomb than in the South tomb, suggesting that the North tomb is a woman's. The gold crown reflects the owner's political and social class.

===Pensive Bodhisattva, or [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation, National Treasure No. 83)]]===
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Pensive Bodhisattva]]
This Bodhisattva, from the early Seventh-century, sits with one leg over the other, lost in thought with fingers on its cheeks. The pose is derived from that of the Buddha contemplating the life of human beings. This statue wears a flat crown called the 'Three Mountain Crown' or 'Lotus Crown.' The torso is naked, adorned by a simple necklace. There are remarkable similarities with the wooden Pensive Bodhisattva at the Koryuji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, which is believed to have been founded by a Silla monk. It is likely, then, that this statue was created in Silla. The well-balanced shape, however, and elegant and refined craftsmanship is typical of the Baekje period.

===Incense Burner, Celadon with Openwork, National Treasure of Korea No. 95===
[[File:Korea - Seoul - National Museum - Incense Burner 0252-06a edit.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Celadon [[Openwork]] Incense Burner]]
This Twelfth-century incense burner represents some of the best quality Goryeo [[celadon]]. It is composed of a cover (with a central hole for releasing incense), a burner, and a support. Above the hole for incense is a curved knob with a Seven Treasure design incised to aid the release of scent.

===Ten-Story Pagoda from Gyeongcheonsa Temple, National Treasure of Korea No. 86===
[[File:Korea-Seoul-National Museum Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda 0187&amp;8-06.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ten-Story Pagoda]]
The "[[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda|Gyeongcheonsa Ten-Story Pagoda]]" (경천사 십층석탑, 敬天寺十層石塔) was originally erected at the monastery Gyeongcheonsa in the fourth year (1348) of King Chungmok of Goryeo. In 1907, it was illegally smuggled to Japan by a Japanese court official, but was returned in 1918 at the behest of British and American journalists, E. Bethell and H. Hulbert. In 1960, it was restored to Gyoengbokgung Palace, but proved difficult to conserve because of acid rain and weathering. So, it was dismantled again in 1995, to be housed inside in the National Museum of Korea's 'Path to History' when the museum reopened in 2005.

===Album of Genre Painting by Danwon, Treasure of Korea No. 527===
[[File:Danwon-Mudong.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Dancing Boy'' by [[Danwon]].]]
The Eighteenth-century painter Kim Hong-do, also known as [[Danwon]], is known for his humorous and candid paintings of the lives of common people. This album consists of twenty-five paintings, each focusing on figures without background features. Kim's paintings appear sketchy, yet show expressive brush strokes and balanced composition. It is presumed that this style arose in Kim's late 30s, the album being completed when he was about 40 years old.

===The Oegyujanggak Uigwe===
Gyujanggak was a royal library established on the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace in the capital by order of King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of the Joseon, in 1776. Over time, the library also developed into a state-sponsored research institution. In 1782, a royal library annex called Oegyujanggak was established on Gangwha Island to preserve important documents related to the royal family more systematically and securely than possible in the capital. Oegyujanggak housed copies of writings, calligraphy, and drawings by former kings as well as the royal genealogies, uigwe, and other such items. As such it was a repository of royal family culture. It includes records of the preparations for state-sponsored events and ceremonies involving key members of the Joseon royal family. The text explains every process in detail and is supported by illustrations elaborately drawn by hand. These served as references for later generations organizing similar ceremonies or events. The Uigwe began to be produced in the 15th century, during early Joseon, and the practice continued to the end of the kingdom in the early 20th century. They preserve core elements of Confucian culture, which revered ritual and propriety. These works also show the governing philosophy and systems by which the Joseon state was run. Their historical and cultural value has been recognized globally, as the “Royal Protocols of Joseon Dynasty”* were inscribed into the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2007.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/program/ebook/ebookList.jsp?menuID=002006009005&amp;ebookTypeID=6 |title=Site Map &amp;#124; 국립중앙박물관 |publisher=Museum.go.kr |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328080021/http://www.museum.go.kr/program/ebook/ebookList.jsp?menuID=002006009005&amp;ebookTypeID=6 |archive-date=2014-03-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two hundred and ninety-seven volumes of the Protocols that were looted in 1866 during the [[French campaign against Korea (1866)|French campaign against Korea]] were kept at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. They were repatriated in April and June 2011 in four separate installments.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Claire [http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110612000269 "Ancient Korean royal books welcomed back home"] ''Korea Herald''. 6 December 2011.

The '''Navigational Aids for the History of Science, Technology, and the Environment Project''' (NAHSTE) was  a research archives/manuscripts cataloguing project based at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Following a proposal led by [[Arnott Wilson]] in 1999,&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite web |first=Arnott |last=Wilson |url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/ncuacs/FP_Wilson.htm |title=A NAHSTE Experience: Edinburgh’s History of Science, Technology and the Environment Project |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713183532/http://www.bath.ac.uk/ncuacs/FP_Wilson.htm |archivedate=13 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the project received £261,755 funding from the [[Research Support Libraries Programme]] (RSLP) from 2000 until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ian| last=Mowatt| editor-first=Nick|editor-last=Stroud| url=http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/bits/2002/2002-09-september.pdf |format=PDF |title=New Horizons |date=September 2002 |publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]] |journal=Edinburgh Bits - Bulletin of C&amp;IT Services |volume=13 |issue=1 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rslp.ac.uk/projects/research/26.htm |title=RSLP Projects : Navigational Aids for the History of Science, Technology and the Environment (NAHSTE) |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613033845/http://www.rslp.ac.uk/projects/research/26.htm |archivedate=13 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was designed to access a variety of outstanding collections of archives and manuscripts held at the three partner Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); the University of Edinburgh, [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]] and to make them accessible on the [[Internet]]. The project additionally included linkages to related records held by non-HEI collaborators.&lt;ref name=NahNP&gt;{{cite web |title=NAHSTE Project 2002 |publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]] |url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk |accessdate=3 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001175740/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/ |archivedate=1 October 2006 |df= }} NAHSTE-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptions of the material conform to [[ISAD(G)|ISAD(G) (Second edition)]], whilst information about key individuals conform to [[ISAAR(CPF)]]. Catalogues were tagged using the [[Encoded Archival Description]] [[XML]] standard.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;

Although the project was completed in 2002, the resulting web service continues to be hosted at Edinburgh.

* ''Through the Ice'' (1989) with Robert Kornwise posthumously—Kornwise was a high school student who had died. His friends sent his unfinished manuscript and a plea to Piers Anthony to help their deceased friend get published.

* ''[[Tatham Mound]]'' (1991)
* ''The Caterpillar's Question'' (1992) with [[Philip José Farmer]]—This collaboration was actually the result of another proposed collaborative project. The original idea proposed by an editor was to have a book where each chapter was written by a different author.

* ''The Secret of Spring'' (2000) with Jo Anne Taeusch
* ''The Gutbucket Quest'' (2000) with Ron Leming
* ''Starkweather: Immortal 0'' (2007) with [[David A. Rodriguez]]—This collaboration is a different one for Piers Anthony. He crafted an original short story based on the character Cartaphilus from the creator-owned ''[[Starkweather (comics)|Starkweather]]'' comic book series by David A. Rodriguez. This short story was then adapted into a comic book script and painted by fantasy artist [[Patrick McEvoy]] and published by [[Archaia Studios]], making ''Starkweather: Immortal'' issue 0, Piers Anthony's first true comic book work.

==Etymology==
Douglas Harper states that the etymological origins of ''Puranas'' are from Sanskrit ''Puranah'', literally "ancient, former," from ''pura'' "formerly, before," cognate with Greek ''paros'' "before," ''pro'' "before," Avestan ''paro'' "before," Old English fore, from proto-Indo-European ''*pre-'', from root ''*per-''."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Harper (2015), [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Purana Purana], Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Hinduism}}
[[Vyasa]], the narrator of the [[Mahabharata]], is hagiographically credited as the compiler of the Puranas. The ancient tradition suggests that originally there was but one Purana. Vishnu Purana (3.6.15) mentions that Vyasa entrusted his ''Puranasamhita'' to his disciple ''Lomaharshana'', who in turn imparted it to his disciples,{{refn|group=note| Six disciples: Sumati, Agnivarchaha, Mitrayu, Shamshapyana, Akritaverna and Savarni}} three of whom compiled their own samhitas. These three, together with Lomaharshana's, comprise the ''Mulasamhita'', from which the later eighteen Puranas were derived.&lt;ref name="Rocher1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludo Rocher|title=The Purāṇas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0-4RJh5FgoC|year=1986|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02522-5|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coburn1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Coburn|title=Devī-Māhātmya: The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hy9kf7_TOHgC&amp;pg=PA27|year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0557-6|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Purana'' appears in the Vedic texts. For example, Atharva Veda mentions ''Purana'' (in the singular) in XI.7.24 and XV.6.10-11 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/HistoryOfDharmasastraancientAndMediaevalReligiousAndCivilLawV.5.2|title=History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India), Vol.5.2, 1st edition, 1962|last=P.

"He changed his place and went over to great direction, and Itihasa and Purana, gathas, verses in praise of heroes followed in going over."|sign=[[Atharva Veda]]|source=&lt;ref name="Kane 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kane | first=P.

Similarly, the Shatapatha Brahmana  (XI.5.6.8) mentions ''Itihasapuranam'' (as one compound word) and recommends that on the 9th day of ''Pariplava,'' the ''hotr'' priest should narrate some Purana because "the ''Purana'' is the Veda, this it is" (XIII.4.3.13). However, states P.V. Kane, it is not certain whether these texts suggested several works or single work with the term ''Purana''.&lt;ref name="kane816"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/HistoryOfDharmasastraancientAndMediaevalReligiousAndCivilLawV.5.2|title=History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India), Vol.5.2, 1st edition, 1962|last=P. V. Kane|first=|publisher=Bhandarkar Oriental Research Insitute|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=816-817|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Vedic text ''Taittiriya Aranyaka'' (II.10) uses the term in the plural. Therefore, states Kane, that in the later Vedic period at least, the Puranas referred to three or more texts, and that they were studied and recited &lt;ref name="kane816" /&gt; In numerous passages the Mahabharata mentions '''Purana''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' in both singular and plural forms. Moreover, it is not unlikely that, where the singular '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Puranam''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' was employed in the texts, a class of works was meant.&lt;ref name="kane816" /&gt; Further, despite the mention of the term Purana or Puranas in the Vedic texts, there is uncertainty about the contents of them until the composition of the oldest Dharmashastra [[Apastamba Dharmasutra|''Apastamba Dharmasutra'']] and [[Gautama Dharmasutra|''Gautama Dharmasutra'']], that mention Puranas resembling with the extant Puranas.&lt;ref name="kane816" /&gt;



Another early mention of the term 'Itihas-purana' is found in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (7.1.2), translated by [[Patrick Olivelle]] as "the corpus of histories and ancient tales as the fifth Veda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=The Early Upanishads: Annotated Text and Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lsp18ZvstrcC |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535242-9|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Colburn (2002), Devī-māhātmya: The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805576}}, page 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The early [[Buddhist]] text ([[Sutta Nipata]] 3.7 describes the meeting between the Buddha and Sela. It has been translated by Mills and Sujato as, "(...) the brahmin Sela was visiting Āpaṇa. He was an expert in the three Vedas, with the etymologies, the rituals, the phonology and word analysis, and fifthly the legendary histories".&lt;ref&gt;[https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7/en/mills-sujato Sutta Nipata 3.7], To Sela and his Praise of the Buddha, Laurence Mills and Bhikkhu Sujato&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Brhadaranyaka Upanishad]] also refers to purana as the "fifth Veda",&lt;ref&gt;[[Brhadaranyaka Upanisad]] 2.4.10, 4.1.2, 4.5.11. Satapatha Brahmana (SBE, Vol. 44, pp. 98, 369). {{Harvnb|Moghe|1997|pp=160,249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Coburn, Puranas and early extra-puranic texts attest to two traditions regarding their origin, one proclaiming a divine origin as the breath of the Great Being, the other as a human named [[Vyasa]] as the arranger of already existing material into eighteen Puranas. In the early references, states Coburn, the term Purana occurs in singular unlike the later era which refers to a plural form presumably because they had assumed their "multifarious form". While both these traditions disagree on the origins of the Puranas, they affirm that extant Puranas are not identical with the original Purana.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Coburn (2002), Devī-māhātmya: The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805576}}, page 23-27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Indologists [[J. A. B. van Buitenen]] and  Cornelia Dimmitt, the Puranas that have survived into the modern era are ancient but represent "an amalgam of two somewhat different but never entirely different separate oral literatures: the Brahmin tradition stemming from the reciters of the Vedas, and the bardic poetry recited by Sutas that was handed down in Kshatriya circles".{{Sfn|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|2012|p=7}} The original Puranas comes from the priestly roots while the later genealogies have the warrior and epic roots. These texts were collected for the "second time between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D. under the rule of the Gupta kings", a period of Hindu renaissance.{{Sfn|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|2012|pp=7-8, context: 4-13}} However, the editing and expansion of the Puranas did not stop after the Gupta era, and the texts continued to "grow for another five hundred or a thousand years" and these were preserved by priests who maintained Hindu pilgrimage sites and temples.{{Sfn|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|2012|pp=7-8, context: 4-13}} The core of Itihasa-Puranas, states Klaus Klostermaier, may possibly go back to the seventh century BCE or even earlier.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=75FFAgAAQBAJ|date=5 July 2007|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7082-4|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible to set a specific date for any Purana as a whole, states [[Ludo Rocher]]. He points out that even
for the better established and more coherent puranas such as Bhagavata and Vishnu, the dates proposed by scholars continue to vary widely and endlessly.&lt;ref name="Rocher1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludo Rocher|title=The Purāṇas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0-4RJh5FgoC|year=1986|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02522-5|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of the production of the written texts does not define the date of origin of the Puranas.&lt;ref name = Johnson247&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|2009|p = 247}}&lt;/ref&gt; They existed in an oral form before being written down.&lt;ref name = Johnson247/&gt; In the 19th century, [[F. E. Pargiter]] believed the "original Purana" may date to the time of the final redaction of the Vedas.{{Sfn|Pargiter|1962|pp=30–54}} [[Wendy Doniger]], based on her study of indologists, assigns approximate dates to the various Puranas. She dates [[Markandeya Purana]] to c. 250 CE (with one portion dated to c. 550 CE), [[Matsya Purana]] to c. 250–500 CE, [[Vayu Purana]] to c. 350 CE, [[Harivamsa]] and [[Vishnu Purana]] to c. 450 CE, [[Brahmanda Purana]] to c. 350–950 CE, [[Vamana Purana]] to c. 450–900 CE, [[Kurma Purana]] to c. 550–850 CE, and [[Linga Purana]] to c. 600–1000 CE.&lt;ref name=collins36&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Charles Dillard|title=The Iconography and Ritual of Śiva at Elephanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C&amp;pg=PA36|year=1988|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-773-0|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All major Puranas contain sections on [[Devi]] (goddesses) and [[Tantra]], but of these the six most significant ones are: [[Markandeya Purana]], [[Shiva Purana]], [[Linga Purana]], [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]], [[Agni Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 113-114, 153-154, 161, 167-169, 171-174, 182-187, 190-194, 210, 225-227, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upapuranas===
[[File:Ashta-Matrika.jpg|thumb|300px|The Goddess [[Durga]] Leading the Eight [[Matrikas]] in Battle Against the Demon [[Raktabija]], Folio from [[Devi Mahatmya]]m, Markandeya Purana.]]
{{main|Upapurana}}
The difference between Upapuranas and Mahapuranas has been explained by Rajendra Hazra as, "a Mahapurana is well known, and that what is less well known becomes an Upapurana".&lt;ref name="Ludo Rocher 1986 page 63"&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, page 63&lt;/ref&gt; Rocher states that the distinction between Mahapurana and Upapurana is ahistorical, there is little corroborating evidence that either were more or less known, and that "the term Mahapurana occurs rarely in Purana literature, and is probably of late origin."&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Upapuranas'' are eighteen in number, with disagreement as to which canonical titles belong in that list of eighteen. They include among many: Sanat-kumara, [[Narasimha Purana|Narasimha]], Brihan-naradiya, Siva-rahasya, Durvasa, [[Kapila Purana|Kapila]], Vamana, Bhargava, Varuna, [[Kalika Purana|Kalika]], [[Samba Purana|Samba]], Nandi, Surya, Parasara, Vasishtha, Devi-Bhagavata, [[Ganesha Purana|Ganesha]], [[Mudgala Purana|Mudgala]], and Hamsa, with only a few having been critically edited.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Hazra, ''Studies in the Upapuranas, vol. I'', Calcutta, Sanskrit College, 1958. ''Studies in the Upapuranas, vol. II'', Calcutta, Sanskrit College, 1979. ''Studies in Puranic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs'', Delhi, Banarsidass, 1975.

Sankaranarayana in {{Harvnb|Kaushal|2001|pp=225–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ganesha and Mudgala Puranas are devoted to [[Ganesha]].&lt;ref name=Thapan&gt;{{Harvnb|Thapan|1997|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gurjari.net/ico/Mystica/html/purana.htm|title=Purana at Gurjari|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]], which extols the goddess [[Durga]], has become (along with the Devi Mahatmya of the Markandeya Purana) a basic text for [[Devi]] worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackenzie|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sthala Puranas===
This corpus of texts tells of the origins and traditions of particular Tamil Shiva temples or shrines. There are numerous Sthala Puranas, most written in [[vernacular]]s, some with Sanskrit versions as well. The 275 Shiva Sthalams of the continent have puranas for each, famously glorified in the [[Tamil literature]] ''[[Tevaram]].'' Some appear in Sanskrit versions in the Mahapuranas or Upapuranas. Some Tamil Sthala Puranas have been researched by [[David Dean Shulman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shulman|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skanda Purana===
The Skanda Purana is the largest Purana with 81,000 verses,&lt;ref name=stephenknapp44&gt;Stephen Knapp (2005), The Heart of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0595350759}}, pages 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; named after deity [[Kartikeya|Skanda]], the son of Shiva and Uma, and brother of deity Ganesha.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy and Wendy Doniger (1993), Asian Mythologies, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226064567}}, pages 92-95&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological part of the text weaves the stories of Shiva and Vishnu, along with Parvati, Rama, Krishna and other major gods in Hindu pantheon.&lt;ref name=stephenknapp44/&gt; In Chapter 1.8, it declares,

{{Quote| 
Vishnu is nobody but Shiva, and he who is called Shiva is but identical with Vishnu. 
|Skanda Purana |1.8.20-21&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Maehle (2009), Ashtanga Yoga, New World, {{ISBN|978-1577316695}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/SriSkandaPuranam-SankaraSamhitaPart1#page/n31/mode/2up Skanda Purana] Shankara Samhita Part 1, Verses 1.8.20-21 (Sanskrit)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Skanda Purana has received renewed scholarly interest ever since the late 20th-century discovery of a [[Nepal]]ese Skanda Purana manuscript dated to be from the early 9th century. This discovery established that Skanda Purana existed by the 9th century. However, a comparison shows that the 9th-century document is entirely different than versions of Skanda Purana that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.&lt;ref name="R Andriaensen 1994 pages 325-331"&gt;R Andriaensen et al (1994), Towards a critical edition of the Skandapurana, Indo-Iranian Journal, Vol. 37, pages 325-331&lt;/ref&gt;

It starts with introduction, a future devotee is described as ignorant about the god yet curious, the devotee learns about the god and this begins the spiritual realization, the text then describes instances of god's grace which begins to persuade and convert the devotee, the devotee then shows devotion which is rewarded by the god, the reward is appreciated by the devotee and in return performs actions to express further devotion.&lt;ref name=gregbailey440&gt;Greg Bailey (2001), Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415172813}}, pages 440-443&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puranas, states Flood, document the rise of the theistic traditions such as those based on Vishnu, Shiva and the goddess Devi and include respective mythology, pilgrimage to holy places, rituals and genealogies.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp = 104-110 }} The bulk of these texts in Flood's view were established by 500 CE, in the Gupta era though amendments were made later. Along with inconsistencies, common ideas are found throughout the corpus but it is not possible to trace the lines of influence of one Purana upon another so the corpus is best viewed as a synchronous whole.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp = 109-112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of similar myths woven across the Puranas, but in different versions, include the ''lingabhava'' – the "apparition of the [[linga]]". The story features Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, the three major deities of Hinduism, who get together, debate, and after various versions of the story, in the end the glory of Shiva is established by the apparition of linga. This myth, state Bonnefoy and Doniger, appears in Vayu Purana 1.55, Brahmanda Purana 1.26, Shiva Purana's Rudra Samhita Sristi Khanda 15, Skanda Purana's chapters 1.3, 1.16 and 3.1, and other Puranas.&lt;ref name=yveswendy38&gt;Yves Bonnefoy and Wendy Doniger (1993), Asian Mythologies, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226064567}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts are in Sanskrit as well as regional languages,&lt;ref name=johncort185/&gt;&lt;ref name=gregorybailey/&gt; and almost entirely in narrative metric couplets.&lt;ref name=merriam/&gt;

===Symbolism and layers of meaning===
The texts use ideas, concepts and even names that are symbolic.&lt;ref name=yveswendy38/&gt; The words can interpreted literally, and at an [[axiology|axiological]] level.&lt;ref&gt;Ravi Gupta and Kenneth Valpey (2013), The Bhagavata Purana: Sacred Text and Living Tradition, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149983}}, pages 130-132&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vishnu Purana]], for example, recites a myth where the names of the characters are loaded with symbolism and axiological significance. The myth is as follows,

{{Quote|
The progeny of [[Dharma]] by the daughters of Daksha were as follows: by Sraddhá (devotion) he had [[Kama]] (desire); by Lakshmí (wealth, prosperity), was born Darpa (pride); by Dhriti (courage), the progeny was [[Niyama]] (precept); by Tusht́i (inner comfort), [[Santosha]] (contentment); by Pusht́i (opulence), the progeny was Lobha (cupidity, greed); by Medhá (wisdom, experience), Sruta (sacred tradition); by Kriyá (hard work, labour), the progeny were Dańd́a, Naya, and Vinaya (justice, politics, and education); by Buddhi (intellect), Bodha (understanding); by Lajjá (shame, humility), Vinaya (good behaviour); by Vapu (body, strength), Vyavasaya (perseverance). Shanti (peace) gave birth to [[Forgiveness#Hinduism|Kshama]] (forgiveness); Siddhi (excellence) to Sukha (enjoyment); and Kírtti (glorious speech) gave birth to Yasha (reputation). These were the sons of Dharma; one of whom, Kama (love, emotional fulfillment) had baby Hersha (joy) by his wife Nandi (delight).

The wife of Adharma (vice, wrong, evil) was Hinsá (violence), on whom he begot a son Anrita (falsehood), and a daughter Nikriti (immorality): they intermarried, and had two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Naraka (hell); and twins to them, two daughters, Máyá (deceit) and Vedaná (torture), who became their wives. The son of Bhaya (fear) and Máyá (deceit) was the destroyer of living creatures, or Mrityu (death); and Dukha (pain) was the offspring of Naraka (hell) and Vedaná (torture). The children of Mrityu were Vyádhi (disease), Jará (decay), Soka (sorrow), Trishńa (greediness), and Krodha (wrath). These are all called the inflictors of misery, and are characterised as the progeny of Vice (Adharma). They are all without wives, without posterity, without the faculty to procreate; they perpetually operate as causes of the destruction of this world. On the contrary, Daksha and the other Rishis, the elders of mankind, tend perpetually to influence its renovation: whilst the Manus and their sons, the heroes endowed with mighty power, and treading in the path of truth, as constantly contribute to its preservation.

===Puranas as a complement to the Vedas===
[[File:Krishna and the Gopis (herdsmaids).jpg|thumb|The mythology in the Puranas has inspired many [[relief]]s and sculptures found in [[Hindu temple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Schastok (1997), The Śāmalājī Sculptures and 6th Century Art in Western India, BRILL, {{ISBN|978-9004069411}}, pages 77-79, 88&lt;/ref&gt; The legend behind the Krishna and Gopis relief above is described in the Bhagavata Purana.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna : A Sourcebook: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, pages 111-119&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The relation of the Puranas with Vedas has been debated by scholars, some holding that there's no relationship, others contending that they are identical.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, Laurie L.(1994), Authority, Anxiety, and Canon: Essays in Vedic Interpretation SUNY Series in Hindu Studies, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0585044675}}, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The Puranic literature, stated [[Max Muller]], is independent, has changed often over its history, and has little relation to the Vedic age or the Vedic literature.&lt;ref name=ludorocher13&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 13-16&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Purana literature is evidently intended to serve as a complement to the Vedas, states Vans Kennedy.&lt;ref name="ludorocher" /&gt; 

Some scholars such as Govinda Das suggest that the Puranas claim a link to the Vedas but in name only, not in substance. The link is purely a mechanical one.&lt;ref name=ludorocher13/&gt; Scholars such as Viman Chandra Bhattacharya and PV Kane state that the Puranas are a continuation and development of the Vedas.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=14-15 with footnotes}} Sudhakar Malaviya and VG Rahurkar state the connection is closer in that the Puranas are companion texts to help understand and interpret the Vedas.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=14-15 with footnotes}}&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (1995), Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791416402}}, pages 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; K.S.

The Puranas, states Kees Bolle, are best seen as "vast, often encyclopedic" works from ancient and medieval India.&lt;ref&gt;Kee Bolle (1963), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062068 Reflections on a Puranic Passage], History of Religions, Vol. 2, No. 2 (Winter, 1963), pages 286-291&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, such as the Agni Purana and Matsya Purana, cover all sorts of subjects, dealing with – states Rocher – "anything and everything", from fiction to facts, from practical recipes to abstract philosophy, from geographic ''Mahatmyas'' (travel guides){{Sfn|Ariel Glucklich|2008|p=146, '''Quote:''' The earliest promotional works aimed at tourists from that era were called ''mahatmyas''}} to cosmetics, from festivals to astronomy.&lt;ref name=gregorybailey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 1-5, 12-21, 79-80, 96-98; Quote: '''These are the true encyclopedic Puranas. in which detached chapters or sections, dealing with any imaginable subject, follow one another, without connection or transition.

The colonial era scholars of Puranas studied them primarily as religious texts, with Vans Kennedy declaring in 1837, that any other use of these documents would be disappointing.&lt;ref name=ludorocher104/&gt; [[John Zephaniah Holwell]], who from 1732 onwards spent 30 years in India and was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1767, described the Puranas as "18 books of divine words".&lt;ref name=ursapp/&gt; British officials and researchers such as Holwell, states Urs App, were [[orientalism|orientalist]] scholars who introduced a distorted picture of Indian literature and Puranas as "sacred scriptures of India" in 1767. Holwell, states Urs App, "presented it as the opinion of knowledgeable Indians; But it is abundantly clear that no knowledgeable Indian would ever have said anything remotely similar".&lt;ref name=ursapp&gt;Urs App (2010), The Birth of Orientalism, University of Pennsylvania Press, {{ISBN|978-0812242614}}, pages 331, 323-334&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship doubts this 19th-century premise.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1975), Selected Studies: Indo-European linguistics, BRILL, {{ISBN|978-9004042285}}, pages 51-86&lt;/ref&gt; Ludo Rocher, for example, states,

{{Quote|
I want to stress the fact that it would be irresponsible and highly misleading to speak of or pretend to describe the religion of the Puranas.
|[[Ludo Rocher]]|The Puranas&lt;ref name=ludorocher104&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 104-106 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The study of Puranas as a religious text remains a controversial subject.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Inden (2000), Querying the Medieval : Texts and the History of Practices in South Asia, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124309}}, pages 87-98&lt;/ref&gt; Some Indologists, in colonial tradition of scholarship, treat the Puranic texts as scriptures or useful source of religious contents.&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Ronald Inden, consider this approach "essentialist and antihistorical" because the Purana texts changed often over time and over distance, and the underlying presumption of they being religious texts is that those changes are "Hinduism expressed by a religious leader or philosopher", or "expressiveness of Hindu mind", or "society at large", when the texts and passages are literary works and "individual geniuses of their authors".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Inden (2000), Querying the Medieval : Texts and the History of Practices in South Asia, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124309}}, pages 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jainism====

The Jaina Puranas are like Hindu Puranas encyclopedic epics in style, and are considered as ''anuyogas'' (expositions), but they are not considered [[Jain Agamas]] and do not have scripture or quasi-canonical status in Jainism tradition.&lt;ref name=johncort185/&gt; They are best described, states John Cort, as post-scripture literary corpus based upon themes found in Jain scriptures.&lt;ref name=johncort185/&gt;

====Sectarian, pluralistic or monotheistic theme====
Scholars have debated whether the Puranas should be categorized as sectarian, or non-partisan, or monotheistic religious texts.&lt;ref name=ludorochersect/&gt;&lt;ref name=bryant11/&gt; Different Puranas describe a number of stories where Brahma, VIshnu and Shiva compete for supremacy.&lt;ref name=bryant11/&gt; In some Puranas, such as [[Devi Bhagavata]], the Goddess Devi joins the competition and ascends for the position of being Supreme. Further, most Puranas emphasize legends around one who is either Shiva, or Vishnu, or Devi.&lt;ref name=ludorochersect/&gt; The texts thus appear to be sectarian. However, states Edwin Bryant, while these legends sometimes appear to be partisan, they are merely acknowledging the obvious question of whether one or the other is more important, more powerful. In the final analysis, all Puranas weave their legends to celebrate pluralism, and accept the other two and all gods in Hindu pantheon as personalized form but equivalent essence of the Ultimate Reality called [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;EO James (1997), The Tree of Life, BRILL Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004016125}}, pages 150-153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2015), Bhakti and Embodiment, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415670708}}, pages 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; The Puranas are not spiritually partisan, states Bryant, but "accept and indeed extol the transcendent and absolute nature of the other, and of the Goddess Devi too".&lt;ref name=bryant11&gt;Edwin Bryant (2003), Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0141913377}}, pages 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
[The Puranic text] merely affirm that the other deity is to be considered a derivative manifestation of their respective deity, or in the case of Devi, the ''Shakti'', or power of the male divinity. The term monotheism, if applied to the Puranic tradition, needs to be understood in the context of a supreme being, whether understood as Vishnu, Shiva or Devi, who can manifest himself or herself as other supreme beings.
|Edwin Bryant|Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana&lt;ref name=bryant11/&gt;}}

Ludo Rocher, in his review of Puranas as sectarian texts, states, "even though the Puranas contain sectarian materials, their sectarianism should not be interpreted as exclusivism in favor of one god to the detriment of all others".&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, page 23 with footnote 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puranas as historical texts===
Despite the diversity and wealth of manuscripts from ancient and medieval India that have survived into the modern times, there is a paucity of historical data in them.&lt;ref name=ludorocher115&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 115-121 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the author name nor the year of their composition were recorded or preserved, over the centuries, as the documents were copied from one generation to another. This paucity tempted 19th-century scholars to use the Puranas as a source of chronological and historical information about India or Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ludorocher115/&gt; This effort was, after some effort, either summarily rejected by some scholars, or become controversial, because the Puranas include fables and fiction, and the information within and across the Puranas was found to be inconsistent.&lt;ref name=ludorocher115/&gt;

In early 20th-century, some regional records were found to be more consistent, such as for the Hindu dynasties in [[Telangana]], Andhra Pradesh. Basham, as well as Kosambi have questioned whether lack of inconsistency is sufficient proof of reliability and [[historicity]].&lt;ref name=ludorocher115/&gt; More recent scholarship has attempted to, with limited success, states Ludo Rocher, use the Puranas for historical information in combination with independent corroborating evidence, such as "epigraphy, archaeology, Buddhist literature, Jaina literature, non-Puranic literature, Islamic records, and records preserved outside India by travelers to or from India in medieval times such as in China, Myanmar and Indonesia".&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 121-127 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L Srinivasan (2000), [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1567807 Historicity of the Indian mythology : Some observations], Man in India, Vol. 80, No. 1-2, pages 89-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
[[File:Devimahatmya Sanskrit MS Nepal 11c.jpg|thumb|300px|An 11th-century Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript in Sanskrit of Devimahatmya (Markandeya Purana).]]
The study of Puranas manuscripts has been challenging because they are highly inconsistent.&lt;ref name=ludorocher59m&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 59-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bailey (2003), The Study of Hinduism (Editor: Arvind Sharma), The University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|978-1570034497}}, pages 141-142&lt;/ref&gt; This is true for all Mahapuranas and Upapuranas.&lt;ref name=ludorocher59m/&gt; Most editions of Puranas, in use particularly by Western scholars, are "based on one manuscript or on a few manuscripts selected at random", even though divergent manuscripts with the same title exist. Scholars have long acknowledged the existence of Purana manuscripts that "seem to differ much from printed edition", and it is unclear which one is accurate, and whether conclusions drawn from the randomly or cherrypicked printed version were universal over geography or time.&lt;ref name=ludorocher59m/&gt; This problem is most severe with Purana manuscripts of the same title, but in regional languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and others which have largely been ignored.&lt;ref name=ludorocher59m/&gt;

{{Quote|
Modern scholarship noticed all these facts. It recognized that the extent of the genuine Agni Purana was not the same at all times and in all places, and that it varied with the difference in time and locality. (...) This shows that the text of the Devi Purana was not the same everywhere but differed considerably in different provinces. Yet, one failed to draw the logical conclusion: besides the version or versions of puranas that appear in our [surviving] manuscripts, and fewer still in our [printed] editions, there have been numerous other versions, under the same titles, but which either have remained unnoticed or have been irreparably lost.
|Ludo Rocher|The Puranas&lt;ref name="Ludo Rocher 1986 page 63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajendra Hazra (1956), Discovery of the genuine Agneya-purana, Journal of the Oriental Institute Baroda, Vol. 4-5, pages 411-416&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Chronology===
Newly discovered Puranas manuscripts from the medieval centuries has attracted scholarly attention and the conclusion that the Puranic literature has gone through slow redaction and text corruption over time, as well as sudden deletion of numerous chapters and its replacement with new content to an extent that the currently circulating Puranas are entirely different than those that existed before 11th century, or 16th century.&lt;ref name=dominicifixvii/&gt;

For example, a newly discovered palm-leaf manuscript of Skanda Purana in [[Nepal]] has been dated to be from 810 CE, but is entirely different than versions of Skanda Purana that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.&lt;ref name="R Andriaensen 1994 pages 325-331"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dominicifixvii&gt;Dominic Goodall (2009), Parākhyatantram, Vol 98, Publications de l'Institut Français d'Indologie, {{ISBN|978-2855396422}}, pages xvi-xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Further discoveries of four more manuscripts, each different, suggest that document has gone through major redactions twice, first likely before the 12th century, and the second very large change sometime in the 15th-16th century for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name=kengoharimoto/&gt; The different versions of manuscripts of Skanda Purana suggest that "minor" redactions, interpolations and corruption of the ideas in the text over time.&lt;ref name=kengoharimoto&gt;Kengo Harimoto (2004), in Origin and Growth of the Purāṇic Text Corpus (Editor: Hans Bakker), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820494}}, pages 41-64&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocher states that the compositions date of each Purana remains a contested issue.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=249}}{{Sfn|Gregory Bailey|2003|pp=139-141, 154-156}} Dimmitt and van Buitenen state that each of the Puranas manuscripts is encyclopedic in style, and it is difficult to ascertain when, where, why and by whom these were written:{{Sfn|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|2012|p=5}}

{{Quote|
As they exist today, the Puranas are a stratified literature. Each titled work consists of material that has grown by numerous accretions in successive historical eras. Thus no Purana has a single date of composition. (...) It is as if they were libraries to which new volumes have been continuously added, not necessarily at the end of the shelf, but randomly.
|Cornelia Dimmitt and [[J. A. B. van Buitenen|J.A.B. van Buitenen]]|''Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas''{{Sfn|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|2012|p=5}}}}

===Forgeries===
Many of the extant manuscripts were written on [[palm leaf manuscript|palm leaf]] or copied during the British India colonial era, some in the 19th century.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=49-53}}&lt;ref name="Powell2010p128"/&gt; The scholarship on various Puranas, has suffered from frequent forgeries, states [[Ludo Rocher]], where liberties in the transmission of Puranas were normal and those who copied older manuscripts replaced words or added new content to fit the theory that the colonial scholars were keen on publishing.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=49-53}}&lt;ref name="Powell2010p128"&gt;{{cite book|author=Avril Ann Powell|title=Scottish Orientalists and India: The Muir Brothers, Religion, Education and Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOnS1X8a528C|year=2010|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84383-579-0|pages=130, 128–134, 87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations===

Maridas Poullé (Mariyadas Pillai) published a French translation from a Tamil version of the Bhagavata Purana in 1788, and this was widely distributed in Europe becoming an introduction to the 18th-century Hindu culture and Hinduism to many Europeans during the colonial era. Poullé republished a different translation of the same text as ''Le Bhagavata'' in 1795, from [[Pondicherry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Filliozat]] (1968), Tamil Studies in French Indology, in Tamil Studies Abroad, Xavier S Thani Nayagam, pages 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of Poullé translation is preserved in [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.

==Influence==
[[File:Bharathanatyam By Ranjitha.jpg|thumb|The Puranas have had a large cultural impact on [[Hindu]]s, from festivals to diverse arts. [[Bharata natyam]] (above) is inspired in part by Bhagavata Purana.&lt;ref name=katherinezubko&gt;Katherine Zubko (2013), The Bhagavata Purana: Sacred Text and Living Tradition (Editors: Ravi Gupta and Kenneth Valpey), Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149983}}, pages 181-201&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most significant influence of the Puranas genre of Indian literature have been, state scholars and particularly Indian scholars,&lt;ref name=gregbailey442/&gt; in "culture synthesis", in weaving and integrating the diverse beliefs from ritualistic rites of passage to Vedantic philosophy, from fictional legends to factual history, from individual introspective yoga to social celebratory festivals, from temples to pilgrimage, from one god to another, from goddesses to tantra, from the old to the new.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bailey (2003), The Study of Hinduism (Editor: Arvind Sharma), The University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|978-1570034497}}, pages 162-167&lt;/ref&gt; These have been dynamic open texts, composed socially, over time. This, states Greg Bailey, may have allowed the Hindu culture to "preserve the old while constantly coming to terms with the new", and "if they are anything, they are records of cultural adaptation and transformation" over the last 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=gregbailey442&gt;Greg Bailey (2001), Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415172813}}, pages 442-443&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puranic literature, suggests Khanna, influenced "acculturation and accommodation" of a diversity of people, with different languages and from different economic classes, across different kingdoms and traditions, catalyzing the syncretic "cultural mosaic of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=champa48&gt;R Champakalakshmi (2012), Cultural History of Medieval India (Editor: M Khanna), Berghahn, {{ISBN|978-8187358305}}, pages 48-50&lt;/ref&gt; They helped influence cultural pluralism in India, and are a literary record thereof.&lt;ref name=champa48/&gt;

Om Prakash states the Puranas served as efficient medium for cultural exchange and popular education in ancient and medieval India.&lt;ref name=omprakash33/&gt; These texts adopted, explained and integrated regional deities such as Pashupata in Vayu Purana, Sattva in Vishnu Purana, Dattatreya in Markendeya Purana, Bhojakas in Bhavishya Purana.&lt;ref name=omprakash33/&gt; Further, states Prakash, they dedicated chapters to "secular subjects such as poetics, dramaturgy, grammar, lexicography, astronomy, war, politics, architecture, geography and medicine as in Agni Purana, perfumery and lapidary arts in Garuda Purana, painting, sculpture and other arts in Vishnudharmottara Purana".&lt;ref name=omprakash33&gt;Om Prakash (2004), Cultural History of India, New Age, {{ISBN|978-8122415872}}, pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

;Indian Arts
The cultural influence of the Puranas extended to Indian classical arts, such as songs, dance culture such as [[Bharata Natyam]] in south India&lt;ref name=katherinezubko/&gt; and [[Rasa Lila]] in northeast India,&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beck (2013), The Bhagavata Purana: Sacred Text and Living Tradition (Editors: Ravi Gupta and Kenneth Valpey), Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149983}}, pages 181-201&lt;/ref&gt; plays and recitations.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Wilczewska (2013), The Bhagavata Purana: Sacred Text and Living Tradition (Editors: Ravi Gupta and Kenneth Valpey), Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149983}}, pages 202-220&lt;/ref&gt;

;Festivals
The myths, lunar calendar schedule, rituals and celebrations of major Hindu cultural festivities such as [[Holi]], [[Diwali]] and [[Durga Puja]] are in the Puranic literature.&lt;ref&gt;A Whitney Sanford (2006), Alternative Krishnas: Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity (Editor: Guy Beck), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791464168}}, pages 91-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Pintchman (2005), Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791465950}}, pages 60-63, with notes on 210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quds''' or '''Beitol moghadas''' ({{Lang-fa|قدس - بیت المقدس}}) refer to the city of [[Jerusalem]]. This name is used many times in [[Persian poetry|Persian poems]], [[ancient literature]] of [[Persia]], [[geographical]] books, [[travel literature]], and Persian [[atlas]]es and [[map]]s.&lt;ref&gt;ابوعلی محمد بن محمد بن بلعمی، تاریخ بلعمی، به‌تصحیح محمدتقی بهار و محمد پروین گنابادی، چاپ دوم، ۱۳۵۳. (ج ۱، ص ۲۰۹)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;سپهری، محمد، متون تاریخی و جغرافیایی به فارسی، سمت. ۱۳۸۴. (ص ۲۸۲)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following books are some examples of literature that use the name "Quds" to refer [[Jerusalem]]:{{citation needed||date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9526">'''Strategy guides''' are instruction books that contain hints or complete solutions to specific [[video game]]s.  The line between strategy guides and walkthroughs is somewhat blurred, with the former often containing or being written around the latter. Strategy guides are often published in print, both in book form and also as articles within [[video game journalism|video game magazine]]s. In cases of exceptionally popular game titles, guides may be sold through more mainstream publication channels, such as bookstores or even newsstands. Some publishers also sell [[E-Book]] versions on their websites.

Strategy guides marketed as "official" are written by game distributors themselves or licensed to a specialty publishing house; [[Prima Games]] (a division of [[Random House]]) and Piggyback Interactive (a division of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]) specialise in writing official guides for various companies. There are also a number of publishers who make unlicensed, "unofficial" strategy guides, and many of today's mainstream publishers began by making such guides.

==Typical contents==
The contents of a strategy guide varies between game genres. Typically, the guides contain:
* Detailed [[gameplay]] information, for example, maneuvers that are not detailed in the manual.
* Complete maps of the game, which show the placement of all items (including hidden and hard-to-find ones).
* Detailed instructions for specific locations on how to proceed from there.
* Explanations of puzzles.
* Details of enemies, including techniques on defeating individual enemies (especially [[boss (video games)|bosses]]), the segment for minor enemies is commonly referred to as a [[bestiary]].
* Checklist of collectible items.
* Cheats and game editing, although this has been less common in official guides.
* Walkthroughs to help the player complete levels.
* Advice on tactics and strategies for use in multi-player (games with multi-player only)

==Publishing before game release==
In order to be released at the same time as the game, commercial strategy guides are often based on a pre-release version of the game, rather than the final retail version; BradyGames' guide for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', for instance, included some misplaced item locations and a slightly different map, which made some directions impossible to follow. BradyGames rectifies such mistakes by offering free [[errata]] pages for download from their [[website]].

Strategy guides are sometimes published before the game itself is published.  This can be risky because there is always the chance that a game will end up not being released.  In January [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], Prima published a guide ({{ISBN|0-7615-3125-4}}) for the [[Dreamcast]] version of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', which was canceled late in development when [[Sega]] discontinued the [[video game console|console]].

==Online guides==
{{Video games}}
{{Main|Video game walkthrough}}
Online strategy guides and FAQs are hosted at sites such as [[GameFAQs]] and [[IGN|IGN FAQs]], though much of this content is user generated and not published by the company.  A number of other sites contain strategy guides, and videos in a number of niche areas, such as Role Playing Games or First Person Shooters. These sites may attract a more limited set of viewers, but can include more depth of content. Video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have given rise to [[Video game walkthrough|video walkthroughs]] using programs such as [[Fraps]], which allows players to more easily mirror the strategies being described. These videos are re-posted to a number of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenarea.com/search/label/Video%20Post|title=Example of YouTube Video Re-posts|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109051251/http://www.hiddenarea.com/search/label/Video%20Post|archivedate=2016-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game wikis are used as both strategy guides and documentation. Content is generated and edited completely by users. Wikis allow for information to updated if a developer introduced a new patch to the game. Wiki farms such as [[Fandom (website)|Fandom]] and [[Gamepedia]] host a large number of unofficial video game wikis while wikis can be integrated into the overall site such as [[IGN|IGN Wikis]]. While most wikis are considered unofficial and not supported by the developer, some developers may choose to do so for various reasons. These reasons may include resolving copyright issues and [[real world trading]] that may be found on unofficial wikis. For example, [[ArenaNet]] hosts an official wiki for ''[[Guild Wars]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', citing that "it's often more complete and useful than the documentation that ArenaNet generates internally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Wiki:About|title=About Guild Wars Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on the wiki is integrated into the game, allowing players to access information from in game. Although the wiki is hosted by ArenaNet, the site is run and moderated by the community and contributions are released under GNU Free Document License (GDFL) similar to sites such as Wikipedia.

Aside from the quality of the content, the community aspect of fan walkthroughs is significant. One perspective argues that walkthroughs are shared stories for gamers and game fans.  In creating walkthroughs, gamers actively create meaning for the games.  This is similar to activities of traditional media such as books, films and television (e.g., [[Fan Fiction]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|title=Zelda 64 and Video Game Fans: A Walkthrough of Games, Intertextuality, and Narrative|journal=[[Television &amp; New Media]]|year=2003|volume=4|issue=3|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing availability of free online FAQs and walkthroughs has taken away some of the demand for commercial strategy guides, although there is still a large market for them. Print guides often feature extensive picture-by-picture walkthroughs, maps, and game art, none of which is possible in the [[plain-text]] works hosted by prominent sites such as [[GameFAQs]]. Some newer sites allow strategy guides to be hosted in formats that allow pictures and videos, which further undercuts the advantages of print strategy guides.

Some publishers have tried combining their printed books with the [[Internet]]. In [[2000 in video gaming|2000]], the ''[[Final Fantasy IX|Final Fantasy IX Official Strategy Guide]]'' was published by BradyGames, but much of the information was contained on Square's [[PlayOnline]] website. This seemed like a good way to promote PlayOnline, while creating a guide that would have updatable content, but it was widely panned. Players saw no need of buying a book if a significant part of the content was online; and there was no point paying for online content from one site, if it was available for free on another site. As a result, Square abandoned the online strategy guide concept and released complete printed guides for future games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/ |title=Square's Innovative Strategy Guide Strategy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617055414/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/ |archivedate=June 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source mistakes==
Some companies  will, at times, make mistakes in the book about the game itself, such as stating that "Character A" has a relationship with "Character B", despite there being no relationship. In a strategy guide for ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'' they referred to characters with terms such as "The Dinosaur" and "The Octopus" instead of their names.

Games journalist and guide writer [[Alan Emrich]] has severely criticized recent strategy guides for:
*Containing only facts which should have been in the game manual, e.g. about the [[user interface]].
*Failing to teach users how to improve their play.
*Failing to provide information which helps them to make decisions, e.g. about the capabilities and costs of units and buildings.
*Being inaccurate, often because the developers have tweaked the game during the publication [[lead time]].

The faults, he says, are mainly caused by the game publishers' and guide publishers' haste to get their products on to the market;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[previously] strategy guides were published after a game was released so that they could be accurate, even to the point of including information changes from late game 'patch' releases. The ''[[Master of Orion]]'' official strategy guide that Tom Hughes and I wrote is just that kind of book."&lt;ref name="emrich"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moo3.quicksilver.com/game/history.html | title=Master of Orion: The History of a Game Series — One Man's Telling of a Cosmic Tale | publisher=Master of Orion III - The Official Web Site | date=2001 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | author=Emrich, Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3849">'''Sâr Dubnotal''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[pulp hero]] who starred in 20 [[pulp magazines]] published in [[France]] in 1909–1910.

The ''Sâr Dubnotal'' stories were published [[Anonymity|anonymously]]. Some scholars believe they were written by [[Norbert Sévestre]], a prolific author of popular adventure series, many of which included similarly [[fantastic]] elements, although this has never been proven.

==Overview==

The Sâr Dubnotal is a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and a [[superhero]] not unlike [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Doctor Strange]].

He is a learned Master of the Occult, nicknamed the "Great Psychagogue", the Napoléon of the Intangible, the Master of Psychognosis, the Conqueror of the Invisible, ''El Tebib'' (meaning Doctor in Arabic), or merely the Doctor.

Despite his stylish oriental guise, Sâr Dubnotal is a westerner, schooled by the [[Rosicrucian]]s, who has then learned the ancient secrets of the [[Hindu]] mystics. He is capable of [[telepathy]], [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and [[hypnotism]]. He was born in [[Mumbai]]. His exact age is unknown, but he is very likely much older than he seems.  

Sâr Dubnotal owns houses in Trez-Hir in [[Brittany]], on the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]] and in [[Cheyne Walk]] in [[London]]. He also owns several yachts, including the ''Brahma'' and the ''Derviche''. He also owns an [[atoll]] called Redemption Island located along the [[Tropic of Cancer]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], where he sends villains to be reformed.

Two recurring enemies include rival evil hypnotist Tserpchikopf who turns out to be [[Jack the Ripper]] and [[Russia]]n [[revolutionary]] [[Azef]], based on a real-life figure.

==Stories==

All 20 magazines were published by Eichler, starting in January 1909 – at the same time in France and translated in Germany.

# ''Le Manoir Hanté de Creh'h-ar-Vran'' (The Haunted Manor of Creh'h-ar-Vran)
# ''La Table Tournante du Docteur Tooth'' (Dr. Tooth's Turning Table)
# ''Le Puits Fatal'' (The Fatal Well)
# ''Le Médium Tragique'' (The Tragic Medium)
# ''La Grêve Sanglante'' (The Bloody Beach)
# ''La Détraquée du Passage Rimbaut'' (The Madwoman of Passage Rimbaut)
# ''Tserpchikopf, le Sanglant Hypnotiseur'' (Tserpchikopf, the Bloody Hypnotist)
# ''La Piste Astrale'' (The Astral Trail)
# ''L'Écartelée de Montmartre'' (The Quartered Woman of Montmartre)
# ''Jack l'Éventreur'' (Jack the Ripper)
# ''Haine Posthume'' (Posthumous Hatred)
# ''La Fiancée de Gibraltar'' (The Fiancée from Gibraltar)
# ''Les Vampires du Cimetière'' (The Vampires of the Cemetery)
# ''L'Empreinte Rouge'' (The Red Mark)
# ''La Somnambule du Gué Sanglant'' (The Somnambulist of the River of Blood)
# ''L'Affaire Azzef-Poloukhine'' (The Azzef-Poloukhine Case)
# ''Un Complot Terroriste'' (A Terrorist Plot)
# ''Dans l'Enfer Sibérien'' (In the Siberian Hell)
# ''Azzef, le Roi des Agents Provocateurs'' (Azzef, King of the Agents Provocateurs)
# ''Double-Taf, le Dernier des Pentyerns'' (Double-Taf, Last of the Pentyerns)

Episodes 1, 7, 9, 10 and 11 were published in English in a translation by [[Brian Stableford]] under the title ''Sâr Dubnotal vs. Jack the Ripper'' by Black Coat Press ({{ISBN|9781934543948}}) in November 2009.

==Other appearances==

Sâr Dubnotal has appeared in several [[short story|short stories]] published in the [[anthology]] ''[[Tales of the Shadowmen]]'', ''Doctor Omega and the Shadowmen''.

Sâr Dubnotal is mentioned in Volume 2 of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''.

'''The Water Clock,''' also known as '''The Giant Water Clock,''' is in the permanent collection of [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] located in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], United States. The modern [[water clock]] is located in the Sunburst Atrium of The Children's Museum, and is adjacent to the Grand Staircase leading up to the second floor.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; It was created by French scientist and artist [[Bernard Gitton]] in 1988, the same year that the museum acquired it.&lt;ref name="Liquid Science"/&gt;

The {{convert|26.5|ft|m|adj=on}} artistic timepiece is the largest water clock in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.childrensmuseum.org/themuseum/icons/waterclock.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The water clock, created by French chemist and artist [[Bernard Gitton]], is approximately {{convert|30|ft|m}} tall and made of more than 40 pieces of glass and 100 pieces of metal.&lt;ref name="Liquid Science"&gt;{{cite web | author=David M. MacMillan| year=2000 | title= Bernard Gitton's Liquid Science | work= Delightful Machines version 1.18| url=http://www.marcdatabase.com/~lemur/dm-gitton.html| accessdate= September 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lights on the clock are bright green and the water is dyed blue. The clock is made of glass, steel, and {{convert|70|USgal|l}} of a solution of deionized water, methyl alcohol, and coloring dye.

It was assembled in France to ensure that it worked, then dissassembled and shipped to Indianapolis. It was assembled again in the Children's Museum over two weeks time.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"/&gt;

===Process===
Functionally, a Gitton water clock consists of four subsystems: An oscillator (the pendulum), a frequency divider, a minute counter (the minute discs), and an hour counter (the hour balls).&lt;ref name="Liquid Science"/&gt; Water from a pump in the basement, just below the clock, is pumped through a pipe running up the middle of the clock into a reservoir at the top. The water then drips down onto a scoop at the top which is connected to the green, swinging pendulum. The pendulum causes the scoop to dump the water into a series of siphons. The siphons fill and empty into the minutes' globes. A [[Siphon]] is a tube in an inverted "U" shape which causes the solution to flow up, without pumps, powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity. One minute globe represents two minutes. When all thirty-minute globes are full, they empty and an additional hour globe fills. Twice a day, at one o'clock, all of the hour globes and minute discs are full and the water empties until only the first hour globe is left full.&lt;ref name="TCM Water Clock"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|title=The Water Clock|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/themuseum/icons/waterclock.htm|publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To read the clock the viewer finds the number of filled "hour" spheres lining the left side of the clock and the number of filled discs on the "minutes" side of the clock, with each disc equaling two minutes.

{{quote|text=Moving water makes a siphon -\ You will not see it pull \ 'Til it reaches to the minutes' sphere \ And makes the water flow.&lt;br&gt;At every single hour \ When the minutes' side is full \ The "minutes matching" U-tube burps: \ Another siphon pulls.|sign=Mark Coovert and Peggy Powis, interpretive poem|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Coovert | first1 = Mark | last2 = Powis | first2 = Peggy | title = How It Works | work = Water Clock | publisher = The Children's Museum of Indianapolis | year = 1989 | location = Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Maintenance==
The water clock has two pumps in the basement – one that keeps the clock working, and a backup in case the first fails. The {{convert|70|USgal|l}} of fluid in the clock is not pure water. It is composed of deionized water (to keep it electrically unconductive), coloring (to make the water easier to see), and methyl alcohol (to keep bacteria from growing in the clock).&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite book|last=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|title=Facts About the Giant Water Clock|year=2000|publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color of the water can be changed by stopping the clock, draining the water, and replacing it with water of the new color.

==Artist==
The water clock was created by Bernard Gitton, a French physical chemist and artist who combines those two studies by creating water clocks, water calculators, fountains, and other items of art and science. Bernard began making items of artistic science in 1979, at the age of 43, when he left the world of research science to create scientific art.&lt;ref name="Liquid Science"/&gt;
