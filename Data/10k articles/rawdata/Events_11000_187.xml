'''The 1931 Summer Deaflympics''' officially known as the '''3rd Summer Deaflympics (3rd International Silent Games)''' is an international multi-sport event that was held from 19 August 1931 to 23 August 1931. It was hosted by [[Nürnberg]],[[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deaflympics.com/games.asp?1931-s|title=Games {{!}} Deaflympics|website=www.deaflympics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd Summer [[Deaflympics]] Games were originally scheduled to be held in 1932, but was decided to host it in 1931 due to the schedule of [[1932 Summer Olympics]].

On the other hand, Poland were not allowed to participate  at the Games due to Germany's conflict with Poland during the Nazi rule at that time as the Games held in Germany.

'''The 1968 Movement''' in [[Pakistan]] was part of the protest against the [[dictator]]ial regime of [[Ayub Khan]]. It took the form of a mass uprising of students and workers, attracting people from every profession. The uprising took place from early November 1968, to the end of March 1969, around 10 to 15 million people were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power|last=Ali|first=Tariq|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4165-6102-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement resulted in  the regime of [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)]] being brought down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/743156|title=REVIEW: Pakistan's Other Story: The Revolution of 1968–1969 by Lal Khan|last=Authors|first=Dawn Books And|date=2012-08-18|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.struggle.pk/pakistans-other-story/|title=پاکستان کی اصل کہانی|work=The Struggle {{!}} طبقاتی جدوجہد|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Since the nation's birth in 1947, Pakistan had been governed though bureaucracy. In 1958, the army seized power through a coup led by Ayub Khan. Under his rule, the country's economy grew at an average yearly rate of more than 5%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxist.com/introduction-pakistans-other-story-1968-69-revolution.htm|title=Pakistan's Other Story: 1. Introduction|last=Woods|first=Alan|website=www.marxist.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to income inequality, Pakistan became a country with extreme wealth and extreme poverty. Ayub Khan's policies nourished the capitalist class, whose fortunes amassed, but it oppressed ordinary people with increasing material poverty, as well as intellectual poverty due to rigorous political and cultural censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marxistleftreview.org/index.php/no-12-winter-2016/132-the-1968-9-pakistan-revolution-a-students-and-workers-popular-uprising|title=The 1968-9 Pakistan Revolution:  a students' and workers' popular uprising|last=Bellingham|first=Justen|website=marxistleftreview.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 1968, [[Mahbub ul Haq|Dr. Mahbub ul Haq]], the then Chief Economist of the Planning Commission, identified Pakistan's 22 richest families that controlled 66 percent of the industries and owned 87 percent shares in the country's banking and insurance industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/279413|title=People who own greatest amount of wealth|last=Hussain|first=Dilawar|date=2007-12-09|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Ayub regime implemented its own version of land reforms, under which a limit was imposed upon land holding. However, it failed miserably, and over 6,000 landowners exceeded his defined ceilings, owning 7.5 million acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1293604|title=What they never tell us about Ayub Khan&amp;#39;s regime|last=Haider|first=Murtaza|date=2016-11-01|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average income in West Pakistan was a mere £35 per year; in East Pakistan, the figure was lower at £15.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1965, [[Elections in Pakistan|presidential elections]] were held. These elections were not based upon adult franchise but on basic democracy. A few thousand so-called elected representatives of local bodies had to elect the president. There were wide speculations of election interference which also led to the opposition's protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/presidential-election#prettyPhoto|title=Presidential Election {{!}} Elections were held on January 2, 1965|date=2013-10-25|work=Story Of Pakistan|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Pakistan went to war with [[India]]. The costs of the war put an end to economic growth and saw massive increase in [[Military budget|defence spending]]. Private investment growth in Pakistan saw 20% decline in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/09/05/the-flipside-of-the-1965-war/|title=The flipside of the 1965 war|website=www.pakistantoday.com.pk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movement '68 ==
In the early months of 1968, Ayub Khan celebrated what was called the "Decade of Development", outraged citizens erupted into agitations. That same year in November, a group of students from Rawalpindi were heading back from [[Landi Kotal]], and were stopped at customs checkpoints near [[Attock]]. They were aggressively met by customs officials. On returning to Rawalpindi, they staged a protest against their mishandling by police as result of their experience. Protests grew to a sizeable amount, resulting in the police trying to dismantle the protests and shots being fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/tribal-tales/|title=Tribal tales ‹ The Friday Times|website=www.thefridaytimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student of Rawalpindi Polytechnic College, Abdul Hameed, was shot dead. Already, outraged citizens were protesting against a rise in the price of sugar; the death of Hameed sparked the whole society and workers to join.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pakistan Labor Party|first=Party|date=19 September 2005|title=Past, Present and Future of Left Movement in Pakistan|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?page=spipdf&amp;spipdf=spipdf_article&amp;id_article=406&amp;nom_fichier=ESSF_article-406|journal=Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent writer [[Tariq Ali]] narrates incident in following words; {{History of Pakistan}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Without any physical provocation the police, who were fully armed with rifles, batons, and tear-gas bombs, opened fire.

On February 13th, for the first time in ten years, the red flag was hauled up in [[Lahore]], as more than 25,000 rail workers marched along the main street chanting: "Solidarity with the Chinese people: Destroy capitalism." However, there was no mass Marxist party to provide leadership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the industrial district of [[Faisalabad]], the district administration had to seek the permission of a local labor leader named Mukhtar Rana for the supply of goods through trucks. All censorship failed. Trains were carrying the revolutionary messages across the country. Workers invented new methods of communication. It was the industrialisation, exploitation, and oppression widening the gulf between rich and poor which brought this change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an interview for the book, ''Pakistan's Other Story-The 1968–69 Revolution'', [[Munnu Bhai]] revealed some anecdotes of the upsurge. "At a public meeting in Ichra, Lahore, [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] leader [[Maulana Maudoodi]] held a piece of bread in his one hand and the Holy Koran in the other. He asked the crowd, 'Do you want roti (bread) or the Koran?' The people had replied, 'We have the Koran in our homes, but we don't have bread.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://leadpakistan.com.pk/news/munnoo-bhai-a-friend-and-comrade/|title=Munnoo Bhai — a friend and comrade|date=2018-01-22|work=Daily Lead Pakistan|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the telegraphic narration of the events of those days in Mubashar Hasan's book, ''The crises of Pakistan and their solution''.&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this movement, a total of 239 people were killed, 196 in East Pakistan and 43 in West Pakistan. According to details police firing killed 41 in West Pakistan and 88 in East Pakistan. Most of them were students. In East Pakistan, they included Asad, Matiur, Anwar, Rostom, Dr. Shamsuzzoha and Sergeant Zahrul Huq".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxist.com/pakistans-other-story-6.htm|title=Pakistan's Other Story: 6.

In March 1969, a group of senior military men advised Ayub to step down, fearing the eruption of a full-scale civil war in East Pakistan and the political and social [[anarchy]] in the country's west wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1128832|title=Exit stage left: the movement against Ayub Khan|last=InpaperMagazine|first=From|date=2014-08-31|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Ayub Khan conceded how the movement had paralysed the functioning of the state and society.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The civilian labor force in Karachi dockyards had struck and stopped work.

== Aftermath ==
On the 25th of March, Ayub Khan resigned as President of Pakistan and announced he was turning over the government of the nation to Army Chief of Staff Gen. [[Yahya Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19690325.2.8|title=President of Pakistan Out, Army Chief In|last=UPI|first=|date=25 March 1969|work=Desert Sun|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he highlighted reasons for his resignation in letter to [[Yahya Khan|General Yahya Khan]] in the following words;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am left with no option but to step aside and leave it to the Defence Forces of Pakistan, which today represent the only effective and legal instrument, to take full control of the country.

In mid-1993, [[Evan Chandler]] accused [[Michael Jackson]] of [[sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] his 13-year-old son, Jordan "Jordy" Chandler. The relationship between Jackson and Jordan had begun in May 1992; Chandler initially encouraged the friendship.&lt;ref name="fischer 217"&gt;Fischer, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship became well known as the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid media]] reported that Jackson had become a member of the Chandler family. In 1993, Chandler confronted his ex-wife June, who had custody of Jordan, with suspicions that their son had been in an inappropriate relationship with Jackson, but June dismissed his worries.&lt;ref name="fischer 218"&gt;Fischer, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fischer 219"&gt;Fischer, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler threatened to go public with the evidence he claimed to have.&lt;ref name="fischer 219" /&gt; 

Jackson asked his lawyer [[Bert Fields]] to intervene.&lt;ref name="fischer 218" /&gt; On July 15, Abrams, a psychologist, sent Chandler's attorney Barry Rothman a letter stating there was "reasonable suspicion" of sexual abuse. He wrote that if it had been a real case,{{Clarify|reason=As opposed to a hypothetical case? What does "a real case" mean here?|date=October 2018}} he would be required by law to contact the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services.&lt;ref name="fischer 220"&gt;Fischer, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, Chandler and Jordan met with Jackson and [[Anthony Pellicano]], Jackson's private investigator, and Chandler read out Abrams' letter. He then opened negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]].&lt;ref name="fischer 221"&gt;Fischer, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "campbell 53"/&gt; Chandler and Rothman had rejected a $350,000 offer from Jackson. On August 16, June's attorney notified Rothman that he would file papers to force Chandler to return Jordan to allow him to go on{{Clarify|reason=to accompany Jackson? or attend the tour in the audience as a fan?|date=October 2018}} Jackson's [[Dangerous World Tour]].

On the day Jackson began the third leg of his tour, news of the allegations broke to the public and received worldwide media attention. Jackson cancelled the remainder of the tour due to health problems arising from the scandal. In January 1994, Jackson reached a financial settlement for $23,000,000 with the Chandlers and in September a criminal investigation was closed. On November 5, 2009, 5 months after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide in [[Liberty Towers (Jersey City)|his apartment]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].

==Allegations==
[[File:Aerial-NeverlandRanch2-28-08.jpg|thumb|Jackson's [[Neverland Ranch]] home, where the sexual abuse was alleged to have taken place]]
Jackson became firm friends with Jordan Chandler and his family after a meeting in May 1992, as he was a fan of Jackson.&lt;ref name = "campbell 47-50"&gt;Campbell, pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt; Their friendship became so close that the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' ran a featured story with the title "Michael's New Adopted Family". The story implied that Jackson had "stolen" the boy from his estranged father, [[Evan Chandler]], a dentist. Chandler was jealous over Jackson's influence on his son.&lt;ref name = "tara 464-471"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 464–471&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, Chandler asked, "Look, are you having sex with my son?" When Jackson said no, Chandler's opinion of Jackson changed.&lt;ref name = "tara 464-471"/&gt;{{Clarify|reason=changed how? did he believe him? why did he ask him this?|date=October 2018}}

Jackson invited Jordan, his stepsister and his mother to visit his [[Neverland Ranch]] on the weekends. They would also take trips to Las Vegas and Florida.&lt;ref name="campbell 47-50" /&gt; These trips interfered with Jordan's scheduled visits with his father, with Jordan preferring to visit Neverland.&lt;ref name="campbell 50" /&gt; By mid-1993, it was revealed{{How|date=October 2018|title=How did this come to light?}} that Jackson had children sleep in his bed with him at at Neverland, which attracted media scrutiny after [[child sexual abuse]] allegations{{Which|date=October 2018}} were brought against him.&lt;ref name="1993 allegations"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/24/newsid_2512000/2512077.stm|title=1993: Michael Jackson accused of child abuse|date=February 8, 2003|accessdate=November 11, 2006|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/18/arts/pop-view-michael-jackson-is-angry-understand.html?sq=HIStory+album+michael+jackson+review&amp;scp=4&amp;st=nyt|title=POP VIEW; Michael Jackson Is Angry, Understand?|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=June 18, 1995|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 1993, when Jackson and Jordan stayed with Chandler, Chandler urged Jackson to spend more time with his son and even suggested that Jackson build an addition to the house so that Jackson could stay there.&lt;ref name="fischer 217" /&gt; After the zoning department said this could not be built, Chandler suggested that Jackson build him a new home.&lt;ref name="fischer 217" /&gt; That month, Jordan and June flew with Jackson to Monaco for the [[World Music Awards]].&lt;ref name="fischer 217" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell 50"&gt;Campbell, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; According to June's lawyer, Michael Freeman, "Evan began to get jealous of the involvement and felt left out."&lt;ref name="fischer 217" /&gt; Upon their return, Chandler was pleased with a five-day visit from Jackson, during which Jackson slept in a room with Jordan and his stepbrother.&lt;ref name="fischer 217" /&gt; Chandler said this is when he became suspicious of sexual misconduct by Jackson, although he said that Jackson and Jordan were clothed when he saw them in bed together, and has never claimed to have witnessed sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name="fischer 217-8"&gt;Fischer, pp.217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 1993, in a private telephone conversation, Chandler was recorded{{How|date=October 2018}} saying: 

{{Quote|There was no reason why [Jackson] had to stop calling me&amp;nbsp;... I picked the nastiest son of a bitch I could find [Chandler's lawyer Barry Rothman], all he wants to do is get this out in the public as fast as he can, as big as he can and humiliate as many people as he can. He's nasty, he's mean, he's smart and he's hungry for publicity. Everything's going to a certain plan that isn't just mine. Once I make that phone call, this guy is going to destroy everybody in sight in any devious, nasty, cruel way that he can do it. I've given him full authority to do that. Jackson is an evil guy, he is worse than that and I have the evidence to prove it. If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever&amp;nbsp;... Michael's career will be over.&lt;ref name="taraborrelli"/&gt;|sign=|source=}} 

In the same conversation, when asked how this would affect his son, Chandler replied:

{{Quote|That's irrelevant to me&amp;nbsp;... It will be a massacre if I don't get what I want. It's going to be bigger than all us put together&amp;nbsp;... This man [Jackson] is going to be humiliated beyond belief&amp;nbsp;... He will not sell one more record.&lt;ref name="taraborrelli"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 477–478&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The recorded conversation was a critical aspect of Jackson's defense against the allegations made against him. He and his supporters argued that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from him.&lt;ref name = "taraborrelli"/&gt; In October 1994, Mary A. Fischer of ''[[GQ]]'' magazine reported it was Chandler who initially accused Jackson of molesting his son, before he demanded a [[screenwriting]] deal from Jackson instead of going to the police.&lt;ref name="fischer 266"&gt;p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ct itstime"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson |first=Charles |title=Michael Jackson: It's Time for Outlets to Take Responsibility in Covering the Rock Star |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-thomson/michael-jackson-its-time_b_482176.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |date=March 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y5xIYInf?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-thomson/michael-jackson-its-time_b_482176.html |archivedate=April 20, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of sedatives ===
According to Taraborrelli, Chandler was forced to admit that he had used the controversial sedative [[sodium amytal]] when he extracted a tooth from Jordan in early August.&lt;ref name="tara 485-486"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 485–486&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium amytal is a [[barbiturate]] that puts people in a [[hypnotic]] state when injected [[intravenously]]. Studies done in 1952 debunked the drug as a [[truth serum]] {{Clarify|reason=debunked how? debunked its use for dental purposes or as a truth serum or what?|date=October 2018}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;and demonstrated that it enabled [[false memories]] to be implanted.&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt; 

Dr. Phillip Resnick, a Cleveland psychiatrist,&lt;ref name="fischer 216"&gt;Fischer, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; said it was "a [[psychiatric medication]]" and "People will say things under sodium amytal that are blatantly untrue".&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt; In May 1994, in [[Napa County, California]], [[Gary Ramona]] won a lawsuit against his daughter's therapist and the psychiatrist who had given her sodium amytal.&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dubious time"&gt;Smolowe, Jill; Willwerth, James. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980759,00.html "Dubious Memories"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. 1994-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatrist claimed the drug helped Ramona's daughter remember specific details of sexual molestation by Ramona, but a [[brief (law)|court brief]] written by Martin Orne, a [[University of Pennsylvania]] psychiatrist who pioneered research of hypnosis and sodium amytal, stated that the drug is "not useful in ascertaining 'truth' . . . The patient becomes sensitive and receptive to suggestions due to the context and to the comments of the interviewers."&lt;ref name="dubious time" /&gt; This was the first successful legal challenge to the "[[repressed memory]] phenomenon".&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt; 

Dr. Kenneth Gottlieb, a San Francisco psychiatrist, said: "It’s absolutely a psychiatric drug ... I would never want to use a drug that tampers with a person’s unconscious unless there was no other drug available. And I would not use it without resuscitating equipment, in case of allergic reaction, and only with an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] anesthesiologist present."&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt; According to Dr. John Yagiela, coordinator of the anesthesia and pain control department of the [[UCLA School of Dentistry]], "It’s unusual for it to be used [for pulling a tooth]" and "better, safer alternatives are available."&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt;

On May 3, 1994, [[KCBS-TV]] reported that Chandler claimed the drug was used for tooth extraction and that the allegations came out{{Clarify|reason=from who?|date=October 2018}} while Jordan was under the influence of the drug.&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt; Mark Torbiner, the dental [[anesthesiologist]] who administered the drug, told ''[[GQ]]'' that if sodium amytal was used, "it was for dental purposes".&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt;  According to Diane Dimond of ''[[Hard Copy]]'', Torbiner's records show that Robinul and Vistarol was administered instead of sodium amytal.&lt;ref name="Dimond pp 61-62"&gt;Dimond, Diane. ''Be Careful Who You Love''. pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration]] was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients [[morphine]] and [[Demerol]].&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt; His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, but he had not adhered to those restrictions.&lt;ref name="fischer 265"&gt;Fischer, p.265&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he had given [[general anesthetic]] to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures.&lt;ref name="fischer 265" /&gt; Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.&lt;ref name="fischer 221" /&gt;

=== Negotiations ===
Over the next couple of months, the parties of Jackson and Chandler engaged in unsuccessful out-of-court negotiations. Chandler and his legal team asked for $20 million, or threatened to take the dispute to a criminal court.&lt;ref name="campbell 53"&gt;Campbell, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson refused, saying, "No way in hell". A few weeks later, Jackson's legal team gave a counter-offer of $1 million, which was declined by Chandler.&lt;ref name="campbell 53" /&gt; Pellicano said he made the offers in an attempt to catch the Chandler's negotiating{{Why|date=October 2018}} and recorded one of the telephone calls to Rothman to demonstrate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-02/local/me-30818_1_anthony-pellicano|title=Jackson Aides Go Back on the Offensive|first1=AMY|last1=WALLACE|first2=JIM|last2=NEWTON|date=September 2, 1993|website=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=September 30, 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler lowered his request to $15 million. Jackson refused and lowered his offer to $350,000, which Chandler refused. With both sides unable to reach an agreement, Chandler decided to take it to court.&lt;ref name="campbell 53" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1994/01/orth199401|title=Nightmare in Neverland|first=Maureen|last=Orth|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chandler took Jordan to a psychiatrist, Dr. Mathis Abrams. Over a three-hour session with Abrams, Jordan said he had had a sexual relationship with Jackson that went on for several months, and which included incidents of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. He repeated these allegations to police and gave a detailed description of what he alleged was Jackson's penis.&lt;ref name="campbell 53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tara 496-498"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 496–498&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations made public and investigation===
On August 18, the [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles Police Department's]] Sexually Exploited Child Unit began a criminal investigation into Jackson. The same day, June told police that she did not believe Jackson had molested her son.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "campbell 42-45"&gt;Campbell, p. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, a search warrant was issued, allowing police to search Neverland Ranch. Police questioned 30 children who were friends of Jackson, who all stated that Jackson was not a child molester.&lt;ref name = "1993 allegations"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "campbell 42-45"/&gt; A police officer involved in the investigation told ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' that no evidence (medical, photographic or video) could be found that would support a criminal filing.&lt;ref name = "campbell 42-45"/&gt; 

On the day the allegations were made public, August 24, Jackson began the third leg of his [[Dangerous World Tour]], in [[Bangkok]]. That same day, Jackson's investigator held a press conference accusing Chandler of trying to extort $20 million. He did not mention that Jackson had made several counter-offers.&lt;ref name="1993 allegations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell 42-45" /&gt; On August 25, Jackson's young friends Brett Barnes and [[Wade Robson]] held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in the same bed as Jackson, but nothing sexual in nature had occurred.&lt;ref name="tara 500-507"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 500–507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cambpell 57-59"&gt;Campbell, pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackson family|Jackson's family]] held another press conference to show support, saying it was their "unequivocal belief" that Michael had been made a victim of a cruel and obvious attempt to take advantage of his fame and wealth.&lt;ref name="tara 500-507" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cambpell 57-59" /&gt; 

The police began an investigation into Chandler, and found that he was $68,400 behind in his [[Child support in the United States|child support]] payments, despite being well-paid as a dentist.&lt;ref name="campbell 47-50" /&gt; On November 8, police searched the Jackson family home, Hayvenhurst, but found nothing of importance.&lt;ref name="1993 allegations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell 89-93" /&gt; According to internal reports from the LA County [[Child Protective Services|DCFS]] at the time, Chandler's story remained largely consistent but dates, places, times and some details were inconsistent.&lt;ref name="chandler story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-26/news/mn-28196_1_michael-jackson |title=International Furor Stirred by Allegations on Jackson : Inquiry: Police focus on entertainer's contact with at least 4 boys, source says.

=== Allegation by LaToya Jackson ===
In the winter of 1993, Jackson's sister [[La Toya Jackson]], who had not spoken to him for several years, claimed that Jackson was a [[pedophile]]. La Toya stated: "I cannot and will not be a silent collaborator in his crimes against young children&amp;nbsp;... Forget about the superstar, forget about the icon. If he was any other 35-year-old man who was sleeping with little boys, you wouldn't like this guy."&lt;ref name="tara 534-540" /&gt; She claimed that checks had been made out to several boys and that Jackson's own physical abuse as a child had turned him into an abuser.&lt;ref name="tara 534-540" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell 128"&gt;Campbell, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; She later claimed{{When|date=October 2018}} that Jackson had tried to kidnap and kill her.&lt;ref name="campbell 128" /&gt; 

LaToya claimed to have proof of Jackson's pedophilia and offered to disclose it for $500,000. A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they realized that her revelations were not what she had claimed.&lt;ref name="tara 534-540" /&gt;{{Clarify|reason=what was it?|date=October 2018}} The rest of the family disowned her, and in later years she insisted she had been forced to make the allegations by her then-husband for financial gain.&lt;ref name="tara 534-540" /&gt; Just prior to making the allegations, her husband had been arrested for assaulting her.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the [[millennium]] Jackson had forgiven his sister.&lt;ref name="tara 534-540" /&gt;

===Lisa Marie Presley===
Jackson first met [[Lisa Marie Presley]] in 1974, during a [[Jackson 5]] engagement at the MGM Grand.&lt;ref name="tara 500-507" /&gt; In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, and they talked almost every day by telephone.&lt;ref name="gliatto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20103653,00.html |title=Neverland Meets Graceland |author=Gliatto, Tom |date=August 15, 1994 |work=People |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329202724/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0%2C%2C20103653%2C00.html |archivedate=March 29, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health.&lt;ref name="tara 518–520" /&gt; She explained, "I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it."&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; She described him in one call as high, incoherent and delusional.&lt;ref name="tara 518–520" /&gt; He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?"&lt;ref name="tara 518–520" /&gt; The marriage was, in her words, "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active".&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 562–564&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced less than two years later, but remained friends.&lt;ref name="tara 580–581"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 580–581&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jackson's health ===
Jackson had begun taking [[painkiller]]s, [[Valium]], [[Xanax]] and [[Ativan]] to deal with the stress of the allegations.&lt;ref name="tara 518–520"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 518–520&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the allegations became news, he had lost approximately 10&amp;nbsp;pounds in weight and had stopped eating.&lt;ref name="tara 514-516"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 514–516&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jackson, he had a tendency to stop eating when "really upset or hurt" and his friend [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had to make him eat: "She took the spoon and would put it into my mouth."&lt;ref name="mjtapes vieira"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32987303/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/page/5/ |title=The Michael Jackson Tapes |author=Vieira, Meredith|date=September 25, 2009 |work=Dateline MSNBC |accessdate= January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he eventually became unconscious and had to be fed intravenously.&lt;ref name="mjtapes vieira" /&gt; 

In a court [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] unrelated to the alleged child abuse,{{Clarify|reason=what was this?|date=October 2018}} Jackson appeared drowsy, lacked concentration and slurred while speaking. He said he could not remember the dates of his album releases or the names of people he had worked with, and took several minutes to name some of his recent albums.&lt;ref name="campbell 96-97"&gt;Campbell, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; His health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his tour and flew with Taylor and her husband to London. When Jackson arrived at the airport, he had to be held up. He was rushed to the home of [[Elton John]]'s manager and afterwards to a clinic.&lt;ref name="campbell 89-93"&gt;Campbell, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tara 524-528" /&gt; When he was searched for drugs on entry, 18 vials of medicine were found in a suitcase. Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic, and was put on a Valium IV to wean him from painkillers.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell 89-93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tara 524-528" /&gt; His spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level".&lt;ref name="tara 524-528" /&gt; While in the clinic, he took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.&lt;ref name="campbell 89-93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tara 524-528"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 524–528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strip search===
In December 1993, Jackson was served with a [[search warrant|warrant]] for a [[strip search]], as police wanted to verify Jordan Chandler's description of Jackson's private anatomy.&lt;ref name = "tara 534-540"/&gt; The order stated that officers were to examine, photograph and videotape Jackson's entire body, "including his penis, anus, hips, buttocks and any other part of his body".&lt;ref name = "tara 534-540"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 534–540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell 141"&gt;Campbell, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNN D.S."&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Jackson sings of D.A. on previous album|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/19/jackson.prosecutor.reut/index.html|date=November 20, 2003| accessdate= May 1, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604042429/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/19/jackson.prosecutor.reut/index.html| archivedate= June 4, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant stated they were looking for discoloration or any other signs of [[vitiligo]] that he had spoken about, or any other skin disorder, and that refusal to comply would be used in court as an indication of guilt.&lt;ref name="campbell 141" /&gt; 

The strip search took place on December 20, 1993, at Jackson's ranch. Those present for the prosecution were Santa Barbara [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas W. Sneddon, Jr.|Tom Sneddon]], a detective, a photographer and a doctor. Those present on behalf of Jackson were his two attorneys, a physician, a detective, a bodyguard and a photographer.&lt;ref name="tara 534-540" /&gt; The attorneys and Sneddon agreed to leave the room when the examination took place. At Jackson's insistence, the prosecution detective also left. In an emotional state, Jackson stood on a platform in the middle of the room and disrobed. The search lasted for approximately 25&amp;nbsp;minutes. He was never touched.&lt;ref name="tara 534-540" /&gt;

Reports vary on whether the photographs of Jackson corroborated Jordan's allegations. ''[[Reuters]]'' reported that an unidentified source informed them on January 27, 1994, that "photos of Michael Jackson's genitalia do not match description given by the boy",&lt;ref name="chandler contra"&gt;Vigoda, Arlene.

Jackson]], "The photographs reveal a mark on the right side of Defendant's penis at about the same relative location as the dark blemish located by Jordan Chandler on his drawing of Defendant's erect penis" and "Chandler's graphic representation of the discolored area on Defendant's penis is substantially corroborated by the photographs."&lt;ref name="blemish sbs"&gt;[http://www.sbscpublicaccess.org/docs/ctdocs/052505pltmotchandler.pdf "Plaintiff's Motion to Admit Evidence that Jordan Chandler had Knowledge of, and Accurately Described Defendant's Distinctively-Blemished Lower Torso and Penis in 1994; Declaration of Thomas W.

===Jackson's response===
On December 22, Jackson responded to events for the first time via [[satellite]] from his ranch: 

{{Quote|As you may already know, after my tour ended I remained out of the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on pain medication ... There have been many disgusting statements made recently concerning allegations of improper conduct on my part. These statements about me are totally false ... I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the mass—matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions. I ask all of you to wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me. Don't treat me like a criminal, because I am innocent. I have been forced to submit to a dehumanizing and humiliating examination...It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life, one that no person should ever have to suffer ... But if this is what I have to endure to prove my innocence, my complete innocence, so be it.&lt;ref name = "1993 allegations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;}} 

A poll at the time, conducted by ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', found that nearly 75 percent of Americans believed Jackson was telling the truth.&lt;ref name = "campbell 140-143"&gt;Campbell, p. 140–143&lt;/ref&gt; While Jackson sought medical help for his faltering health, his legal team and friends, such as Presley and Taylor, took control of his defense and finances.&lt;ref name = "tara 514-516"/&gt; Much of Jackson's legal team would meet three times a week at Taylor's home to discuss the case.&lt;ref name = "tara 514-516"/&gt; Taylor then called in more legal professionals on Jackson's behalf. Eventually, Presley, Taylor, and Jackson's team agreed that Jackson was too sick to endure a lengthy trial, and that he should settle out of court.&lt;ref name = "tara 524-528"/&gt;

==Media reaction==
Most of the information available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson.&lt;ref name="ct itstime"/&gt; Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media,&lt;ref name="ct itstime"/&gt; which used [[Sensationalism|sensational headlines]] or headlines that implied guilt&lt;ref name="tara 500-507" /&gt; when the content itself did not support the headline,&lt;ref name="campbell 42-45"/&gt; purchased stories of his alleged criminal activity&lt;ref name = "campbell 77-80"&gt;Campbell, p. 77–80&lt;/ref&gt; and confidential leaked material from the police investigation,&lt;ref name = "campbell 47-50"/&gt; deliberately used unflattering photographs,&lt;ref name = "tara 500-507"/&gt; and exercised a general lack of objectivity.&lt;ref name = "tara 500-507"/&gt;

The ''[[New York Post]]'' ran the headline "Peter Pan or [[Pervert]]", despite minimal information having been disclosed by the police.&lt;ref name = "tara 500-507"/&gt; Two weeks after the allegations were reported, the headline, "Michael Jackson: A Curtain Closes" reflected the attitude of most tabloid media.&lt;ref name = "campbell 71-73"&gt;Campbell, p. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; In a piece for ''[[Hard Copy]]'', [[Diane Dimond]]—a journalist who spent the next 15 years trying to prove Jackson was a pedophile—ran a story stating it had acquired "new documents in the criminal investigation of Michael Jackson, and they are chilling; they contain the name of child movie actor [[Macaulay Culkin]]". The document stated that Culkin strongly denied being abused by Jackson.&lt;ref name = "campbell 42-45"/&gt;

Two tabloid media bought confidential leaked documents from the LAPD for $20,000.&lt;ref name = "campbell 47-50"/&gt; A number of Jackson's former employees—most of whom had worked at Neverland—sold stories alleged prior sexual misconduct on Jackson's part, instead of reporting their claims to police. One couple asked for $100,000, claiming that Jackson had sexually caressed Macaulay Culkin. They were prepared to expand upon this allegation for a fee of $500,000, whereby they would allege that Jackson put his hands down Culkin's pants. When the story broke, Culkin strongly denied the allegation, and did so again in court during Jackson's 2005 trial.&lt;ref name = "campbell 77-80"/&gt; A former security guard made various allegations about Jackson, saying he was fired because he "knew too much",&lt;ref name = "campbell 113-115"/&gt; and alleged that he was ordered by Jackson to destroy a photo of a naked boy. Instead of reporting this to police, he sold the story to ''Hard Copy'' for $150,000.&lt;ref name = "campbell 113-115"&gt;Campbell, p. 113–115&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Jackson's maid, Branca Francia, alleged that she "quit in disgust" after seeing Jackson in a shower with a child, but did not inform the police. It later emerged that Francia had been fired in 1991, but nevertheless sold her story to ''Hard Copy'' for $20,000.&lt;ref name = "campbell 113-115"/&gt;

When Jackson left the US to go into drug rehabilitation, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' (UK) held a "Spot the Jacko" contest, offering readers a trip to [[Disney World]] if they could correctly predict where he would appear next.&lt;ref name = "campbell 89-93"/&gt; A ''[[The Daily Express|Daily Express]]'' headline read "Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run", while a ''[[News of the World]]'' headline accused Jackson of being a [[fugitive]]. These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have [[cosmetic surgery]] that would make him unrecognizable.&lt;ref name = "campbell 89-93"/&gt; [[Geraldo Rivera]] set up a mock trial, with a jury made up of audience members, even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil lawsuit ==
A [[civil lawsuit]] was filed by Jordan Chandler and his parents on September 14, 1993.&lt;ref name="la sued"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nazario|first=Sonia|title=Jackson Sued by Boy Who Alleged Sexual Molestation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1993-09-15/local/me-35320_1_sexual-battery|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 15, 1993| accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1993, district attorneys in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties both convened [[grand juries]] to assess whether [[criminal charges]] should be filed against Jackson.&lt;ref name="fischer 268"&gt;Fischer, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1, 1994, $2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in California and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses, but Jordan's allegations could not be [[corroborate]]d.&lt;ref name="taraborrelli1" /&gt; On January 4, 1994, Chandler's attorney, Larry Feldman, filed a motion for the photos from Jackson's December 1993 body search from investigators, saying Jackson's attorneys and the L.A. district attorney had refused to give him copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-05/local/me-8514_1_michael-jackson "Boy's Lawyer Seeks Photos of Michael Jackson's Body"]. ''Los Angeles Times''. 1994-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Feldman petitioned the court that he should be allowed access to Jackson's finances over concerns that Jackson's wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court. One adviser to Jackson stated, "You can take pictures of Michael's dick and he's not gonna like it, but once you start trying to figure out how much money he has, that's where he stops playing around."&lt;ref name="taraborrelli1" /&gt; 

Jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded. Feldman filed a counter-motion, saying the delay would hurt Jordan's chances for recovery and make it more difficult to gather evidence.&lt;ref name="la lapd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newton|first=Jim|title=Jackson's Lawyers Attack LAPD Investigation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1993-11-17/local/me-57719_1_michael-jackson|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 17, 1993| accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal [[statute of limitations]] as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date, such as the case of ''Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16534682523245094517&amp;q=Pacers,+Inc.+v.+Superior&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=10000000000002&amp;as_vis=1|title=162 Cal.App.3d 686 (1984)208 Cal.

On November 23, Judge Rothman accepted Feldman's motion and set March 21, 1994, as the start date for the [[civil trial]].&lt;ref name="var civiltrial"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandler|first=Adam|title=Jackson told to cooperate in civil trial|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR116092?refCatId=18|newspaper=Variety|date=November 23, 1993| accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothman ordered Jackson's [[deposition (law)|deposition]] scheduled before the end of January 1994, but noted he might reconsider if Jackson was indicted on criminal charges.&lt;ref name="la postponement"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newton|first=Jim|title=Jackson to Give Deposition About Allegations Lawsuit: The singer has agreed to tell his side Jan. 18.

The concerns about a civil trial during an ongoing criminal investigation, and about the prosecutor's access to the plaintiff's information in the civil trial, stemmed from Jackson's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref name="billofrights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Right Transcript|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html|work=Bill of Rights|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=January 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110208205437/http://archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html| archivedate= February 8, 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As two grand juries had deemed there was insufficient evidence for charges as of January 1,&lt;ref name="taraborrelli1"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 540–545&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecution might have been able to form the elements of a criminal case around the defense strategy in the civil trial; creating a situation akin to [[double jeopardy]].&lt;ref name="shareinfo latimes"&gt;Newton, Jim (December 18, 1993).

On January 24, 1994, prosecutors announced that they would not bring charges against Chandler for attempted [[extortion]], as Jackson's camp has been slow to report the extortion claim to the police and had tried to negotiate a settlement with Chandler for several weeks.&lt;ref name="noextortcharges latimes"&gt;Newton, Jim (January 25, 1994).

In the extortion investigation, a [[search warrant]] was never sought to search the homes and offices of Chandler and Rothman and no grand jury was convened when both men declined to be interviewed by police.&lt;ref name="fischer 268" /&gt; In contrast, the police searched Jackson's residences solely based on Jordan's allegations reported by a psychiatrist with no particular expertise in child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="campbell 44-45"&gt;Campbell, pp.44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fischer 266-7"&gt;Fischer, pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt; They increased their efforts after no supporting evidence was found in their raids and after questioning almost 30 children and their families, all of whom said Jackson had done nothing wrong.&lt;ref name="fischer 267" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell 44-45" /&gt; Officers flew to the Philippines to interview two ex-housekeepers who had sold a molestation story to the tabloids but decided it lacked credibility.&lt;ref name="fischer 267" /&gt; Several parents also complained to one of Jackson's attorneys of aggressive investigative techniques by the police. For example, they claimed the police frightened their children with lies such as "We have nude photos of you" to pressure them into accusing Jackson,&lt;ref name="la lapd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fischer 267" /&gt; and told parents their children had been molested even though their children had denied it.&lt;ref name="fischer 267" /&gt;

Jackson's [[insurance]] company "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" and was "the source of the settlement amounts", as noted in a 2005 memorandum in [[People v. Jackson]].&lt;ref name="mesereau"&gt;Mesereau et al., pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum also noted that "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of [[precedent]]s in California.&lt;ref name="mesereau" /&gt; Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to [[overrule]] the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court)&lt;ref name="precedent stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-reas-prec/index.html#Pre "Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning: 2.

Equally, most appeal courts are bound by their own earlier decisions, though they are generally entitled in certain circumstances to overrule those decisions. There is enormous variation in the circumstances that are necessary for a court to overrule one of its own decisions: at a minimum it must regard the earlier decision as wrongly decided, but generally more is required than this, e.g. that the decision is ‘clearly’ or ‘plainly’ wrong. Finally, courts are generally not bound by the decisions of lower courts"&lt;/ref&gt; or the court must be convinced to [[distinguish]] the case.&lt;ref name="distinguishing stanford" /&gt; That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case.&lt;ref name="distinguishing stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-reas-prec/index.html#PreLayDowRul "Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning: 2.1 Precedents as laying down rules: 2.1.2 The practice of distinguishing"].

==Aftermath==
===General===
A week after the settlement of the Chandler's lawsuit was announced on January 25, 1994,&lt;ref name="campbell 159"&gt;Campbell, p.159&lt;/ref&gt; L.A. District Attorney Gil Garcetti announced he supported amending a law that prohibits forcing people who say they have been sexually assaulted to testify in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name="campbell 163-4"&gt;Campbell, pp.163–164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="desparate usatoday"&gt;Wickham, DeWayne (February 7, 1994).

Three years later, Jordan Chandler's alleged account of the relationship was detailed in a book by journalist Victor M. Gutierrez. The book was said to be based on a diary the boy had kept at the time and included details of alleged sexual encounters between Jackson and him.&lt;ref name = "1993 allegations"/&gt; In 1995, Jackson filed a civil suit against Gutierrez for slander; the jury found in Jackson's favor, awarding him $2.7 million in damages. However, that suit was unrelated to the book and the judgement does not serve to refute the allegations contained within.&lt;ref&gt;url={{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,2828,00.html |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209225608/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0%2C1%2C2828%2C00.html |archivedate=February 9, 2005 |title=Michael Jackson's Victory |last1=Ryan |first1=Joel |date=1998-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Evan Chandler sued Jackson for around $60 million, claiming Jackson had breached an agreement never to discuss the case. In 1999, a court ruled in Jackson's favor and threw out the lawsuit.&lt;ref name = "1993 allegations"/&gt;

But the 1993 case would be revisited again with the 2003 allegations. There was more than a year between Jackson's 2003 arrest and the beginning of his trial and he was prevented by a [[gag order]] from responding to any stories in the media.&lt;ref name="ct shameful" /&gt;  As in 1993, there were leaked documents e.g. Jordan Chandler's 1993 police statement.&lt;ref name="ct shameful" /&gt; The media was again eager to report on the allegations, with a tendency for sensationalism. And allegations sold to tabloid TV shows by disgruntled ex-employees in the 1990s were constantly in the news again.&lt;ref name="ct shameful" /&gt; Also similar to 1993, details of the Arvizo family's 2003 allegations were leaked.&lt;ref name="ct shameful" /&gt; These stories were mostly reported as allegations rather than facts, but the volume and frequency of stories, combined with Jackson's inability to refute them, had a devastating impact on public opinion of him.&lt;ref name="ct shameful" /&gt;

In a 2005 lecture at [[Harvard]] after Jackson's trial, Jackson's attorney [[Thomas Mesereau]] said the following about Jordan Chandler: "The prosecutors tried to get him to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents."&lt;ref name="ct shameful"/&gt; In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a [[barbell]], choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/11/18/2009-11-18_dad_of_jacko_molest_accuser_kills_self_in_swanky_jersey_pad.html |title=Evan Chandler, dad of boy who accused Michael Jackson of molestation, commits suicide in New Jersey |work=NYDailyNews.com |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2010 | first=Bill | last=Hutchinson |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.&lt;ref name="EvanDead1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/6593458/Michael-Jackson-father-of-Jordan-Chandler-shoots-himself-dead.html |title=Michael Jackson: father of Jordan Chandler shoots himself dead |work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=November 17, 2009 | first=Nick | last=Allen | date=November 17, 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091120111346/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/6593458/Michael-Jackson-father-of-Jordan-Chandler-shoots-himself-dead.html| archivedate= November 20, 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music journalist Charles Thomson noted a continued media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson said he was contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid&lt;ref name="ct itstime"/&gt; and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide.&lt;ref name="ct itstime"/&gt; He noted when Jackson's [[FBI]] file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence.&lt;ref name="ct itstime"/&gt; He noted how [[Gene Simmons]]' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, [[Jennifer Batten]], who rebutted Simmons' claims.&lt;ref name="ct itstime"/&gt;

===Effect on Jackson's career===
Jackson's commercial appeal and public image declined in the wake of the case.

The album released prior to the allegations was ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]''.  The album stands as one of the world's best-selling records.&lt;ref name="RIAA certifications"&gt;{{cite web

The last charting single from ''Dangerous'' was the ballad "[[Gone Too Soon]]", released in December 1993 and dedicated to the memory of Jackson's friend [[Ryan White]], a teenager from [[Kokomo, Indiana]], who came to national attention after being expelled from his school for having [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].  A rumored tenth single release of the title track "Dangerous" was canceled.&lt;ref name = "Nelson George overview 45"&gt;George, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Dubai]] barred Jackson from performing in response to an anonymous [[pamphlet]] campaign that attacked him as immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eugene|last=Robinson|date=November 15, 1993|title=Pepsi Drops Elusive Michael Jackson|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After performing 24 shows of the third leg of the Dangerous Tour, Jackson canceled the remainder of the tour to seek treatment for his pain medication addictions.

[[PepsiCo]] stopped all promotional activities with Jackson, ending their ten-year partnership. Jackson's fans responded by boycotting the company.&lt;ref name = "campbell 96-97"/&gt; Jackson had contracted to create a new horror-themed song and video that would be cross-promoted with the film ''[[Addams Family Values]]''. He was unable to finish shooting the video, and his song was dropped from the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|date=November 16, 1993|title=Jackson Being Treated Abroad For Addiction, Lawyer Says|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brand of his-and-hers fragrances was canceled because of Jackson's drug problems at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the marketing group behind the fragrance deal called it "somewhat of a fiasco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Baters|author2=Chuck Philips|date=September 22, 1994|title=With the legal cloud clearing and music as the only certainty in his career, marketing experts tell Michael Jackson: Don't quit your day job|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next studio album was ''[[HIStory]]'', released in the summer of 1995. Jackson also produced a special show for cable-network [[HBO]] titled ''For One Night Only'', with the show to be recorded in front of a special invited audience at [[New York City]]'s [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]] on December 8 and 9, 1995 for transmission on HBO on December 10.  However, the shows were canceled after Jackson collapsed at the theater on December 6 during rehearsals.  Jackson was admitted overnight to Beth Israel Medical Center North. The shows and the HBO special were never rescheduled.  The following year, Jackson began the [[HIStory World Tour]]. Despite the show's success, Jackson's only concerts in the USA were two shows performed at the [[Aloha Stadium]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. Jackson never performed another world tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations also had an effect on the content of Jackson's music: ''HIStory'', which was released shortly after the allegations, "creates an atmosphere of paranoia," according to one writer.&lt;ref name="ALG HIStory"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Erlewine |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r216079|pure_url=yes}} |title=Michael Jackson HIStory Overview |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its content focuses on the public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the songs "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]" and "Tabloid Junkie", along with the ballad "[[You Are Not Alone]]", Jackson directs much of his anger and personal hurt at the media.&lt;ref name="RS HIStory"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Hunter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/albums/album/312830/review/5943497/history_past_present_and_future_book_1

(song)|D.S.]]", Jackson launches a verbal attack against a character who is often cited to be Tom Sneddon, the District Attorney that requested his strip search. He describes the person as an antisocial white supremacist who wanted to "get my ass, dead or alive". Of the song, Sneddon said, "I have not, shall we say, done him the honor of listening to it, but I’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot."&lt;ref name="Sneddon profile"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.ndaa.org/ndaa/profile/tom_sneddon_jan_feb_2003.html |title=Thomas W.

Jackson's last album, ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'', was released six years later, in 2001, his longest period between full studio records. Following a conflict between Jackson and his record label, [[Sony Music]] stopped promoting the album. ''Invincible'' would go on to be seen as a relative commercial disappointment when compared to Jackson's prior solo material, although it sold 13 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Invincible 13 million copies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/we-killed-michael-jackson_b_272174.html |title=We Killed Michael Jackson |author=Tamara Conniff  |work=[[Huffington Post]] |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Jackson's contract with Sony, a number of compilations of greatest hits packaged with previously unreleased material were released, including ''[[Number Ones (Michael Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' in 2003, the 4-CD/1-DVD box set ''[[Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection|The Ultimate Collection]]'' in 2004 and double-album ''[[The Essential Michael Jackson]]'' in 2005.  New agreements between Sony and Michael Jackson saw the release of the singles collection ''[[Visionary: The Video Singles]]'' in 2006, a 25th anniversary edition of ''[[Thriller 25|Thriller]]'' in 2008 and Jackson's final release before his death – the ''[[King of Pop (album)|King of Pop]]'' album celebrating Michael's 50th birthday with tracks voted for by fans.

He then proceeded to call Jackson "Wacko Jacko" and shouting "We got him, we finally got him" to the media, when he had only just began an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence.&lt;ref name="CBSNews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Corey |last=Moss |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480542/20031120/jackson_michael.jhtml |title=Why Is The DA In The Michael Jackson Case Smiling? |publisher=MTV |date=November 20, 2003 |accessdate=November 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071213020019/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480542/20031120/jackson_michael.jhtml| archivedate= December 13, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 child molestation allegations===
On May 1, 2013, a lawyer for choreographer [[Wade Robson]] filed a complaint against the Michael Jackson Estate for "childhood sexual abuse". [[Howard Weitzman]], the lawyer for Jackson's estate, called Robson's accusations "outrageous and pathetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Emily|title=Michael Jackson Estate Calls Wade Robson's Molestation Claims 'Pathetic'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1706987/michael-jackson-wade-robson-molestation-claim.jhtml|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=MTV|date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/08/05/michael-jackson-sex-abuse-code-words-accuser-duck-butter/|title=Michael Jackson Accuser -- MJ Had Secret Code Words For Abusing Me|website=Tmz.com|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Robson appeared on ''[[The Today Show]]'' on May 16, 2013, to discuss the allegations. Robson told interviewer [[Matt Lauer]] that Jackson was "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" who "performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him" over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson was seven years old when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawn|first=Randee|title=Wade Robson: 'Pedophile' Michael Jackson abused me for 7 years|url=http://www.today.com/entertainment/wade-robson-pedophile-michael-jackson-abused-me-7-years-1C9948163|accessdate=January 17, 2014|newspaper=Today|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's "special friend" in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jackson Case: Boys' relatives: Sleepovers were innocent fun|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/17/court.archive.jackson8/index.html|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=CourtTVNews.com|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taraborrelli|first=John|title=Michael Jackson – The Magic and the Madness|publisher=Grand Central|pages=500–507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson said in the ''Today Show'' interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's "complete manipulation and brainwashing" of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail for the rest of our lives." Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Wade Robson calls Michael Jackson 'a pedophile'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/16/showbiz/jackson-sex-accuser/|accessdate=January 17, 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robson filed an amended complaint on July 1, 2013, which stated, "The long-term psychological consequences of (Jackson’s) threats, sexual trauma and mental manipulation imprisoned (Robson’s) mind and prevented him from filing a timely claim just as effectively as if he had been physically imprisoned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dillon|first=Nancy|title=Alleged Michael Jackson molestation victim Wade Robson attempts to file late lawsuit|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/michael-jackson-accuser-eyes-late-lawsuit-article-1.1387721|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2014, the trial for Robson's lawsuit against Jackson's estate for 'childhood sexual abuse' began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Peter|title=Michael Jackson's Aussie accuser Wade Robson gets trial date|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/jacksons-aussie-accuser-gets-trial-date/story-fni0b8dw-1226729236100|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Choreographer in new Jackson 'sexual assault' claim: Friend who used to sleep over at Neverland and defended star at trial now says he was also a victim|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2321078/Michael-Jackson-trial-Choreographer-Wade-Robson-new-sexual-assault-claim.html|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit against the Jackson Estate was dismissed May 26, 2015, by a Los Angeles judge who ruled that Robson waited too long to seek legal action. Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff wrote in his decision that Robson could file a lawsuit "only for a reasonable time period after any violence, intimidation or threatening conduct by the decedent ceases." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jackson-molestation-lawsuit-dismissed-20150528|title=Michael Jackson Molestation Lawsuit Dismissed|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit against the Jackson-owned companies was allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/michael-jackson-child-sex-abuse-molestation-lawsuit-wade-robson-allegation-dismissed-a8120096.html|title=Judge drops Michael Jackson child molestation case|date=December 20, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wade's trial-date in his lawsuit against MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures was set for March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/michael-jackson-ran-elaborate-child-sex-abuse-operation-suit-article-1.2790802|title=Michael Jackson ran the ‘most sophisticated child sexual abuse’ operation in history: suit|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson's lawyer stated that Jackson "operated the most sophisticated child sexual abuse procurement and facilitation operation the world has known", and that while his companies were supposedly "dedicated to creating and distributing Michael Jackson's music and entertainment, it actually served a dual purpose, and that was locating, producing and enabling his sexual abuse of kids". The lawyer for Jackson's estate, Howard Weitzman, stated that "[my] opinion is that summary judgment will be granted in this case and there won’t be any trial, but the court did set a trial date for a year away just in case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/10/hunt-for-the-man-who-first-accused-michael-jackson-of-abusing-him-as-a-child-6767215/|title=Hunt for man who first accused Michael Jackson of abusing him as a child|date=July 10, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2017, Judge Mitchell Beckloff summarily dismissed the case against MJJ Ventures and MJJ Productions, the two remaining defendants, finding they were not liable for Robson's exposure to Jackson.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; The ruling did not comment on the credibility of the allegations, and Robson's attorney stated his intention to appeal.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

===2014 lawsuit===

On August 4, 2014, James Safechuck filed court papers against Jackson's estate which alleged that Jackson abused him after he appeared alongside him in a Pepsi commercial. Howard Weitzman, attorney for the Jackson Estate, stated the whole lawsuit should be scrapped because, "This is a person who made his claim five years after Michael Jackson has passed away, more than 20 years after the incidents supposedly happened, and who has given sworn testimony that Michael never did anything inappropriate to him" [in 1993], and stated that this was just an attempt from Safechuck "to recover money from Jackson's beneficiaries" that should be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Selby|first1=Jenn|title=Michael Jackson hit with new child sex abuse claims more than five years after his death|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/michael-jackson-hit-with-new-sex-abuse-claims-five-years-after-his-death-9650832.html|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/michael-jackson-sex-related-code-words-secret-hand-signals-alleged-victim-article-1.1896302|title=Michael Jackson used sex-related code words, secret hand signals: alleged victim|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safechuck's lawsuit was dismissed on June 28, 2017, due to the statute of limitations having passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/court-throws-case-james-safechuck-sexual-abuse-case-against-michael-jackson-estate/|title=Judge Tosses Sex Abuse Case Against Michael Jackson’s Estate|date=July 10, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 anonymous child molestation lawsuit===

On October 18, 2016, an anonymous woman sued Michael Jackson's Estate, MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, alleging she had been sexually abused by Jackson when she was 12-15, from 1986-1989 in Jackson's Encino home, hotels, the "Smooth Criminal" set, the "Moonwalker" movie set, in the back of his limousine, his Neverland Ranch, and an apartment/condo he nicknamed "The Hideout". She provided letters, love notes allegedly written by Jackson, multiple gifts apparently given by Jackson, a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an Album photo-shoot, checks given to her from 1990-1993 totaling $920,000 sent from Michael Jackson, MJJ Ventures, and MJJ Productions—coming directly from Jackson's back-accounts, and a 1993 LAPD letter asking her to come in and speak to them -- stating that she could provide information regarding claims of child abuse, regarding their investigation. Her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotional/psychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with Jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in September 2016, and that even if she had wanted to she could not possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone, told that she would get in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did, and that Jackson made her promise not to tell anyone. A lawyer for the businesses dismissed the allegations saying, "This is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of Michael Jackson more than seven years after Michael's death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred. We believe this claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit. It's also no coincidence that this woman is represented by the same attorneys involved in two other frivolous claims against the estate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/woman-claims-michael-jackson-molested-child-article-1.2844883|title=Woman claims Michael Jackson molested her as a child|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7.com/entertainment/woman-alleges-michael-jackson-molested-her-as-child-30-years-ago/1573174/|title=Woman alleges Michael Jackson molested her as child 30 years ago|date=October 26, 2016|website=Abc7.com|accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12394">'''Acclimatisation societies''' were [[voluntary association]]s in the 19th and 20th centuries that encouraged the [[introduced species|introduction of non-native species]] in various places around the world with the hope of their [[acclimatization|acclimatisation]] and [[adaptation]]. The motivation at the time was a sense that introducing these [[species]] of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s would enrich the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of a region. These societies were born during a period of [[colonialism]] when Europeans began to settle in unfamiliar environments, and the movement sought to establish familiar plants and animals (mainly from Europe) in new areas while also bringing exotic and useful foreign plants and animals into the European centres. Today it is widely understood that introducing species can be harmful to [[indigenous (ecology)|native species]] and their [[ecosystem]]s; for example, in Australia [[rabbits in Australia|plants were harmed by rabbits' overgrazing]]; in North America [[house sparrow#Introductions|house sparrows displace and kill native birds]]; and around the world, [[salamander]] populations are today threatened by introduced [[mycosis|fungal infections]]. At the time of acclimatisation societies, however, this was insufficiently understood.

A definition of acclimatisation was attempted by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in his entry in the 11th edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911). Here Wallace tried to differentiate the idea from other terms like domestication and naturalization. He noted that a domesticated animal could live in environments controlled by humans. Naturalization, he suggested included the process of acclimatization which involved "gradual adjustment". The idea, at least in France, was associated with [[Lamarckism]] and Wallace noted that there were some like [[Charles Darwin]] who denied the possibility of forcing individual animals to adjust. Wallace however pointed out that there was the possibility that there were variations among individuals and that some could have the ability to adapt to new environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|author=Wallace, Alfred Russel|edition=11|volume=1|pages=114–121|year=1911|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri01chis#page/114/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jardin d'Acclimatation.jpg|thumb|upright|Jardin d'Acclimatation in 1861]]
The first Acclimatisation society was ''La Societé Zoologique d'Acclimatation'' founded in [[Paris]] on 10 May 1854 by [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. It was essentially an offshoot of the Paris museum of natural history and the other staff included [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau|de Bréau]], [[Antoine César Becquerel]] and his son Alexandre. Saint-Hilaire believed in the Lamarckian idea that humans and animals could be forced to adapt to new environments. The Paris society established a branch in Algeria as well as the ''[[Jardin d'Acclimatation|Jardin d' Acclimatation]]'' in Paris in 1861 to showcase not just new animals and plants but also people from other lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Climates of Opinion: Acclimatization in Nineteenth-Century France and England |first=Warwick |last=Anderson |journal= Victorian Studies| volume=35| issue=2| year=1992 | pages=135–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acclimatizing the World: A History of the Paradigmatic Colonial Science |first=Michael A. |last=Osborne |journal=Osiris |volume=15| year=2000| pages=135–151 |doi=10.1086/649323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6580658w/f15.planchecontact  |title= Guide du promeneur au Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation |author=Vavasseur, Pierre|year=1861|publisher=Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation |place=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards in the form of medals were offered for anyone in the colonies to establish breeding animals. The rules were that at least six specimens had to be maintained with at least two instances of breeding in captivity.&lt;ref name=bennett /&gt; After Saint-Hilaire's death in 1861 the Society was headed by [[Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys]], foreign minister to Napoleon III and many of the functionaries were diplomats who established ties with officers in the colonies both French and foreign. Franco-British as well as Franco-Australian ties were involved in the movements of plants and animals. Australian acacias for instance were introduced in Algeria by the French and by the British in South Africa.

== In Britain ==
[[File:Acclimatisation society UK 1861.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Members of the British Society in 1861]]
The British acclimatisation society originated from an idea proposed by the management of ''The Field'' journal. A meeting was held on January 21, 1859, at the [[London Tavern]] on Bishopsgate Street. The attendees included Professor [[Richard Owen]] at the head of the table and the servings included a large pike, American partridges, a young bean goose and an African eland. At the meeting [[David William Mitchell|Mitchell]] and others suggested that many of these exotic animals could live in the British wilderness. Professor Owen wrote in the newspapers later on the taste of the eland and the need for animal introductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life of Frank Buckland|author=Bompas, George C.|url=https://archive.org/stream/lifefrankbuckla01bompgoog#page/n108/mode/2up|pages=99–102|year=1885|publisher=Smith, Elder, &amp; Co.|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 1860, another meeting was held and the Acclimatisation Society was formally founded in London and a year later the Secretary to the Society, [[Francis Trevelyan Buckland|Frank Buckland]], a popular naturalist known for his taste in exotic meats, noted the "success" of the Society in introducing peafowl, common pheasant, swan, starling and linnet into Australia through the efforts of [[Edward Wilson (journalist)|Edward Wilson]]. One of the supporters of the Society was Miss [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Burdett Coutts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Buckland, F.T.|year=1861|title=First Annual Report of the Society for the Acclimatisation of animals, birds, fishes, insects and vegetables within the United Kingdom|url=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_22920#page/n7/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other such societies spread quickly around the world, particularly to European colonies in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. In many instances they existed both as societies for the study of natural history as well as to improve the success rate of introduced species. In 1850, English sparrows were introduced into America and [[Eugene Schieffelin]] introduced starlings in 1890 as part of a plan to introduce all the birds mentioned in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name=jwh&gt;{{cite journal|title=Remaking the land: The Acclimatization Movement and Anglo Ideas of Nature|last=Dunlap| first=Thomas R.|journal=Journal of World History|volume= 8| issue=2| pages=303–319|year=1997| doi=10.1353/jwh.2005.0062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian settler, J. Martin, complained in 1830 that the "trees retained their leaves and shed their bark instead, the swans were black, the eagles white, the bees were stingless, some mammals had pockets, others laid eggs, it was warmest on the hills..." It was here that the desire to make the land feel more like England was strongest. The
Acclimatisation Society of Victoria was established in 1861. Speaking at the Society, [[George Bennett (naturalist)|George Bennett]] pointed out how it was important to have such an organisation, citing the example of the Earl of Knowsley who had been conducting successful experiments in private whose results had been lost with his death.&lt;ref name=bennett&gt;{{cite book|title=Acclimatisation: its eminent adaptation to Australia|author=Bennett, George|publisher=William Goodhugh &amp; Co.|place=Melbournce|year=1862|url=https://archive.org/stream/acclimatisation00unkngoog#page/n6/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major proponent of importing and exporting trees and plants was [[Ferdinand von Mueller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Forest Culture and Eucalyptus Trees|author=Cooper, Ellwood| publisher=Cubery and Company| place=San Francisco| year=1876|pages=9–84|url=https://archive.org/stream/forestcultureeuc00coopuoft#page/10/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introductions of commercially valuable species or game species were also made. In some instances the results were disastrous, such as the economic and ecological effects of [[Rabbits in Australia|introducing rabbits to Australia]] or [[Common brushtail possum in New Zealand|possums to New Zealand]]. The disastrous effects were rapidly felt and a Rabbit Nuisance Act was passed in 1876 in New Zealand. To make matters worse, the suggestion was made that weasels and stoats could control the rabbits. Despite warnings from [[Alfred Newton]] and others, these predators were introduced and [[Herbert Guthrie-Smith]] declared it as an "attempt to correct a blunder by a crime."&lt;ref name=jwh /&gt;

In 1893, [[Theodore Sherman Palmer|T.S. Palmer]] of California wrote on the dangers of animal introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palmer, T.S. |year=1893|title= The Dangers of Introducing Noxious Animals and Birds.|publisher=Department of Agriculture|url=https://archive.org/stream/dangerofintroduc00palmrich#page/86/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the editors of the Avicultural Magazine were decidedly against the idea of bird introductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Foreign birds for London Parks |pages=48–50 |year= 1906| journal=Avicultural Magazine| volume=5| issue=1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/aviculturalmaga02socigoog#page/n74/mode/2up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the field of [[ecology]] transformed expert and public opinion on introductions and gave way to new rules. Quarantine regulations began to be set up instead. Beginning in New Zealand, some of the acclimatisation societies transformed themselves into fish and game organizations.&lt;ref name=jwh /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1021">An '''adverse food reaction''' is an [[adverse]] response by the body to [[food]] or a specific type of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gt66.htm+t780 | work=World Health Organisation |title=ICD code T78.1 | date=2007 | accessdate=21 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726090503/http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gt66.htm+t780| archivedate= 26 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common adverse reaction is a [[food allergy]], which is an adverse [[immune response]] to either a specific type or a range of food [[protein]]s.

However, other adverse responses to food are not allergies.  These reactions include responses to food such as [[food intolerance]], pharmacological reactions, and toxin-mediated reactions, as well as physical responses, such as [[choking]].

'''''Al-Dostor '''''(also '''''Al-Dostour''''' and '''''Al-Dustour''''')  ({{lang-ar|'''الدستور'''|translation=The Constitution}}, [[Egyptian Arabic]]: {{IPA-arz|eldosˈtuːr, edːosˈtuːr|}}), is an independent  Daily [[Egypt]]ian opposition newspaper.

==History and profile==
''Al Dustour'' was first published in December 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeffrey Black|title=Egypt’s Press: More free, still fettered|journal=Arab Media &amp; Society|date=January 2008|url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20080114230358_AMS4_Jeff_Black.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nathalie Bernard-Maugiron|title=Freedom of the press in Egypt: Checks and Balances|journal=Law Journal Library|date=1999|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/yislamie6&amp;type=Text&amp;id=50|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is published weekly in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rasha Allam|title=Media Landscapes. Egypt|url=http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/egypt|publisher=European Journalism Centre|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was originally published with a registration in [[Cyprus]] in order to get around the restrictive newspaper publication laws in Egypt during the [[Mubarak]] era. It was financed by Essam Fahmy Ismail, who chose its original [[editor in chief]], [[Ibrahim Eissa]]. In 2010, Essam Fahmy agreed to sell the newspaper to Reda Edouard, a businessman with alleged connections to the ruling regime, who remains at the head of the newspaper's board today. Edouard replaced Eissa with Esam Nabawy.&lt;ref name="madamasrboss"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ibrahim Eissa is “The Boss,” but at what cost?|url=http://madamasr.com/content/ibrahim-eissa-%E2%80%9C-boss%E2%80%9D-what-cost|accessdate=5 May 2014|work=Mada Masr|date=28 April 2014|author=Heba Afify|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504164610/http://www.madamasr.com/content/ibrahim-eissa-%E2%80%9C-boss%E2%80%9D-what-cost|archive-date=2014-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It started as a weekly newspaper published on Wednesdays. It later came to be issued both daily and weekly. ''Al-Dostour'''s popularity grew quickly after its founding. It became known for its colloquial style and wide use of cartoons.&lt;ref name=madamasrboss/&gt; The paper published articles on current affairs written by various leading figures of the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite web|author=Dina Shehata|title=Mapping Islamic Actors in Egypt|url=http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/mapping-islamic-actors---version-2.2.pdf|publisher=Islam Research Program|accessdate=6 October 2014|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Al-Dustour'' and the Egyptian government==
Since the day of its first issue, ''Al-Dustour'' has been harshly critical of the government, formerly that of the Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]], his family, and the former ruling party, [[The National Democratic Party (Egypt)|The National Democratic Party]] (NDP). It was one of Egypt’s top critics of Mubarak’s 30-year rule. It introduced unprecedented cartoons of Mubarak &lt;ref name="madamasrboss"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and showed sharp opposition to his son [[Gamal Mubarak]]'s likely succession to power. 

In 1998, ''Al-Dustour'' published a statement attributed to the [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] militant group in 1998, that threatened the lives of three Christian businessmen. The [[Ministry of Information (Egypt)|Egyptian Ministry of Information]] closed down the paper. It considered the statement unacceptable and a potential cause of sectarian strife. Seven years later, on March 23, 2005, the paper was revived, initially being published every Wednesday, and since 31 March 2007 it has been issued both daily and weekly.

In 2007, ''Al-Dustour's'' former editor-in-chief, [[Ibrahim Eissa]], was arrested, then freed on bail on 13 September 2007 pending an appellate court decision in a sentence of a year-long prison term and a fine of 20,000 Egyptian Pound (≈ US$ 3,800 at the time). He and three other independent Egyptian newspaper editors, Wael El Abrashy of ''Sawt Al-Umma'', Adel Hammouda of ''Al-Fajr'', and ''Al-Karama'''s former editor Abdel Halim Kandil, were charged with "insulting the Egyptian president and publishing false information likely to disturb public order."&lt;ref name = 1stAccusation&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cpj.org/news/2007/mideast/egypt13sep07na.html|title=Egypt: Four editors sentenced to jail|publisher=CPJ|date=13 September 2007|accessdate=12 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in a separate case, [[Ibrahim Eissa|Eissa]] was again arrested and sentenced to six months, later reduced to two months in prison,&lt;ref name = PARDON&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ifex.org/egypt/2008/10/09/editor_previously_sentenced_to/| title=Editor previously sentenced to prison granted presidential pardon|publisher=International Freedom of Expression eXchange|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 March 2008, by the Boulak Abo El Ela Court of Misdemeanor for publishing "false information concerning Mubarak's health harming public security and the country's economy" due to articles and headlines in ''Al-Dustour'' speculating on the health of the 80-year-old president. Governmental authorities alleged that Eissa's articles caused a withdrawal of foreign investment in the Egyptian economy equivalent to US$ 350 million. Eissa was freed, a second time, on bail of 200 EP (≈ US$ 37 at the time) to hold off on implementation of the verdict until another appeal.&lt;ref name = 2ndAccusation&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/mideast/egypt26mar08na.html|title=Egypt: Leading independent editor sentenced to six months in jail|publisher=CPJ|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2008, [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] announced that he would pardon Eissa,&lt;ref name="PARDON"/&gt; the first time that such a pardon had been issued in the history of the modern Egyptian press. ''Al-Dustour'' praised the pardon{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} in its pages and asked the president to honor his promise to cancel custodial sentences in cases of publication.

The paper has continued its opposition role under new President [[Mohamed Morsi]]. In September 2012, its former editor-in-chief, Islam Afify, was charged by a Cairo court with "defaming the president" and "harming the public interest with inflammatory articles'" &lt;ref name="egyptindependent.com"&gt;Rizk, M. (22 October 2012). [http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/al-dostour-editor-chief-islam-afify-resigns-after-editorial-pressure Al-Dostour Editor-in-Chief Islam Afify resigns after 'editorial pressure] ''Egypt Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; and his travel privileges were revoked. ''Al-Dustour'' frequently criticized the Muslim Brotherhood, accusing it of intentions to make Egypt an Islamic state. Afify was jailed temporarily but later released due to the new president's decision to end pretrial detention for journalists.

At the time of Mubarak's departure (February 2011), ''Al-Dostour'' was the fifth largest daily newspaper in Egypt, with a daily edition selling 45,000 and weekly edition selling 85,000 copies.

On 28 March 2014 the 22-year-old photograph and journalist of the newspaper [[Mayada Ashraf]] was killed among three others, in the clashes between the demonstrators and the security forces in the suburb of [[Ain Shams]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/28/world/meast/egypt-violence/ Egypt: Journalist killed in Cairo clashes] CNN. 28 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4304">'''ʿAnbasa ibn Suḥaym al-Kalbi''' ({{Lang-ar| عنبسة بن سحيم الكلبي}}) was the Muslim [[wali]] (governor) of [[al-Andalus]], from 721 to 726.

Immediately after his appointment, Anbasa doubled taxes on Christians;&lt;ref name="Blankinship1994"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Khalid Yahya Blankinship|title=The End of the Jihad State: The Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz0Yy053WS4C&amp;pg=PA89|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn= 978-0-7914-1827-7|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is thought that this increase did not affect most of the recently conquered estates and towns, subdued by treaty on very specific conditions (taxes, land ownership, etc.), but lands under direct Arab rule and new towns being conquered in [[Septimania]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. (1989) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, a dynastic struggle arose among Muslims in the Middle East. It was sparked by the death of [[Caliph]] [[Yazid II]] and the succession of his brother, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] in 724. On this account, Anbasa tried to please the demands imposed by the Caliph to further tax exaction on non-Muslims, with attempts being made to enforce it on non-Arab Muslims too; there was a popular rebellion in Egypt in 725 for increase in taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 0-631-19405-3|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, this more rigorous approach may have provided legal shelter and security to ownership in [[al-Andalus]].

These actions caused displeasure, scattered acts of disobedience, as well as some open revolts. During his tenure in office, [[Pelagius of Asturias]], defied the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] attempt to extract taxes in the mountains of [[Asturias]], where he gathered a band of rebellious followers. An Umayyad patrol was sent to search for Pelagius and his men, and it was ambushed at the [[Battle of Covadonga]] at great loss of life according to heavily mythical Christian sources, a skirmish according to later Muslim chroniclers, who showed little concern for the episode;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1983 | title = Early Medieval Spain | publisher = St. Martin's Press |location = New York|isbn= 0-312-22464-8|p = 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mozarabic Chronicle'' of 754, a Christian and only almost contemporary account of the major events taking place in Hispania doesn't mention it. In retrospect, these events are viewed by some as the beginning of the [[Reconquista]], an effort by Christian kingdoms to wrest control of Hispania from the Muslims.

Following the major [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Ummayyad defeat in Toulouse (721)]] resulting in [[Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani]]'s death, Anbasa dispatched several military expeditions into [[Septimania]], and managed to capture the Visigothic town of [[Carcassonne]] in 724 (or 725), as well as [[Nîmes]], the latter without resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. (1989) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to lead an expedition to the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]], a Frankish territory, as far north as [[Autun]]. However, he died of natural causes in this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. (1989) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a flow of refugees found shelter in southern [[Duchy_of_Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] and [[Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. (1989) p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as wali by [[Udrra ben Abd Allah al-Fihrí]], who after a few months, was replaced by [[Yahya ibn Salama al-Kalbi]]. Yahya denounced the injustices of the policies of Anbasa, especially with respect to the collection of taxes and the confiscation of property.

"Arshak II" is the first “Armenian grand opera” with choruses and ballets. It was partially staged in 1873, assembled on November 29, 1945 at the [[Armenian Opera Theater]] in [[Yerevan]] and was awarded by the USSR State Prize in 1946. ''Arshak II'' is a "gem" of [[Armenia]]n musical culture. In 2001, it was staged at the [[San Francisco Opera]]. [[Pavel Lisitsian]], Mihran Yerkat, [[Tigran Levonyan]] were among the performers of Arshak's role.

'''''Auto Focus''''' is a 2002 American [[biographical film]] directed by [[Paul Schrader]], starring [[Greg Kinnear]] and [[Willem Dafoe]]. The screenplay by Michael Gerbosi is based on [[Robert Graysmith]]'s book ''The Murder of Bob Crane'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/28/AR2007022801979.html | work=The Washington Post | first=William | last=Booth | title=A Killer Obsession | date=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Murder of Bob Crane: Who Killed the Star of Hogan's Heroes? |date=May 18, 1993| author= Graysmith, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Auto Focus'' tells a dramatized story of actor [[Bob Crane]], an affable radio show host and amateur drummer who found success on ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', a popular television [[situation comedy|sitcom]], and his dramatic descent into the underbelly of Hollywood after the series was cancelled, and after forming a friendship with [[John Henry Carpenter]].

As of today, Crane's murder remains unsolved. Although Carpenter was tried and [[acquittal|acquitted]] of the crime, he remained the subject of suspicion even after his death in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34357/motion-picture-purgatory-auto-focus |title=Motion Picture Purgatory: Auto Focus| website=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Disc-jockey-turned-actor [[Bob Crane]] develops a secret personal life, focusing on his relationship with [[John Henry Carpenter]], an electronics expert involved with the nascent [[Videocassette recorder#First home video recorders|home video]] market. Encouraged by Carpenter and enabled by his expertise, Crane&amp;mdash;a church-going, clean-cut family man&amp;mdash;becomes a [[sexual addiction|sex addict]] obsessed with women and with recording his encounters using video and photographic equipment, usually with Carpenter participating.

As years pass, the relationship between Crane and Carpenter unravels in a dangerous way. Crane is divorced by two wives, first Anne and then Patty, a former co-star from his hit television series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''. After the show goes off the air, Crane struggles to find work while dealing with money troubles. By the time [[Walt Disney Productions]] hires him for the leading role in a family movie, his reputation for being obsessed by sex and pornography starts to jeopardize his image.

Confined to doing dinner theater in mid-sized cities, Crane's attempts to distance himself from Carpenter fail as their sexual escapades continue. Carpenter soon becomes "my only friend," but after a final falling-out between them in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], someone bludgeons Crane to death inside a motel room. Carpenter is tried for the murder, but not until many years later, when he is [[acquittal|acquitted]]. Crane's murder remains unsolved.

==Production notes==
The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[San Sebastián Film Festival]], the [[Helsinki International Film Festival]], the [[Chicago International Film Festival]], the New Orleans Film Festival, and the [[Bergen International Film Festival]] before going into limited release on eleven screens in the US, earning $123,761 on its opening weekend. It grossed $2,063,196 in the US and $641,755 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $2,704,951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=autofocus.htm |website=BoxOfficeMojo.com|title=Auto Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DVD]] release includes a 50-minute [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''Murder in Scottsdale,'' which delves into the initial murder investigation and the reopening of the case some 15 years later.{{citation needed|date= December 2014}}

The DVD also features several audio commentary tracks. Greg Kinnear and Willem Dafoe can be heard joking about how the stylist made up Kinnear’s hair to resemble Bob Crane's. A quick online search for photos of the real Bob Crane reveals that, while taking pains to match Crane's hair color and thickness as Kinnear noted,  the stylist parted his hair on the wrong side.

==Critical reception==
The film met with a largely positive reception from critics.  A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film "gets to you like a low-grade fever, a malaise with no known antidote. When it was over, I wasn't sure if I needed a drink, a shower or a lifelong vow of [[chastity]] ... there is [a] severe, powerful moralism lurking beneath the film's dispassionate matter-of-factness. Mr. Schrader is indifferent to the sinner, but he cannot contain his loathing of the sin, which is not so much sex as the fascination with images ... To argue that images can corrupt the flesh and hollow out the soul is, for a filmmaker, an obviously contradictory exercise, but not necessarily a hypocritical one. There is plenty of nudity in ''Auto Focus,'' but you can always glimpse the abyss behind the undulating bodies, and the director leads you from easy titillation to suffocating dread, pausing only briefly and cautiously to consider the possibility of pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/04/movies/04AUTO.html |work=The New York Times|date= October 4, 2002|author=Scott, A.O.|title=Movies: Auto Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars calling it "a hypnotic portrait ... pitch-perfect in its decor, music, clothes, cars, language and values ... Greg Kinnear gives a creepy, brilliant performance as a man lacking in all insight ... Crane was not a complex man, but that should not blind us to the subtlety and complexity of Kinnear's performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ebert, Robert| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021025/REVIEWS/210250302/1023 |work=Chicago Sun-Times| date= October 25, 2002|title=Reviews: Auto Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it "a compelling, sympathetic portrait ... Kinnear undercuts the seaminess of the Crane story, and shows us a man with more dimension and complexity than his behavior might suggest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Guthmann, Edward| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/10/25/DD81502.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle| title=Review: Auto Focus| date= October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded it 3½ out of 4 stars and added, "Schrader, the writer of ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and the director of ''[[American Gigolo]]'', is a poet of male sexual pathology. Shot through with profane laughs and stinging drama, ''Auto Focus'' ranks with his best films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Travers, Peter| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949379/review/5949380/auto_focus |work=Rolling Stone|date= October 17, 2002| title=Movie Reviews: Auto Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "one of director Paul Schrader's best films, and like ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' ranks as a shrewd exposé of recent Hollywood's slimy underside ... Schrader directs with a very smooth hand, providing a good-natured and frequently amusing spin to eventually grim material that aptly reflects the protagonist's almost unfailing good humor ... Pic overall has an excellent [[L.A.]] period feel without getting elaborate about it, and musical contributions by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] and a host of pop tunes are tops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Schrader, Paul| title=Review: Auto Focus| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117918591.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 |work= Variety| date= September 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 71% based on 161 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 6.6/10.

==Criticism by Scotty Crane==
Bob Crane's son, Scotty, bitterly attacked the film as being inaccurate. In an October 2002 piece he wrote on the movie, Scotty said that his father was not a regular church-goer and had only been to church three times in the last dozen years of his life, including his own funeral. There is no evidence that Crane engaged in [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]], and director Paul Schrader told Scotty that the S&amp;M scene was based on Schrader's own personal experience. Scotty claims that his father and John Carpenter did not become close friends who socialized together until 1975, and that Crane was a sex addict long before he became a star, recording his sexual encounters at least as early as 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Scotty|title=Raging Bullshit: Auto Focus Is Not My Dad's Story|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/raging-bullshit/Content?oid=12356|publisher=The Stranger|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotty and his mother had shopped a rival script for a Bob Crane movie biography. The spec script, alternately titled "F-Stop" and "Take Off Your Clothes and Smile", was written up in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' by venerable columnist [[Army Archerd]], but after ''Auto-Focus'' was announced, interest in Scotty's script ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Bob Crane|url=http://mortystv.com/bob_crane.shtml|publisher=Morty's TV.com|accessdate=14 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094408/http://mortystv.com/bob_crane.shtml| archivedate= 24 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==

{{Anti-Tamil riots in Sri Lanka}}
'''Black July''' ({{lang-ta|கறுப்பு யூலை|translit=Kaṟuppu Yūlai}}; {{lang-si|කළු ජූලිය}} ''Kalu Juliya'') is the common name used to refer to the anti-[[Tamil people|Tamil]] pogrom&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kGBBq-vmEyYC&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Community, Gender and Violence, edited by Partha Chatterjee, Pradeep Jeganathan]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic riot|riots]] in [[Sri Lanka]] during July 1983. The riots began as a "response" to a [[Four Four Bravo|deadly ambush]] on 23 July 1983 by the LTTE ([[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]), one of the many [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|Tamil militant group]] of that time. The LTTE had killed 13 [[Sri Lanka Army]] soldiers in the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nidheesh |first1=MK |title=Book review: The Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by Neena Gopal |url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/vGvHn61alReQUEO4HV42EP/Book-review-The-Assassination-of-Rajiv-Gandhi-by-Neena-Gopa.html |accessdate=1 November 2018 |publisher=Live Mint |date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction, beginning in the capital [[Colombo]] on the night of 24 July 1983, anti-Tamil pogroms spread to other parts of the country.

==Background==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--first 3 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
{{Main|Origins of the Sri Lankan civil war}}
During the [[British Ceylon|colonial period]], many Sri Lankan Tamils, particularly those from the [[Jaffna peninsula]], took advantage of educational facilities established by [[missionaries]]. They were also benefited by the British policy of [[divide and rule]], which placed minorities in positions of power in colonies and soon dominated the civil service and other professions. When Sri Lanka became independent ([[Dominion status]])in 1948, a majority of government jobs were held by Tamils, who were a minority of the country's population. The elected leaders saw this as the result of a British stratagem to control the [[majority]] [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]], and they deemed it a situation that needed correction.

In 1956 the Official Language Act, commonly known as the [[Sinhala Only Act]], was introduced. Up until that time [[English language|English]], spoken by only five percent of the population, had been the sole [[official language]]." The use of [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], spoken by 75 percent, and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], spoken by 25 percent, had been severely restricted during British colonial times. This was reversed by the new Sinhala government, by replacing English with Sinhala  as the official language. Protests against the Sinhala Only policy by Tamils and by the [[Sri Lanka leftist parties|leftist parties]] were met with mob violence that eventually snowballed into the [[Sri Lankan riots of 1958|riots of 1958]]. Political parties and groups representing Tamilain Sri Lankans felt that the implementation of the Sinhala Only Act deprived the Tamil populations in the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|north]] and [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|east]] of the country of their right to fully integrate into government institutions. They saw this as an injustice brought upon this ethnic minority.

In 1958, the Tamil political leadership acquiesced to a formula of Sinhala as the official language, but with the "reasonable use of Tamil". Only the leftist parties opposed this, holding out for parity of status between the two languages. However, after the Tamil people gave an overwhelming mandate to the [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Tamil nationalist]] [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi]] (Federal Party), which had agreed to a subordinate status for the Tamil language, the leftist parties eventually abandoned parity of status.

Throughout the 1960s, protests and state repression against these protests created further animosity. In 1972, the [[policy of standardisation]] that affected Tamils' entry into universities strained the already tenuous political relationship between the elites of the Tamil and Sinhalese communities. The quota entitlement in political representation became another cause for contention between Sinhala and Tamil people. There was also a series of [[Sri Lankan riots of 1977|ethnic riots in 1977]] following the [[United National Party]]'s (UNP) coming to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajasingham-Senanayake|first=Darini|title=Dysfunctional Democracy and the Dirty War in Sri Lanka|journal=AsiaPacific Issues|date=May 2001|issue=52|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/sites/default/files/private/api052.pdf|accessdate=1 August 2006|publisher=[[East–West Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the renowned public library in [[Jaffna]] was [[Burning of Jaffna library|burnt down]] by a violent mob. The Jaffna Library was well known at the time as a nexus of Tamil activity, with various Tamil groups vying for control. Until 1983, there were similar incidents of low level violence between the government and the mushrooming Tamil militant groups. There were many murders, disappearances, and cases of torture attributed to both sides.

On 23 July 1983 at around 11:30 pm, the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (the Tamil Tigers or the LTTE) ambushed the [[Four Four Bravo]] military patrol in [[Thirunelveli (Sri Lanka)|Thirunelveli]] near [[Jaffna]] in northern Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|pp=63–64}} A road-side bomb was detonated beneath the jeep that was leading the convoy, injuring at least two soldiers onboard. Soldiers traveling in a truck behind the jeep dismounted to help their colleagues. They were ambushed by a group of Tamil Tiger fighters who fired at them with [[automatic weapon]]s and hurled [[grenade]]s at them. In the ensuing clashes, one officer and twelve soldiers were killed immediately, and two more were fatally wounded. The total death toll was fifteen. A number of the rebels were also killed.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=21}} [[Kittu (Tamil militant)|Kittu]], a regional commander of the LTTE later admitted to planning and carrying out the ambush.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=21}} This attack has been described as a retaliation for the killing of one of the LTTE's founding members, [[Charles Lucas Anthony|Charles Anthony]], by Sri Lankan forces&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=iSUKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3267&amp;dq=in+retaliation+for+the+murder+of+Charles+Antony&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin_-X25-PKAhVM8GMKHalJCkAQ6wEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20retaliation%20for%20the%20murder%20of%20Charles%20Antony&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-11-07|isbn = 9781135193959|language = en|first = Carl|last = Skutsch|quote = "Tensions reached a breaking point on July 23, 1983 when the LTTE ambushed and killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers in retaliation for the murder of Charles Antony, the LTTE's second-in-command."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a retaliation for the abduction and rape of some Tamil school girls by the government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The massacres in Sri Lanka during the Black July riots of 1983|url = http://www.massviolence.org/The-Black-July-riots-1983|website = Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence|date = 2008-05-13|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en|first = Eleanor|last = Pavey|quote = "Even though the origins of the 1983 riots were widely attributed to the killing of 13 Sinhalese soldiers by Tamil rebels, many Tamils point out that it was the abduction and rape—by government forces—of three Tamil schoolgirls that led Tamil rebels to attack government forces.

==Black July==
===Sunday, 24 July===
The Army, including its [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Commander]] [[Tissa Weeratunga]], didn't want the soldiers' funerals to be held in Jaffna. And because of possible disturbances at multiple locations, they didn't want to hand the bodies over to their families.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=66}}{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=21}} So the decision was made at the highest level to hold the funeral, with full military honours, at [[Colombo]]'s General Cemetery at Kanatte.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=66}} [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]], fearing violence, was against holding the funeral in Colombo, but [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] [[J. R. Jayewardene]] overruled him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooray|first=B. Sirisena|title=President Premadasa and I: Our Story|publisher=Dayawansa Jayakody &amp; Company|year=2002|isbn=955-551-280-9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7nYhJAAACAAJ|pp=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President, the Prime Minister, and the rest of the [[Cabinet of Sri Lanka|Cabinet]] were to attend the funeral, which was to take place at 5pm on 24 July. This plan was against the standard procedure of burying the fallen soldiers in their home villages.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=21}}

Preparations were made for the funeral, and the riot squad at Borella Police Station was put on stand-by. But by 5pm the bodies hadn't arrived in Colombo.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=67}} The soldiers' families wanted the bodies handed over to them to be buried according to tradition. Due to procedural issues, the bodies were still at Palali Army Camp near Jaffna.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=67}} The bodies were eventually moved from [[Palali Airport|Palali Air Force Base]] shortly after 6pm. Back at Colombo General Cemetery, tensions were growing because of the delay, and a large crowd, including around 3,000 people from the Wanathamulla [[List of slums in Sri Lanka|slum]], started gathering at the cemetery, angered by news of the ambush, which was magnified by wild rumour.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=67}} The [[Avro]] plane which was carrying the bodies arrived at [[Ratmalana Airport]] at 7:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. by which time the crowd at the cemetery had swollen to more than 8,000.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=67}} The crowd wanted the bodies to be handed over to the families rather than to be buried at the cemetery. Violence broke out between the crowd and police, and the riot squad was summoned. The riot squad fired tear gas at the crowd and baton-charged them before handing control of the situation over to the Army. The President then decided to cancel the military funeral and hand the bodies over to the families.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=68}} The vehicles carrying the bodies had been driven away from Ratmalana at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and the drivers were heading to the cemetery. But they were diverted to Army Headquarters so that they could be handed over to the families. The crowd at the cemetery was informed of the President's decision at around 10pm.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=68}} The crowd left the cemetery in a restive mood.

A section of the crowd marched up D. S. Senanayake Mawatha to nearby [[Borella]], where they destroyed Tamil-owned Nagalingam Stores.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=68}} The mob, which by that time numbered around 10,000, attacked, looted, and set fire to any building near Borella junction that had a Tamil connection, including Borella Flats and the [[Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club]].{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=68}} Then houses belonging to Tamils in the neighbourhood were targeted. The police fired tear gas at the crowd, but after exhausting all of their stock, they were forced to fire rifles into the air.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}} The crowd then dispersed in the direction of [[Dematagoda]], [[Maradana]], [[Narahenpita]], [[Grandpass]] and Thimbirigasyaya, where they attacked and looted Tamil properties and set them on fire.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}} Members of underworld criminal gangs then joined in.

===Monday, 25 July===
President Jayewardene met the country's Security Council at the [[President's House, Colombo]] at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 25 July. A hundred yards away the Bristol building, the Tamil-owned Ambal Cafe, was ablaze.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}} Also close by on York Street, the Tamil-owned clothier Sarathas was ablaze as well.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}} Soon all the Tamil-owned shops on Baillie Street opposite the President's House were on fire. Every Tamil-owned business in the [[Fort (Colombo)|Fort]] area was on fire by the time the Security Council meeting finished.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}} The President ordered a [[curfew]] in Colombo from 6pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Travellers warned on Sri Lankan strife|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=9fRKRCJz75UC&amp;dat=19830726&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[The Free Lance–Star]]/[[Associated Press]]|date=26 July 1983|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TT260783&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobs burn shops in Sri Lanka|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=kccl&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS17403130&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|newspaper=[[The Times]]/[[Reuters]]|date=26 July 1983|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mob moved on to Olcott Mawatha, where they set fire to the Tamil-owned [[thosai]] boutique Ananda Bhawan, oilman store Rajeswari Stores, and Ajantha Hotel.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}}

The rioting had spread to the slums of Canal Bank, Grandpass, Hattewatte, [[Kirilapone]], [[Kotahena]], Maradana, [[Modera]], [[Mutwal]], Narahenpita, [[Slave Island]], and Wanathamulla by 10am. Mobs armed with crow bars and kitchen knives roamed the streets, attacking and killing Tamils.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}} [[Wellawatte]] and [[Dehiwala]], which contained the largest number of Tamils in Colombo, were the next target of the mob. Homes and shops were attacked, looted, and destroyed.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=69}} Tamil shops on Main Street and Bo Tree Junction were also attacked.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|pp=69–70}} The riots then spread to the middle class residential areas of Anderson Flats, Elvitigala Flats, Torrington Flats, and Thimbirigasyaya. Tamil targets in the exclusive [[Cinnamon Gardens]] were also attacked as were those in the suburbs of [[Kadawatha]], [[Kelaniya]], [[Nugegoda]] and [[Ratmalana]].{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=70}} The [[India House (Colombo)|residence]] of the [[India]]n [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] was also attacked and ransacked.&lt;ref name=TT260783/&gt; By lunchtime, virtually the entire city was on fire. The curfew was brought forward to 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and then to 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., and it was extended to [[Gampaha District]] due to the violence spreading as far as [[Negombo]].{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=70}} In [[Kalutara]] the TKVS Stores were set on fire. The owner jumped out of an upstairs window, but the mob threw him back into the fire.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=71}} The curfew was extended to [[Kalutara District]].

The police were unwilling, or unable, to enforce the curfew.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=23}} The army was then called in to assist the police.

The rioters were then becoming organised, using voter registration lists to target Tamils.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=71}} The possession of electoral lists by the mobs, which enabled them to identify Tamil homes and property, implied prior organization and cooperation by elements of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The massacres in Sri Lanka during the Black July riots of 1983|url = http://www.massviolence.org/The-Black-July-riots-1983|website = Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence|date = 2008-05-13|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en|first = Eleanor|last = Pavey|quote = "The systematic and well-planned nature of the attacks against the Tamils - to which the government itself later alluded - ruled out the spontaneous outburst of anti-Tamil hatred within the Sinhalese masses.

Outside of the [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]], there was violence in [[Galle]], [[Kegalle]], [[Trincomalee]] and [[Vavuniya]] on 25 July.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=74}}

The mobs were equipped with voter registration lists. There was burning and attacking mainly of Tamil residences and businesses. And army and government officials were late in being deployed to control the mob. All of this gave credence to the idea that it had been an organised attack with support at the government level. While a number of Tamils fled the city, many Sinhalese and [[Sri Lankan Moors|Muslim]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s saved the lives and properties of Tamils despite the activities of the gangs.

The mob attacks continued in Wellawatte and Dehiwala on 26 July. There were 53 houses on Ratnakara Road. The 24 Tamil owned/occupied houses were burnt.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=72}} Three houses were owned by Sinhalese but were rented by Tamils.

In Trincomalee, false rumours started spreading that the LTTE had captured Jaffna, that the Karainagar Naval Base had been destroyed, and that the Naga Vihare had been desecrated.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|pp=74–75}} Sailors based at [[SLN Dockyard|Trincomalee Naval Base]] went on a rampage, attacking Central Road, Dockyard Road, Main Street, and North Coast Road.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=75}} The sailors started 170 fires before returning to their base.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=75}} The Sivan Hindu temple on Thirugnasambandan Road had also been attacked.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=75}}

The curfew was extended nationwide on 26 July as a precautionary measure. There were more outbreaks of violence and looting against Tamils in areas where various ethnic groups coexisted .&lt;ref name=TH280783/&gt; By the evening of the 26 July the mob violence began to slacken off as police and army units patrolled the streets in large numbers and began to take action against the rioters.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=24}} The soldiers killed in the Thirunelveli ambush were quietly buried during the night curfew.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=24}}

The daytime curfew in Colombo was lifted on 27 July, and the day began in relative calm. But then at [[Fort Railway Station]], a train heading for Jaffna was stopped as it was pulling out of Platform One after cartridges were found on the track. Sinhalese passengers on the train started attacking Tamil passengers, killing twelve.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=76}} Some Tamils were burnt alive on the railway tracks.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=76}}

===Thursday, 28 July===
Badulla was still on fire on 28 July, and the rioting spread from Lunugala to Passara.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=77}} There was also rioting in [[Nuwara Eliya]] and [[Chilaw]].{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=77}} But the violence had subsided in Colombo, Kandy, and Trincomalee.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=77}}

President Jayewardene and his cabinet met in an emergency session on 28 July.

He blamed the violence committed by the Tamil militants for the way "the Sinhalese people themselves have reacted".{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=78}} Jayewardene vowed that the "Sinhalese people will never agree to the division of a country which has been a united nation for 2,500 years [sic]" and announced that the government would "accede to the clamour...of the Sinhalese people" and ban any party which sought to divide the nation.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|pp=78–79}}&lt;ref name=TT290783/&gt;

===Friday, 29 July===
Colombo was still calm on 29 July. Tamil residents were visiting their friends and relatives who had taken refuge in the many refugee camps in the city. But at around 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. two Sinhalese youths were shot on Gas Works Street.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=80}} A large crowd gathered at the scene, and soon rumours started circling that the youths had been shot by Tamil Tigers in the Adam Ali building.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=80}} The building was surrounded by the army, navy, and police who proceeded to fire at the building using [[submachine gun]]s and [[semi-automatic rifle]]s.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=80}} A helicopter also fired at the building with a machine gun. The security forces stormed the building but found no Tamil Tigers, weapons, or ammunitions inside.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|pp=80–81}} Rumours began to spread around Colombo that the army was engaged in a battle with the Tamil Tigers.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=81}} Panicking workers began to flee in any mode of transport they could find.

Badulla, Kandy, and Trincomalee were calm on 29 July but there was violence in Nuwara Eliya where around midday. The Tamil-owned Ganesan and Sivalingam stores were attacked and set on fire.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=82}} The violence then spread to Bazaar Street and Lawson Road.{{sfn|Dissanayake|2004|p=82}} Violence was also reported in [[Kegalle District]] and [[Matara District]].

==Government's response==
{{See also|Human rights in Sri Lanka|State terrorism in Sri Lanka}}
There had been a growing tension between the Sinhala and Tamil communities of Sri Lanka even before the actual riots began. And with the formation of rebel Tamil groups, there was a rising anti-Tamil sentiment among the Sinhalese majority. Although the violence began as a spontaneous reaction by Sinhalese mobs who had gathered at the Colombo cemetery where the bodies of the soldiers were to be buried, they were later joined by elements associated with Sinhalese political activists actively involved in the organisation of the riots.{{sfn|Hoole|Somasundaram|Sritharan|Thiranagama|1990}} Also, during the early stages of riots, it is alleged that the local police and military stood by doing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swamy|first=M.

In other instances, there were unconfirmed reports that buckets petrol was kept ready in white cans for the mobs at the Ceylon petroleum cooperation. Also, many reports indicate that certain members of the armed forces stood by and watched while much of the looting and arson was taking place (Meyer 2001:121-2). In some instances, security forces even took part in the riots. President Jayawardene himself would later admit that "[…] there was a big anti-Tamil feeling among the forces, and they felt that shooting the Sinhalese who were rioting would have been anti-Sinhalese; and actually in some cases we saw them [the forces] encouraging them [the rioters]" (Tambiah 1986:25)."}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Jayewardene has been accused of failing to condemn the violence or to express sympathy to the survivors, blaming Tamils for bringing it upon themselves,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contested lands: Israel-Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Cyprus, and Sri Lanka|last = Bose|first = Sumantra|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-674-02447-2|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages = 28|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=KKZcgOJPjVkC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=President+Jayewardene+failed+to+condemn+the+violence+or+express+sympathy+to+the+survivors;+instead+he+blamed+Tamils+for+bringing+it+upon+themselves.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhh7bQzuPKAhVFlx4KHREiCkcQ6wEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=President%20Jayewardene%20failed%20to%20condemn%20the%20violence%20or%20express%20sympathy%20to%20the%20survivors%3B%20instead%20he%20blamed%20Tamils%20for%20bringing%20it%20upon%20themselves.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; failing to take any meaningful measures to punish the perpetrators of the violence, and praising the mobs as heroes of the Sinhalese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Politicization of Buddhism and Electoral Politics in Sri Lanka|ssrn = 1567618|publisher = Social Science Research Network|date = 2010-03-09|location = Rochester, NY|first = Abdul|last = Razak|first2 = Mohamed|last2 = Imtiyaz|quote = "The government neither condemned the violence that killed approximately two thousand Tamils, nor took any meaningful measures to punish the perpetrators of the violence.

Even though some Tamil politicians accused the ruling UNP of not taking appropriate actions to prevent the riots, according to the government it took vital counter measures from the very early stages to combat rioters and to safeguard the Tamil community. Curfew was enforced immediately after the riots broke out. The attacks, according to the government, were carefully organised, and government properties such as trains, buildings and buses were the initial targets. Prime Minister Premadasa formed a committee to organise shelter and feeding for an estimated 20,000 homeless Tamils in Colombo. These temporary shelters were situated at five school buildings and an aircraft hangar. After the number of refugees increased to around 50,000, the government, with help from India, took measures to send Tamils north by way of ships.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1989|p=24}}

==Eyewitness accounts==
The rioters initially targeted government properties. Just as many times before (and since), most of the people who gathered at the Borella Kanatta, where the dead army soldiers were supposed to be buried, directed their anger towards the government. Later it developed into full-scale violence, targeting Tamil citizens and their properties.

The murder, looting, and general destruction of property was well organised. And mobs armed with petrol were seen stopping passing motorists at critical street junctions. After ascertaining the ethnic identity of the driver and passengers, they set alight the vehicles, with the drivers and passengers trapped inside.

Mobs were also seen stopping buses to identify Tamil passengers, who were subsequently knifed, clubbed to death, or burned alive. One Norwegian tourist saw a mob set fire to a minibus with 20 people inside, killing them all.{{sfn|Hoole|Somasundaram|Sritharan|Thiranagama|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tamil struggle for Freedom in Sri Lanka: A Photo Album|publisher=Ilankai Tamil Sangam|url=http://www.sangam.org/FB_PHOTOHISTORY/ONE.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an eyewitness testimony of a victim who survived the riots, Buddhist monks were among the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Black July '83 - Survivors|url = http://www.blackjuly83.com/Survivors.htm|website = www.blackjuly83.com|access-date = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Motorists were dragged from their cars to be stoned and beaten with sticks. Others were cut down with knives and axes. Mobs of Sinhala youth rampaged through the streets, ransacking homes, shops and offices, looting them and setting them ablaze, as they sought out members of the Tamil ethnic minority. A mob attacked a Tamil cyclist riding near Colombo's eye hospital. The cyclist was hauled from his bike, drenched with petrol and set alight. As he ran screaming down the street, the mob set on him again and hacked him down with jungle knives.}}

In his book, ''The Tragedy of Sri Lanka'', William McGowan wrote:

{{quote|While travelling on a bus when a mob laid siege to it, passengers watched as a small boy was hacked 'to limb-less death.' The bus driver was ordered to give up a Tamil. He pointed out a woman who was desperately trying to erase the mark on her forehead—called a kumkum—as the thugs bore down on her. The woman's belly was ripped open with a broken bottle and she was immolated as people clapped and danced. In another incident, two sisters, one eighteen and one eleven, were decapitated and raped, the latter 'until there was nothing left to violate and no volunteers could come forward,' after which she was burned. While all this was going on, a line of Buddhist monks appeared, arms flailing, their voices raised in a delirium of exhortation, summoning the Sinhalese to put all Tamils to death.}}

The London ''[[Daily Express]]'' (29 July) wrote: 

{{quote|Mrs Eli Skarstein, back home in Stavanger, Norway, told how she and her 15 year old daughter, Kristen witnessed one massacre. 'A mini bus full of Tamils were forced to stop in front of us in Colombo', she said. A Sinhalese mob poured petrol over the bus and set it on fire. They blocked the car door and prevented the Tamils from leaving the vehicle. 'Hundreds of spectators watched as about 20 Tamils were burnt to death.' Mrs. Skarstein added: 'We can't believe the official casualty figures. Hundreds, maybe thousands, must have been killed already. The police force (which is 95% Sinhalese) did nothing to stop the mobs. There was no mercy. Women, children and old people were slaughtered. Police did nothing to stop the genocide.'}}

''[[The Times]]'' of London reported on 5 August that "...Army personnel actively encouraged arson and the looting of Tamil business establishments and homes in Colombo", and that "absolutely no action was taken to apprehend or prevent the criminal elements involved in these activities. In many instances army personnel participated in the looting of shops."

''[[The Economist]]'' of 6 August wrote: "...But for days the soldiers and policemen were not overwhelmed; they were un-engaged or, in some cases, apparently abetting the attackers. Numerous eye witnesses attest that soldiers and policemen stood by while Colombo burned."

Paul Sieghart of the ''[[International Commission of Jurists]]'' stated in ''Sri Lanka: A Mounting Tragedy of Errors'', two months after the riots, that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Clearly this (July 1983 attack) was no spontaneous upsurge of communal hatred among the Sinhala people – nor was it as has been suggested in some quarters, a popular response to the killing of 13 soldiers in an ambush the previous day by Tamil Tigers, which was not even reported in the newspapers until the riots began. It was a series of deliberate acts, executed in accordance with a concerted plan, conceived and organized well in advance.&lt;ref&gt;ICJ Website: http://www.icj.org/lanka-a-mounting-tragedy-of-errors-report-of-a-mission-to-sri-lanka-in-january-1984-on-behalf-of-the-international-commission-of-jurists-and-its-british-section-justice/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Casualty estimates==
The estimates of casualties vary. While the government initially stated just 250 Tamils were killed, various [[NGO]]s and international agencies estimate that between 400 and 3,000 people, believed to be [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] or [[Hill Country Tamils]], were killed in the riots.&lt;ref name=BBC230703&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=Frances|title=Twenty years on – riots that led to war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3090111.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=23 July 2003|authorlink=Frances Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC230708&gt;{{cite news|last=Buerk|first=Roland|title=Sri Lankan families count cost of war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7521197.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-three terrorism suspects alone were killed in the [[Welikade prison massacre]].

More than 18,000 houses and numerous commercial establishments were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of Tamils fled the country to [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=DN260704/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/07/23/riots-helped-to-define-canadas-tamil-community.html|title=Riots helped to define Canada's Tamil community|last=Nadesan|first=Kumaran|date=July 23, 2015|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Tamil youths also joined the various Tamil groups, including the Tamil Tigers.

==Prosecutions and compensations==
A presidential commission appointed during the subsequent [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]] government estimated that nearly 300 people were killed and 18,000 establishments, including houses, were destroyed. The commission recommended that restitution be paid. Thus far no restitution has been paid nor have any criminal proceedings begun against anyone involved.&lt;ref name=DN260704/&gt;

==As a remembrance day==
July has become a time of mourning and remembrance amongst the [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora]] around the world. Tamil diaspora around the world come together to commemorate the loss of Tamils. This has happened in countries such as [[Canada]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].

[[Image:Disarblot by Malmström.jpg|thumb|240px|''The [[Dísablót]]'', by August Malmström.]]
'''{{lang|non|Blót}}'''  is the term for "[[sacrifice]]" in [[Norse paganism]]. A ''{{lang|non|blót}}'' could be dedicated to any of the [[List of Germanic deities|Norse gods]], the spirits of the land, and to [[ancestor worship|ancestors]]. 
The sacrifice involved aspects of a sacramental meal or feast.

The cognate term ''{{lang|ang|blōt}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|geblōt}}'' in [[Old English]] would have referred to comparable traditions in [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], and comparanda  can also be reconstructed for the wider (prehistoric) [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]]  [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]].&lt;!--[[WP:LEAD]]: article is on Norse paganism and lacks material on comparative mythology--&gt;

==Etymology==
The word {{lang|non|blót}} is an [[Old Norse]] [[Old Norse morphology#Strong nouns|strong neuter noun]] (genitive {{lang|non|blóts}}). The corresponding [[Old English]] neuter {{lang|ang|blōt}} (genitive {{lang|ang|blōtes}}) may be influenced by Old Norse; the [[Old English Bible translations|Old English gospels]] have prefixed {{lang|ang|ge-blōt}} "sacrifice".

The reconstructed [[Proto-Germanic]] form of the noun is {{lang|gem-x-proto|blōtą}} "sacrifice, worship". Connected to this is the Proto-Germanic strong verb {{lang|gem-x-proto|blōtaną}} with descendants in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got|𐌱𐌻𐍉𐍄𐌰𐌽}} ({{lang|got-Latn|blōtan}}), Old Norse {{lang|non|blóta}}, Old English {{lang|ang|blōtan}} and [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|bluozan}}, all of which mean "to sacrifice, offer, worship".

The word also appears in a compound attested in Old Norse as {{lang|non|blót-hús}} "house of worship" and in Old High German as {{lang|goh|bluoz-hūz}} "temple". With a different nominative affix, the same stem is found in the Proto-Germanic noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|blōstrą}} "sacrifice" — attested in Gothic *{{lang|got|𐌱𐌻𐍉𐍃𐍄𐍂}} (*{{lang|got-Latn|blostr}}) in {{lang|got|𐌾𐌿𐌸-𐌱𐌻𐍉𐍃𐍄𐍂𐌴𐌹𐍃}} ({{lang|got-Latn|guþ-blostreis}}) "worshipper of God" and Old High German {{lang|goh|bluostar}} "offering, sacrifice"). This stem is thought to be connected to the Proto-Germanic verb {{lang|gem-x-proto|blōaną}} "to blow; to bloom, blossom", as are the words for "blood" (Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|blōþą}}) and "bloom" (Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|blōmô}}). [[Sophus Bugge]] was the first to suggest a connection between {{lang|non|blót}} and the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[flamen]]}} (&lt; *{{lang|la|flădmen}}), and both words can be traced back to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stem *{{PIE|bhlād-}} "to bubble forth; to mumble, murmur, blather".&lt;ref&gt;Bammesberger (1990:87); Orel (2003:50–51).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites and beliefs==
The verb {{lang|non|blóta}} meant "to worship with sacrifice",&lt;ref&gt;
blœt; blét, blétum; blótinn, with acc. of that which is worshipped, with dat. of the object sacrificed; Zoëga, ''A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic''&lt;/ref&gt; or "to strengthen".&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht 1998:74&lt;/ref&gt;
The sacrifice usually consisted of [[animal sacrifice|animals]] or war prisoners, in particular [[pig]]s and [[horse]]s. The meat was boiled in large cooking pits with heated stones, either indoors or outdoors. The blood was considered to contain special powers and it was sprinkled on the statues of the gods, on the walls and on the participants themselves.

It was a sacred moment when the people gathered around the steaming cauldrons to have a meal together with the gods or the [[Elves]]. The drink that was passed around was blessed and sacred as well and it was passed from participant to participant. The drink was usually [[beer]] or [[mead]] but among the nobility it could be imported [[wine]].

The old prayer was {{lang|non|til árs ok friðar}}, "for a good year and [[frith]] (peace)" They asked for fertility, good health, a good life and peace and harmony between the people and the powers.

==Dates==
The autumn blót was performed in the middle of October (about four weeks after the autumn equinox),{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} the [[Winter Nights]], indicating the beginning of winter. The great midwinter blót, or [[Yule]], took place in the middle of January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Heimskringla |last=Sturluson |first=Snorri |authorlink=Snorri Sturluson |translator-last=Hollander |translator-first=Lee M. |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1964 |isbn=0292730616 |edition=illustrated, reprint |page=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freyr]] was the most important god at the Midwinter and autumn blót,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and [[Christmas ham]] (the pig was for Freyr) is still a main Christmas course in parts of Scandinavia. The Summer blót was undertaken in the middle of April (about four weeks after the spring equinox) and it was given to [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fornsidr.no/2012/03/a-time-for-blot-2/ |title=A time for Blot |website=Reviving the Elder Way |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520031241/http://www.fornsidr.no/2012/03/a-time-for-blot-2/ |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2012-05-20 |accessdate=2012-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, they drank for victory in war and this blót was the starting date for Viking expeditions and wars.

For the early [[Anglo-Saxons]], November was known as {{lang|ang|[[Blōtmōnaþ]]}}, as this later [[Old English]] passage points out:
{{Verse translation |lang=ang
|Se mónaþ is nemned on Léden {{lang|la|Novembris}}, and on úre geþeóde blótmónaþ, forðon úre yldran, ðá hý hǽðene wǽron, on ðam mónþe hý bleóton á, ðæt is, ðæt hý betǽhton and benémdon hyra deófolgyldum ða neát ða ðe hý woldon syllan.
|The month is named in Latin {{lang|la|Novembris}}, and in our speech ''blót-month'', because our forefathers, when they were heathens, always blóted in this month, that is, that they took and devoted to their idols the cattle which they wished to offer.
}}

==Locations==
A building where the blót took place was called a ''hov'' (compare German {{Lang|de|[[Heathen hofs|Hof]]}}) and there are many place names derived from this in e.g. [[Skåne|Scania]], [[West Götaland]] and [[East Götaland]]. Excavations at the medieval churches of Mære in [[Trøndelag]] and at [[Old Uppsala]] provide the few exceptions where church sites are associated with earlier churches.

There were also other sacred places called {{lang|non|[[Hörgr]]}}, {{lang|non|[[Vé (shrine)|Vé]]}}, {{lang|non|[[Lund]]}} and {{lang|non|[[Tumulus|Haug]]}}. {{lang|non|Hörgr}} means [[altar]] possibly consisting of a heap of stones, {{lang|non|Lund}} means "[[sacred grove|grove]]" and {{lang|non|Ve}} simply "sacred place". The Christian laws forbade worshipping at the {{lang|non|haug}} or {{lang|non|haugr}} meaning "[[mound]]" or "[[tumulus|barrow]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/norol-BF-X.html ''Old Norse Online Base Form Dictionary'' (Jonathan Slocum and Todd B. Krause. The College of Liberal Arts.  University of Texas at Austin)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===

====Lejre====
The German historian [[Thietmar, Count of Merseburg]] wrote that the [[Daner]] had their main cult centre on [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] at [[Lejre]], where they gathered every nine years and sacrificed 99 people but also horses, dogs and hens. There are however no historical records from Scandinavian sources nor any archeological findings supporting this. Archaeological excavations have indeed revealed Lejre to be of great importance and in fact the seat of the royal family dating to at least the [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Age]]. There is not conclusive evidence that Lejre was the site of a main cult centre though, but excavations around lake [[Tissø]] not far to the West, have revealed an ancient [[heathen hofs|hof]] of great importance.

===Norway===

====Mære====
[[Snorri Sturluson]] relates of a meeting between the peasants of [[Trøndelag]] and king [[Haakon I of Norway]], a meeting which ended in a religious feud centered around the blót. Haakon was raised at the Christian English court and had returned to claim the throne of his father [[Harald Fairhair]] (the unifier of Norway) and intended to Christianize the country. In spite of the fact that the peasants had elected Haakon king at the [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]] they opposed his religious ideas.

{{quote| It was an old custom, that when there was to be sacrifice all the {{wikt-lang|non|bóndi}}s [freeholders] should come to the spot where the temple stood and bring with them all that they required while the festival of the sacrifice lasted.  To this festival all the men brought ale with them; and all kinds of cattle, as well as horses, were slaughtered, and all the blood that came from them was called {{wikt-lang|non|hlaut}}, and the vessels in which it was collected were called {{lang|non|hlaut}}-vessels. {{lang|non|Hlaut}}-staves were made, like sprinkling brushes, with which the whole of the altars and the temple walls, both outside and inside, were sprinkled over, and also the people were sprinkled with the blood; but the flesh was boiled into savoury meat for those present.  The fire was in the middle of the floor of the temple, and over it hung the kettles, and the full goblets were handed across the fire; and he who made the feast, and was a chief, blessed the full goblets, and all the meat of the sacrifice.  And first Odin's goblet was emptied for victory and power to his king; thereafter, Niord's and Freyja's goblets for peace and a good season.  Then it was the custom of many to empty the brage-goblet (1); and then the guests emptied a goblet to the memory of departed friends, called the remembrance goblet.| [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/05hakon.htm Hákon the Good's Saga], section 16, Sacred Texts website.}}

During this ceremony, the king also had to participate, although he was a Christian, and he had to drink of the mead that was offered and consecrated for [[Odin]], [[Njord]] and [[Freyja]]. The peasants also wanted him to eat of the meat, but he only gaped over the handle of the cauldron and held a linen cloth between his mouth and the meat. The peasants were not at all satisfied with a king who would not participate fully in the blót. The King had however, been seriously humiliated and later he converted to the old faith. The tradition says that he was buried in the old ways.

===Sweden===

====Gotland====
The [[Gutasaga]] relates of the blót on the island of [[Gotland]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]:
{{Verse translation |lang=non
|Firi þan tima oc lengi eptir siþan. Troþu menn a hult. oc a hauga. wi. oc. stafgarþa. oc a haiþin guþ. blotaþu þair synnum oc dydrum sinum Oc fileþi. miþ matj oc mundgati. þet gierþu þair eptir wantro sinnj. land alt. hafþi sir hoystu blotan miþ fulki. ellar hafþi huer þriþiungr. sir. En smeri þing hafþu mindri blotan meþ fileþi. matj. Oc mungati. sum haita suþnautar. þi et þair suþu allir saman.
|Before this time, and a long time thereafter, they believed in groves and barrows, sanctuaries, and sacred enclosures and in the pagan gods.  This they did due to their superstition. The whole country (the althing) had the largest blót with sacrifice of people, otherwise every trithing had its blót and smaller things had smaller blót with cattle, food and drinks. They were called food-, or cooking-brethren, because they prepared the meals together.}}

====Uppsala====
{{main|Old Uppsala|Temple at Uppsala}}
The German chronicler [[Adam of Bremen]] has described how it was done at the [[Temple at Uppsala]] at [[Old Uppsala]] in [[Sweden]], ca 1070:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thor was the most powerful god and ruled over thunder and lightning, wind and rain, sunshine and crops. He sat in the centre with a hammer (Mjolnir) in his hand, and on each side were Odin, the god of war, in full armour and Frey, the god of peace and love, attributed with an enormous erect phallus. All the pagan gods have their priests who offer them the people's sacrifices. If there is disease or famine, they sacrifice to Thor, if war to Odin and if weddings to Frey.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every ninth year there is a blót of nine days, a common feast for everyone in Sweden. Then they sacrifice nine males of each species, even men, and the bodies are hung from the branches of a grove near the temple. No one is exempt from this blót and everyone sends gifts to the shrine, even the kings. Those who are Christian have to pay a fee not to take part in the blót.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Adam of Bremen]] considered this financial penalty to be very harsh.

[[Image:Offering by Lund.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A depiction of a [[Goði]] leading the people in sacrificing to an idol of Thor in this painting by [[J. L. Lund]].]]

It is possible that the last nine-day blót was performed in 1078. The [[Temple at Uppsala]] was probably destroyed by king [[Ingold I]] in 1087. For quite some time there had been civil war between Christians and pagans every nine years, and this was the year of the last battle.

According to Snorri, there was a main blót at the Temple at Uppsala in February, the {{lang|non|[[Dísablót]]}}, during which they sacrificed for peace and for the victories of the king. The blót was also performed to see how large the next harvest would be. Then the [[Thing of all Swedes]] was held and there was a grand fair, the [[Disting]]. The Disting survived Christianity, and the tradition has never been interrupted. The fair is still held every first Tuesday in February in [[Uppsala]], even though the date has sometimes been moved within the month. In 1968, the tradition of discussing official matters was resumed.

==Specific blóts==
The old Norse calendar consisted of a summer half year and a winter half year, not the four seasons modern Europeans are accustomed to. The winter half of the year began in mid-to-late October, the summer half of the year began in mid-to-late April. Some blót were associated with these turning points.

;Beginning of Winter half year
*[[Winter Nights]],
*''Haust blót'' "autumn sacrifice", mentioned in the [[Ynglinga saga]] and in other texts
*''Völsi blót'': The ''Völsi'' was the [[horse penis|penis of a stallion]], and the rites surrounding it are described in ''[[Völsa þáttr]]''. It was taken from a stallion during the autumn butchering, and it is said that the mistress of the homestead considered it to be her god, and kept it in a coffin together with linen and leeks (see also [[horse sacrifice]]). In the evening everybody gathered in the main building.  The mistress presented the penis from the coffin, greeted it with a prayer, and let it pass from person to person. Everybody greeted it with the religious phrase ''May Mörnir receive the holy sacrifice!''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mörnir'' probably means female [[Jötunn|Jotuns]], because in ''[[Haustlöng]]'' ''faðir mörna'' is used as a [[kenning]] for Jotun.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The ''[[álfablót]]'' or ''Elven blót'' was small scale and was celebrated at the homestead and led by its mistress. Not much is known about these rites, since they were surrounded by secrecy and strangers were not welcome during the time of the rituals. However, since the [[Elf|elves]] were collective powers closely connected with the ancestors some assume that it had to do with the ancestor cult and the life force of the family.
**[[Dísablót]]

;During winter
*[[Yule]], an important sacrifice celebrated some time after [[Winter solstice]]. When Christianity arrived in Scandinavia the yuleblót/winterblót was celebrated on 12 January (note: Date as of the previous Julian calendar. Hence it is not on January 12 in the current calendar.)

;At the mid-point of the Winter half of the year
*[[Þorrablót]] (Iceland)
*Freyr blot (Sweden): The ''[[Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta]]'' has an account of a priestess of [[Freyr]] travelling across eastern Sweden ([[Uppland]] or [[Södermanland]]) with an image of the god in wintertime, celebrating a sacrifice for fertility.

;Beginning of Summer half year
This point in time is known as [[First Day of Summer]] in modern Iceland
*[[Dísablót]]
*  ''Sigrblót'': the [[Ynglinga saga]] states one of the great festivals of the calendar is ''at sumri, þat var sigrblót'' "in summer, for victory".

==Modern reception==
{{see|Heathen holidays}}
Pre-Christian Scandinavian traditions have left traces in [[Scandinavian folklore]].
A conscious revival of Norse paganism has also taken place, in the 19th century in [[Romantic nationalism]], and since the later 20th century under the name [[Asatru]] or [[Germanic Neopaganism]].

In Scandinavian  [[Yule]] or Christmas traditions in particular, such as the ''Christmas porridge'', of which an extra bowl  often is served and carried outdoors, because this is a meal shared with the guardian of the homestead, the [[tomte]] (nisse in Danish and Norwegian), a land [[wight]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The [[Þorrablót]] is an Icelandic tradition introduced in the 19th century, deliberately harking back to the term ''blót'' associated with pre-Christian times.

Modern adherents of the [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionist]]  
[[Germanic neopaganism]] (in English-speaking countries also known as "[[Heathenism (contemporary religion)|heathenism]]")&lt;!--not used in Scandinavia--&gt;
have developed traditions of ''blót'' rituals celebrated in a contemporary context since the 1970s.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--any specific source on this providing additional info, or are we content with an uncited assertion of existence?--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5774">The '''Boggy Bayou Mullet Festival''' is an annual seafood and arts festival held in [[Niceville, Florida]], [[United States]], beginning the third Friday in October. The main attractions are music, food (especially fried [[mullet (fish)|mullet]]), rides and a wide variety of arts and crafts.

This festival is named after the mullet, a fish found in abundance in the local waters. While it is a common misconception, the [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] haircut is not the origin of the festival's name. 

The festival was founded by Walter Francis Spence Jr. in 1976. The first Mullet Festival took place on September 24th, 1977. Now the festival lasts three days, starting the third Friday in October, and ends Sunday after dark.  Alcohol is not served on Sunday.  In recent years, the festival has typically had attendance over 40,000 for the weekend.

Chantal, Hollywood entertainment reporter for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s "[[Good Morning America]]," broadcast from the festival on Friday, October 20, 1989. During the broadcast, festival founder, Francis Spence, and  local James Campbell demonstrated how to catch and fry mullet.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfsen, Bruce, "'Mullet gets shot at TV,'" Northwest Florida Daily News, Saturday 21 Oct 1989, p 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a third annual '''Boggy Bayou Mullet Festival''' T-shirt made by [[Tailgate Clothing Company]] appeared in Season 2 of the [[HBO]] series, "[[True Blood]]" (Episode 3 - "Scratches"). A representative from the show said that she found the shirt on a Web site she used to outfit some of the characters. A Mullet Festival T-shirt had also appeared on the [[CBS]] comedy "[[How I Met Your Mother]]" (Season 4, Episode 1), according to [[Niceville]] City Manager Lannie Corbin.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Robbyn, "'True Blood' fad: Mullet Festival,'" Northwest Florida Daily News, Monday 14 Sep 2009, p A3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Byron Bay Bluesfest''', formerly the '''East Coast International Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival''', is an annual music festival that has been held over the [[Easter]] long weekend in the [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] area in [[Australia]] since 1990. It features a large selection of [[blues]] and [[Americana (music)|roots]] performers, from Australia and around the world, and is one of the world's leading contemporary music festivals.

It was founded by Keven Oxford and Dan Doeppel in 1990 and is now run by [[Peter Noble (music promoter)|Peter Noble]] who joined Oxford for the 1994 event. It has been held at several locations in and around Byron Bay, and is currently held at Tyagarah, 11 kilometres drive north of Byron Bay town. Originally running for three days, it now runs for five days, from Thursday to Monday. From an original crowd of 6,000, it now attracts annual audiences of over 101,000 across the five days. Patrons range from locals to international visitors from a wide age range, including celebrities such as [[Matt Damon]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/matt-damon-chris-hemsworth-jason-momoa-spotted-at-bluesfest-at-byron-bay/news-story/2a80cb3966b93bd75077609963099a1b|title=Stars feel the blues this Easter|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was staged for the first time in 1990 at the [http://nomadsworld.com/arts-factory/ Arts Factory Lodge] in Byron Bay as a five-day blues music event over the Easter weekend. In December 2004, Keven Oxford, a director and founder of the event, left the festival and sold his 50% share of the company to a consortium comprising [[Michael Chugg]] (managing director of Sydney-based Michael Chugg Entertainment), Daryl Herbert (CEO of Melbourne-based Definitive Events) and [[Glenn Wheatley]] (CEO of Melbourne-based Talentworks), who ran the festival with co-founder Peter Noble. Noble bought out the consortium in 2008 and now owns the festival alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=15 October 2008 |title=Bluesfest buy-out |journal=dBMagazine |volume= |issue=451 |pages= |url=http://www.dbmagazine.com.au/451/Industry.shtml |accessdate=14 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203145331/http://www.dbmagazine.com.au/451/Industry.shtml |archivedate=3 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Bluesfest moved to its permanent home at the 120-hectare Tyagarah Tea Tree farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oztix.com.au/Home/tabid/373/mid/852/newsid852/603/Bluesfest-Byron-Bay-Tickets/Default.aspx |title=Bluesfest Byron Bay Tickets |publisher=Oztix.com.au |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
[[File:Byron by Harlow.jpg|thumb|Byron: "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."]]
'''''Childe Byron''''' is a 1977 play by [[Romulus Linney (playwright)|Romulus Linney]] about the strained relationship between the poet, [[Lord Byron]], and his daughter, [[Ada Lovelace]]. Of Linney's more than sixty plays, ''Childe Byron'' is one he identified as holding a "deeply personal" connection. In his own words, he approached it through "the pain of a divorced father who can't reach his own daughter."&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher-Ross, Jacob, “In Memoriam: Points of Intersection: Romulus Linney ’58,” Annual Magazine of Yale School of Drama 2011-2012, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his narrative poem, ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', Byron wrote of the female infant he left behind when he went into exile: "I see thee not. I hear thee not. But none can be so rapt in thee.” When Linney re-read these words in preparation for the play, he recalled "My daughter Laura, the actress... her mother and I were separated and divorced when she was a baby, so these lines just laid me out."&lt;ref&gt;Linney in video interview, "Romulus Linney: Childe Byron: Part 1," http://omeka.library.appstate.edu/exhibits/show/romulus-linney/history-plays/childe&lt;/ref&gt;

== World premiere ==

[[File:CHILDE BYRON WP credits.jpg|thumb|left|Program credits for the 1977 premiere of Romulus Linney's ''Childe Byron'']]
The play received its first production on March 4, 1977 in the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], on the stage of the Virginia Museum Theater (now the [[Leslie Cheek Theater]]) in Richmond, Virginia. Commissioned by [[Keith Fowler]], then the artistic director of the theater, with the aid of a [[Ford Foundation]] grant,&lt;ref&gt;Glover, William, AP Drama Writer, “Audience for Theater Grows”, ''Observer-Reporter'', Washington, PA, May 7, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and staged by Fowler as a part of that company's "Festival of Britain," the play received wide attention from local and national press. The original cast was led by Jeremiah Sullivan as Lord Byron and Marjorie Lerstrom as his daughter, with an ensemble of David Addis, Janet Bell, James Kirkland, Pamela Lewis, Rachael Lindhart, and William Stancil. The show's scenery was designed by Sandro LaFerla, and the costumes were by Paige Southard. [[M. Elizabeth Osborn]] was the company's dramaturg.

== Synopsis ==

The word "Childe" is an honorific once given to young aristocratic men who had not yet attained knighthood, and its use in the play's title is a reference to Lord Byron's poem, ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]''.  [[File:Countess Ada Lovelace in 1852.jpg|thumb|left|Ada Lovelace, near death in 1852]] The drama begins with Ada, the Countess of Lovelace, writing her will. She is a mathematician&lt;ref&gt;She developed, with Charles Babbage, the analytic engine and a programming language that is today considered to be the first practical computer.&lt;/ref&gt; and the daughter of the infamous George Gordon, Lord Byron, a man reputed to be "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."&lt;ref&gt;Attributed to Lady Caroline Lamb.&lt;/ref&gt; She is dying of a painful cancer at age thirty-six, the same age he was when he died.  Separated from him while he lived, she now hates his memory.  As her own end is near, however, she desires to know more about the man.  Her medicines stimulate her imagination, and she envisions him alive again.  In incisive, witty dialogue she digs into the truth behind the legends surrounding her father.  Six other actors play a diverse range of characters as she observes scenes from Byron's life, including his youthful incestuous relations with his sister, his homosexual adventures, his foolish marriage, and the causes of his disapprobation by British society.

Author Linney is known for his strong female characters, from Esther Dudley and Mrs. Madeline Lee in his ''Democracy'' to Lucy Lake in ''The Love Suicide at Schofield Barracks''.  His Ada Lovelace is one of his richest roles.  Beginning with a deeply negative perception of her absent father, yet driven to understand his contradictions, Ada challenges his spirit remorselessly.  In the contest she matches his masculine flippancy, but comes to see his essential honesty.

Discussing his dramatized women in ''The New York Times'', Linney commented, "I'm not writing about what you're supposed to think of women, but what you really think of them. …  Oh, they get credit for doing the right thing or the wrong thing, but not the unique or surprising thing. … I love the contradictions in women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paikert|first=Charles|title=Theater: A Playwright Who Fashions Then Into Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/03/theater/theater-a-playwright-who-fashions-then-into-now.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=21 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 3, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the end of ''Childe Byron'', a compromising reconciliation between daughter and sire is reached—providing a freshly intimate view of the major Romantic poet of the early 19th century.

== Controversy ==

“The perils of the state as patron of the arts” was the headline of a ''Washington Post'' editorial criticizing the Virginia Museum’s reaction to its own theater's premiere of ''Childe Byron''.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul G., "About censorship and the perils of the state as patron of the arts," ''Washington Post,'' March 31, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  In his commentary, staff writer Paul G. Edwards noted that America’s tradition of free speech and first amendment prohibition on governmental interference with public expression were challenged anew by the Virginia Museum trustees’ “obnoxious” attempts to censor the play that had been commissioned by their own artistic director.&lt;ref name="EdwardsIbid"&gt;Edwards, ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the first production of ''Childe Byron'' caused a stir in conservative Richmond, the capitol of the old Confederacy.  The play's subject matter drew controversy when the administrative director of the museum, in response to pressure from some trustees and a few influential patrons, called on artistic director Keith Fowler to remove a homosexual kiss and delete the word "fuck" from an historical quotation attributed to Byron.&lt;ref&gt;"Supporters of Museum Theater Director Air Their Views," ''The Richmond News Leader,'' Thursday, March 31, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; With playwright Linney's backing, Fowler declined the censorship directive.

National attention turned to the ''Byron'' conflict.  Interviewed on NPR's "All Things Considered," Fowler said that he stood by author Linney's script despite the museum director's threat to close the show.  "The order impinged directly on an area of artistic prerogative ... I discussed the problem with cast members and... they were very supportive of my stand."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Keith Fowler by Alzada Forbes, broadcast on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered," 5:30 p.m., WRFK-FM Richmond VA, Tuesday March 29, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Post'' editorial complained of the state-sponsored Virginia Museum's "Big Brother government" interference in theater art.  A museum trustee was quoted as saying, "Accountability is the name of the game," to which the editorial replied, "Maybe in government, but not in theater.  Theater goers have a right to assume that the art they pay to hear and see reflects the genius and biases of the playwright, players and play director, not the government."&lt;ref name="EdwardsIbid" /&gt; Local letter writers noted ironically that the sense of scandal that accompanied Byron in his lifetime seemed reflected in the new storm attending his stage debut.  "Throughout his life," commented one correspondent, "Byron and his poetry drew both acclaim and outrage.  The controversial reception of ''Childe Byron'' is a tribute to its success."&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, Gregory N., "Fowler Receives Thanks for Five Good Years," ''The Richmond News Leader,'' Thursday, March 31, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  Patrons on either side threatened to cancel subscriptions.  Letters to editorial pages grew heated for and against the museum's attempt to impose revisions on the play.''&lt;ref&gt;One correspondent offered, "[W]hat is really obscene is the realization that some 'batty little old lady with a lot of money' or a few influential board members can determine which plays the other 10,000 of us will be allowed to see." Brockmeyer, Dianne, "Censorship, Not Play, Is True Obscenity," ''Richmond News Leader,'' March 31, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing a dramatist's guild contract that protects a playwright's text, director Fowler prevailed, and the show remained intact throughout its run—although the artistic victory was to prove costly.  When he called on the trustees to promise no further attempts to censor VMT productions, Fowler's contract was allowed to expire.  Although the theater's subscriptions had more than doubled under his directorship, the administration found it expedient to let him go.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, Megan (March 24, 1977). "Theater Director Quits After 'Byron' Dispute", ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;
His departure gave emphasis to the issue of artistic freedom, with some letter writers sensing that a golden age of Richmond Theater was drawing to an end and lamenting the end of VMT as a "bastion of culture."&lt;ref&gt;"I must applaud... Fowler's decision to resign," wrote one theater supporter, "Censorship of the arts is fearful, particularly in a state that likes to call itself the 'cradle of democracy.'  Any group of people that wishes to censor their artists should expect to lose them." Crosby, Philp H., "Director's Resignation Proved His Integrity," ''Richmond News Leader,'' March 31, 1977. Another theater-goer wrote "to protest vehemently the attempts at censorship of Keith Fowler's Virginia Museum Repertory Theater.  ...As far as my friends and I are concerned, if Mr. Fowler goes, so goes one of the bastions of culture in Virginia." Madison, Terry M., "Loss of Director Would be a Shame," ''Richmond News Leader,'' March 31, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  The public response triggered by ''Childe Byron'' did not remain confined to the play.  The museum's censorship attempt stirred citizen groups to challenge the powerful institution, including a letter of protest circulated by local artists who alleged that the museum had a pattern of peremptory censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Many protesting artists were associated with Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter accused the museum of forcing Fowler's resignation and interfering with other artists' exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the ''Byron'' conflict, they criticized the museum for removing an "offensive" print from a local artist's photographic exhibit and attempting to censor another artist who chose instead a "voluntary withdrawal of his One-Man exhibit." The letter demanded a public statement of "criteria... used for the selection of exhibition, dramatic, and film offerings" and a specific statement as to what is "objectionable." Letter to "The Board of Trustees, Virginia Museum" from "Walter Coppage, Gerald Donato, David Freed," ''et al.'', April 25, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the minutes of the trustees' meetings, complaints of censorship occupied the institution's director and trustees for the ensuing three months&lt;ref&gt;Dohn, Helen, Secretary of the Museum, "Excerpt from the Minutes [redacted] of the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts held in the Conference Room of the Museum on May 19, 1977"&lt;/ref&gt;  In May, the ''Childe Byron'' incident was cited among other grounds for a possible "first amendment court case through the American Civil Liberties Union" against the Virginia Museum.&lt;ref&gt;"Possible Court Showdown....," ''Independent Virginian''," May 15, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, Robert, "Court Showdown Possible About Policies of Museum," ''Richmond Times-Dispatch, '' May 11, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1977 theater season, Fowler was awarded Richmond Newspapers' "Phoebe" prize for "Best Direction" for the staging of ''Childe Byron''.  He was subsequently hired by his alma mater, the [[Yale School of Drama]], to head the directing program there.&lt;ref name=steger&gt;Steger, Martha (June/July 1979). "Keith Fowler: Rebel With a Cause", ''Virginia Lifestyle''.&lt;/ref&gt;
As with many such art and censorship clashes, the passions over ''Childe Byron'' were quick to rise and then dissipated over time.  Romulus Linney's frank, witty drama remained intact throughout its original run;&lt;ref&gt;Linney voluntarily substituted the word "fornicate" for "fuck" at the show's student matinees.&lt;/ref&gt; the shock waves that emanated from it may have roused public vigilance but did no harm to ticket sales, and the play's subsequent history and many revivals attest to its continuing theatrical vigor.

== Revivals ==

''Childe Byron'' is one of prolific author Linney's most frequently revived plays.  Not long after its Richmond premiere, the play was performed in 1979 by the Actors Theater in Louisville, where it was directed by [[Jon Jory]].&lt;ref name=Dramatists&gt;{{cite book|last=Linney|first=Romulus|title=Childe Byron: A Play in Two Acts|year=1981|publisher=Dramatists Play Service, Inc.|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnmEFS22GOwC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780822202011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its New York premiere was in 1981 in a production by [[Circle Repertory Company]], directed by [[Marshall W. Mason]] and starring [[William Hurt]] as Byron and [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Ada.&lt;ref name="Dramatists"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rich1981&gt;{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Frank|title=Stage: William Hurt in 'Childe Byron'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/27/theater/stage-william-hurt-in-childe-byron.html|accessdate=21 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 27, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was first produced on the West Coast in 1981 by [[South Coast Repertory]] in Costa Mesa, California.&lt;ref name="Dramatists"/&gt; The play's first international production was by London's [[Young Vic]] in 1981, with pop star [[David Essex]] in the title role and [[Simon Gipps-Kent]] as the young Byron.&lt;ref name="UOKent"&gt;[http://www.kent.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/theatre/r.php/36414/show.html University of Kent / Theatre Special Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romulus Linney Papers at Belk Library; http://collections.library.appstate.edu/findingaids/ac494&lt;/ref&gt; The Penguin Repertory Theater of Rockland County NY presented a well-reviewed revival in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Alvin, "A Lusty Byron in Rockland," The New York Times, May 13, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;Scarcely a year goes by without a revival by a regional American theater or a university. Philadelphia's Wilma Theater produced the drama in 1986;&lt;ref name=Nelson1986&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Nels|title='Childe Byron': Wordy, But Magic|url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-02-26/entertainment/26087832_1_romulus-linney-lord-byron-bleachers|accessdate=21 September 2013|work=Philly.com|date=February 26, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baylor University presented its version in 2003;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/theatre/index.php?id=39137 Baylor University || Theatre Arts || Childe Byron&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a revival by the Players Club in Swarthmore was in 2005, while Drake University offered it in 2013, over thirty-five years following its premiere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Adam-Meirink-Drake-University-Department-of-Theatre-Presents-Childe-Byron Drake University Department of Theatre Presents Childe Byron : Wherevent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
''Childe Byron'', acknowledged by Linney as a personal attempt by a divorced father to speak to his daughter (''cf.'' footnotes 1 and 2), eventually led to a direct real-life link when actress [[Laura Linney]] performed the role of Ada in 1986 during her senior year at Brown University,&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Patrica, "Genuine Actress Flirts With Stardom," The New York Times, January 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; a performance which her father described as the play's "crowning" event.&lt;ref&gt;Linney in video interview, "Romulus Linney: Childe Byron: Part 2," http://omeka.library.appstate.edu/exhibits/show/romulus-linney/history-plays/childe&lt;/ref&gt;
Through the years, various directors have shown how the play can be staged as an historic spectacle--as in Philadelphia's Allens Lane production in 2012&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Allens Lane principals is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqL9TStZJ4U&lt;/ref&gt; where the focus was on Byron's relations with his large "entourage"... like a "modern-day posse"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagemagazine.org/2012/10/childe-byron-needed-more-of-a-life/ CHILDE BYRON Needed More of a Life | Stage Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;--or as an intimate, unpretentious study--as in the "compact, elegant little production" with "beauty and power" offered by the Eclipse Theater in 2001 at the Athenaeum in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Richard, "Childe Byron," ''Chicago Tribune'', August 24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death education''' is [[education]] about [[death]] that focuses on the [[human]] and [[emotional]] aspects of death. Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with [[grief]] is a primary focus. Death education is formally known as [[thanatology]]. Thanatology stems from the Greek word ''thanatos'', meaning death, and ''ology'' meaning a science or organized body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;   A specialist in this field is referred to as a [[thanatologist]]. 
Death education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people that are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is a taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up to others. With the right education of death, the less of a taboo it will be.

==History==
Historically death education in American society has been seen as a taboo topic, not worthy of scholarly research or for educational purposes. In the 1960s pioneering professionals like that of Herman Feifel (1959), [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] (1969), and [[Cicely Saunders]] (1967) encouraged behavioral scientists, clinicians, and humanists to pay attention and to study death-related topics. This initiated the death-awareness movement and began the widespread study of death-related behavior, developing new programs of care for the dying and bereaved, as well as new research on death-related attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
"Death is no enemy of life; it restores our sense of the value of living. Illness restores the sense of proportion that is lost when we take life for granted. To learn about value and proportion we need to honor illness, and ultimately to honor death."&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 2002, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Death education honors death by educating about death, dying, and bereavement to enrich personal lives, inform and guide individuals in their transactions with society, prepare individuals for their public roles as citizens, help prepare and support individuals in their professional and vocational roles, and lastly to enhance the ability of individuals to communicate effectively about death-related matters.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospice==
One of the major organizations that educates people on death is [[Hospice]]. Hospice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospice Foundation of America |url=http://www.hospicefoundation.org/beforedeath |accessdate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311105852/http://www.hospicefoundation.org/beforedeath |archivedate=11 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers support for the caregiver, and Hospice also offers information on what to expect before death and what the family can expect after death. One of the major subjects that hospice addresses within death are the myths that come along with death. Hospice will also walk caretakers through the signs and symptoms to look for that signify death.
Hospice is an important type of care that helps spread and explain death education to the people. When people have a loved one that is not able to get anymore help from medication or doctors, it would be a good recommendation for them to go to hospice. They would be able to receive great support and comfort during the end of their life journey. Not only does hospice give care to the terminally ill, they also give grief suggestions to family members and close friends. "With proper care, proper support, and love, we can share the miracle that is life".  The end of a person's life should be centered on being alive instead of being dead.

==Curriculum==
Students of a death education course need to clearly understand the complex knowledge of the subject, learn the five key areas of knowledge, and to learn the physical, psycho-social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of death. The five key areas are: understanding the dying process, decision making for end of life, loss, grief, and bereavement, assessment and intervention, and traumatic death. Death education should be taught in perspective and one's emotional response should be proportionate to the occasion. In addition death education can be taught formally or informally. Formally planned death education is associated with learning in organized educational settings including: schools, colleges, graduate education, professional workshops, and volunteer training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of Dying==
in her book, In Death and Dying (1969), Elisabeth Kubler-Ross proposed the five stages of the dying process. Though her work has often been referred to as the "five stages of grief," the original work was based on her clinical observations of the psychosocial responses of terminally ill patients to their impending death. Much scholarly debate has surrounded the legitimacy of her five "stages"—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Experienced psychosocial clinicians have largely rejected the accuracy of the model because it addresses only emotional states, sets up false expectations of the process, and have not been empirically verified as a descriptive model.

The first stage is denial and isolation. When you first hear about a loved one who has a deathly illness your first instinct is to deny the reality of the situation.  This is known as a defense mechanism because we block out the words by not fully processing them and also hide from the facts.
The second stage is anger. Once the blocking out subsides the reality of the situation becomes overwhelming and the pain from the news emerges.
The third stage is bargaining. This stage you will feel more vulnerable and helpless. In order to gain control again you'll start thinking of ways that would have made it better like:
•	"If only we had sought medical attention sooner…"
•	"If only we got a second opinion from another doctor…"
•	"If only we had tried to be a better person toward them…"

All of these are defense lines to try and protect us from the reality of pain in a lost one.
The fourth stage is depression. In this stage there can be two different types of depression that you deal with. The first type of depression can be a more quiet and private feeling. The second type of depression is the kind where sadness and regret overtake your body and become the predominate factors in your life.
The fifth and final stage is acceptance. This stage does not always reach everyone but for the people who actually get it should consider this stage as a gift. It does not mean that you will not be sad anymore but it does mean that there is going to be some kind of peace that you are able to reach with the loved one that died.

==Summary==
Even though people are still conservative towards the idea of death and dying, with help and the education of death, people will come to know death as a natural part of life that everyone will someday have to go through. Instead of being timid and scared of death, people will become comfortable towards the topic and be able to prepare for what will come in the future. Death education is not just for medical professionals and those dealing with the terminally ill but rather death education is beneficial to everyone for it reveals the importance of quality in living and the human search for meaning. "Dying was what human life moved toward and therefore dying was what a human being constantly prepared for."&lt;ref&gt;Moran, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3859">The '''Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show''' was an [[Outdoor activity|outdoor]] [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] exposition held annually at the [[Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex &amp; Expo Center]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]], and was the largest show of its kind in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="sports"&gt;[http://www.easternsportshow.com/en/Show-Information/ Show information] Eastern Sports &amp; Outdoor Show, accessed February 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The event was first held in 1955 and attracted outdoor sports enthusiasts from [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Washington D.C.]]. The annual event was known to showcase the very latest that hunting and fishing had to offer, including services, gear, expert advice, seminars and competition shooting.&lt;ref name="sports" /&gt; It included more than 1,000 hunting and fishing related vendors and over 500 outfitters from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoutdoorwire.com/story/1258537560urqrjhg9jp5 2010 Eastern Sports &amp; Outdoor Show Features More] The Outdoor Wire, accessed February 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2013 [[Reed Exhibitions]], the promoter of the show, announced that modern sporting rifles (MSR's) and related products would not be permitted at the show. Following the announcement, hundreds of its exhibitors and most of its celebrity speakers cancelled. Following opposition by the [[National Rifle Association]], and a statement by the [[National Shooting Sports Foundation]] that they would stop co-organizing with Reed for their annual [[SHOT Show]], Reed announced the indefinite postponement of the ESOS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2013/01/27/eastern-sports-and-outdoor-show-what-postponement-of-the-u-s-s-largest-gun-show-says-about-america/ Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show: What Postponement of the U.S.'s Largest Gun Show Says About America]&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show was subsequently replaced with a new exhibition, run by the NRA and known as the [[Great American Outdoor Show]], which was first held in February 2014 and annually since.&lt;ref name="sentinel2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=NRA selected to produce outdoor show in Harrisburg |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |url=https://cumberlink.com/news/local/nra-selected-to-produce-outdoor-show-in-harrisburg/article_0ecc3bce-a6c2-11e2-941f-001a4bcf887a.html |work=[[The Sentinel (Pennsylvania)|The Sentinel]] |location=Carlisle, PA |date=Apr 16, 2013 |access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials with the Hershey Harrisburg Regional Visitors Bureau ([https://www.visithersheyharrisburg.org/ HHRVB]) reported $44 Million of that loss was in Direct Spending from the 1,000 vendors and estimated 250,000 visitors attending the show each year. Regional hotels reported the event accounted for approximately 12,000 room-nights during what was typically a slow period for occupancy.

'''Eclipse Festival''' is an [[electronic music]] festival held in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] during the summer. Formerly biennial but yearly since 2016, this festival is a weekend-long international gathering of visual and musical art. It features a symbiosis of dance, open philosophies, performance art, human (and spiritual) experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipsefestival.com Eclipse Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first edition of the Eclipse Festival was an indoor party that happened in [[Montreal]] in the end of April of the year 1999. After two years of absence, they came back in September 2002, with another indoor party. The festival has been happening every year since then, inviting electronic music producers and DJs from all over the world.

The 2003 edition of the Eclipse Festival happened in the outdoors near [[Mont-Tremblant]], Quebec. People were invited to bring their tents and camp there. Since that year, the festival officially became an outdoor festival. The 2004 edition was held in Ste-Agathe, Quebec. In 2005 they moved the location to [[Ste-Therese-de-la-Gatineau]], which is a lot farther from the big cities, but which is also a bigger place with big open fields and a beach on the river. They used the same location for all the other events after that, except in 2007 when the festival happened at the [[ecovillage]] at [[Mont-Radar]].

In 2001, the festival continued at Lewis University under the title, "Electronic Music at Lewis - 2001."  Electronic Music Midwest became the official name at the 2002 festival held at Kansas City Kansas Community College.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Electronic Music Midwest continued its tradition of excellence, in this, its eleventh annual festival hosted by Kansas City Kansas Community College. As one of the premiere electroacoustic conferences in the world, EMM is responsible for having performed over 500 works. That is quite the feat. This essential festival is remarkably approachable for anyone willing to take the first leap. If your impression of electronic music is a random collection of bleeps and blorps, the variety of music at EMM will astound you if you’re willing to delve into outwardly atypical aural spaces - ''Eclectic electronics'' By Lee Hartman KCMetropolis.org  Tue, Oct 04, 2011 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In celebration of EMM's 10th anniversary, Lewis University hosted the first EMM mini-Invitational festival on March 11, 2010.  15 composers were invited to present up to 15 minutes of music during this one-day, three concert festival.  Among other compositions, highlights from this festival included ''Three Improvisatory Groovescapes'' (performed by the composer) by EMM technical director, [[Ian Corbett]], ''Tranquility'' by [[Kyong Mee Choi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kyongmeechoi.com/ | title=Kyong Mee Choi: website}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bapu'' (performed by [[Lisa Bost-Sandberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lisabost.com/ | title = Lisa Bost-Sandberg: website}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by [[Asha Srinivasan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.twocomposers.org/ | title =Asha Srinivasan: website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Texturologie 6: Emerald Emergent'' by James Caldwell.

Electronic Music Midwest (EMM) alternates each year between Kansas City, Kansas and the suburbs of Chicago in Romeoville, Illinois.  Besides the main festival which is usually takes place over three days.  The festival also presents "mini" festivals which are one day events presented as outreach to other cities. [[Composer's Voice Concert Series]] hosted an EMM mini-Invitational festival In New York City on June 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voxnovus.com/composersvoice/program/12-06-24.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Michigan University as part of is New Sounds Festival hosted EMM mini-Invitational festival in Kalamazoo, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2013/03/electronic_music_midwest_to_ma.html ''Electronic Music Midwest to make sounds, beautiful to 'granulated and anxious' at the Dalton Center'' ] [[Mark Wedel]], Special to the [[Kalamazoo Gazette]] on March 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

EMM has always featured an 8-speaker surround diffusion system under the guidance of Ian Corbett. The core of the system are eight Mackie 1521 bi-amped speakers, an EAW/QSC subwoofer system, and a Soundcraft MH3, 32+4 Channel mixer.

Since its beginning, EMM has programmed over 500 new electroacoustic compositions. Composers have traveled from around the world to graciously share their music with audiences in the Midwest. EMM strives to create an environment conducive to building community interaction. "Electronic Music Midwest has been dedicated to program a variety of electro-acoustic music, and to provide the highest quality of e-media presentations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansivayla.fi/artikkeli/336788-kari-vakevan-teos-kantaesitetaan-kansasissa Kari Väkevän teos kantaesitetään Kansasissa] Lansivayla&lt;/ref&gt;

Most concerts are approximately one hour long, and composers have plenty of time to "talk shop" with each other as well as interact socially with students and audience members.

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1966''' was the 11th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was held on 5 March 1966 in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]], [[Luxembourg]], following the country's win at the previous [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965|1965 edition]]. The host venue was Grand Auditorium de RTL in Villa Louvigny. The presenter was [[Josiane Chen]].

The winner was Austria with the song "[[Merci, Chérie]]" performed and composed by [[Udo Jürgens]], and written by Jürgens and Thomas Hörbiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Udo Jürgens|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year/participant-profile/?song=20338|publisher=[[EBU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would remain Austria's only win in the contest until their second win in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]]. The rule stating that a country could only sing in any of its [[language|national languages]] was originally created in this year, possibly due to the [[Absent Friend|1965 edition's Swedish entry]] which was sung in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=ESC1966&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1966|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=283|publisher=[[EBU]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
{{details|topic=the host city|Luxembourg (city)}}
[[File:Luxembourg, villa Louvigny.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Villa Louvigny, Luxembourg – host venue of the 1966 contest]]
The 1966 Eurovision Song Contest was hosted in [[Luxembourg City]]. The venue chosen to host the 1966 contest was the Villa Louvigny, which also hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1962]].  The building served as the headquarters of [[Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion]], the forerunner of [[RTL Group]].  It is located in [[Municipal Park (Luxembourg City)|Municipal Park]], in the [[Ville Haute]] [[Quarters of Luxembourg City|quarter]] of the centre of the city.

During the voting process, the presenter ([[Josiane Chen]]) accidentally greeted United Kingdom by saying "Good night, London". She then realized her mistake and said "Good evening, London", after [[Michael Aspel]], who was the spokesperson for the United Kingdom, at that time, responded by saying "Good morning, Luxembourg".

1966 marked the year the first ever black singer graced the Eurovision stage, [[Milly Scott]] representing the [[Netherlands]]. She was also the first singer to use a portable microphone. This was the last contest that [[Denmark]] participated in until 1978, more than a decade later.&lt;ref name=ESC1966 /&gt;

It was also one of the first contests in which an entry was not accompanied by an orchestra. The Italian entry "[[Dio, come ti amo]]" performed by [[Domenico Modugno]] had been rearranged since its performance at the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] and officially broke the EBU rule that stated the arrangement should be finalised well in advance. During the Saturday afternoon rehearsal Modugno performed the new arrangement with three of his own musicians as opposed to the orchestra, which went over the three minute time limit. Following his rehearsal Modugno was confronted by the show's producers about exceeding the time limit and was asked to use the original arrangement with the orchestra. Modugno was so dissatisfied with the orchestra that he threatened to withdraw from the Contest. Both the producers and EBU scrutineer [[Clifford Brown (scrutineer)|Clifford Brown]] felt it was too short notice to fly [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] to Luxembourg to represent Italy, so the EBU gave in and allowed Modugno to use his own ensemble instead of the orchestra. Despite websites and the official programme listing [[Angelo Giacomazzi]] as the conductor, Giacomazzi actually played the piano for the entry.&lt;ref name="Roxburgh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roxburgh|first=Gordon|title=Songs For Europe The United Kingdom at The Eurovision Song Contest Volume One: The 1950s and 1960s|publisher=Telos|location=UK|year=2012|page=410|isbn=978-1-84583-065-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Giacomazzi bio at www.andtheconductoris.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Startijenn - Festival Yaouank 2015 - 35.jpg|thumb|7000 dancers in [[Rennes]] for the Fest Noz Yaouank 2015 (Startijenn on stage).]]

A '''Fest Noz''' ([[Breton language|Breton]] for ''night festival'') is a [[Brittany|Breton]] traditional festival, with dancing in groups and live musicians playing acoustic instruments.

Although it is all too easy to write off the ''fest nozou'' and ''fêtes folkloriques'' as modern inventions, most of the traditional dances of the Fest Noz are ancient, some dating back to the [[Middle Ages]], providing a way for the community to grasp hold of its past and relish a deep sense of being with ancestors and with place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry W.|title=The Celts: a very short introduction|year=2003|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=978-0-19-280418-1|pages=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llPsTQvlRMQC&amp;pg=PT114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plural in Breton is ''festoù-noz'', but the [[Goadec Sisters]] (a family of traditional singers) used to say ''festnozoù'', and the French may also say in [[French language|French]] ''des fest-noz''.

On 5 December 2012 the fest-noz was added by [[UNESCO]] to the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00707 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : |author=UNESCO - Intangible Heritage Section |work=unesco.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826004244/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00707 |archivedate=2013-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fest-noz ==
[[File:Fest-Noz Cléder 2013 14.jpg|left|thumb|[[Frères Morvan]], famous farmers brothers, in 2013]]
A fest-noz (plurial festoù-noz) is a traditional dance festival in Brittany. Most Breton dances are social dances, in a group. Currently, many festoù-noz are also held outside Brittany within diaspora, bringing the Breton culture to life outside Breton territory. This term is known since the end of the 19th century but is given as a name only since the 1950s.

In the past, the dances were sometimes used to trample the ground to make a firm earth floor in a house or a solid surface for farm work (the "aire neuve" dances), to which people from the neighbourhood were invited, which explains the presence of stamping movements in some of the dances. For a long time the church banned "kof-ha-kof" (stomach-to-stomach) dances, meaning dancing in pairs. These festivals were a chance for young people to meet and size each other up, on a social level, by their clothes, and to see how quickly they got tired, since dances sometimes continued for a long time and involved complex and swift steps that required effort and skill.

These days, "Festoù Noz" are still very popular, mixing the different generations. Most of the villages have a fest-noz at least once a year, organised by the sports clubs, the school, etc... It is a way to express their culture and identity, and to share common values with friends of a night. As in many group folk dances, one talks of sometimes reaching a trance state because of repetitive music, and physical exertion. During the summer and tourist season, in many ways, taking part in a fest-noz is for many people like an alternative way of going to a night club.

== The dances ==
[[File:Fest noz 3.jpg|thumb|A fest noz in the Pays Gallo in 2007 as part of the ''Mill Góll'' festival]]
There are hundreds of traditional dances, of which the most well-known are [[gavotte]]s, the [[An Dro|an dro]], the 'hanter dro, the plinn and the Scottish. During the fest-noz, most dances are practised in a chain or in a circle (everyone holds hands), but there are also dances in pairs and "choreographed" dances, meaning dances enriched with precise artistic elements (sequences, figures, etc.).

The major study on Breton dancing is "La tradition populaire de danse en Basse-Bretagne", book written from his thesis dissertation, by [[Jean-Michel Guilcher]] - new edition by Coop-Breizh - Chasse-Marée/Armen - 1995.

== The music ==

There are principally two types of music at these festivals: music sung [[a cappella]] ([[kan ha diskan]], ...), accompanied with music or purely instrumental. Before the invention of microphones and amplified instruments, the instruments that were most often used were the [[bombarde]] (a sort of oboe or shawm) and the [[biniou|Breton bagpipes]] (binioù kozh), due to their high volume. Also popular was the diatonic [[accordion]], the [[clarinet]], and occasionally the [[violin]] and the [[hurdy-gurdy]]. After the [[Second World War]], the [[Great Highland bagpipe|Scottish bagpipes]] (binioù bras) also became common in Brittany thanks to [[bagad]]où (pipe bands) and thus often replaced the binioù-kozh. The basic clarinet (treujenn-gaol - "cabbage core" in Breton) had all but disappeared but has regained popularity over the past few years.

Other than the traditional instruments, there are nowadays groups with many different styles of music ranging from rock, [[jazz]], to punk and also mixes with styles from other countries. String instruments (the violin, the double-bass, the acoustic guitar, the electric guitar, the bass guitar) and North-African percussion instruments have long since been adopted. To varying degrees, some Fest-Noz groups also use electronic keyboards and synthesisers (Strobinell, Sonerien Du, Les Baragouineurs, Plantec...). Brass instruments are becoming increasingly commonplace, often bringing with them sounds approaching those of oriental music.

== The programme ==
[[File:La galette saucisse de Rennes (3503247167).jpg|thumb|[[Galette-saucisse]] in Rennes.]]
Just after the revival of the 1970s, the standard was to alternate a couple of singers (a cappella or "kan a diskan")and a couple of musicians (biniou - bombarde generally). It was common to see the holding of «free stages». Currently, couples of singers (kanerien) and couples of musicians (sonerien) play alternately with a band. Bands play more instrumental music and often the practice of the dance is different from the two other ways to conduct the dancers.

Between every "suite" (three dances), there is a small break where dancers socialise by speaking very easily to the other dancers or by having a local snack: [[crêpe]]s, [[Galette-saucisse|galettes-saucisses]], far breton, kouign amann and drinks like [[cider]], beer, and [[chouchen]], a drink made from fermenting honey in water.

The '''Ginetta Junior Championship''' is a [[one-make racing]] series based in the [[United Kingdom]]. From the [[2010 Ginetta Junior Championship|2010 season]] teams will use the [[Ginetta G40]], having previously used the [[Ginetta G20]].

The cars use sealed [[Ford Zetec engine|Ford Zetec]] 1.8-litre engines, and feature tubular steel chassis, fully integral FIA approved roll cages and fibre-glass shells which ensure safe, controlled racing.

==Race weekend==
Meetings are usually made up of two 15-minute races. The starting grids for the two races are determined by a 15-minute qualifying session. Each driver's fastest lap in this session sets their starting position for the first race, whilst their second fastest lap sets their starting position for race two.

The '''Great Cannon of China''' is an [[cyberweapon|attack tool]] that is used to launch [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]]s on websites by [[Man-in-the-middle attack|intercepting]] massive amounts of [[web traffic]] and redirecting them to targeted websites.&lt;ref name="NYT-China-Said-to-Use-Powerful-New-Weapon-Censor-Internet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/technology/china-is-said-to-use-powerful-new-weapon-to-censor-internet.html | title=China Is Said to Use Powerful New Weapon to Censor Internet | publisher=The New York Times Company | work=The New York Times | date=April 10, 2015 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Perlroth, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers at the [[Citizen Lab]], the [[International Computer Science Institute]], and [[Princeton University]]'s Center for Information Technology Policy, who coined the term, the Great Cannon hijacks foreign web traffic intended for Chinese websites and re-purposes them to flood targeted [[web servers]] with enormous amounts of traffic in an attempt to disrupt their operations. While it is co-located with the [[Great Firewall]], the Great Cannon is "a separate offensive system, with different capabilities and design."&lt;ref name="China-Great-Cannon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://citizenlab.org/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/ | title=China's Great Cannon | publisher=Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, Canada | work=The Citizen Lab | date=April 10, 2015 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Marczak, Bill | author2=Weaver, Nicolas | author3=Dalek, Jakub | author4=Ensafi, Roya | author5=Fifield, David | author6=McKune, Sarah | author7=Rey, Arn | author8=Scott-Railton, John | author9=Deibert, Ronald |author10=Paxson, Vern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides launching denial-of-service attacks, the tool is also capable of monitoring web traffic&lt;ref name="Motherboard-Great-Cannon-China-Powerful-New-Hacking-Weapon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-great-cannon-is-chinas-powerful-new-hacking-weapon | title=The 'Great Cannon' is China's Powerful New Hacking Weapon | publisher=Vice Media LLC | work=Motherboard - Vice | date=April 10, 2015 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Franceschi-Bicchierai, Lorenzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and distributing [[malware]] in targeted attacks in ways that are similar to the [[Tailored Access Operations#QUANTUM attacks|Quantum Insert]] system used by the U.S. [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name="China-Great-Cannon-Lets-Internet-Censors-Hack-Sites-Abroad"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/chinas-great-cannon-lets-internet-censors-hack-sites-abroad-just-ask-github-1877180 | title=China's 'Great Cannon' Lets Internet Censors Hack Sites Abroad -- Just Ask GitHub | publisher=IBT Media Inc. | work=International Business Times | date=April 10, 2015 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Stone, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known targets of the Great Cannon (in late March 2015) were websites hosting censorship-evading tools, including [[GitHub]], a web-based code hosting service, and [[GreatFire]], a service monitoring blocked websites in China.&lt;ref name="WSP-China-Deploys-New-Weapon-Online-Censorship-Great-Cannon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/04/10/china-escalates-censorship-efforts-with-debut-of-offensive-cyber-weapon-researchers-say/ | title=China deploys new weapon for online censorship in form of 'Great Cannon' | publisher=The Washington Post | date=April 10, 2015 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Peterson, Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indie Games Uprising''' is a developer led event designed to promote the "best of the best" [[Xbox Live Indie Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XBLIG Indie Uprising III beings in September|url=http://www.oxmonline.com/xblig-indie-games-uprising-iii-begins-september|publisher=Official Xbox Magazine|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion was originally conceived by Robert Boyd of [[Zeboyd Games]] and Ian Stocker of MagicalTimeBean, when they noticed that they both had games coming out in the same time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Winter Games Uprising is coming|url=http://www.magicaltimebean.com/2010/11/the-winter-games-uprising-is-coming/|publisher=MagicalTimeBean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotions==
===Indie Games Winter Uprising===
The first Indie Games Uprising launched in December 2010. The promotion was curated by developers Robert Boyd and Ian Stocker. Notable releases include [[Zeboyd Games#Cthulhu Saves the World|Cthulhu Saves the World]], ''Soulcaster II'', [[Decimation X3]] by [[Xona Games]], and ''ZP2KX: Zombies &amp; Pterodactyls!'' by [[Ska Studios]]. Boyd reported "spotty results" from the promotion, and cited developer's inability to set release dates on their games as a major issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boyd: Spotty Results For XBL Indie Games Winter Uprising Promotion|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/122642/Boyd_Spotty_Results_For_XBL_Indie_Games_Winter_Uprising_Promotion.php|publisher=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the promotion, Microsoft allowed developers to select release dates for their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XBLIG Developer Can Now Choose Their Release Date |url=http://www.armlessoctopus.com/2011/05/09/xblig-developers-can-now-choose-their-release-date/ |publisher=Armless Octopus |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230005517/http://www.armlessoctopus.com/2011/05/09/xblig-developers-can-now-choose-their-release-date/ |archivedate=2016-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indie Games Summer Uprising===
Journalist [[Dave Voyles]] and Indie Games Winter Uprising developer Kris Steele of Fun Infused Games coordinated the second Indie Games Uprising. The Indie Games Summer Uprising opened up game submissions to the public, and were then narrowed down through rounds of voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XBL Indie Games Uprising returns this summer, taking submissions|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/06/16/xbl-indie-games-uprising-returns-this-summer-taking-submissions/|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer Uprising launched on August 22, 2011 and released one title daily from Monday through Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indie Games Summer Uprising Schedules Its Releases|url=http://kotaku.com/5830579/indie-games-summer-uprising-schedules-its-releases|work=Indie Games Summer Uprising Schedules Its Releases|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; While developers reported a varying range of sales, ''Cute Things Dying Violently'' sold over 10,000 copies in its first month of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cute Things Dying Violently Post-Mortem|url=http://www.apathyworks.com/articles/view.php?id=21|publisher=ApathyWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indie Games Uprising III, scheduled to start on September 10, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox Live Indie Game Devs Ready For Third Uprising|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/08/08/xbox-live-indie-game-devs-ready-for-third-uprising.aspx|publisher=GameInformer}}&lt;/ref&gt; was curated by developer Michael Hicks and Summer Uprising coordinator Dave Voyles. Hicks expressed his interest in another promotion after he noticed a number of "exciting" games would be released around the same time as his own title ''Sententia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uprising III|url=http://xboxforums.create.msdn.com/forums/t/104699.aspx|publisher=XBLIG Forums}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable games include ''Gateways'' by the creator of [[The Adventures of Shuggy]], and ''qrth-phyl'' from hermitgames, developer of the critically acclaimed ''Leave Home''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Best Indie Games.

===Indie Games Uprising Tribute===
Launched on September 28, 2015, the Uprising aimed to highlight developers who started their career on Xbox Live Indie Games or gained something from publishing on the channel. Multiple games from previous Uprisings are featured, along with former XBLIG developers that are working on new projects for [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Wii U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XBLIG Tribute|url=http://www.indiegames-uprising.com/XBLIGTribute/|website=Indie Games Uprising}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden''' ('''International May Festival''', '''IMF''') is a theater festival in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany. Established in the late 19th century after the [[Bayreuth Festival]], the festival is one of the most distinguished international theatre and music festivals in the world. It is presented annually in May at the [[Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden]], the State Theatre of Hesse in the capital Wiesbaden. The festival currently features performances of [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, [[play (theatre)|play]]s and [[Musical theatre|musical]]s. Visiting companies, mostly from European theaters, present their recent productions along with performances of the Theater Wiesbaden. [[Concert]]s from a wide array of music genres are featured as well as artistic circus acts and modern dance presentations. Lectures, recitals, cabaret performances, art showings and readings are also part of the program.

== Kaiserfestspiele ==
In 1896 the festival was established as "Kaiserfestspiele" (Imperial Festival) by [[Georg von Hülsen]], director of the theater in Wiesbaden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miz.org/details_8570_51.html |title=Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden |language=German |year=2010 |publisher=Deutsches Musikinformationszentrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to create a festival to compare with the successful [[Bayreuth Festival]]. A festival in Spring was supposed to coincide with the emperor's regular stay at the [[spa]] to create a cultural event. The director also wanted to improve the status of his "Neues königliches Hoftheater" (New Royal Court Theatre), which relied mostly on productions from the Royal theater in Berlin. The first festival was presented from 6 to 19 May 1896, with the German emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] and the empress [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in attendance.&lt;ref name="TW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://staatstheater-wiesbaden.de/?page=theater&amp;subpage=1&amp;language=en_EN |title=International May Festival |publisher=staatstheater-wiesbaden.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085100/http://staatstheater-wiesbaden.de/?page=theater&amp;subpage=1&amp;language=en_EN |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The posters and programs showed "Festspiele auf allerhöchsten Befehl!" (Festival by the very highest order!), referring to the emperor's demand.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebn24.com/index.php?id=32249 |title=Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden |language=German |author=Achim Thorwald |accessdate=27 April 2011 |publisher=European Business Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning the focus was on the works of [[Richard Wagner]] as in Bayreuth, but different from Bayreuth works of other composers were also performed, such as Carl Maria von Weber's ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' in 1900. The festival closed for the duration of World War I.&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt;

== Mai-Festwoche ==
In 1928, the first festival after the war was staged by the director [[Paul Bekker]] and called "Mai-Festwoche" (Festival week in May). It presented on 6 May the premiere of three short operas by [[Ernst Krenek]], ''[[Der Diktator]]'', ''[[Das geheime Königreich]]'' and ''[[Schwergewicht|Schwergewicht, oder Die Ehre der Nation]]''.&lt;ref name="Hessen"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Maifestwoche des Staatstheaters in Wiesbaden, 6. Mai 1928
| publisher = lagis-hessen.de
| language = German
| accessdate = 6 May 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 the festival was called "Festwochen im Mai" (Festive Weeks in May). His main concern was to stress the achievement of the Wiesbaden theatre. From 4 to 21 May 1929 the festival presented the opera ''[[Die ägyptische Helena]]'' of Richard Strauss, which had premiered the year before at the [[Semperoper]].&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dokumentserver.hlb-wiesbaden.de/WiesbadenerBadeblatt/1928/1928-05-08/ "Die Mai-Festwochen in Wiesbaden"], ''Wiesbadener Bade-Blatt'', 8 Mai 1928, p. 1 (for all the cast) PDF[[File:Pdf icon.png|16px|link=]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Nazism]], the festival was held until 1939 as part of the ''Gaukulturwochen''. The director was [[Carl von Schirach]].

In 1950 the first festival after World War II was the first with an international approach, reflected in the new name. The festival was held annually since then. Traditionally the festival was opened by a new production of the Wiesbaden theatre.&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt; Starting in 1962, director [[Claus Helmut Drese]] encouraged presentations from Eastern European companies under the Motto "Fenster nach Osten" (window to the East). Guest productions of operas and ballets from Warsaw, Leningrad, Sofia, Bucharest, Moscow and the great theatres of former East Germany took place at the festival. Claus Leininger, director from 1986 to 1994, invited companies from Northern Europe, Spain and North America. In 1989, when Germany was still divided, the Berlin companies [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] from [[West Berlin]] and [[Komische Oper Berlin]] from [[East Berlin]] both showed their productions.

The '''Jinan (Tsinan) incident''' ({{lang-ja|{{linktext|済南事件}}}}) or '''May 3 Tragedy''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|五三惨案}}|t={{linktext|五三慘案}}|p=Wŭsān Cǎn'àn}}) was an armed conflict between the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[Northern Expedition]] army in [[Jinan]] (then romanized as Tsinan), the capital of East China's [[Shandong]] province in May 1928.

==Background==
During the [[Northern Expedition]], troops of the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] attacked several foreign consulates in a fervor of anti-[[imperialism]] in what became known as the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]] of March 1927. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] sought to avoid repetition of such incidents, and in November 1927 he met with Baron [[Tanaka Giichi]], who had become Japan's prime minister in April of that year (and also held the portfolio of Foreign Minister), in part on the strength of promises to take more active and aggressive measures than his predecessor toward protection of Japanese lives, property and economic interests in China.  Chiang had only a tenuous hold on power in China and relied in large measure on the promise to end foreign domination and re-unify the country to buttress his legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Iriye, ''After Imperialism,'' 193-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanaka realized that the use of force was not necessarily the best way to protect Japanese interests, and Chiang wanted to keep his troops away from [[Jinan]] and the risks of a costly but useless clash. With no guarantee that the Chinese National Revolutionary Army would bypass Jinan, prior political commitments and [[Imperial Japanese Army]] insistence forced Tanaka to reinforce Japanese forces in the Shandong leased territory. Between May and September 1927, some 4000 troops were deployed to [[Qingdao]] and [[Jinan]] in what was known in Japan as the {{nihongo|First Shandong Expedition|第一山東出兵|Dai-ichi Santo Shuppei}}. Both the [[Beiyang government|northern warlord coalition government]] in [[Beijing]] (Peking) and the [[Kuomintang]] government in [[Nanjing]] (Nanking) protested vigorously that this was a violation of China's sovereignty, and the Japanese forces were withdrawn when Chiang temporarily halted his northern advance.&lt;ref&gt;Iriye, ''After Imperialism,'' 195-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hostilities==
[[Image:Autopsy of a Japanese victim killed in the Jinan Incident.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Autopsy of a Japanese victim killed in the Jinan Incident (Japanese source).]]
When the Northern Expedition resumed on April 27, contrary to his standing orders from [[Tokyo]], Japanese commander Gen. [[Fukuda Hikosuke]] moved troops from [[Tianjin]] into Ji'nan and Qingtao along the [[Jiaoji Railway]]. This was known in Japanese as the {{nihongo|Second Shandong Expedition|第二山東出兵|Dai-ni Santo Shuppei}}. Northern Chinese troops under [[Zhang Zongchang]] withdrew from the city on April 30, and Kuomintang troops—also acting contrary to Chiang Kai-shek’s orders—moved in. Matters remained tense as the Japanese took up positions at the Japanese consulate and various Japanese-controlled businesses and schools, but the situation remained reasonably quiet and amicable until a minor clash occurred near the home of a Japanese family on May 3, resulting in the deaths of 12 Japanese civilians. The British Acting Consul-General reported that he had seen the bodies of Japanese males who had been castrated. Japanese reports blamed the shooting on troops under Gen. [[He Yaozu]] (賀耀祖), reputed to have been responsible for the Nanjing Incident, while Chinese reports held that Chinese soldiers had been attacked by Japanese. Leaders on both sides agreed on a truce and a cease-fire, and the Japanese consul general in the city pushed for peace. Gen. Fukuda and his fellow generals, however, perhaps motivated by the desire for action, felt that they could not let the "insult" to Japanese honor go unpunished, but did not take action until they had built up stocks of food and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Iriye, ''After Imperialism,'' 199-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Kai-shek judged it more important for his troops to move on to Peking than to fight in Jinan and sent a team of officers to negotiate. On May 7 Gen. Fukuda issued a five-point set of demands so onerous that the Chinese would have no choice but to refuse, with a 12-hour deadline. He refused to release the negotiators, including [[Cai Gongshi]] and 16 others in his team. When commissioner Cai protested in Japanese, his nose, ears, and tongue were cut off, and his eyes were gouged out before he was executed. Sixteen other members of his negotiation team were also stripped naked, whipped, dragged to the back lawn and slaughtered by machine guns on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ji'nan Government |url=http://www.jinan.gov.cn/art/2005/9/1/art_40_8702.html |date=September 1, 2005 |accessdate=August 16, 2013 |title=The Year of 1928 |quote="蔡公时用日语抗议，日兵竟将其耳鼻割去，继又挖去舌头、眼睛。日军将被缚人员的衣服剥光，恣意鞭打，然后拉至院内用机枪扫射" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724101408/https://www.jinan.gov.cn/art/2005/9/1/art_40_8702.html |archivedate=July 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Having received reinforcements and supplies, by May 11 the Japanese, after fierce fighting, pushed Chinese troops from the area and inflicted thousands of casualties,&lt;ref&gt;C.

Publicly, Chiang did not apologize to the Japanese but did remove the Chinese commander He; in his diary he expressed his new feeling that Japan was China's greatest enemy. However, "before one can settle scores," he wrote, "one must be strong."&lt;ref&gt;Jay Taylor, ''The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-Shek and the Struggle for Modern China'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,  2009), 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Autopsy of a Japanese victim killed in the Jinan Incident.jpg|thumb|right|Autopsy of a Japanese killed in the Jinan Incident]] --&gt;
In May 1928 a Chinese man infuriated about the incident killed 11 people and himself in the Japanese city of [[Kobe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19280525-1.2.37.aspx Chinese Amok in Kobe - Murder of Eleven Japanese Reported] The Straits Times (May 25, 1928)&lt;/ref&gt; If the incident had been an isolated example of Japanese assertion and Chinese resistance, a general understanding might have been reached. However, Chiang's troops expanded their control in northern China and the Japanese army continued to distrust the forces of Chinese nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Iriye, ''After Imperialism'', 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese army leaders feared that Chiang would respond to patriotic agitation and threaten their interests in south Manchuria. On June 4, as he rode in a special train, [[Zhang Zuolin]], the military leader of Manchuria who had been talking about joining forces with Chiang, was killed in an explosion, later linked to officers of the Japanese army, setting off a chain of events leading to the seizure of Manchuria and the establishment of [[Manchukuo]]. When Chiang lectured a group of Chinese army cadets, he urged them to turn their energies to washing away the shame of Jinan, but to conceal their hatred until the last moment.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Generalissimo'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuomintang government later decreed that May 3 be designated a "National Humiliation Memorial Day."

'''''Jolson Tonight''''' is a musical with a book by [[Nicholas Dante]]. The musical is based on the life of [[Al Jolson]].

==Background==
Nicholas Dante was hired by producer Jeff Britton to write ''Jolson Tonight'' after his previous Al Jolson musical, ''Joley'', failed in spring 1979. The show was written in a similar fashion to ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', Dante's previous musical, by having a series of recorded conversations with star Larry Kert about the public and private life of Al Jolson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovrtur.com/show/126099/history&lt;/ref&gt; 

The show was doing a pre-Broadway trial in five cities in the 1980 in preparation for a run on Broadway. The backers' audition was held in July 1979 to about 200 spectators. Rehearsals started in June 1980, and the cost was $1.4 million with a cast of 30. The show opened on July 21, 1980 in [[Indianapolis]]. The tryout was supposed to play there for a week followed by week-long runs in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]] and [[Tulsa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovrtur.com/show/126099/history&lt;/ref&gt; The set was designed by Michael Bottari and Ronald Case, who along with director Michael Shawn created many of the visual concepts. The costumes were designed by Donna Granata.

The creative team included [[Pierre Cardin]], a fashion designer, who was trying to get the show to Broadway, produced by Salvatore Pirrone, directed and choreographed by Michael Shawn, and starring [[Larry Kert]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19810717&amp;id=NzwaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UycEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6085,551433&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is said to have closed because no Broadway theatres were available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovrtur.com/show/126099/history&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Kobe Collection'''|神戸コレクション}} is a [[fashion]] event that has been held in [[Kobe, Japan|Kobe]], [[Japan]] and other cities during spring and autumn every year since 2002; over 30 brands have participated. It is characteristically a public relations event for consumers, and a chance for young designers to publish their own designs. 

In the second half of the 19th century, there were many trading companies and banks that made inroads into Kobe, and the comparatively wealthy families who worked for these companies, tended to live on the mountain side of Kobe and [[Ashiya, Hyōgo|Ashiya]].  Originally the Kobe fashion-style was seen in children of such wealthy families. The fashion-style was characterized by the refined everyday wear which in quiet colors (navy blue, black, white and gray), in contrast to the popular style for girls in Osaka. From around 1990, many Japanese women's magazines came to take up this style, because it is known to look refined and [[Kawaii|cute]] by women in their teens and early 20s. A magazine named Kobe Style focuses on the style trends of Kobe.&lt;ref name="what is kobe-style? (japanese)"&gt;[http://f32.aaa.livedoor.jp/~extract/style/index.html  what is kobe-style?

The mode of "Kobe-Style" has somewhat changed, although it is expressed as a pronoun of a conservative fashion in Japan currently, it has been popular among young Japanese girls. Kobe collection has held a strong social background in Japan and surrounding east-Asian countries; In 2007, Kobe collection was held in [[Shanghai]], [[Yokohama]], and  in Kobe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.explore.ne.jp/feature/kobe.html  an interpretive article of Kobe Collection], retrieved March 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latrun''' ({{lang-he-n|לטרון}}, ''Latrun''; {{lang-ar|اللطرون}}, ''al-Latrun'') is located at a strategic hilltop in the '''Latrun salient''' in the [[Ayalon Valley]]. It overlooks the road between [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], 25 kilometers west of Jerusalem and 14 kilometers southeast of [[Ramla]]. It was the site of [[Battles of Latrun (1948)|fierce fighting]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 war]]. During the 1948–1967 period, it was occupied by Jordan at the edge of a [[no man's land]] between the armistice lines known as the Latrun salient. In the 1967 war, it was captured by Israel along with the whole salient and the [[West Bank]], and remains under Israeli occupation.

The hilltop includes the [[Trappist]] Latrun Abbey, [[Mini Israel]], a park with scale models of historic buildings around Israel, [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel#Birding Division|The International Center for the Study of Bird Migration]] (ICSBM), which is adjacent to [[Yad La-Shiryon]] Memorial and Museum. [[Neve Shalom]] (Oasis of Peace) is a joint Jewish-Arab community on a hilltop south of Latrun. [[Canada Park]] is nearby to the east.

==Etymology==
The name Latrun is ultimately derived from the ruins of a medieval castle. There are two theories regarding the origin of the name. One is that it is a corruption of the French, ''Le toron'' des chevaliers (''The Castle'' of the Knights), named by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]]. The other is that it is from the Latin, Domus boni ''Latronis'' (The House of the Good ''[[wikt:latro#Latin|Thief]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1841, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/n47/mode/1up 30], [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/n83/mode/1up 66]&lt;/ref&gt; a name given by 14th century Christian pilgrims after the [[penitent thief]] who was crucified by the Romans alongside Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:40–43|BBC}}).&lt;ref name="Etym"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=imcpl1111&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R2&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX2587511922&amp;&amp;docId=GALE |title=Latrun |author=Walter Pinhas Pick |year=2007 |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Biblical era===
In the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], the [[Ayalon Valley]] was the site of a battle in which the Israelites, led by [[Joshua]], defeated the [[Amorite]]s (Joshua 10:1–11).&lt;ref name="Etym" /&gt; Later, [[Judah Maccabee]] established his camp here in preparation for battle with the [[Seleucid]] Greeks, who had invaded Israel/Judea and were camped at [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]]; this site is today identified by archaeologists as Hurvat Eked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblewalks.com/Sites/EmmausFortress.html|title=Emmaus - Nikopolis - Hasmonean period fortress|author=|date=|website=www.biblewalks.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Book of Maccabees]], [[Judah Maccabee]] learned that the Greeks were planning to march on his position, and successfully ambushed the invaders. The Jewish victory in what was later called the [[Battle of Emmaus]] led to greater Jewish autonomy under [[Hasmonean]] rule over the next century.&lt;ref name=Roiter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Monastic-Life|last=Roiter|first=Nadav|title=Monastic life|accessdate=3 June 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=16 September 2011|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusader era===
[[Image:Latrun-Castle-S-034.jpg|right|thumb|Remains of the Crusader castle at Latrun.]]
Little remains of the castle, which was held by the [[Knights Templars|Templars]] by 1187. The main tower was later surrounded with a rectangular enclosure with vaulted chambers. This in turn was enclosed by an outer court, of which one tower survives.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, 1997, pp.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_NbE5obqRMC&amp;pg=PA64 64]-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, 1998, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Y0tA0xLzwEC&amp;pg=PA5 5]-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/135/mode/1up 135]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
In 1883, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' (SWP)  described  Latrun as a few [[adobe]]  huts among the ruins of a medieval fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/15/mode/1up 15]-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1890, a monastery was established at Latrun by French, German and Flemish monks of the [[Trappists]], from [[Sept-Fons Abbey]] in France, at the request of Monseigneur Poyet of the [[Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]. The monastery is dedicated to [[Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows]]. The liturgy is in French. The monks bought the 'Maccabee Hotel', formerly called 'The Howard' from the Batato brothers together with two-hundred hectares of land and started the community in a building which still stands in the monastic domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/augustin.tavardon/ACCUEIL+HISTOIRE.htm|title=Orange|author=|date=|website=pagesperso-orange.fr|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 it was given the status of a [[Priory]] and that of an [[Abbey]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="LatrounAbbey"&gt;Latroun Abbey Archive&lt;/ref&gt; The monks established a vineyard using knowledge gained in France and advice from an expert in the employ of Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] from the [[Carmel-Mizrahi Winery]]. Today they produce a wide variety of wines that are sold in the Abbey shop and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Roiter /&gt;

The community was expelled by the Ottoman Turks between 1914–1918 and the buildings pillaged.

[[Walid Khalidi]] in his book ''All That Remains'' describes al-Latrun as a small village established in the late 19th century by villagers from nearby [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]].

===British Mandate===
In the [[1922 census of Palestine]], conducted by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate authorities]], ''Latrun''  had a population of 59, all [[Muslim]]s. In addition, ''Dair Latrun'' ("The monastery of Latrun") had a population of 37 Christian males.&lt;ref name="Census1922"&gt;Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Ramleh, p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n23/mode/1up  21]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]] they were counted together, and Latrun had a population 120; 76 Muslims and 44 Christians, in a total of 16 houses.&lt;ref name="Census1931"&gt;Mills, 1932, p. [https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas 22].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Latrun-Police-Building.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Tegart fort|Tegart police fort]].]]
The Latrun monastery was rebuilt in 1926. The crypt was completed in 1933 and the church in 1954. The monastery was designed by the community's first abbot, Dom Paul Couvreur, and is an example of [[Cistercian architecture]]. Much of the stained-glass windows were produced by a monk of the community.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A Juniorate, a school for young boys, ran from 1931 until 1963 and provided many vocations for the community, especially of Lebanese monks.&lt;ref name="LatrounAbbey" /&gt;

Following the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] authorities built a number of police forts (named [[Tegart fort]]s after their designer&lt;ref&gt;Note that the forts commonly called "''Taggart''" forts in Israel are named after Sir Charles ''[[Charles Tegart|Tegart]]'' - a [[misspelling]] apparently from [[transliteration]] of the name from [[English language|English]] to [[Hebrew]] and then back to English.&lt;/ref&gt;) at various locations; Latrun was chosen due to its strategic significance, particularly its dominant position above the Tel-Aviv-Jerusalem road. Many members of the [[Yishuv]] who had resisted the British administration were imprisoned in a detention camp at Latrun. [[Moshe Sharett]], later Israel's second Prime Minister, and several other members of the [[Jewish Agency]]'s Executive Committee, were held at Latrun for several months in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clifton|first=Daniel|title=Britain Launches Army Drive to End Palestine Terror|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/06/30/107142654.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 June 1946|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British to Release 700 Interned Jews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/11/02/archives/british-to-release-700-interned-jews-dedicating-new-library-at.html|accessdate=3 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 November 1946|agency=AP|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=8 Jewish Leaders Freed by British|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB071FFD3A5C107A93C4A9178AD95F428485F9|accessdate=3 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 November 1946|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of  the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]], the population of the Latrun village had grown to 190 Christians,&lt;ref name=1945p30&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/VSpages/VS1945_p30.jpg   30]&lt;/ref&gt;, with a total of 8,376  [[dunam]]s of land.&lt;ref name=Hadawi67&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

===1948 and 1967 Arab–Israeli Wars===
{{main|Battles of Latrun (1948)}}
[[File:Gun on roof of Latrun pollice station.jpg|thumb|Arab gunners on the roof of Latrun police station, 1957.]]
The road from the coastal plain to Jerusalem was blocked after the British withdrew and handed the fort of Latrun over to [[Jordan]]'s [[Arab Legion]]. The Arab Legionnaires used the fort to shell Israeli vehicles traveling on the road below, effectively imposing a [[Battle for Jerusalem (1948)|military siege on Jerusalem]] and the Jewish residents there, despite that the United Nations plan was to keep Jerusalem as an international zone with neither Jordan, Israel, nor the Palestinian [[Arab Higher Committee]] having sovereignty over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/Israel/1948WarofIndependance.html |title=1948-Israel War of Independence|date=|website=History Central|author= Schulman, Marc |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 1948, ten days after the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] per the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s Resolution 181&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/181(II)|title=A/RES/181(II) - E|author=|date=|website=undocs.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arab assaults against Israel which followed, the Jordanian Legion's fort was assaulted by combined forces of Israel's newly created [[7th Armored Brigade (Israel)|7th Armored Brigade]], and a battalion of the [[Alexandroni Brigade]]. [[Ariel Sharon]], then a platoon commander, was wounded at Latrun along with many of his soldiers. The assault, codenamed [[Battles of Latrun (1948)#Operation Bin Nun Alef (24–25 May)|Operation Bin Nun Alef (24–25 May)]], was unsuccessful, sustaining heavy casualties. On 31 May 1948, a second attack against the fort, codenamed [[Battles of Latrun (1948)#Operation Bin Nun Bet|Operation Bin Nun Bet]], also failed, although the outer defenses had been breached.

Many of the Israeli fighters were young [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors who had just arrived in the country and had minimal military training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/latrun.htm Lessons of the Battles of Latrun] MidEastWeb&lt;/ref&gt; The official casualty figure for both battles was 139.{{citation needed|date=February 2008}}

To circumvent the blocked road, a makeshift camouflaged road through the seemingly impassable mountains towards Jerusalem was constructed under the command of [[Mickey Marcus|Mickey (David) Marcus]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This bypassed the main routes overlooked by Latrun and was named the [[Burma Road (Israel)|Burma Road]] after its emergency supply-line namesake between Kumming (China) and Lashio (Burma), improvised by the Allies in [[World War II]]. By 10 June 1948, the road was fully operational, putting an end to the month -old Arab blockade.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2008, pp. 230–231&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August, the [[United Nations Conciliation Commission|Truce Commission]] drew the attention of the [[Security Council]] to the Arabs' refusal to allow water and food supplies to reach [[Jerusalem]]. After much negotiation, it was agreed that United Nations convoys would transport supplies, but the convoys often came under sniper fire. Towards the end of August, the situation improved. The destruction of the Latrun pumping station made it impossible for water in adequate quantities to flow to Jerusalem, but the [[Israelis]] built an auxiliary water pipe-line of small capacity along the "Burma Road" which provided a minimum amount of water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/ab14d4aafc4e1bb985256204004f55fa!OpenDocument UN Doc A/648] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006021434/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/ab14d4aafc4e1bb985256204004f55fa!OpenDocument |date=2007-10-06 }} of 16 September 1948 Progress Report of the United Nations Mediator [[Count Folke Bernadotte]] on Palestine Submitted to the Secretary-General for Transmission to the Members of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Operation Danny]], Israeli forces anticipated a Jordanian counterattack,&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yjeXQVmGrwcC&amp;pg=PA166 166]&lt;/ref&gt; possibly from Latrun, but King Abdullah remained within the bounds of the tacit agreement made with the Jewish Agency and kept his troops at Latrun.&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, 2006b, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zAJZCKAwtPMC&amp;pg=PA140 140]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], the fort remained a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] under [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian control]], which was in turn surrounded by a perimeter of [[no man's land]]. Under the cease-fire agreement, [[Jordan]] was not to disrupt Israeli travelers using this road; in practice, constant sniper attacks led Israel to build a [[Bypass (road)|bypass road]] around the bulge.

The Palestinian Arab residents of Latrun were evacuated to [[Imwas]] in 1949 as a result of the war and Latrun's location on the 1949 armistice line.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, 1992, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, Latrun was captured by the Israeli Defense Forces, and the main-road to Jerusalem was re-opened and made safe for travel. The villages of [[Imwas]], [[Yalo]] and [[Bayt Nuba]] were razed, their residents taking refuge in the West Bank and Jordan, and [[Canada Park]] was established on the land.&lt;ref&gt;Brynen, Rex and Roula El-Rifai.

On the southern slopes of the olive groves stretched down the road, while at the bottom of the western slope sat a big Trappist monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ariel Sharon]]. page 52 Warrior: An Autobiography&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Since the Six-Day War===
The Latrun monastic community allowed two communities, [[Neve Shalom|Neve Shalom/Wahat as-Salam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gavron|first1=Daniel|title=Holy Land Mosaic:Stories of Cooperation and Coexistence Between Israelis and Palestinians|date=2008|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=978-0-742-54013-2|pages=57–72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-rPdMvSxscC&amp;pg=PA57|chapter=Living together}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the {{ill|Jesus-Bruderschaft|de}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus Brotherhood  Gnadenthal|url=http://www.jesus-bruderschaft.de/fix/doc/JB%20Flyer%20Text%20EN.doc.2.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be established on its land.
The [[Tegart Forts|Tegart Fort]] became the [[Yad La-Shiryon]] memorial for fallen soldiers of the [[Israeli Armored Corps]] and a Museum was established there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armored Corps’ Memorial Site|url=http://www.yadlashiryon.com|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2012, a nude assailant, Rudy Eugene, attacked and maimed Ronald Poppo, a homeless man, on the [[MacArthur Causeway]] in [[Miami, Florida]], making headlines worldwide. During the 18-minute filmed encounter, Eugene accused Poppo of stealing his Bible, beat him unconscious, removed Poppo's pants, and bit off most of Poppo's face above the beard (including his left eye), leaving him blind in both eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Richard Luscombe in Miami |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/30/face-eating-victim-stable-condition?newsfeed=true |title=Face-eating victim 'will recover' from horrific Miami attack |work=guardian.co.uk |date= 30 May 2012|accessdate=2012-06-08 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the incident's shocking nature and subsequent worldwide media coverage, Eugene came to be dubbed the "'''Miami Zombie'''" and the "'''Causeway Cannibal'''".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite web|title=Friends of cannibal Rudy Eugene say he was not 'a face-eating zombie monster' as police reveal first picture of homeless victim in bizarre Miami attack|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/friends-of-cannibal-rudy-eugene-say-he-was-not-a-face-eating-zombie-monster-as-police-reveal-first-picture-of-homeless-victim-in-bizarre-miami-attack/story-fnat7jnn-1226373586516|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack ended when Eugene was fatally shot by a [[Miami Police Department|Miami PD]] officer.

Although friends and family filled in details of Eugene's life, the reason for the attack remains unclear. Eugene, 31, employed at a car wash at the time, was a divorced former high school football player with a series of petty criminal arrests from age 16, with the last in 2009. Poppo, 65, a graduate of Manhattan's [[Stuyvesant High School]], was homeless and had long been presumed dead by his estranged family. While police sources speculated that the use of a street drug like "[[bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]" might have been a factor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=Miami Police believe the 31-year-old was under the influence of something much more powerful than marijuana the day he walked on the MacArthur Causeway, shedding his clothes along the way.

Eugene—who eventually became completely naked, discarding even his shoes and his Bible at the crime scene&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;—encountered 65-year-old Ronald Poppo at approximately 1:55&amp;nbsp;pm. Poppo had been lying underneath the elevated [[Metromover]] people-mover viaduct when Eugene began to pummel him, strip him of his pants, and bite his face.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">'''Microwave International New Media Arts Festival''' (微波國際新媒體藝術節）is a [[new media]] art festival based in [[Hong Kong]]. It began in 1996 as the annual [[video art]] festival for local video art collective [[Videotage]].

In 2006, it became independent from Videotage and in 2007 it officially became fully independent as the government's previous "presenter" role was handed over to Microwave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microwavefest.net/ Microwavefest.net].&lt;/ref&gt; The government remains the main sponsor of the Festival, although many more sponsors are sought for each year's Festival. 

The annual festival generally includes a main exhibition at the Hong Kong City Hall, a smaller scale and usually more alternative exhibition in a separate venue, a keynote conference, performances, screening programmes and other special events organised each year. 

In 2007, the performance by US art collective [[Graffiti Research Lab]] that "hacked the city" with their [[L.A.S.E.R.T.A.G]] along with the participation of local graffiti artist [[MC Yan]], they achieved a record-breaking tag&lt;ref&gt;[http://graffitiresearchlab.com/projects/hong_kong/ GRL + MC YAN = H$NG K$NG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117194515/http://graffitiresearchlab.com/projects/hong_kong/ |date=2010-11-17 }}, [http://graffitiresearchlab.com/ Graffiti Research Lab].&lt;/ref&gt; 1,200 metres ''across'' [[Victoria Harbour]] ([[James Powderly]] and MC Yan tagging from Central ferry, with [[Evan Roth]] and the local crew controlling the set up in front of the [[Hong Kong Cultural Centre|Cultural Centre]] in Tsim Sha Tsui).

In its first extended event outside of the annual November Festival, Microwave also held the "A-Glow-Glow" Macro Interactive Media Art Exhibition in April 2008, which was funded by the [[Hong Kong Arts Development Council]] and aimed for more mass appeal. Two large-scale interactive [[LED]] artworks were placed by the [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] waterfront, right across the harbour from the [[Hong Kong City Hall]], where the annual festival main exhibition is held.

Microwave's festival design, by local design partner [[Milkxhake]], also consistently wins design awards almost every year since their partnership commenced.

{{nihongo|'''Kunchi'''|くんち}}, also {{nihongo|'''Nagasaki Kunchi'''|長崎くんち}} or {{nihongo|'''Nagasaki Okunchi'''|長崎おくんち}}, is the most famous festival in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan. It began as a celebration of autumn [[harvest]]s in the late 16th century and became a shrine festival when [[Suwa Shrine (Nagasaki)|Suwa Shrine]] was founded in 1642. Another purpose was to check for [[Kakure Kirishitan|hidden Christians]] after the ban on Christianity. This is still evident today in the custom of {{nihongo|''garden showing''|庭見せ|niwamise}}, when the presenting neighbourhoods open up their homes to public scrutiny. One of the most famous performances of the festival is the [[Dragon Dance]] which was originally performed on [[New Year's Eve]] by the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] residents of Nagasaki. Rehearsals for the festival begin on June 1. From October 7-9 the presentations of the festival, which vividly reflect Nagasaki's colourful history, spill over from the three festival sites into the streets and create an atmosphere of celebration throughout the city.

===1996–1999: Early years===
The festival was created in 1996 by Ozzy Osbourne's wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, after she was rebuffed by [[Lollapalooza]] when she tried to get Ozzy on that festival circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/10/13/sharon-osbourne-says-ozzfest-her-biggest-achievement|title=Sharon Osbourne says Ozzfest her biggest achievement|author=|date=13 October 2014|website=torontosun.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was well-received, which prompted the festival to become a yearly occurrence.&lt;ref name="ozzy bio"/&gt;

The first Ozzfest was not a national tour, but rather a two-day festival held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[Devore, California]] on 25 and 26 October 1996 respectively.

In 1997, there were large protests outside of the festival to cancel [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s performance. However, no dates were cancelled. There were also protests of a similar nature in 2001, following the [[Columbine High School massacre]], which some groups had blamed on [[Marilyn Manson]].

In 1998, Ozzfest ventured outside the United States for the first time into the United Kingdom, which featured a different line-up of bands. The festival would eventually return to the UK in 2001&lt;ref name="datehistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smnnews.com/ozzfest-date-lineup-history-from-1996/|title=Ozzfest - Date Lineup History from 1996|author=|date=|website=smnnews.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/ozzfestx21x05x02|title=Ozzfest 2002 U.K.|author=|date=21 May 2002|website=contactmusic.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert on 18 July 1998 at Float Rite Park was merged with [[Warped Tour 1998]]. Some 39,000 fans were at the 12-hour, six-stage, 48-band event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deftones Talk About Ozzfest/Warped Marriage|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1428001/deftones-talk-about-ozzfestwarped-marriage/|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000–2006: Commercial success===
In the early 2000s, artists and bands including [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Kittie]], [[Pantera]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Mudvayne]], [[Godsmack]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Linkin Park]],&lt;ref name="ozzfest 2001"/&gt; [[System of a Down]], [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], [[P.O.D.]], and [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] played the yearly music festival.&lt;ref name="ozzfest 2001"&gt;{{cite web

On-stage footage of the Ozzfest 2004 tour was shown on [[MTV]], as Ozzy and Sharon hosted a show on the network titled ''[[Battle for Ozzfest]]'' where they chose eight out of hundreds of bands to compete for a spot on the following year's Ozzfest. Ozzy selected one member from each chosen band to "tag along" on the tour. Each contestant had to complete numerous challenges to improve his/her band's chances of winning the contest. Occasionally, meetings would be held and certain contestants would be eliminated for various reasons. The person who prevailed as the winner and guaranteed his band's spot on the Ozzfest tour was Marc Serrano from metalcore act [[A Dozen Furies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/battle_for_ozzfest/series.jhtml#bio|title=MTV Original TV Shows, Reality TV Shows - MTV|author=|date=|website=MTV|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Iron Maiden]]'s last Ozzfest performance, on 20 August 2005 at the [[Hyundai Pavilion]] at Glen Helen in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], California, several negative events took place. During the first song, several members of the crowd, brought on by [[Sharon Osbourne]], bombarded the British metal band Iron Maiden with eggs, bottle caps and ice after vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] allegedly ridiculed Ozzy's need for a teleprompter during his performances, as well as the Osbourne family's ventures into reality television (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Battle for Ozzfest]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1508432/20050826/osbourne_ozzy.jhtml?headlines=true Sharon Osbourne Admits Cutting Iron Maiden's Power] [[MTV]]:26 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; During three of Iron Maiden's songs, the P.A. system was switched off, cutting power to Dickinson's microphone and then to all the band's instruments. During the concert, Bruce Dickinson can be heard accusing the festival's organizers of deliberately cutting off the band's power. On Iron Maiden's departure, Sharon Osbourne came on stage to make a few statements, telling the audience that she "absolutely loved Iron Maiden" but thought that Dickinson is a "prick."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Chris.

What I actually said was that, if there was anything to apologise for, then I'd do it. But that was twisted around to seem like I'd said sorry – that never happened!"&lt;ref name= "MH Ozzfest"/&gt;

===2007–2008===
On 7 February 2007, it was announced that tickets to Ozzfest 2007 would be offered free of charge, dubbing the 2007 Ozzfest as "free fest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozzfest.com/blog/entry/3 The Ozzfest Community at Ozzfest.com, Heavy Metal &amp; Hard Rock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071540/http://ozzfest.com/blog/entry/3 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets were made available through sponsor websites, the Ozzfest web site and to those buying an advance copy of Ozzy Osbourne's new release, ''[[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Black Rain]]''.

Sponsorship money provided the revenue for the tour, but organizers did not pay any of the bands appearing. Ozzy Osbourne returned to the headlining slot on the tour after being absent from the 2006 tour. Ozzfest 2007 featured well-established acts such as Lamb of God, Static X, and Hatebreed.

There were problems with distribution of the free tickets. Fans were given codes to receive tickets through the official Ozzfest website, but due to the heavy load on [[Live Nation]]'s [[secure server]]s, there were issues with ticket redemption. Another problem was that many "[[eBay]] scalpers" charged fans to pay for the free tickets, often turning out to be unusable duplicates of other tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozzfest.com/blog/entry/25 The Ozzfest Community at Ozzfest.com, Heavy Metal &amp; Hard Rock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707080546/http://ozzfest.com/blog/entry/25 |date=7 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on 26 July, Ozzfest gave away free tickets without requiring its "redemption code" previously required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozzfest.com/blog/entry/49 The Ozzfest Community at Ozzfest.com, Heavy Metal &amp; Hard Rock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071553/http://ozzfest.com/blog/entry/49 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the show of 16 August 2007 in Holmdel, New Jersey at the [[PNC Bank Arts Center]], controversy was generated as 83 attendees were arrested at the show, most of them underage and arrested prior to 8:00. In addition, two men died, one after overdosing on alcohol and energy drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketnews.com/news/Two-Deaths-Occur-at-Ozzfest180807|title=Two Deaths Occur at Ozzfest - TicketNews|author=|date=|website=www.ticketnews.com|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions over whether the event would be held in 2008 began when in April that year Ozzy Osbourne announced that he would be headlining the Canadian Monsters of Rock festival.&lt;ref name="Harris2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Chris|title=Ozzy Osbourne Announces Monsters of Rock Headlining Gig – So What Does This Mean For Ozzfest?|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585580/20080415/osbourne_ozzy.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=15 April 2008|accessdate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 version of the festival took place for only one date at [[Pizza Hut Park]] in [[Frisco, Texas]] on 9 August 2008. The line-up featured [[Metallica]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as the headliner bands, as well as other acts such as [[Jonathan Davis]] (frontman of [[Korn]]), [[Sevendust]], [[DevilDriver]], [[Serj Tankian]] (frontman of [[System of a Down]]), [[Cavalera Conspiracy]], [[Shadows Fall]], [[Apocalyptica]] and [[In This Moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bands|url=http://www.ozzfest.com/static_content/view/bands.html|publisher=Ozzfest|year=2008|accessdate=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metallica"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Chris|title=Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne Sign on For One-Day Ozzfest|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1587371/20080513/metallica.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=13 May 2008|accessdate=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the two main stages was a third, named the Texas Stage, which, according to Sharon Osbourne, featured such Texas-based bands as [[The Sword (band)|The Sword]], [[Drowning Pool]], [[Goatwhore]], [[Soilent Green]] and [[Rigor Mortis (band)|Rigor Mortis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozzfest...Metallica Arrives Saturday, August 9th in Dallas, Texas|url=http://www.ozzfest.com/blog/entry/69|publisher=Ozzfest|date=20 May 2008|accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080615193001/http://www.ozzfest.com/blog/entry/69 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freedman|first=Pete|title=Ozzfest 2008 is One Show Only...In Frisco|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2008-05-22/music/ozzfest-2008-is-one-show-only-in-frisco/|work=Dallas Observer|date=22 May 2008|accessdate=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Version of "The Monsters of Rock" was held exclusively on 26 July 2008 at the McMahon Stadium located in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada. It was also scheduled as a "one time only" event. The main attraction for the festival of heavy metal and mayhem were metal giants [[Judas Priest]] and the headliner, [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. In addition, various other "big league" heavy metal outfits attended the festivities. The following bands preceded the two main attractions: [[Serj Tankian]], [[Hatebreed]], [[Cavalera Conspiracy]] (featuring current frontman of [[Soulfly]],and former frontman of [[Sepultura]], [[Max Cavalera]]), [[Shadows Fall]], Canadian metal unit [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[3 Inches of Blood]], [[Priestess (band)|Priestess]], [[Zimmers Hole]], and [[Dillinger Escape Plan]].

'''Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia''' (Tassilo Wilhelm Humbert Leopold Friedrich Karl; 6 April 1893 – 6 April 1917) was a [[Germany|German]] [[prince]] and competitive [[Equestrianism|horse rider]] who competed in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Friedrich Karl, Prince von Preußen"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/vo/friedrich-karl-prince-von-preussen-1.html |title=Friedrich Karl, Prince von Preußen |accessdate=3 August 2015 |work=Sports Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Prince Friedrich Karl was born in [[Jagdschloss Glienicke|Schloss Klein-Glienicke]], [[Potsdam]], [[Berlin]].  He was the son of [[Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia]] (1865–1931) and [[Princess Louise Sophie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg]] (1866–1952) and a grandson of [[Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia]].

He was a member of the 1912 German Olympic equestrian team, which won a bronze medal in the [[Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Team jumping|team jumping]] event.  His horse during the Olympic competition was "Gibson Boy".

He fought in [[World War I]] as an aviator between 1914 and 1917.  He commanded ''Fliegerabteilung (Artillerie) 258'', an [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]] unit, but flew patrols in a single-seat fighter with ''[[Jagdstaffel 2|Jasta Boelcke]]'' whenever possible.  During one such patrol on March 21, 1917, he was forced to land because of a bullet in his engine and with a slight wound to his foot.  He landed his [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] aircraft in [[no-man's land]], but while running towards his own lines he was shot in the back and severely wounded by Australian troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German royal airman’s last fight|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/register/german-royal-airmans-last-fight-xrh2sl3wx|website=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken into captivity, where he died from his injuries on 6 April 1917 at [[Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray]].&lt;ref name="WWI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/friv/lists.cgi?id=65 |title=Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War |accessdate=3 August 2015 |work=Sports Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint François d'Assise''''' is an opera in three acts and eight scenes by French composer and librettist [[Olivier Messiaen]], written from 1975 to 1983.  It concerns [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]], the title character, and displays the composer's devout Catholicism.  The world première was given by the [[Paris Opera]] at the [[Palais Garnier]] on 28 November 1983.

==Composition history==
Despite his studies of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas, Messiaen thought he would never compose an opera.  When [[Rolf Liebermann]], general manager of the [[Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opera]], commissioned an opera from Messiaen in 1971 the composer refused.  Messiaen changed his mind when Liebermann arranged that he be a guest at a dinner at the [[Elysée Palace]], hosted by then French President [[Georges Pompidou]]; at the end of the dinner Pompidou said: "Messiaen, you will write an opera for the Opéra de Paris!".&lt;ref name=Proms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2008/aboutthemusic/p70_messiaen.shtml|title=About the Music / Programme Notes—Olivier Messiaen (1908–92)—''Saint Francis of Assisi'' (1975–83)|work=[[BBC Proms]] website|publisher=BBC |author=Roger Nichols&lt;!-- doesn't seem to be either of the Roger Nichols we have an article for--&gt;|date=7 September 2008|accessdate=8 September 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In searching for subject matter, Messiaen pondered dramatizing either Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] or his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. Feeling unworthy of either subject, he eventually chose to dramatize the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, which paralleled [[Jesus|Christ]]'s chastity, humility, poverty, and suffering.

The process of writing the opera took its toll on the composer. Initially, Messiaen set to work and he made rapid progress as it became the sole object of his musical attention. By 1977 he contacted the general manager of the Paris National Opera to say he was ready to play through an unorchestrated version of the opera. Messiaen could not envisage orchestrating the opera by 1980, and adding to the pressure on Messiaen, there was a leak on the radio that he was writing an opera about Saint Francis. This revelation transgressed Messiaen's normal practice of secrecy when composing.

Messiaen appealed for a deadline extension in 1979. The new date was agreed to be 1983; however, Messiaen's health was now beginning to deteriorate. In 1981 he had several periods of ill-health, and Messiaen once again doubted that he would finish according to plan. Messiaen began to suffer from depressions, and by December 1981 he felt unable to go on. However, his doctor advised him to take daily walks to increase his wellbeing and he began to attend evening mass at the [[Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacre Coeur]]. This encouraged Messiaen to go on and complete the work, though by completion it had left its mark and he was still convinced it would be his last.

===Libretto===
For maximum artistic freedom, Messiaen penned both [[libretto]] and [[sheet music|score]].&lt;ref name=Proms /&gt;  For nearly eight years, the composer consulted [[Franciscan]] sources, reading biographies by [[Tommaso da Celano|Thomas of Celano]] and [[Bonaventure|St. Bonaventure]], as well as Francis' own prayers (including ''Canticle of the Sun'').  He also cited passages from the ''[[Fioretti]]'', ''Considerations on the Stigmata'' and the Bible.

In order to focus on the progress of grace in Francis's soul after his conversion, Messiaen omitted certain episodes in his hero's life, including the often-romanticized relationship between Francis and [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]], and the fable of his taming of a wild wolf at [[Gubbio]].  

Critics later chastised Messiaen for beginning the action after Francis’s conversion. The composer defended his choice in an interview with [[Claude Samuel]]: "Some people have told me, 'There's no sin in your work.'  But I myself feel sin isn't interesting, dirt isn't interesting. I prefer flowers. I left out sin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/29/classicalmusicandopera.proms 'Sin isn't interesting. I prefer flowers' ''The Guardian'' 29 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera's eight scenes, divided into three acts, delineate Francis’s spiritual development.  Act One contains scenes in which he realizes his goals:  "La Croix" (''The Cross''), "Les Laudes" (''Lauds'') and "Le Baiser au Lépreux" (''The Kissing of the Leper'').  Act Two shows Francis's journey towards enlightenment, ministry and divinity: "L’Ange voyageur" (''The Journeying Angel''), "L’Ange musicien" (''The Angel Musician'') and "Le Prêche aux oiseaux" (''The Sermon to the Birds'').  The scenes of Act Three explore the saint's approach to divinity and his entrance into eternity: "Les Stigmates" (''The [[Stigmata]]'') and "La Mort et la Nouvelle Vie" (''Death and the New Life'').

==Performance history==
After the 1983 world premiere at the Palais Garnier, ''Saint François'' was not staged for almost a decade. The opera was presented on stage again by the 1992 [[Salzburg Festival]] (at the ''Felsenreitschule''), directed by [[Peter Sellars]] with [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] conducting the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] in the orchestra pit. This production was revived in 1998, again at the Salzburg Festival. Productions at [[Oper Leipzig]] (1998) and at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] (2002) followed. The American premiere took place at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in 2002. Since then, the opera was presented in staged productions by the [[RuhrTriennale]] at the Jahrhunderthalle in Bochum (2003), by the [[Opéra National de Paris]] at the [[Opéra Bastille]] in Paris (2004), by the [[Stopera|Muziektheater]] in Amsterdam (2008) and by the [[Bavarian State Opera]] in Munich (2011). The Munich production was directed by [[Hermann Nitsch]], a renowned representative of Viennese [[action painting]]. The RuhrTriennale production was also shown in the Madrid Arena (Spain) in 2011.

==Synopsis==
:Place: Italy. 
:Time: 13th century.

The subject of each scene is borrowed from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' and the ''Reflexions on the Stigmata'', books written by anonymous [[Franciscans]] of the 14th century.  There are seven characters: [[Saint Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]], the Leper, the Angel, Brother Elias, and three Brothers especially beloved of Saint Francis--[[Brother Leo]], Brother Masseo, and Brother Bernard.  Throughout the work one must see the progress of grace in the soul of Saint Francis.

===Act 1===
''Scene 1: The Cross''

Saint Francis explains to Brother Leo that for the love of [[Jesus|Christ]] he must patiently endure all contradictions, all suffering. This is the "Perfect joy."

''Scene 2: Lauds''

After the recitation of Matins by the Brothers, Saint Francis, remaining alone, prays that he might meet a leper and be capable of loving him.

''Scene 3: The Kissing of the Leper''

At a leper-hospital, a [[leprosy|leper]], horribly blood-stained and covered in pustules, rails against his disease.  Saint Francis enters and, sitting close to him, speaks gently.  An angel appears behind a window and says: "Leper, your heart accuses you, but God is greater than your heart."  Troubled by the voice and by the goodness of Saint Francis, the leper is stricken with remorse.  Saint Francis embraces him and, miraculously, the leper is cured and dances for joy.  More important than the cure of the leper is the growth of grace in the soul of Saint Francis and his exultation at having triumphed over himself.

===Act 2===
''Scene 4: The Journeying Angel''

On a forest road on [[La Verna]] an angel appears, disguised as a traveler.  His knocking on the door of the monastery makes a terrific sound, symbolising the inrush of Grace.  Brother Masseo opens the door.  The Angel asks Brother Elias, the vicar of the Order, a question about [[predestination]].  Brother Elias refuses to answer and pushes the Angel outside.  The Angel knocks on the door again and puts the same question to Brother Bernard, who replies with much wisdom.  The Angel having gone, Brother Bernard and Brother Masseo look at each other, Bernard remarking, "Perhaps it was an angel..."

''Scene 5: The Angel-Musician''

The Angel appears to Saint Francis and, to give him a foretaste of celestial bliss, plays him a solo on his viol.  This solo is so glorious that Francis swoons.

''Scene 6: The Sermon to the Birds''

Set at [[Assisi]], at the Carceri, with a large green oak tree in spring with many birds singing. Saint Francis, followed by Brother Masseo, preaches a sermon to the birds and solemnly blesses them.  The birds reply with a great chorus in which are heard not only birds of [[Umbria]], especially the [[blackcap]], but also birds of other countries, of distant lands, notably the [[Isle of Pines, New Caledonia|Isle of Pines]], close to [[New Caledonia]].

===Act 3===
''Scene 7: The [[Stigmata]]''

On [[La Verna]] at night in a cave beneath an overhanging rock, Saint Francis is alone.  A great Cross appears.  The voice of Christ, symbolized by a choir, is heard almost continually.  Five luminous beams dart from the Cross and successively strike the two hands, the two feet, and the right side of Saint Francis, with the same terrific sound that accompanied the Angel's knocking.  These five wounds, which resemble the five wounds of Christ, are the divine confirmation of Saint Francis's holiness.

''Scene 8: Death and the New Life''

Saint Francis is dying, stretched out at full length on the ground.  All the Brothers are around him.  He bids farewell to all those he has loved, and sings the last verse of his ''[[Canticle of the Sun]]'', the verse of "our sister bodily Death".  The Brothers sing Psalm 141.  The Angel and the Leper appear to Saint Francis to comfort him.  Saint Francis utters his last words: "Lord! Music and poetry have led me to Thee [...] in default of Truth [...] dazzle me for ever by Thy excess of Truth..."  He dies. Bells ring.  Everything disappears.  While the choir hymns the Resurrection, a patch of light illuminates the spot where previously the body of Saint Francis lay.  The light increases until it becomes blinding.  The curtain falls.

==Musical elements==
Messiaen's wealth of experience as an orchestral composer manifests itself in ''Saint François d’Assise''.  In fact, Messiaen devotes a great majority of the opera's running time to orchestral music, though not to the detriment of character development.  The composer reflects the characters’ psychological and emotional state through the use of [[leitmotif]] and [[Bird song|birdsong]].

===Leitmotif===
Several leitmotifs exist in the orchestral score, most of which connect to one or more characters.

*'''Death''' (or "J’ai peur")
The dramatic action of the opera begins with the entrance of Brother Leo, who sings the "death" motif to words taken from the end of [[Ecclesiastes]]: "I am afraid on the road, when the windows grow larger and more obscure, and when the leaves of the poinsettia no longer turn red."  "I am afraid on the road, when, about to die, the tiare flower is no longer perfumed.  Behold! The invisible, the invisible is seen…"  This theme repeats nearly every time Leo enters, and the orchestra accompanies it with lazy glissandos in the strings.
*'''Perfect Joy''' ("la joie parfaite")
Francis answers Leo's introspection with the "perfect joy" motif, a combination of [[Trumpet|Trumpet in D]], [[xylophone]] and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]].  This motif reoccurs several times throughout the piece.  In some cases, Brother Leo's "death" motif alternates with Francis’ "perfect joy" motif.
*'''Solemnity'''
Messiaen linked Francis’ moments of great solemnity with quite possibly the most pervasive motif of the opera.  It is structured as a [[tone cluster]] in the [[trombone]] section, creating an ominous, harsh sound.  The motif is quite evident in the second scene, wherein Francis asks God to let him meet a leper: "Fais-moi rencontrer un lépreux."  The tone clusters break up his line of text: "Fais-moi"—''cluster''—"rencontrer"—''cluster''—"un lépreux."
*'''Grace'''
During Scene Four at [[La Verna]], the Angel knocks on the monastery door.  Messiaen represents the knocking with a motif heavy pounding sounds in the percussion and [[String instrument|strings]].  He saw these knocks as an entry of grace—a force one must not resist.  The Angel's knocking foreshadows Francis’ eventual acceptance of the [[stigmata]] during Scene Seven.  The main difference in Scene Seven is that the motif represents the painful, brutal pounding of nails into Christ's body.

===Birdsong===
Messiaen considered himself an [[ornithology|ornithologist]], and his love for birds is evident in the opera.  The composer traveled to the saint's native [[Assisi]], as well as [[New Caledonia]], to research and record birdcalls of several local species, later transcribing them into melodies for use as musical themes attached to particular characters.

*'''François''' – [[Blackcap|Capinera]] (Italian for "Blackcap")
Upon entering caves at the Carceri (just east of Assisi), Messiaen heard the call of the capinera.  Francis often retreated to these caves for meditation and prayer, thus the choice of the capinera is fitting.
*'''L’Ange''' – Gerygone
This yellow-bellied warbler from New Caledonia signals nearly every entrance and exit of the Angel.  Messiaen scored the gerygone with a staccato piccolo alternating with glockenspiel and xylophone.  In some cases, the [[kestrel]] birdcall accompanies the gerygone.
*'''Frère Elie''' – Notou
Francis’ most contrarian brother, Elias, receives the birdcall of this "gloomy sounding pigeon" from New Caledonia.
*'''Frère Bernard''' – [[Friarbird|Philemon]] (or "friarbird")
The philemon birdcall (most likely recorded in New Caledonia) reflects Bernardo's age and wisdom while punctuating his musical and textual phrases.

Messiaen devotes the entire sixth scene ("La Prêche aux oiseaux" or, ''The Sermon to the Birds'') to all manner of birdsong as Francis delivers his famous sermon with Brother Masseo in attendance.

===Orchestra===
Messiaen's full orchestration requires more than 110 musicians, placing great demands on budgets as well as orchestra pit space. At the [[Palais Garnier]], the overflow of players were placed in boxes adjacent to the stage.

* '''Woodwinds''': 3 [[piccolos]], 3 [[flute]]s, 1 [[alto flute]], 3 [[oboe]]s, 1 [[Cor anglais|English horn]], 2 [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinets]], 3 [[clarinet]]s, 1 [[bass clarinet]], 1 [[contrabass clarinet]], 3 [[bassoon]]s, 1 [[contrabassoon]]
* '''[[Brass instrument|Brass]]''': 6 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 1 small trumpet in D, 3 trumpets, 4 [[trombone]]s, 2 [[Bass tuba|bass tubas]], 1 [[contrabass tuba]]
* '''[[String section|Strings]]''': 16 first [[Violin|violins]], 16 second violins, 14 [[viola]]s, 12 [[Cello|cellos]] and 10 [[double bass]]es
* '''Percussion''' (5 players): 
:: ''Player 1:'' [[Glockenspiel|bells]], [[claves]], [[wind machine|eoliphone]], [[snare drum]] 
:: ''Player 2:'' [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[claves]], 6 [[temple blocks]], very small [[cymbal]], small [[cymbal]], [[suspended cymbal]] 
:: ''Player 3:'' [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[claves]], [[wood block]], [[whip (instrument)|whip]], a pair of [[maraca]]s, a [[reco reco]] or [[guiro]], glass chimes, shell chimes, wood chimes, [[tambourine]], 3 [[gong]]s 
:: ''Player 4:'' [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[claves]], set of [[crotales]], large suspended [[cymbal]], [[suspended cymbal]], medium [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]], low tom-tom, 3 [[Gong#Chau gongs (Tam-tam)|tam-tams]] 
:: ''Player 5:'' set of [[Glockenspiel|bells]], [[Thunder sheet|metal sheet]], [[claves]], [[Geophone (percussion instrument)|geophone]], [[wind machine|eoliphone]], [[bass drum]]

In addition to these, pitched percussion instruments are also used: one [[xylophone]], one [[xylorimba]], one [[marimba]], one [[glockenspiel]] and one [[vibraphone]], as well as three [[Ondes Martenot]] which the composer described in his interview with Claude Samuel as being 'very rare in an opera!'.

===Chorus===
The opera requires a ten-part, 150-voice choir, which serves a twofold role:  [[Greek chorus]] and divine presence.  Throughout the piece, the chorus comments on Francis’ spiritual journey.  The first three scenes include a commentary on the preceding plot action with a "moral."  For example, after Francis' conversation with Leo on "perfect joy", the chorus sings the text "He who would walk in my steps, let him renounce himself, take up his Cross and follow me."  One could say that this text carries a double purpose—the moral is not only sung, but comes from the mouth of [[Jesus|Christ]].  In the latter scenes of the opera, especially ''The [[Stigmata]]'', the chorus perpetuates its image as Christ speaking directly to Francis as He bestows the wounds onto the saint.  Messiaen's choral writing, especially the violent, wordless chants during ''The [[Stigmata]]'', suggests a mystical, otherworldly presence.

===Color===
Messiaen's [[synesthesia]] caused a perception of colors associated with particular harmonies or musical [[Degree (music)|scale degrees]].  For instance, when hearing a C-natural on the piano, the composer saw "white" before his eyes.  In the opera, Messiaen underscores the final moments (Francis’ death and ascent into heaven) on a [[C major]] chord structure, providing a musical burst of white light.  It is unclear whether this final chord structure was coincidental or intentional.

==Messiaen's other research==
Messiaen traveled to Italy not merely for [[Bird song|birdcall]] research.  In Assisi, he visited the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] to study the [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] [[fresco]]es.  During rehearsal for the premiere production, the composer coached [[baritone]] [[José van Dam]] (creator of the title role) in some of the gestures and attitudes evoked on the [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] masterpieces.  Messiaen also made a side trip to [[Florence]].  While in the [[San Marco, Florence|monastery of San Marco]], he found inspiration for the Angel's costume in one of several paintings of the [[Annunciation]] by [[Fra Angelico]].  As a result, the libretto includes a costume note on the exact shade of the Angel's robe (as dictated by the original artwork): a pinkish [[mauve]] between lilac and salmon.

==Recordings and broadcasts==
Four recordings of the opera exist, three of which are complete:
*'''Ozawa''' (1983): Conductor [[Seiji Ozawa]] recorded the world première production with the orchestra and chorus of the [[Opéra National de Paris|Théâtre national de l'Opéra de Paris]].  Cast members included [[José van Dam]] in the title role with soprano [[Christiane Eda-Pierre]] as the Angel.  Released on the Cybélia label (then Assai Classics),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000508UZ|title=Saint François d'Assise (Assai Classics) at Amazon.com|accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was the first complete recording of the opera.
*'''Zagrosek''' (1985): The [[Salzburg Festival]] of 1985 included performances of the opera under the baton of [[Lothar Zagrosek]], with the [[Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Arnold Schoenberg Chor]].

*'''Nagano''' (1998): Nagano also helmed this complete live recording with the [[Hallé Orchestra]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg Choir]] at the [[Salzburg Festival]] in 1998 for release on [[Deutsche Grammophon]].  José van Dam returned to sing the title role.  American soprano [[Dawn Upshaw]] sang the Angel, with [[Chris Merritt]] as the Leper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JSAO|title=Saint François d'Assise (Deutsche Grammophon) at Amazon.com|accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera was given a semi-staged performance as Prom 70 in the 2008 [[BBC Proms]] season and broadcast live on [[BBC Radio 3]]. This was based on the recent production by [[Netherlands Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2008/whatson/0709.shtml|title=About the Music / Proms by Day—Sunday 7 September—Prom 70: Messiaen's Saint Francis of Assisi |work=[[BBC Proms]] website|publisher=BBC |year=2008 |accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This production was filmed and issued on DVD in 2009, with [[Rod Gilfry|Rodney Gilfry]] as St. Francis and [[Camilla Tilling]] as the Angel.  The conductor is [[Ingo Metzmacher]], and the stage producer is Pierre Audi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2426">The '''[[Sree Narayana Jayanthi]] Vallam Kali or Boat Race''', at [[Kumarakom]], [[Kerala]] is held in the month of September every year during [[Onam]] festival. More than 1,000 oarsmen in boats of different sizes and shapes participate. Even though snake boats participate in this race, the importance is given here is for '''iruttukuthi''', in which about 50 oarsmen row. The successful iruttukuthi wins the Sree Narayana Ever Rolling Trophy.

== Origin ==
In 1903 the [[Sree Narayana Guru]] arrived at [[Kumarakom]] to consecrate an idol of Sri Balasubrahmonia Swami at the [[Kumaramangalom Temple]]. After much hesitation that he agreed to consecrate the idol as he was more interested in starting a school at the backward village. Eventually, both the school and the temple were started as per the wish of the Guru. The arrival of the Guru was a great day of celebration for the people of this nondescript village by the Vembanad lake and they welcomed the sage into their midst, accompanying him in their boats in a procession. To commemorate this event, for the past many decades, a boat race, preceded by a boat procession are held as part of the [[Sri Narayana Jayanthi]] celebrations at [[Kumarakom]].

== Celebrations ==
The day begins with special pujas at the Kumaramangalom Temple. This is followed by Gurupuja and Gurupushpanjali at the Gurumandiram. Arts and sports competitions for children are held as part of the celebrations during the forenoon. The ''Kumarakom boat race'' commences. Prior to this, the grand procession of country boats carrying a portrait of [[Sree Narayana Guru]] and the ''thidampu'' from Kumaramangalom Temple is held up to Kottathodu, the venue of the boat race. The celebrations conclude with a public meeting and distribution of prizes for the winners.

[[File:Star theatre.JPG|thumb|Facade of the Star Theatre]]
The '''Star Theatre''' is a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] in [[Kolkata]], built in 1883. Initially situated in Beadon Street, the theatre later moved to Cornwallis Street - now called [[Bidhan Sarani]]. The Star, along with the [[Minerva Theatre, Kolkata|Minerva Theatre]], was one of the first institutions of commercial Bengali theatre. The Star, along with Minerva and The Classic Theatre, were also one of the places where the [[Cinema of West Bengal|first motion pictures]] in Bengal, made by [[Hira Lala Sen]], were screened. This is a heritage site of Calcutta (Kolkata) that was destroyed in a fire and thereafter restored by the local municipal corporation. The restored Star Theatre maintains the heritage facade; the interiors are contemporary. The property is maintained by a private company. At present, it is primarily a cinema hall; plays are staged on about two days per month. However, during winter (December and January) plays are staged here much more frequently, of the order of ten days per month. The auditorium has excellent acoustics. Star Theatre is close to the junction of Grey Street (Aurobindo Saranee) and Cornwallis Street (Bidhan Saranee); the area near this junction is called Hatibagan (Elephant Park). The theatre is a 10-minute walk from the Shobhabazar-Sutanuti station of the underground railway. Star Theatre has an underground car park with a nominal parking fee of Rs 10/- per hour (minimum three hours). Tramcar tracks, and services, on Grey Street and Cornwallis Street enhance the heritage ambience.

[[Girish Chandra Ghosh]] was one of the first to produce plays at the Star Theatre, in the 1880s.

In 2012, the Star Theatre was to be returned to civic ownership, "to stop commercialization of the historic building that was once visited by Bengali luminaries such as [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar|Vidyasagar]], [[Ramakrishna Paramhansa]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (28 March 2012).

The '''Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations''' or '''The Great Exhibition''', sometimes referred to as the '''Crystal Palace Exhibition''' in reference to the temporary structure in which it was held, was an international exhibition that took place in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, from 1 May to 15 October 1851. It was the first in a series of [[World's fair|World's Fairs]], exhibitions of [[culture]] and [[industry]] that became popular in the 19th century, and it was a much anticipated event. The Great Exhibition was organized by [[Henry Cole]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of the reigning monarch, [[Queen Victoria]]. It was attended by famous people of the time, including [[Charles Darwin]], [[Samuel Colt]], members of the [[Orléanist|Orléanist Royal Family]] and the writers [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[George Eliot]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. Music for the opening was under the direction of Sir [[George Thomas Smart]] and the continuous music from the exhibited organs for the Queen's procession was "under the superintendence of [[William Sterndale Bennett]]".

==Background==
The [[Exposition des produits de l'industrie française]] (Exhibition of Products of French Industry) organized in Paris, France, from 1798 to 1849 were precursors to the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London.

The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations was organized by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], [[Henry Cole]], Francis Henry, [[George Wallis]], [[Sir Charles Dilke, 1st Baronet|Charles Dilke]] and other members of the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]] as a celebration of modern [[Industry|industrial]] technology and design. It was arguably a response to the highly effective [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844]]: indeed, its prime motive was for Britain to make "clear to the world its role as industrial leader".&lt;ref name="Kishlansky, Mark 2008"&gt;Kishlansky, Mark, Patrick Geary and Patricia O'Brien. ''Civilization in the West''. 7th Edition. Vol. C. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort, was an enthusiastic promoter of the self-financing exhibition; the government was persuaded to form the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]] to establish the viability of hosting such an exhibition. Queen Victoria and her family visited three times. Although the Great Exhibition was a platform on which countries from around the world could display their achievements, Britain sought to prove its own superiority. The British exhibits at the Great Exhibition "held the lead in almost every field where strength, durability, utility and quality were concerned, whether in iron and steel, machinery or textiles."&lt;ref name="Ffrench, Yvonne 1851"&gt;Ffrench, Yvonne. ''The Great Exhibition''; 1851. London: Harvill Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain also sought to provide the world with the hope of a better future. Europe had just struggled through "two difficult decades of political and social upheaval," and now Britain hoped to show that technology, particularly its own, was the key to a better future.&lt;ref name="Kishlansky, Mark 2008"/&gt;

Sophie Forgan says of the Exhibition that "Large, piled-up ‘trophy’ exhibits in the central avenue revealed the organisers’ priorities; they generally put art or colonial raw materials in the most prestigious place. Technology and moving machinery were popular, especially working exhibits." She also notes that visitors "could watch the entire process of cotton production from spinning to finished cloth. Scientific instruments were found in class X, and included electric telegraphs, microscopes, air pumps and barometers, as well as musical, [[horological]] and surgical instruments."&lt;ref name="Forgan, S. 2000"&gt;{{citation |last=Forgan |first=Sophie |journal=Nature |page=596 |title=A compendium of Victorian culture |volume=403 |issue=6880 |date=10 February 2000 |doi=10.1038/35001134|bibcode=2000Natur.403..596F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special building, nicknamed [[The Crystal Palace]], or "The Great [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar]]",&lt;ref name="dukemag"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111206/depgal2.html|title= The Great Exhibition of 1851|accessdate=30 July 2007 |work= Duke Magazine|date= November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built to house the show. It was designed by [[Joseph Paxton]] with support from [[structural engineer]] [[Charles Fox (civil and railway engineer)|Charles Fox]], the committee overseeing its construction including [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], and went from its organisation to the grand opening in just nine months. The building was architecturally adventurous, drawing on Paxton's experience designing [[greenhouse]]s for the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|sixth Duke of Devonshire]]. It took the form of a massive glass house, 1848 feet (about 563 metres) long by 454 feet (about 138 metres) wide and was constructed from [[cast iron]]-frame components and [[glass]] made almost exclusively in [[Birmingham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James Harrison|title=Children's Encyclopedia of British History|year=1996|publisher=Kingfisher Publications|location=London|isbn=978-0-7534-0299-3|page=131|chapter=Imperial Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Smethwick]]. From the interior, the building's large size was emphasized with trees and statues; this served, not only to add beauty to the spectacle, but also to demonstrate man's triumph over nature.&lt;ref name="Kishlansky, Mark 2008"/&gt; The Crystal Palace was an enormous success, considered an architectural marvel, but also an engineering triumph that showed the importance of the Exhibition itself.&lt;ref name="Ffrench, Yvonne 1851"/&gt; The building was later moved and re-erected in 1854 in enlarged form at [[Sydenham Hill]] in south London, an area that was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]]. It was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936.&lt;ref name="dukemag"/&gt;

Six million people—equivalent to a third of the entire population of Britain at the time—visited the Great Exhibition. The average daily attendance was 42,831 with a peak attendance of 109,915 on 7 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=412|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n419/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event made a surplus of £186,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|186000|1851|2015|r=-4}}}} in 2015),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, which was used to found the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. They were all built in the area to the south of the exhibition, nicknamed [[Albertopolis]], alongside the [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]]. The remaining surplus was used to set up an educational trust to provide grants and scholarships for industrial research; it continues to do so today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 | title = About Us | url = http://www.royalcommission1851.org.uk/about.html | accessdate = 1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exhibition caused controversy as its opening approached. Some conservatives feared that the mass of visitors might become a revolutionary mob,&lt;ref name="newth"&gt;{{cite book | last = Newth | first = A.M. | title = Britain and the World: 1789-1901 | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 1967 | isbn = 978-0-14-080304-4 | page = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst radicals such as [[Karl Marx]] saw the exhibition as an emblem of a [[capitalism|capitalist]] fetishism of commodities. King Ernest Augustus I of Hanover, shortly before his death, wrote to Lord Strangford about it:  &lt;blockquote&gt;
The folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to [[Osborne House|Osborne]] during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the occasion.  The idea&amp;nbsp;... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman.  But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van der Kiste|2004|pp=206–207.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern times, the Great Exhibition is a symbol of the [[Victorian Age]], and its thick catalogue, illustrated with steel engravings, is a primary source for High Victorian design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Official Catalogue of the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations |year=1851 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=OfMHAAAAQAAJ&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial to the exhibition, crowned with a statue of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]],  is located behind the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://preview-riba.contensis.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/GreatExhibition/MemorialToTheExhibition.aspx| title= Memorial to the exhibition| publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects]]|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inscribed with statistics from the exhibition, including the number of visitors and exhibitors (British and foreign), and the profit made.

== Admission fees ==
Admission prices to the Crystal Palace varied according to the date of visit, with ticket prices decreasing as the parliamentary season drew to an end and London traditionally emptied of wealthy individuals. Prices varied from three [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3.15|1851|2015|r=2}}}} in 2015){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} (two guineas for a woman) for a season ticket, or £1 per day (for the first two days only), then reducing to five shillings per day (until May 22).&lt;ref name="leapman"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World For A Shilling | author=Leapman, Michael | year=2001 | pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission price was then further reduced to one shilling (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.05|1851|2015|r=2}}}} in 2015),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} per day – except on Fridays, when it was set at two shillings and six pence and on Saturdays when it remained at five shillings.&lt;ref name="leapman"/&gt; The one-shilling ticket proved most successful amongst the industrial classes, with four and a half million shillings (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|225000|1851|2015|r=0}}}} in 2015),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} being taken from attendees in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/the_great_exhibition.htm#Entrance%20Costs%20To%20The%20Great%20Exhibition|title=Entrance Costs to the Great Exhibition|work=Fashion Era|accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thousand five hundred tickets were printed for the opening day, all of which were bought.&lt;ref name="newth"/&gt;

== Souvenirs: Lane's Telescopic Views ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
The Great Exhibition of 1851 encouraged the production of souvenirs, the Lane's Telescopic Views which provided a three-dimensional view of the Great Exhibition of 1851. These were paper souvenirs that were made of printed lithographic cards which were hand-coloured and held together by cloth to give a three-dimensional view of the Great Exhibition. These views offered a miniature view of the Crystal Palace Exhibition when one viewed the cards through the peep hole on the front cover. Visitors purchased these souvenirs so that they could relive the experience of going to the exhibition.

'''Triplemanía III-A''' was the first of three parts of the third [[Triplemanía]] [[professional wrestling]] show series promoted by [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). 1995 was second year to feature the "Triplemanía Series" of shows with 3, referred to as III-A, III-B and III-C. The show took place on June 10, 1995 in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], Mexico. The Main event featured a 13-wrestler [[Professional wrestling match types|Steel Cage Elimination match]], ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' "Mask vs. Mask" match featuring the "[[Mini-Estrella]]s" division. The participants included Ninjita, [[Espectrito I]], [[Espectrito II]], [[Jerrito Estrada]], Fuercita Guerrera, [[Mascarita Sagrada]], Mini Calo, [[Octagoncito]], [[La Parkita]], [[Payasito Rojo]], Payasito Azul, [[Super Muñequito]], and Torerito. This marked the first and so far only time that the "Minis division" was featured in the main event of a Triplemanía. The show also featured the first of three ''Lucha de Apuestas'', mask vs. mask match series for the Triplemanía III shows as the culmination of a storyline feud between the ''tecnico'' team ([[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]], those that portray the good guys) of [[Super Caló]] and [[Abismo Negro|Winners]] against the ''Rudo'' ([[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], those that portray the bad guys) team known as ''[[Los Diabolicos]]'' ("The Diabolical Ones"; Ángel Mortal and Marabunta). Six of the eight matches were later shown on AAA's weekly [[Televisa]] show.

==Production==

===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA, or Triple A; Spanish for "Assistance, Consulting, and Administration"). After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April, 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Peña and AAA held their first [[Triplemanía]] event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's [[Super Bowl]] event, similar to the [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] being the biggest show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 Triplemanía was the third year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the fifth overall show under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía show featured seven [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Initial plans for the 1995 Triplemanía III series of events included a storyline where ''[[Los Gringos Locos]]'' members [[Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Art Barr]] would turn on teammate [[Konnan]] in the fall of 1994. This was supposed to turn ''técnico'' and set up a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, between Konnan and Art Barr where both would put their hair on the line.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAA booker [[Antonio Peña]] was hoping to actually sell out the 130,000 seat [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; The plans never came to fruition as Art Barr died suddenly on November 23, 1994 before the storyline even had a chance to start.&lt;ref name="HardcoreHistory"&gt;{{cite book | last=Williams | first=Scott | title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW'| pages=45–46 | publisher=SportsPublishingLLC |  year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr's death, coupled with the [[Mexican peso crisis]] in 1994 led to Guerrero leaving AAA to work in the United States instead and thus made a ''Los Gringos Locos'' storyline impossible to piece together. AAA still planned on making the 1995 Triplemanía III event a series of shows, spread out over several weeks, serving as the [[Super Bowl]] of AAA's year.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

The first two Triplemanía III shows were supposed to take place in late April, but for reason that have not been revealed the first show had to be canceled on the day of the event, leading to a second Triplemanía III show in ''Arena Rio Nilo'' in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] to be changed at the last moment.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; The show was changed so late in the day that the apron and posters in the arena advertised that the show was a Triplemanía show.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; The show still featured three high profile matches, starting with the trio of [[Maniaco|Perro Silva]], [[Karloff Lagarde, Jr.]] and [[Los Diabolicos|Mr. Cóndor]] defeating ''Las Gemas del Ring'' (Zafiro, Brillante, Diamante) in a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match, forcing all three ''Gemas'' to unmask.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=DiaApril30&gt;{{cite web | url=https://superluchas.com/2015/04/30/en-un-dia-como-hoy-1995-aparece-en-aaa-el-hijo-del-perro-aguayo-las-gemas-del-ring-pierden-las-mascaras/ | title=En un día como hoy… 1995: Aparece en AAA el Hijo del Perro Aguayo… Las Gemas del Ring pierden las máscaras | first=Teddy | last=Centinela | date=April 30, 2015 | accessdate=July 1, 2015 | work=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TomoAngel&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Zafiro | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo VI | pages = 27 | date = January 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second high profile match was a six-man tag team match for the vacant [[WWA Trios Championship (Mexico)|WWA World Trios Championship]], a championship that Peña was allowed to promote on AAA shows. For the Arena Rio Nilo show the father/son combo of [[Fuerza Guerrera]] and [[Juventud Guerrera]] teamed up with [[Psicosis]] to take on the trio of [[El Hijo del Santo]], [[Octagón]] and [[Rey Misterio, Jr.]]. In the end the Guerreras and Psicosis won the match and became the sixth overall WWA World Trios champions.&lt;ref name=DiaApril30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter= Mexico: WWA Trios Title | page= 401 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main event match was for the "Copa Rio Nilo", a one night special feature match between long time rivals [[Perro Aguayo]], [[Konnan|Konan]] and [[Cien Caras]] who had been involved in a long running storyline that for Aguayo and Caras stretched back into the 1980s. During the match Cien Caras' brother, [[Máscara Año 2000]] came to ringside and attacked Perro Aguayo, seeking revenge for being unmasked by Aguayo at [[Triplemanía I]]. At one point Máscara Año 2000 broke a glass beer bottle over Aguayo's head, causing him to bleed so badly that he had to be taken from the arena on a stretcher.&lt;ref name=DiaApril30/&gt; In the end Cien Caras pinned Konnan setting up the team rivalry with Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000 against Konnan and Perro Aguayo, a feud that would be featured on all three Triplemanía III shows.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

In the early 1990s then-[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL)  Promoter Antonio Peña created the ''[[Mini-Estrellas]]'' concept, building on the classic [[midget wrestling]] concept but adding a ''Lucha libre'' flair to it. When Peña left CMLL to form AAA he made sure the ''Mini-Estrellas'' were given a strong presence on the shows and for Triplemanía III-A they were actually given the main event slot. Building off several individual storylines between the ''Mini-Estrellas'' AAA promoted a 13-man [[steel cage match]] where the last person in the cage would be forced to unmask under ''Lucha de Apuestas'' rules. One of the focal points was the emergence of ''Los Payasitos'' ("The Little Clowns"), two ''Mini-Estrella'' versions of ''[[Los Payasos]]'', known as Payasito Azul and Payasito Rojo as they fought against the ''técnicos'' [[Mascarita Sagrada]] and [[Mexican National Mini-Estrella Championship|Mexican National Mini-Estrella Champion]] [[Super Muñequito]] on several shows. Another storyline leading up to the cage match was the feud between  and [[Espectrito I]], who had back up in the form of his younger brothers [[Espectrito II]] and [[La Parkita]]. [[Octagoncito]]. Octagoncito had actually defeated Espectrito I in a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match on May 31, 1995 forcing the ''Mini-Estrella'' to be shaved bald after the match only 10 days before the show.&lt;ref name="EncyEspectrito"&gt;{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Espectrito | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo II | page = 12 | date = August 2007| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included in the cage match included former Mexican National Mini-Estrellas Champion [[Fili Estrella|Furcito Guerrera]], [[Mini Psicosis|Jerrito Estrada]], Mini Calo, Torerito and Ninjita.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;

One of the main storylines that would highlight not only Triplemanía III-A but also [[Triplemanía III-B]] and [[Triplemanía III-C]] was the feud between the two masked, young técnicos, [[Super Caló]] and [[Abismo Negro|Winners]], fighting against the''rudo'' team known as ''[[Los Diabolicos]]'', in this case the two masked members Marabunta and Ángel Mortal. The basic storyline centered around two the "veteran" wrestlers in ''Los Diabolicos'' getting annoyed with the fan reaction Super Caló and Winners were getting without, in their opinion, earning it by proving themselves in the ring.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt; In the weeks prior to Triplemanía ''Los Diabolicos'' had faced off against Super Caló and Winners, often in [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|six-man tag team match]] with the third ''Diabolic'' Mr. Condor against Caló, Winners and various young ''tecnicos''. During those matches ''Los Diabolicos'' would often either steal the mask of their opponents, or rip the masks apart during their matches.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt; This led to all four wrestlers signing a contract for a series of ''Lucha de Apuesta'', or bet matches, where each competitor would wager their mask on the outcome of the match. In ''Lucha Libre'' a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match is viewed as more prestigious than a championship match and is often promoted as the main event of major shows.&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29–40 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three match series would mean that three out of the four wrestlers would be unmasked by the time the third and final Triplemanía III match was over.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;

In 1994 AAA luchador, and star of several ''[[Luchador films]]'' [[Octagón]] was one of AAA's main draws, which let Peña to the idea to give him an ''[[Evil twin]]'', creating an "Evil mirror image" of Octagón for him to fight against. Peña turned [[Espanto Jr.|Jesus Andrade]], previously known as Espanto Jr. into the masked "Pentagón" character, a rival and distorted mirror image of Octagón.&lt;ref name=AAAPentagon&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/noticiasaaa/item/377-pentag%C3%B3n-informaci%C3%B3n-clasificada-aaa.html | title=Pentagón: Informacion classificaca AAA | accessdate=March 26, 2013 | work=LuchaLibreAAA | publisher= Asistencia Asesoría y Administración | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentagón made his in ring debut a month prior to Triplemanía III-A but the in-ring interaction between Pentagón and Octagón had deliberately been limited by AAA, mainly with Pentagón doing sneak attacks during matches leading up to the show.&lt;ref name=YIR1994/&gt; Triplemanía III-A marked the first time the two rivals truly faced off in the ring.

On November 6, 1994 then-[[Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship|Mexican National Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[La Parka]] teamed up with [[Jerry Estrada]] and [[Blue Panther]], losing to a team of international wrestling stars [[Chris Benoit|The Pegasus Kid]], [[2 Cold Scorpio]], and [[Tito Santana]] as part of the [[AAA When Worlds Collide]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexican supercards|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/la.html#1194|publisher=Prowrestlinghistory.com|id=2007 Edition|page= 160|accessdate=June 23, 2015|date=November 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks following the team loss Jerry Estrada turned on La Parka, turning the increasingly popular La Parka to the ''técnicos'' side as Estrada demanded a match for the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=YIR1993&gt;{{cite news|title=1993 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2214|date=January 7, 1994|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 1995 Estrada won the championship from La Parka in a high profile match in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]] as part of the long running storyline between the two.&lt;ref name=MexLighHeavy&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4|chapter=Mexico: National Light Heavyweight Title|pages=391–392}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Triplemanía III-A the two found themselves on opposite sides of each other in an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|eight-man "Atómicos" tag team match]] that paired up four high profile feuds of the time between Konnan and Cien Caras, Perro Aguayo and Máscara Año 2000, La Parka and Jerry Estrada and finally Octagón and Pentagón to complete the two sides.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;

==Event==
[[Image:Octagón.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[Octagón]], one of eight competitors in the seventh match of the night.]]
This first two matches of the show were not broadcast on Television as part of AAA's weekly wrestling show on [[Televisa]] but were [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark matches]] that only the fans in attendance at the Plaza de Toros de la Concordia [[bull fighting]] arena saw. The opening match featured AAA's women's division with [[Martha Villalobos]], [[La Comandante|La Nazi]] and Neftali taking on a trio of women who had primarily worked for the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA), [[La Sirenita]], [[Irma Gonzales]] and Irma Aguilar. The UWA trio was working the show due to a work agreement with the UWA, a promotion that was one of the major Mexican promotions in the 1970s and 1980s but by 1994 was close to going out of business and actually would close in 1995.&lt;ref name=YIR1995&gt;{{cite news|title=1995 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2228|date=January 9, 1996|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1994&gt;{{cite news|title=1994 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2176|date=January 8, 1995|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villalobos, La Nazi and Neftali defeated the UWA trio, although no records indicated who was pinned.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip3/&gt; The second Dark Match of the show featured a trio known as ''[[Los Misioneros de la Muerte]]'' ("The Missionaries of Death"), also originally from the UWA but by this time AAA regulars taking on the team of  [[El Torero]], [[Halcón 78|El Mexicano]] and [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Dragón de Oro]]. ''Los Misioneros'' originally consisted of [[El Signo]], [[Negro Navarro]] and [[El Texano]] and later on brought in Black Power II to replace El Texano while working in the UWA. When the group joined AAA Black Power was replaced by a mask wrestler known as Misionero, which may have been Black Power under a mask or possibly former ''Misionero'' [[Rocky Santana]], but the identity was never confirmed. ''Los Misioneros'' defeated Torero, Mexicano and Dragón de Oro.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip3/&gt;

The third match of the night was also the first match to be shown on AAA later on, first airing on July 1, 1994 on Televisa along with the fourth match and the main event steel cage match. The fourth match of the night, another traditional ''lucha libre'' [ix-man tag team match contested under best two-out-of-three falls rules featured another trio that made its name as part of the UWA but was transitioning to AAA by 1994, ''Los Villanos'', in this case [[Villano I]], [[Villano III]] and [[Villano IV]] facing one of AAA's top ''rudo'' trios ''Los Payasos'' ("The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) who had held the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] on two occasions prior to Triplemanía III-A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter = Mexico: National Trios Title | page = 393 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lucha 2000 Staff | title = Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales | work =Lucha 2000 | id = Especial 21 | date = December 20, 2004 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Los Villanos'' won the first fall when they simultaneously pinned all three ''Payasos'' and then won the second fall by disqualification when ''Los Payasos'' pulled off ''Los Villanos'' masks to cause the disqualification, giving ''Los Villanos'' the match two falls to none.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip3/&gt;

The fifth match of the night was one of the featured matches of the night as Super Caló teamed up with rival Ángel Mortal to fight against Winners and Marabunta in what is called a ''[[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Parejas Suicidas|Relevos Increibles Suicidas]]'' ("Incredible pairs suicide" match). The concept of that type of match is that two storyline enemies are  forced to team together against another team of rivals, in this case their opponents were also their regular tag team partners. The losing team would then be forced to wrestle against each other in a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match as a "punishment" for losing the tag team match.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt; For most of the match Ángel Mortal and Marabunta did not wrestle against each other while Winners and Super Caló only faced off once during the match.  Marabunta forced Super Caló to submit, then moments later his ''Los Diabolicos'' Ángel Mortal pinned Marabunta to even the sides. Moments later Winners applied a submission hold, forcing Ángel Mortal to tap out. THis allowed Winners and Marabunta to escape with their masks for the night.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip3/&gt;&lt;ref name=PWI500-2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=TomoCalo/&gt; Traditionally ''Lucha de Apuestas'' matches are held under "best two-out-of-three falls" rules, but due to the ''Relevos Increibles Suicidas'' stipulation Super Caló and Ángel Mortal fought in a single fall match with their masks on the line, a match Super Caló won by pinfall. Following the match Ángel Mortal tried to escape the arena but was forced back in the ring where he was unmasked and revealed that his real name was Juan Manuel de la Rosa.&lt;ref name=TomoAngel/&gt;

In the semi-main event four different storylines intersected in an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|eight-man "Atómicos" tag team match]] featuring the top feuds of AAA at the time. Perro Aguayo was accompanied to the ring by his son [[Perro Aguayo Jr.]] who was slated to make his in ring debut at the following Triplemanía III show. For most of the match the rival pairs worked against each other with Perro Aguayo and Máscara Año 2000, Konnan and Cien Caras, La Parka and Jerry Estrada and finally Octagón and Pentagón pairing off. In the end the ''técnicos;; side of Aguayo, Konnan, La Parka and Octagón won the match.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip3/&gt;

The main even steel cage match included referees on the outside of the cage to determine when a wrestler had successfully left the cage and a special ''Mini-Estrella'' referee, El Tirantio (a shorter version of referee ''El Tirantes'') inside the cage. During the introductions it was announced that since Espectrito I has just lost a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match to Octagoncito 10 days earlier he was not allowed to compete in the match since he had no hair to "bet" on the match. Initially Espectrito I and his brothers, Espectrito II and La Parkita, tried to keep him in the ring but eventually the other 10 ''Mini-Estrellas'' ganged up on him and threw him out of the door of the cage. When the bell run the only way to get out of the match with their mask would be to climb over the top of the 15 foot tall steel cage and climb all the way to the floor. Payacito Azul was the first man to escape the cage only a few minutes into the match, leaving his tag team partner Payacito Rojo behind.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt; The final four competitors were Espectrito II, Octagoncito, Super Muñequito and Payacito Rojo, When Octagoncito tried to escape Espectrito I, who had remained at ringside during the match, climbed up the cage and blocked Octagoncito's exit. Later on he did the same to Super Muñequito preventing him from leaving so that Espectrito II would not end up losing the match. After fighting on top of the cage, then while clinging to the outside of the cage Espectrito II jumped to the floor safely, followed moments later by Octagoncito. After wrestling against each other for a minute or two Super Muñequito took advantage of a mistake by Payasito Rojo and climbed out of the cage as the last man.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip3/&gt; With his victory he was given credit for Payacito Rojo's mask loss.&lt;ref name=MunequitoEncicliopedia/&gt; Following the match Payacito Rojo removed his mask and announced that his real name was Raymundo Rodriguez, better known to the wrestling fans as "Piratita Morgan" ("Little Morgan the Pirate").&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAATrip3/&gt;

==Aftermath==
This show marked the last time that Raymundo Rodriguez worked under the ring name "Payasito Rojo: as he resumed working as "Piratita Morgan" afterwards and later on also worked as the masked character Battalion in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref name=WWF9099Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 2: WWF 1990 - 1999  | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2013 | asin=B00RWUNSRS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the end of ''Los Payasitos'' in AAA as his tag team partner Payasito Azul changed his ring name to "Fuercita Guerrera", taking over the ring character for the original Fuercita Guerrera who retired not long after Triplemanía III. At [[Triplemanía III-B]] the ''Mini-Estrella'' division was featured in the first ever ''Mini-Estrellas'' [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Eight-man "Atómicos" tag team match]] as Torerito, Super Muñequito, Octagoncito and Mascarita Sagrada defeated Fuercita Guerrera, La Parkita, Espectrito I and Espectrito I when Super Muñequito pinned Espectrito I.&lt;ref name="Trip3B"/&gt; Super Muñequito would later lose the [[Mexican National Mini-Estrella Championship]] to Espectrito I as part of their long running rivalry.&lt;ref name=MexMinis&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: Mexican National Midget (Miniestrella) Title|page=401|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MinisMag&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales|work=Lucha 2000|id=Especial 21|date=December 20, 2004|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000 would go on to Triplemanía III-B where they defended their [[UWA World Heavyweight Championship]] and IWC World Heavyweight Championship respectively against Perro Aguayo and Konnan in a tag team match with both championships on the line. In the end Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000 retained their championships when Perro Aguayo was disqualified in the third and final fall of the match.&lt;ref name="Trip3B"/&gt; Konnan would later on move to [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and work in the United States for years, putting an end to his rivalry with Cien Caras. Aguayo's rivalry with Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000 would carry on for years, even beyond Aguayo's initial retirement from wrestling as Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000 brought him back for one more ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match as part of CMLL's 2006 [[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2006)|Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]] show.&lt;ref name=Lucha2006&gt;{{cite news|title=Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana duranted el 2006|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 192|date=December 23, 2006|url=http://superluchas.net/?p=44|accessdate=July 11, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Triplemanía III-B Perro accompanied his son to the ring as he made his debut against [[Juventud Guerrera]], son of Fuerza Guerrera who was at ringside with his son as well. During the match Fuerza Guerra interfered in the match, helping his son gain a victory over Perro Jr.&lt;ref name="Trip3B"/&gt; That match started a father/son storyline between the Aguayos and the Guerrera family and would include the two teams fight over the [[Mexican National Tag Team Championship]] held by the Guerrera family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will |chapter = Mexico: National Tag Team Titles |pages = 396–397 |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud ended when Fuerza Guerrera left AAA in late 1995.

La Parka and Estrada found themselves on opposite side of multi-man tag team matches at the subsequent Triplemanía III shows with La Parka's side winning one and Estrada's team winning the second match.&lt;ref name="Trip3B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip3C"/&gt; On August 6, 1995 La Parka regained the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship from Jerry Estrada as their feud continued into 1996.&lt;ref name=MexLighHeavy/&gt; The storyline between Octagón and Pentagón would continue to evolve, stretching out for several years, including the original Pentagón being replaced in 1996 when he had to retire due to health problems.&lt;ref name=PentagonInterview&gt;{{cite web | url=http://estrellasdelring.blogspot.com/2010/04/entrevista-jesus-andrade-salas-espanto.html | title=Entrevista a Jesús Andrade Salas, Espanto Jr y Pentagón. | date=April 2010 | accessdate=March 26, 2012 | first=Eduardo | last=Reyes Ruiz | work=Estrellas del Ring | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of the original Pentagón was never officially acknowledged by AAA since Pentagón wore a mask that covered almost his entire face and ring gear that covered everything but his fingertips.&lt;ref name=MondoParka&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = La Parka | pages = 120–124 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline between Octagón and his "evil twin" stretched into 2002 where Octagón finally unmasked Pentagón, although at this time it was a third man under the mask.&lt;ref name="EncyPentagon123"&gt;{{cite news|author=Enciclopedia staff|title=Enciclopedia de las Mascaras|work=Pentagon|location=[[Mexico]]|id=Tomo IV|page=11|date=October 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAA originally intended to carry the storyline forward into the next "generation" as they introduced [[Kalisto (wrestler)|Octagón Jr.]] in 2012 as well as a character supposed to be his rival in [[Pentagón Jr.]]. In the summer of 2013 the wrestler playing Octagón Jr. left AAA for [[WWE]], cutting any planned storylines short.

The storyline between the team of Winners/Super Caló and ''Los Diabolicos'' led to Winners and Marabunta facing off in a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match at the subsequent [[Triplemanía III-B]] on June 18, 1995.&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip3B"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iii-b | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners defeated Marabunta, forcing him to unmask and reveal his real name.&lt;ref Name="SLObit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/?p=19963|title=Recordando a Abismo Negro: Su vida y legado en los cuadriláteros |accessdate=2009-03-24|date=2009-03-23|publisher=SuperLuchas.net|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327025114/http://superluchas.net/?p=19963| archivedate= 27 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the storyline a third and final ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match took place on June 30, 1995 and was the main event of [[Triplemanía III-B]]&lt;ref name=YIR1995/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip3C"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iii-c | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the stipulation of the previous matches Winners and Super Caló were forced to face off against each other with their masks on the line.

'''USS ''Drum'' (SSN-677)''', a {{sclass-|Sturgeon|submarine|0}} [[attack submarine]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the drum, also known as the croaker or hardhead, any of various fishes of the ''[[Sciaenidae]]'' [[Family (biology)|family]], capable of making a drumming noise and best known on the [[Atlantic]] coast of North America.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build ''Drum'' was awarded to [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] at [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], California, on 15 March 1967, and her [[keel]] was laid down there on 20 August 1968. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 May 1970, sponsored by Mrs. William F. Bringle, wife of [[Vice Admiral]] [[William F. Bringle]], commander of the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 April 1972. ''Drum'' was the last US naval vessel newly built in a naval shipyard.

==Service history==
===1970s===
After commissioning, ''Drum'' conducted initial testing in [[Puget Sound]] before arriving at her [[home port]] of [[San Diego]], California, on 22 May 1972. ''Drum'' then commenced six months of operational tests and fleet training exercises in Puget Sound, the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and off San Diego to become a unit of the [[COMSUBPAC|United States Pacific Fleet Submarine Force]]. After completing these tests and exercises, ''Drum'' returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in November 1972 for a one month of post-[[shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] testing.

After completing the post-shakedown testing and follow-on operations in [[Southern California]], ''Drum'' deployed in March 1973 on her first [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] deployment; it also was the longest deployment of her career, lasting eight months before she returned to San Diego in November 1973.

''Drum'' began her second deployment to the Western Pacific at the end of 1974, visiting Japan, Hong Kong, and the [[Philippines]] before returning to San Diego in May 1975.  ''Drum'' was awarded her first [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for her successes during this deployment.

In June 1976, ''Drum'' departed San Diego for her third Western Pacific deployment, visiting Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and [[Guam]], and returned to San Diego in November 1976. She was awarded her first [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for her successes during this deployment.

1977 began with ''Drum'' changing her home port to [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], Washington, and entering [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] for [[Mark 48 torpedo]] impact testing and a non-refueling [[wikt:overhaul|overhaul]]. She completed the overhaul in April 1978, ahead of schedule and under budget. She spent the next several months conducting operations in Puget Sound, including visits to [[Seattle]] and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]] in Washington and [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]], British Columbia, Canada, until returning to San Diego, which once again became her home port, in July 1978.

From her return to San Diego until April 1979, ''Drum'' completed the rigorous training, testing, and loadout necessary prior to a deployment. She then deployed to the Western Pacific again from May to October 1979. During this deployment, she completed a special operation for which she was awarded her second Meritorious Unit Commendation and made port visits to Guam, [[Thailand]], and the Philippines. After returning to San Diego in October 1979, she engaged in local operations and completed two months of repairs and alterations at Mare Island Naval Shipyard.

===1980s===
In May 1980, after ''Drum'' returned to San Diego, and for the next several months, ''Drum'' operated in the San Diego area. She began her next Western Pacific deployment in October 1980, which included visits to Guam and the Philippines. This deployment lasted until mid-April 1981, when she returned to San Diego.
In the course of that year the {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-324}} collided with an unidentified American submarine, believed to be of the {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|4}}, in the Peter the Great Bay, not far from [[Vladivostok]]. At least one source identifies this submarine as USS ''Drum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebook.co5.biz/history/red-november-inside-the-secret-u-s-soviet-submarine-war ''Red November: Inside the Secret U.S.-Soviet Submarine War'' (review)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1981, ''Drum'' again departed San Diego for the Western Pacific, visiting [[South Korea]], spending Christmas in Japan, and returning home at the beginning of 1982. She then conducted operations off Southern California and visited San Francisco, California, before starting another period of repairs and alterations in San Diego in the summer of 1982.

Upon completion of repairs, ''Drum'' concluded 1982 preparing for her next deployment. Shortly after Christmas 1982, ''Drum'' deployed to the Western Pacific. During this deployment, ''Drum'' visited the Philippines, Australia, and Japan, and also conducted operations in the Indian Ocean, during which she visited [[Diego Garcia]]. She returned to San Diego in June 1983.

After a routine standdown period at the end of this deployment, ''Drum'' participated in Advanced Capability (ADCAP) [[Mark 48 torpedo]] testing exercises at the tracking range at [[CFMETR, Nanoose Bay|Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges, Nanoose Bay]], British Columbia.

In May 1984, ''Drum'' left San Diego for a Western Pacific deployment, stopping in Hawaii for [[RIMPAC]] '84, a multi-national naval exercise, then continued west with visits to the Philippines, Japan, Guam, and Thailand.  ''Drum'' returned to San Diego in November 1984.

1985 began with local operations off Southern California and operations in Puget Sound, including a port visit to Esquimalt, British Columbia. In October 1985, ''Drum'' changed her home port to Bremerton, Washington, for the second time to begin her second and last overhaul – a [[refueling overhaul]] – at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

The refueling overhaul was completed in November 1987, and ''Drum'' returned to San Diego. which again became her home port, and became a unit of her new [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]], [[Submarine Squadron 11]].

''Drum'' participated in RIMPAC '90, which included a port call at Lahaina, Maui, in the spring of 1990. After a summer of preparations, ''Drum'' departed San Diego in September 1990 for another deployment to the Western Pacific, during which she made port calls at Guam, Japan, and Singapore.  ''Drum'' was awarded her fourth Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations conducted during this deployment, and while deployed, was awarded the [[Battle Efficiency Award]] (Battle "E") for Submarine Squadron 3 for her outstanding performance during [[fiscal year]] 1990.  ''Drum'' returned to San Diego in March 1991.

No one was injured on either ship nor did ''Drum'' suffer notable damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/411187/N-SUB-UNDAMAGED-IN-FREIGHTER-COLLISION.html |title=N-SUB UNDAMAGED IN FREIGHTER COLLISION |date=25 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drum'' returned to San Diego on 13 April 1995. Her Commanding Officer was relieved of duty pending investigation of the collision, later resolved as "not for cause." 

At 1300 hours on 20 May 1995, an inactivation ceremony was held for ''Drum'' at San Diego. In late May 1995, she departed San Diego for the last time, destined for Pearl Harbor, where she would undergo deactivation at [[Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard]].

==Decommissioning and disposal==
''Drum'' was decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 30 October 1995. Afterwards, she was stored at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, awaiting entry into the Nuclear-Powered [[Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] for scrapping.

On 20 May 2010 the ex-''Drum'' entered drydock for the last time. The ship was recycled in drydock three at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and IMF. In early 2011 her reactor compartment was shipped to Hanford, Washington, for burial. The sail of the USS ''Drum'' was removed for display. It is currently on display at U.S. Navy Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois.

==Preservation efforts==
The non-profit [[Mare Island Park Historic Foundation]] was raising money to return ''Drum'' to Vallejo as a floating [[museum ship]]. In Fiscal Year 1997, the [[United States Congress]] authorized the transfer of ''Drum'' to Vallejo at "no cost to the [[U.S. Government]]". If enough money had been raised to cover the cost of that transfer, ''Drum'' would have been transferred to Vallejo after removal of her [[nuclear reactor]] and decontamination of her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. These efforts were unsuccessful.
