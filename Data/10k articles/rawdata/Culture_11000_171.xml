An '''affinity space''' is a place where [[learning]] takes place.  According to [[James Paul Gee]], affinity spaces are locations where groups of people are drawn together because of a shared, strong interest or engagement in a common activity.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, 2004; Gee, 2005; Gee &amp; Hayes, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref name=Gee /&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}} Often but not always&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neely|first=A.D.|last2=Marone|first2=V.|year=2016|title=Learning in parking lots: Affinity spaces as a framework for understanding knowledge construction in informal settings|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2016.05.002|journal=Learning, Culture and Social Interaction|volume=11 |issue=4|pages=58–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurring online, affinity spaces encourage the sharing of knowledge or participation in a specific area, and informal learning is a common outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=Vittorio|year=2015|title=From discussion forum to discursive studio: Learning and creativity in design-oriented affinity spaces|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1555412014557328|journal=Games and Culture|volume=10 |issue=1|pages=81–105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his coining of the term, Gee takes the notion of participatory cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/confronting-challenges-participatory-culture|title=Confronting the challenges of participatory culture: Media education for the 21st century|last=Jenkins|first=H.|publisher=MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reframes it to the idea of "space". To Gee, what is happening in these online cultures is not merely a "culture" – and far different from a "community". In Gee's view, the word "community" conjures up images of belongingness  and membership (p.&amp;nbsp;70).&lt;ref name="Gee"&gt;''Situated Language and Learning: A Critique of Traditional Schooling''. New York: Routledge, 2004. {{ISBN|0-415-31777-0}}, {{ISBN|0-415-31776-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}} Instead, he has defined these worlds as "spaces" – a term that allows for the "robust characterization of the ebbs and flows and differing levels of involvement and participation exhibited by members" &lt;ref name="Gee"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

According to Gee (2004), "An affinity space is a place or set of places where people affiliate with others based primarily on shared activities, interests, and goals, not shared race, class culture, ethnicity, or gender" (p.&amp;nbsp;67).&lt;ref name=Gee /&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

Gee (2004) refers to affinity spaces and states, "Learners 'apprentice' themselves to a group of people who share a certain set of practices (e.g. learning to cook in a family, learning to play video games with a guild, learning to assemble circuit boards in a workplace, learning to splice genes in a biology lab), pick up these practices through joint action with more advanced peers, and advance their abilities to engage and work with others in carrying out such practices" (p.&amp;nbsp;70).&lt;ref name=Gee /&gt;

What Gee (2004) tries to explain about Affinity Spaces is not an attempt to label a group of people. By affinity space he means a space where people can interact and share a lot with each other. the people who are interacting in a space might find themselves as sharing a community with some others in that space, while other people might view their interactions in the space differently. Gee (2004) adds, " In any case, creating spaces within diverse sorts of people can interact is a leitmotif of the modern world" (p.&amp;nbsp;71).&lt;ref name=Gee /&gt;

== Hallmarks of Affinity Spaces ==
Gee described twelve hallmarks of what he terms "nurturing" affinity spaces:
# The affinity in these spaces is to the endeavor, not other people. People from all ages, ethnicities, educational levels, and cultures play/create together – often anonymously or using alter-identities.
# Not segregated by age; there is no assumption that older or more senior participants are the only ones with something to teach.
# Not segregated by experience; newbies, masters, and everyone else share a common space.
# Everyone can, if they so wish, produce and not just consume. The idea that creation can come not only from a space's designers, but also from its users, is a hallmark of these spaces. Users – not just site designers – can help create, shape, and reshape the site and its content. Suggestions are welcome and encouraged, and site designers often use the suggestions of users to reform site designs and configurations.
# Content within the space is not fixed, but is transformed by interaction.
# Both intensive and extensive knowledge are encouraged. Extensive knowledge is seen as broad, less specialized knowledge about many aspects of the space. Intensive knowledge is in-depth knowledge about certain aspects of the space.
# Individual and distributed knowledge are valued.
# Dispersed knowledge is encouraged.
# Tacit knowledge is encouraged and honored. Members do not have to lead or design; those who wish to “just play” are valued as much as those who wish to contribute more substantially to the site.
# Many forms and routes to participation are available.
# Different routes to status are inherent in the game.
# Leadership is porous and leaders are resources.

==Educational uses==
Because members of an affinity space are interested in a common practice/belief/activity, they have common ground and motivation together. Gee says that because of this common interest, affinity spaces are able to bridge barriers of age, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[socio-economic]] status, and educational level, and thus allow each user to participate as he/she chooses, and both experts and novices are equally legitimate participants in the affinity space&lt;ref&gt;Gee, 2005{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not everyone in affinity spaces is an expert, they are not places where the "blind are leading the blind."  Many spaces have unwritten rules that while sharing information, you must share only what you know, provide sources to back up what you say, and in general, leave [[feedback]] and comments only in areas you know.

==Examples==
Online [[fan fiction]] sites are examples of affinity spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=Rebecca W.|year=2006|title=Language, culture, and identity in online fanfiction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/elea.2006.3.2.170|journal=E-learning|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=170–184|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the goal of the sites is usually to share and read other people's fan fiction creations, informal learning takes place as people have their work read and commented on by "'beta readers.'"  It is up to the author then to decide what to do with this informal [[feedback]]; often, it is used to revise and edit the work, and at the same time, it may aid the author in pinpointing his or her own overall writing flaws.

Other examples come from "snark sites" or "rant communities." The goal of these sites is typically to make fun of particular problems, such as poorly written fan fiction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/fanficrants/ FanFicRants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112094218/http://community.livejournal.com/fanficrants/ |date=2009-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or digital [[image editing]] mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photoshopdisasters.com/ Photoshop Disasters]&lt;/ref&gt; As community members criticize other people's work, they reach new levels of sophistication in their evaluations, creating extended vocabularies of terms and categorizing mistakes. In [[Benjamin Bloom]]'s taxonomy, evaluation is at the top of [[higher order thinking skills]]. Since either authors or their friends and fans are likely to come to the defense of works being criticized, [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] are two areas where much active learning takes place.

{{for|modern pronunciations of Ancient Greek often used for practical purposes|Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching}}
{{IPA notice}}
'''Ancient Greek phonology''' is the description of the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[phonology]] or [[pronunciation]] of [[Ancient Greek]]. This article mostly deals with the pronunciation of the standard [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]] of the fifth century BC, used by [[Plato]] and other [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] writers, and touches on other dialects spoken at the same time or earlier. The pronunciation of Ancient Greek is not known from direct observation, but determined from [[#Reconstruction|other types of evidence]]. Some details regarding the pronunciation of Attic Greek and other Ancient Greek dialects are unknown, but it is generally agreed that Attic Greek had certain features not present in English or Modern Greek, such as a [[voice-onset time|three-way distinction]] between [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]], [[voicelessness|voiceless]], and [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|stops]] (such as {{IPA|/b p pʰ/}}, as in English "bot, spot, pot"); a distinction between [[gemination|single and double consonants]] and [[vowel length|short and long vowels]] in most positions in a word; and a [[accent (phonetics)|word accent]] that involved [[pitch accent|pitch]].

[[Koine Greek]], the variety of Greek used after the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] in the fourth century BC, is sometimes included in Ancient Greek, but its pronunciation is described in [[Koine Greek phonology]]. For disagreements with the reconstruction given here, [[#More recent developments|see below]].

==Dialects==
{{Greek dialects}}
Ancient Greek was a [[pluricentric language]], consisting of [[Ancient Greek dialects|many dialects]]. All Greek dialects derive from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] and they share certain characteristics, but there were also distinct differences in pronunciation. For instance, the form of [[Doric Greek|Doric]] in [[Crete]] had a digraph {{angbr|{{lang|grc|θθ}}}}, which likely stood for a sound not present in Attic.&lt;ref name="Allen intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=xii-xvi|loc=introduction: dialectal nature of Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early form of [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] in which the [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]] were composed, and the [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] dialect of [[Sappho]], likely had the phoneme {{IPA|/w/}} at the beginnings of words, sometimes represented by the letter [[digamma]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ϝ}}}}, but it had been lost in the standard Attic dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pluricentric nature of Ancient Greek differs from that of Latin, which was composed of basically one variety from the earliest [[Old Latin]] texts until [[Classical Latin]]. Latin only formed dialects once it was spread over Europe by the [[Roman Empire]]; these [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects became the [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref name="Allen intro" /&gt;

The main dialect groups of Ancient Greek are [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]], [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], [[Doric Greek|Doric]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Attic Greek|Attic]]. These form two main groups: East Greek, which includes Arcadocypriot, Aeolic, Ionic, and Attic, and West Greek, which consists of Doric along with Northwest Greek and Achaean.&lt;ref name="Sihler dialects"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=7–12|loc=§12-15: history of Greek, dialects and their use}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smyth dialects"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§C-E: Greek dialects, their characteristics, the regions they occurred in, and their use in literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the main dialects, all but Arcadocypriot have literature in them. The Ancient Greek [[literary language|literary dialects]] do not necessarily represent the native speech of the authors that use them. A primarily Ionic-Aeolic dialect, for instance, is used in epic poetry, while pure Aeolic is used in lyric poetry. Both Attic and Ionic are used in prose, and Attic is used in most parts of the [[Greek tragedy|Athenian tragedies]], with Doric forms in the [[stasimon|choral sections]].

===Early East Greek===
Most of the East Greek dialects [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] or [[assibilation|assibilated]] {{IPA|/t/}} to {{IPA|[s]}} before {{IPA|/i/}}. West Greek, including Doric, did not undergo this sound change in certain cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=149, 150|loc=§148: assibilation in Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the influence of Doric neither did the Thessalian and Boeotian dialects of Aeolic.
* Attic {{lang|grc|τίθησι}}, Doric {{lang|grc|τίθητι}} ('he places')
: Attic {{lang|grc|εἰσί}}, Doric {{lang|grc|ἐντί}} ('they are')
: Attic {{lang|grc|εἴκοσι}}, Doric {{lang|grc|ϝῑκατι}} ('twenty')

Arcadocypriot was one of the first Greek dialects in Greece. [[Mycenaean Greek]], the form of Greek spoken before the [[Greek Dark Ages]], seems to be an early form of Arcadocypriot. Clay tablets with Mycenaean Greek in [[Linear B]] have been found over a wide area, from [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in [[Central Greece]], to [[Mycenae]] and [[Pylos]] on the [[Peloponnese]], to [[Knossos]] on [[Crete]]. However, during the Ancient Greek period, Arcadocypriot was only spoken in [[Arcadia]], in the interior of the Peloponnese, and on [[Cyprus]]. The dialects of these two areas remained remarkably similar despite the great geographical distance.

Aeolic is closely related to Arcadocypriot. It was originally spoken in eastern Greece north of the [[Peloponnese]]: in [[Thessaly]], in [[Locris]], [[Phocis]], and southern Aetolia, and in [[Boeotia]], a region close to [[Athens]]. Aeolic was carried to [[Aeolis]], on the coast of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and the nearby island of [[Lesbos]]. By the time of Ancient Greek, the only Aeolic dialects that remained in Greece were Thessalian and Boeotian. The Aeolic dialects of Greece adopted some characteristics of Doric, since they were located near Doric-speaking areas, while the Aeolian and Lesbian dialects remained pure.

Boeotian underwent vowel shifts similar to those that occurred later in Koine Greek, converting {{IPA|/ai̯/}} to {{IPA|[ɛː]}}, {{IPA|/eː/}} to {{IPA|[iː]}},&lt;ref name="Allen e" /&gt; and {{IPA|/oi̯/}} to {{IPA|[yː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=66, 67|loc=long y from oi in Boeotian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=80, 81|loc=the diphthong oi}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are reflected in spelling (see [[Boeotian Greek phonology]]). Aeolic also retained {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=50, 51|loc=Aeolic digamma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] or Epic Greek, the literary form of Archaic Greek used in the [[epic poetry|epic poems]], [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]], is based on early Ionic and Aeolic, with Arcadocypriot forms. In its original form, it likely had the semivowel {{IPA|/w/}} and a voiceless version {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, as indicated by the meter in some cases. This sound is sometimes written as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Ϝ}}}}}} in inscriptions, but not in the Attic-influenced text of Homer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stanford|1959|loc=I: The Homeric dialect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stanford|1959|§2: digamma in Homer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Greek===
The Doric dialect, the most important member of West Greek, originated from western Greece. Through the [[Dorian invasion]], Doric displaced the native Arcadocypriot and Aeolic dialects in some areas of central Greece, on the Peloponnese, and on Crete, and strongly influenced the Thessalian and Boeotian dialects of Aeolic.

Doric dialects are classified by which vowel they have as the result of [[#Compensatory lengthening|compensatory lengthening]] and [[#Contraction|contraction]]: those that have  {{lang|grc|η ω}} are called Severer or Old, and those that have {{lang|grc|ει ου}}, as Attic does, are called Milder or New.&lt;ref name="Smyth dialects" /&gt; Laconian and Cretan, spoken in [[Laconia]], the region of [[Sparta]], and on [[Crete]], are two Old Doric dialects.

===Attic and Ionic===
Attic and Ionic share a [[vowel shift]] not present in any other East or West Greek dialects. They both raised Proto-Greek long {{IPA|/aː/}} to {{IPA|[ɛː]}} ([[#Attic–Ionic vowel shift|see below]]). Later on, Attic lowered {{IPA|[ɛː]}} found immediately after {{IPA|/e i r/}} back to {{IPA|[aː]}}, differentiating itself from Ionic.&lt;ref name="Allen e"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=73, 74|loc=long e from long a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihler Attic-Ionic"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=50–52|loc=§54-56: Attic-Ionic {{lang|grc|η}} from {{PIE|*ā}}; Attic reversion; origin of {{PIE|*ā}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other East and West Greek dialects retain original {{IPA|/aː/}}.

Ionic was spoken around the [[Aegean Sea]], including in [[Ionia]], a region of [[Anatolia]] south of Aeolis, for which it was named. Ionic contracts vowels less often than Attic ([[#Contraction|see below]]).&lt;!-- Maybe less than Doric as well. --&gt;

Attic is the standard dialect taught in modern introductory courses in Ancient Greek, and the one that has the most literature written in it. It was spoken in [[Athens]] and [[Attica]], the surrounding region. Old Attic, which was used by the historian [[Thucydides]] and the [[Greek tragedy|tragedians]], replaced the native Attic {{IPA|/tt rr/}} with the {{IPA|/ss rs/}} of other dialects. Later writers, such as Plato, use the native Attic forms.

===Later Greek===
{{main article|Koine Greek phonology|Medieval Greek#Phonetics and phonology}}
Koine, the form of Greek spoken during the [[Hellenistic period]], was primarily based on Attic Greek, with some influences from other dialects. It underwent many sound changes, including development of aspirated and voiced stops into fricatives and the shifting of many vowels and diphthongs to {{IPA|[i]}} (iotacism). In the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] it developed into [[Medieval Greek]], which later became standard [[Modern Greek]] or [[Demotic Greek|Demotic]].

[[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]], a modern form of Greek mutually unintelligible with Standard Modern Greek, derived from the Laconian variety of Doric, and is therefore the only surviving descendant of a non-Attic dialect.

==Consonants==
Attic Greek had about 15 consonant phonemes: nine [[stop consonant]]s, two fricatives, and four or six sonorants. Modern Greek has about the same number of consonants. The main difference between the two is that Modern Greek has voiced and voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] that developed from Ancient Greek voiced and aspirated stops.

In the table below, the phonemes of standard Attic are unmarked, allophones are enclosed in parentheses. The sounds marked by asterisks appear in dialects or in earlier forms of Greek, but may not be phonemes in standard Attic.

Ancient Greek had nine stops. The grammarians classified them in three groups, distinguished by [[voice-onset time]]: voiceless aspirated,&lt;ref name="Allen aspirates"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=18–29|loc=aspirated plosives}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiceless unaspirated (tenuis),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=14–18|loc=voiceless plosives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and voiced.&lt;ref name="Allen voiced plosives"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=29–32|loc=voiced plosives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aspirated stops are written {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ/}}. The tenuis stops are written {{IPA|/p˭ t˭ k˭/}}, with {{angbr|{{IPA|˭}}}} representing lack of aspiration and voicing, or {{IPA|/p t k/}}. The voiced stops are written {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}}. For the Ancient Greek terms for these three groups, [[#Terminology|see below]]; see also the section on [[#Spirantization|spirantization]].

English distinguishes two types of stops: voiceless and voiced. Voiceless stops have three main pronunciations ([[allophone]]s): moderately aspirated at the beginning of a word before a vowel, unaspirated after {{IPA|/s/}}, and unaspirated, [[no audible release|unreleased]], [[t-glottalization|glottalized]], or [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] at the end of a word. English voiced stops are often only partially voiced.{{citation needed|reason=These facts are fairly well established, but it would be best to have a source to verify them.|date=January 2015}} Thus, some pronunciations of the English stops are similar to the pronunciations of Ancient Greek stops.
* voiceless aspirated ''t'' in ''tie'' {{IPA|[tʰaɪ]}}
* tenuis ''t'' in ''sty'' {{IPA|[st˭aɪ]}}
* tenuis, unreleased, glottalized, or debuccalized ''t'' in ''light'' {{IPA|[laɪt˭, laɪt̚, laɪˀt, laɪʔ]}}
* partially voiced ''d'' in ''die'' {{IPA|[daɪ]}} or {{IPA|[d̥aɪ]}}

===Fricatives===
Attic Greek had only two fricative phonemes: the [[voiceless alveolar fricative|voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|/s/}} and the [[voiceless glottal fricative|glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/h/}}.

{{IPA|/h/}} is often called the ''aspirate'' ([[#Terminology|see below]]). Attic generally kept it, but some non-Attic dialects during the Classical period lost it ([[#Psilosis|see below]]). It mostly occurred at the beginning of words, because it was usually lost between vowels, except in two rare words. Also, when a [[word stem|stem]] beginning with {{IPA|/h/}} was the second part of a [[compound (linguistics)|compound word]], the {{IPA|/h/}} sometimes remained, probably depending on whether the speaker recognized that the word was a compound. This can be seen in Old Attic inscriptions, where {{IPA|/h/}} was written using the letterform of eta ([[#Consonant spelling|see below]]), which was the source of H in the Latin alphabet:&lt;ref name="Allen h"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=52–55|loc=h}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Old Attic inscriptional forms
:: {{lang|grc|{{sc|ΕΥΗΟΡΚΟΝ}}}} {{IPA|/eú.hor.kon/}}, standard {{lang|grc|εὔορκον}} {{IPA|/eú.or.kon/}} ('faithful to an oath')
:: {{lang|grc|{{sc|ΠΑΡΗΕΔΡΟΙ}}}} {{IPA|/pár.he.droi/}}, standard {{lang|grc|πάρεδροι}} {{IPA|/pá.re.droi/}} ('sitting beside, [[assessor (law)|assessor]]')
:: {{lang|grc|{{sc|ΠΡΟΣΗΕΚΕΤΟ}}}} {{IPA|/pros.hɛː.ké.tɔː/}}, standard {{lang|grc|προσηκέτω}} {{IPA|/pro.sɛː.ké.tɔː/}} ('let him be present')
* {{lang|grc|εὐαἵ}} {{IPA|/eu.haí/}} ('yay!')
* {{lang|grc|ταὧς}} {{IPA|/ta.hɔ́ɔs/}} ('peacock')

{{IPA|/s/}} was a voiceless coronal sibilant. It was transcribed using the symbol for {{IPA|/s/}} in [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]], as in ''{{transl|sa|IAST|Dianisiyasa}}'' for {{lang|grc|Διονυσίου}} ('of [[Dionysius (disambiguation)|Dionysius]]') on an Indian coin.&lt;!-- Allen does not say which language this is; maybe Sanskrit. Also, maybe we could find out which Dionysius this referred to. --&gt; This indicates that the Greek sound was a [[sibilant|hissing sound]] rather than a hushing sound: like English ''s'' in ''see'' rather than ''sh'' in ''she''. It was pronounced as a voiced {{IPA|[z]}} before voiced consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=45, 46|loc=the fricative s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[W. Sidney Allen|W.S. Allen]], [[zeta]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ζ}}}} in Attic Greek likely represented the consonant cluster {{IPA|/sd/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[zd]}}. For metrical purposes it was treated as a double consonant, thus forming a heavy syllable. In Archaic Greek, when the letter was adopted from [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] [[zayin]], the sound was probably an [[affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPAblink|dz}}. In Koine Greek, {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ζ}}}} represented {{IPA|/z/}}. It is more likely that this developed from {{IPA|[dz]}} rather than from Attic {{IPA|/sd/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen z"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=56–59|loc=zeta}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ζεύς ('[[Zeus]]') — Archaic {{IPA|/d͡zeús/}}, Attic {{IPA|/sdeús/ [zdeǔs]}}, late Koine {{IPA|/zefs/}}

{{IPA|/p k/}} in the clusters {{IPA|/ps ks/}} were somewhat aspirated, as {{IPA|[pʰs]}} and {{IPA|[kʰs]}}, but in this case the aspiration of the first element was not [[distinctive feature|phonologically contrastive]]: no words distinguish {{IPA|/ps *pʰs *bs/}}, for example ([[#Assimilation|see below]] for explanation).&lt;ref name="Allen x ps"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=59, 60|loc=x, ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=The "see below" link only implies that they were not aspirated, which sounds like normal phonology to me. Was Ancient Greek /ks/ pronounced differently from English /ks/ or any other /ks/ of any language that also has /kʰ/? What exactly is said in the book?|date=January 2018}}

===Nasals===
Ancient Greek has two nasals: the bilabial [[nasal consonant|nasal]] {{IPA|/m/}}, written {{lang|grc|[[Mu (letter)|μ]]}} and the alveolar nasal {{IPA|/n/}}, written {{lang|grc|[[Nu (letter)|ν]]}}. Depending on the phonetic environment, the phoneme {{IPA|/n/}} was pronounced as {{IPA|[m n ŋ]}}; see [[#Assimilation|below]]. On occasion, the {{IPA|/n/}} phoneme participates in true gemination without any assimilation in place of articulation, as for example in the word {{lang|grc|ἐννέα}}. Artificial gemination for metrical purposes is also found occasionally, as in the form {{lang|grc|ἔννεπε}}, occurring in the first verse of Homer's Odyssey.

===Liquids===
Ancient Greek has the [[Liquid consonants|liquids]] {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, written {{lang|grc|λ}} and  {{lang|grc|ρ}} respectively.

The letter [[lambda]] {{lang|grc|λ}} probably represented a lateral ("clear") {{IPAblink|l}} as in Modern Greek and most European languages, rather than a velarized ("dark") {{IPAblink|ɫ}} as in English in [[Syllable coda|coda position]].

The letter [[rho]] {{lang|grc|ρ}} was pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, as in Italian or Modern Greek rather than as in standard varieties of English or French. At the beginning of a word, it was pronounced as a [[voiceless alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r̥]}}. In some cases, initial {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ρ}}}} in poetry was pronounced as a long trill (phonemically {{IPA|/rr/}}), shown by the fact that the previous syllable is counted as heavy: for instance {{lang|grc|τίνι ῥυθμῷ}} must be pronounced as {{lang|grc|τίνι ρρυθμῷ}} in [[Euripides]], [[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]] 772, {{lang|grc|τὰ ῥήματα}} as {{lang|grc|τὰ ρρήματα}} in [[Aristophanes]], [[The Frogs]] 1059, and {{lang|grc|βέλεα ῥέον}} as {{lang|grc|βέλεα ρρέον}} in [[Iliad]] 12.159.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=41–45|loc=on r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semivowels===
The semivowels {{IPA|/j w/}} were not present in standard Attic Greek at the beginnings of words. However, diphthongs ending in {{IPA|/i u/}} were usually pronounced with a double semivowel {{IPA|[jj ww]}} or {{IPA|[jː wː]}} before a vowel. Allen suggests that these were simply semivocalic allophones of the vowels, although in some cases they developed from earlier semivowels.&lt;ref name="Allen w"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=47–51|loc=the semivowel ''w''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen j"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=51, 52|loc=the semivowel ''y''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen diphthong vowel"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=81–84|loc=diphthongs before other vowels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[labio-velar approximant]] {{IPA|/w/}} at the beginning of a syllable survived in some non-Attic dialects, such as Arcadian and Aeolic; a [[voiceless labio-velar approximant]] {{IPA|/ʍ/}} probably also occurred in Pamphylian and Boeotian. {{IPA|/w/}} is sometimes written with the letter [[digamma]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Ϝ}}}}}}, and later with {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Β}}}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|ΟΥ}}}}}}, and {{IPA|/ʍ/}} was written with [[digamma]] and [[heta]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|ϜΗ}}}}}}:&lt;ref name="Allen w" /&gt;
*Pamphylian {{lang|grc|{{sc|ϜΗΕ}}}} {{IPA|/ʍe/}}, written as {{lang|grc|ἕ}} in Homer (the [[reflexive pronoun]])
*Boeotian {{lang|grc|{{sc|ϜΗΕΚΑΔΑΜΟΕ}}}} {{IPA|/ʍe.ka.daː.moe/}}&lt;!-- Attempt at transcription; needs verification. --&gt; for Attic {{lang|grc|Ἑκαδήμῳ}} [[Akademos]]

Evidence from the [[dactylic hexameter|poetic meter of Homer]] suggests that {{IPA|/w ʍ/}} also occurred in the Archaic Greek of the Iliad and Odyssey, although they would not have been pronounced by Attic speakers and are not written in the Attic-influenced form of the text. The presence of these consonants would explain some cases of absence of [[elision]], some cases in which the meter demands a [[syllable weight|heavy syllable]] but the text has a light syllable (''positional quantity''), and some cases in which a long vowel before a short vowel is not shortened (absence of epic [[correption]]).&lt;ref name="Allen w" /&gt;

In the table below the [[scansion]] of the examples is shown with the breve {{angbr|˘}} for light syllables, the macron {{angbr|¯}} for heavy ones, and the pipe {{angbr|{{!}}}} for the divisions between [[foot (prosody)|metrical feet]]. The sound {{IPA|/w/}} is written using digamma, and {{IPA|/ʍ/}} with digamma and rough breathing, although the letter never appears in the actual text.

|}

===Doubled consonants===
Single and double ([[gemination|geminated]]) consonants were distinguished from each other in Ancient Greek: for instance, {{IPA|/p kʰ s r/}} contrasted with {{IPA|/pː kʰː sː rː/}} (also written {{IPA|/pp kkʰ ss rr/}}). In Ancient Greek poetry, a vowel followed by a double consonant counts as a [[syllable weight|heavy syllable]] in meter. Doubled consonants usually only occur between vowels, not at the beginning or the end of a word, except in the case of {{IPA|/r/}}, for which [[#Liquids|see above]].

Gemination was lost in Standard Modern Greek, so that all consonants that used to be geminated are pronounced as singletons. [[Cypriot Greek]], the Modern Greek dialect of [[Cyprus]], however, preserves geminate consonants.

A doubled {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ττ}}}} {{IPA|/tː/}} in Attic corresponds to a {{lang|grc|σσ}} {{IPA|/sː/}} in Ionic and other dialects. This sound arose from historic [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] ([[#Palatalization|see below]]).

==Vowels==
Archaic and Classical Greek vowels and diphthongs varied by dialect. The tables below show the vowels of Classical Attic in the IPA, paired with the vowel letters that represent them in the standard Ionic alphabet. The earlier Old Attic alphabet had certain differences. Attic Greek of the 5th century BC likely had 5 short and 7 long vowels: {{IPA|/a e i y o/}} and {{IPA|/aː eː ɛː iː yː uː ɔː/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen vowels"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=62|loc=simple vowels}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowel length was phonemic: some words are distinguished from each other by vowel length. In addition, Classical Attic had many diphthongs, all ending in {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}; these are discussed below.

In standard Ancient Greek spelling, the long vowels {{IPA|/eː ɛː uː ɔː/}} (spelled {{lang|grc|ει η ου ω}}) are distinguished from the short vowels {{IPA|/e o/}} (spelled {{lang|grc|ε ο}}), but the long&amp;ndash;short pairs {{IPA|/a aː/}}, {{IPA|/i iː/}}, and {{IPA|/y yː/}} are each written with a single letter, {{lang|grc|α, ι, υ}}. This is the reason for the [[#Terminology|terms for vowel letters]] described below. In grammars, textbooks, or dictionaries, {{lang|grc|α, ι, υ}} are sometimes marked with [[macron (diacritic)|macrons]] ({{lang|grc|ᾱ, ῑ, ῡ}}) to indicate that they are long, or [[breve]]s ({{lang|grc|ᾰ, ῐ, ῠ}}) to indicate that they are short.

For the purposes of [[#Accent|accent]], vowel length is measured in [[mora (linguistics)|morae]]: long vowels and most diphthongs count as two morae; short vowels, and the diphthongs {{IPA|/ai oi/}} in certain endings, count as one mora. A one-mora vowel could be accented with [[pitch accent|high pitch]], but two-mora vowels could be accented with falling or rising pitch.&lt;ref name="Kiparsky"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kiparsky|1973|p=796|loc=Greek accentual mobility and contour accents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Close and open vowels====
The [[Vowel#Height|close and open]] short vowels {{IPA|/i y a/}} were similar in quality to the corresponding long vowels {{IPA|/iː yː aː/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=62, 63|loc=the vowel a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=65|loc=the vowel i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen u"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=65–69|loc=upsilon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Greek close back rounded {{IPA|/u uː/}} shifted to front {{IPA|/y yː/}} early in Attic and Ionic, around the 6th or 7th century BC ([[#Vowel raising and fronting|see below]]).&lt;ref name="Allen ou o" /&gt; {{IPA|/u/}} remained only in diphthongs; it did not shift in Boeotian, so when Boeotians adopted the Attic alphabet, they wrote their unshifted {{IPA|/u uː/}} using {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|ΟΥ}}}}}}.&lt;ref name="Allen u" /&gt;

====Mid vowels====
The situation with the mid vowels was more complex. In the early Classical period, there were two short mid vowels {{IPA|/e o/}}, but four long mid vowels: [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]] {{IPA|/eː oː/}} and [[open-mid vowel|open-mid]] {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen ou o"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=75–79|loc=ou ō}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen e ei"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=69–75|loc=ē and ei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the short mid vowels changed to long close-mid {{IPA|/eː oː/}} rather than long open-mid {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}} by compensatory lengthening in Attic, [[Edgar Howard Sturtevant|E.H. Sturtevant]] suggests that the short mid vowels were close-mid,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sturtevant|1940|p=34}}&lt;!-- page number given by Allen --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but Allen says this is not necessarily true.&lt;ref name="Allen short mid"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=63, 64|loc=short mid vowels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-4th century BC, the close-mid back {{IPA|/oː/}} shifted to {{IPA|/uː/}}, partly because {{IPA|/u uː/}} had shifted to {{IPA|/y yː/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen ou o" /&gt; Similarly, the close-mid front {{IPA|/eː/}} changed to {{IPA|/iː/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen e ei" /&gt; These changes triggered a shift of the open-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}} to become mid or close-mid {{IPA|/eː oː/}}, and this is the pronunciation they had in early Koine Greek.

In Latin, on the other hand, all short vowels except for {{IPA|/a/}} were much more open than the corresponding long vowels. This made long {{IPA|/eː oː/}} similar in quality to short {{IPA|/i u/}}, and for this reason the letters {{angbr|{{sqc|I E}}}} and {{angbr|{{sqc|V O}}}} were frequently confused with each other in Roman inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=47–49|loc=long and short vowel quality}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also explains the vocalism of New Testament Greek words such as λεγ'''ε'''ών ('legion'; &lt; Lat. ''leg'''i'''o'') or λ'''έ'''ντιον ('towel'; &lt; Lat. ''l'''i'''nteum''), where Latin {{angbr|i}} was perceived to be similar to Greek {{angbr|ε}}.

In Attic, the open-mid {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}} and close-mid {{IPA|/eː oː/}} each have three main origins. Some cases of the open-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}} developed from Proto-Greek {{PIE|*ē ō}}. In other cases they developed from contraction. Finally, some cases of {{IPA|/ɛː/}}, only in Attic and Ionic, developed from earlier {{IPA|/aː/}} by the [[Attic–Ionic vowel shift]].&lt;!-- Sometime between Proto-Greek and Ancient Greek, but the likely point should be determined. --&gt;

In a few cases, the long close-mid vowels {{IPA|/eː oː/}} developed from [[#Monophthongization|monophthongization]] of the pre-Classical falling diphthongs {{IPA|/ei ou/}}. In most cases, they arose through [[#Compensatory lengthening|compensatory lengthening]] of the short vowels {{IPA|/e o/}}&lt;ref name="Smyth lengthening"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§37: compensatory lengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through [[#Contraction|contraction]].&lt;ref name="Smyth contraction"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§48-59: contraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smyth ei ou"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§6: ei ou, spurious and genuine diphthongs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both Aeolic and Doric, Proto-Greek {{IPA|/aː/}} did not shift to {{IPA|/ɛː/}}. In some dialects of Doric, such as Laconian and Cretan, contraction and compensatory lengthening resulted in open-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}}, and in others they resulted in the close-mid {{IPA|/eː oː/}}. Sometimes the Doric dialects using the open-mid vowels are called Severer, and the ones using the close-mid vowels are called Milder.&lt;ref name="Smyth dialects" /&gt;

===Diphthongs===
Attic had many diphthongs, all [[Diphthong#Falling and rising|falling diphthongs]] with {{IPA|/i u/}} as the second [[semivowel|semivocalic element]], and either with a short or long first element. Diphthongs with a short first element are sometimes called "proper diphthongs", while diphthongs with a long first element are sometimes called "improper diphthongs."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Blass]], ''Pronunciation of Ancient Greek'', Cambridge University Press, 1890, p. 22; Anne H. Groton''From Alpha to Omega: A Beginning Course in Classical Greek'', Hackett Publishing, 2013, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they have a long or a short first element, all diphthongs count as two morae when applying the accent rules, like long vowels, except for {{IPA|/ai oi/}} in certain cases. Overall Attic and Koine show a pattern of monophthongization: they tend to change diphthongs to single vowels.&lt;ref name="Allen e ei" /&gt;

The most common diphthongs were {{IPA|/ai au eu oi/}}&lt;ref name="Allen short diphthong"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=79|loc=short diphthongs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|/ɛːi̯ aːi̯ ɔːi̯/}}. The long diphthongs {{IPA|/ɛːu̯ aːu̯ ɔːu̯/}} occurred rarely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=84–88|loc=long diphthongs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diphthongs {{IPA|/ei ou yi/}} changed to {{IPA|/eː uː yː/}} in the early Classical period in most cases, but {{IPA|/ei yi/}} remained before vowels.

In the tables below, the diphthongs that were monophthongized in most cases are preceded by an asterisk, and the rarer diphthongs are in parentheses.

The second element of a diphthong {{IPA|/i u/}} was often pronounced as a doubled semivowel {{IPA|[jj ww]}} or {{IPA|[jː wː]}} before vowels, and in other cases it was often [[elision|lost]]:&lt;ref name="Allen diphthong vowel" /&gt;
* {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναῖοι}} {{IPA|/a.tʰɛɛ.nái.oi/}} ('Athenians'): {{IPA|[a.tʰɛː.naĵ.joi]}}
* {{lang|grc|ποιῶ}} {{IPA|/poi.ɔ́ɔ/}} ('I do'): either {{IPA|[poj.jɔ̂ː]}} or {{IPA|[po.jɔ̂ː]}}&lt;!-- Examples from meter of Athenian tragedy needed. --&gt;

* {{lang|grc|σημεῖον}} {{IPA|/sɛɛ.méi.on/}} ('sign'): {{IPA|[sɛː.meĵ.jon]}}

The diphthong {{IPA|/oi/}} merged with the long close front rounded vowel {{IPA|/yː/}} in Koine. It likely first became {{IPA|[øi]}}. Change to {{IPA|[øi]}} would be [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]: the back vowel {{IPA|[o]}} becoming front {{IPA|[ø]}} because of the following front vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. This may have been the pronunciation in Classical Attic. Later it must have become {{IPA|[øː]}}, parallel to the monophthongization of {{IPA|/ei ou/}}, and then {{IPA|[yː]}}, but when words with {{angbr|{{lang|grc|οι}}}} were borrowed into Latin, the Greek digraph was represented with the Latin digraph {{angbr|{{sqc|oe}}}}, representing the diphthong {{IPA|/oe/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen short diphthong" /&gt;

[[Thucydides]] reports the confusion of two words ([[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:54|2:54]]), which makes more sense if {{IPA|/oi/}} was pronounced {{IPA|[øi]}}:&lt;ref name="Allen short diphthong" /&gt;
*{{lang|grc|λοιμός}} {{IPA|/loi.mós/}} ('plague'): possibly {{IPA|[løi.mós]}}
:{{lang|grc|λῑμός}} {{IPA|/lii.mós/}} ('famine'): {{IPA|[liː.mós]}}

In the diphthongs {{IPA|/au̯ eu̯ ɛːu̯/}}, the offglide {{IPA|/u/}} became a consonant in Koine Greek, and they became Modern Greek {{IPA|/av ev iv/}}. The long diphthongs {{IPA|/aːi̯ ɛːi̯ ɔːi̯/}} lost their offglide and merged with the long vowels {{IPA|/aː ɛː ɔː/}} by the time of Koine Greek.

==Spelling==
[[Archaic Greek alphabets|Many different forms of the Greek alphabet]] were used for the regional dialects of the Greek language during the Archaic and early Classical periods. The Attic dialect, however, used two forms. The first was the [[Archaic Greek alphabets#Old Attic|Old Attic alphabet]], and the second is the Ionic alphabet, introduced to [[Athens]] around the end of the 5th century BC during the [[archon]]ship of [[Eucleides]]. The last is the standard alphabet in modern editions of Ancient Greek texts, and the one used for Classical Attic, standard Koine, and Medieval Greek, finally developing into the alphabet used for Modern Greek.

===Consonant spelling===
Most double consonants are written using double letters: {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ππ σσ ρρ}}}} represent {{IPA|/pː sː rː/}} or {{IPA|/pp ss rr/}}. The geminate versions of the aspirated stops {{IPA|/pʰː tʰː kʰː/}} are written with the digraphs {{angbr|{{lang|grc|πφ τθ κχ}}}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|p=21|loc=doubling of aspirates}}&lt;/ref&gt; and geminate {{IPA|/ɡː/}} is written as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|κγ}}}}, since {{angbr|{{lang|grc|γγ}}}} represents {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} in the standard orthography of Ancient Greek.&lt;ref name="Allen g"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{lang|grc|ἔκγονος}} ({{lang|grc|ἐκ-γονος}}) {{IPA|/éɡ.ɡo.nos/}} ('offspring'), occasionally {{lang|grc|{{sm|εγγονοσ}}}} in inscriptions
:{{lang|grc|ἐγγενής}} {{IPA|/eŋ.ɡe.nɛɛ́s/}} ('inborn') ({{lang|grc|εν-γενής}})

{{IPA|/s/}} was written with [[sigma]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|Σ σ ς}}}}. The clusters {{IPA|/ps ks/}} were written as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|ΦΣ ΧΣ}}}}}} in the [[Archaic Greek alphabets#Old Attic|Old Attic alphabet]], but as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Ψ Ξ}}}}}} in the standard Ionic alphabet.

Voiceless {{IPA|/r/}} is usually written with the ''spiritus asper'' as {{lang|grc|ῥ-}} and transcribed as ''rh'' in Latin. The same orthography is sometimes encountered when {{IPA|/r/}} is geminated, as in {{angbr|{{lang|grc|συρρέω}}}}, sometimes written {{angbr|{{lang|grc|συῤῥέω}}}}, giving rise to the transliteration ''rrh''. This example also illustrates that {{IPA|/n/}} ({{lang|grc|συν-ῥέω}}) assimilates to following {{IPA|/r/}}, creating gemination.

===Vowel spelling===
The [[Close front rounded vowel|close front rounded]] vowels {{IPA|/y/}} and {{IPA|/yː/}} (an evolution of {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} respectively) are both represented in writing by the letter [[upsilon]] ({{lang|grc|υ}}) irrespective of length.

In Classical Attic, the spellings {{lang|grc|ει}} and {{lang|grc|ου}} represented respectively the vowels {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} (the latter being an evolution of {{IPA|/oː/}}), from [[#Monophthongization|original diphthongs]], [[#Compensatory lengthening|compensatory lengthening]], or [[#Contraction|contraction]].

The above information about the usage of the vowel letters applies to the classical orthography of Attic, after Athens took over the orthographic conventions of the Ionic alphabet in 403 BC. In the earlier, traditional Attic orthography there was only a smaller repertoire of vowel symbols: {{lang|grc|α}}, {{lang|grc|ε}}, {{lang|grc|ι}}, {{lang|grc|ο}}, and {{lang|grc|υ}}. The letters {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ω}} were still missing. All five vowel symbols could at that stage denote either a long or a short vowel. Moreover, the letters {{lang|grc|ε}} and {{lang|grc|ο}} could respectively denote the long open-mid {{IPA|/ɛː, ɔː/}}, the long close-mid {{IPA|/eː, oː/}} and the short mid phonemes {{IPA|/e, o/}}. The Ionic alphabet brought the new letters {{lang|grc|η}} and {{lang|grc|ω}} for the one set of long vowels, and the convention of using the digraph spellings {{lang|grc|ει}} and {{lang|grc|ου}} for the other, leaving simple {{lang|grc|ε}} and {{lang|grc|ο}} to be used only for the short vowels. However, the remaining vowel letters {{lang|grc|α}}, {{lang|grc|ι}} and {{lang|grc|υ}} continued to be ambiguous between long and short phonemes.

===Spelling of /h/===
In the Old Attic alphabet, {{IPA|/h/}} was written with the letterform of [[eta]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Η}}}}}}. In the Ionic dialect of Asia Minor, {{IPA|/h/}} was lost early on, and the letter {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Η}}}}}} in the Ionic alphabet represented {{IPA|/ɛː/}}. In 403 BC, when the Ionic alphabet was adopted in Athens, the sound {{IPA|/h/}} ceased to be represented in writing.

In some inscriptions {{IPA|/h/}} was represented by a symbol formed from the left-hand half of the original letter: {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Ͱ}}}}}} ({{GrGl|Eta tack}}). Later grammarians, during the time of the Hellenistic Koine, developed that symbol further into a [[diacritic]], the rough breathing ({{lang|grc|δασὺ πνεῦμα}}; {{lang-la|spiritus asper}}; {{lang|grc|δασεῖα}} for short), which was written on the top of the initial vowel. Correspondingly, they introduced the [[mirror image]] diacritic called smooth breathing ({{lang|grc|ψιλὸν πνεῦμα}}; {{lang-la|spiritus lenis}}; {{lang|grc|ψιλή}} for short), which indicated the absence of {{IPA|/h/}}. These marks were not used consistently until the time of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

==Phonotactics==
Ancient Greek words were divided into syllables. A word has one syllable for every short vowel, long vowel, or diphthong. In addition, syllables began with a consonant if possible, and sometimes ended with a consonant. Consonants at the beginning of the syllable are the syllable onset, the vowel in the middle is a nucleus, and the consonant at the end is a coda.

In dividing words into syllables, each vowel or diphthong belongs to one syllable. A consonant between vowels goes with the following vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§138, 140: syllables, vowels, and intervocalic consonants}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following transcriptions, a period {{angbr|{{IPA|.}}}} separates syllables.
* {{lang|grc|λέγω}} ('I say'): {{IPA|/lé.ɡɔɔ/}} (two syllables)
* {{lang|grc|τοιαῦται}} ('this kind') ({{sm|fem pl}}): {{IPA|/toi.áu.tai/}} (three syllables)
* {{lang|grc|βουλεύσειε}} ('if only he would want'): {{IPA|/buː.leú.sei.e/}} (four syllables)
* {{lang|grc|ἠελίοιο}} ('sun's') (Homeric Greek): {{IPA|/ɛɛ.e.lí.oi.o/}} (five syllables)

Any remaining consonants are added at the end of a syllable. And when a double consonant occurs between vowels, it is divided between syllables. One half of the double consonant goes to the previous syllable, forming a coda, and one goes to the next, forming an onset. Clusters of two or three consonants are also usually divided between syllables, with at least one consonant joining the previous vowel and forming the syllable coda of its syllable, but see below.
* {{lang|grc|ἄλλος}} ('another'): {{IPA|/ál.los/}}
* {{lang|grc|ἔστιν}} ('there is'): {{IPA|/és.tin/}}
* {{lang|grc|δόξα}} ('opinion'): {{IPA|/dók.sa/}}
* {{lang|grc|ἐχθρός}} ('enemy'): {{IPA|/ekʰ.tʰrós/}}

===Syllable weight===
Syllables in Ancient Greek were either [[syllable weight|light or heavy]]. This distinction is important in [[Ancient Greek poetry]], which was made up of patterns of heavy and light syllables. [[Syllable weight]] is based on both consonants and vowels. Ancient Greek accent, by contrast, is only based on vowels.

A syllable ending in a short vowel, or the diphthongs {{lang|grc|αι}} and {{lang|grc|οι}} in certain noun and verb endings, was light. All other syllables were heavy: that is, syllables ending in a long vowel or diphthong, a short vowel and consonant, or a long vowel or diphthong and consonant.
* {{lang|grc|λέγω}} {{IPA|/lé.ɡɔɔ/}}: light&amp;nbsp;– heavy;
* {{lang|grc|τοιαῦται}} {{IPA|/toi.áu.tai/}}: heavy&amp;nbsp;– heavy&amp;nbsp;– light;
* {{lang|grc|βουλεύσειε}} {{IPA|/buː.leú.sei.e/}}: heavy&amp;nbsp;– heavy&amp;nbsp;– heavy&amp;nbsp;– light;
* {{lang|grc|ἠελίοιο}} {{IPA|/ɛɛ.e.lí.oi.o/}}: heavy&amp;nbsp;– light&amp;nbsp;– light&amp;nbsp;– heavy&amp;nbsp;– light.

Greek grammarians called heavy syllables {{lang|grc|μακραί}} ('long', singular {{lang|grc|μακρά}}), and placed them in two categories. They called a syllable with a long vowel or diphthong {{lang|grc|φύσει μακρά}} ('long by nature'), and a syllable ending in a consonant {{lang|grc|θέσει μακρά}} ('long by position'). These terms were translated into Latin as ''{{lang|la|naturā longa}}'' and ''{{lang|la|positiōne longa}}''. However, Indian grammarians distinguished vowel length and syllable weight by using the terms ''heavy'' and ''light'' for syllable quantity and the terms ''long'' and ''short'' only for vowel length.&lt;ref name="Allen syllable"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=104, 105|loc=terms for syllable quantity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1973|pp=53–55|loc=''heavy'' or ''long'' versus ''light'' or ''short''}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article adopts their terminology, since not all metrically heavy syllables have long vowels; e.g.:
* {{lang|grc|ἥ}} ({{sm|fem [[relative pronoun|rel pron]]}}) {{IPA|/hɛɛ́/}} is a heavy syllable having a long vowel, "long by nature";
* {{lang|grc|οἷ}} ({{sm|masc dat sg [[personal pronoun|pron]]}}) {{IPA|/hói/}} is a heavy syllable having a diphthong, "long by nature";
* {{lang|grc|ὅς}} ({{sm|masc rel pron}}) {{IPA|/hós/}} is a heavy syllable ending in a consonant, "long by position".

Poetic meter shows which syllables in a word counted as heavy, and knowing syllable weight allows us to determine how consonant clusters were divided between syllables. Syllables before double consonants, and most syllables before consonant clusters, count as heavy. Here the letters {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ζ, ξ and ψ}}}} count as consonant clusters. This indicates that double consonants and most consonant clusters were divided between syllables, with at least the first consonant belonging to the preceding syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=105, 106|loc=syllable division}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{lang|grc|ἄλλος}} {{IPA|/ál.los/}} ('different'): heavy&amp;nbsp;– heavy
*{{lang|grc|ὥστε}} {{IPA|/hɔɔ́s.te/}} ('so that'): heavy&amp;nbsp;– light
*{{lang|grc|ἄξιος}} {{IPA|/ák.si.os/}} ('worthy'): heavy&amp;nbsp;– light&amp;nbsp;– heavy
*{{lang|grc|προσβλέψαιμι}} {{IPA|/pros.blép.sai.mi/}} ('may I see!'): heavy&amp;nbsp;– heavy&amp;nbsp;– heavy&amp;nbsp;– light
*{{lang|grc|χαριζομένη}} {{IPA|/kʰa.ris.do.mé.nɛɛ/}} ('rejoicing' {{sm|fem sg}}): light&amp;nbsp;– heavy&amp;nbsp;– light&amp;nbsp;– light&amp;nbsp;– heavy

In Attic poetry, syllables before a cluster of a stop and a liquid or nasal are commonly light rather than heavy. This was called ''{{lang|la|correptio Attica}}'' ('Attic shortening'), since here an ordinarily "long" syllable became "short".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=106–110|loc=correptio Attica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1973|pp=210–216|loc=syllable weight before consonant sequences inside words}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{lang|grc|πατρός}} ('of a father'): Homeric {{IPA|/pat.rós/}} (heavy-heavy), Attic {{IPA|/pa.trós/}} (light-heavy)

===Onset===
In Attic Greek, any single consonant and many [[consonant cluster]]s can occur as a [[Syllable#Onset|syllable onset]] (the beginning of a syllable). Certain consonant clusters occur as onsets, while others do not occur.

Six stop clusters occur. All of them agree in [[voice-onset time]], and begin with a labial or velar and end with a dental. Thus, the clusters {{IPA|/pʰtʰ kʰtʰ pt kt bd ɡd/}} are allowed. Certain stop clusters do not occur as onsets: clusters beginning with a dental and ending with a labial or velar, and clusters of stops that disagree in voice onset time.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldstein|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coda===
In Ancient Greek, any vowel may end a word, but the only consonants that may normally [[Syllable#Coda|end a word]] are {{IPA|/n r s/}}. If a stop ended a word in Proto-Indo-European, this was dropped in Ancient Greek, as in {{lang|grc|ποίημα}} (from {{lang|grc|ποίηματ}}; compare the genitive singular ποιήματος). Other consonants may end a word, however, when a final vowel is elided before a word beginning in a vowel, as in {{lang|grc|ἐφ᾿ ἵππῳ}} (from {{lang|grc|ἐπὶ ἵππῳ}}).

==Accent==
{{Main article|Ancient Greek accent}}
Ancient Greek had a pitch accent, unlike the stress accent of Modern Greek and English. One [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] of a word was accented with high pitch. A mora is a unit of vowel length; in Ancient Greek, short vowels have one mora and long vowels and diphthongs have two morae. Thus, a one-mora vowel could have accent on its one mora, and a two-mora vowel could have accent on either of its two morae. The position of accent was free, with certain limitations. In a given word, it could appear in several different positions, depending on the lengths of the vowels in the word.

In the examples below, long vowels and diphthongs are represented with two vowel symbols, one for each mora. This does not mean that the long vowel has two separate vowels in different syllables. Syllables are separated by periods {{angbr|.}}; anything between two periods is pronounced in one syllable.
*{{lang|grc|η}} (long vowel with two morae): phonemic transcription {{IPA|/ɛɛ/}}, phonetic transcription {{IPA|[ɛː]}} (one syllable)
*{{lang|grc|εε}} (two short vowels with one mora each): phonemic transcription {{IPA|/e.e/}}, phonetic transcription {{IPA|[e̞.e̞]}} (two syllables)

The accented mora is marked with acute accent {{angbr|´}}. A vowel with rising pitch contour is marked with a caron {{angbr|ˇ}}, and a vowel with a falling pitch contour is marked with a circumflex {{angbr|ˆ}}.

The position of the accent in Ancient Greek was phonemic and distinctive: certain words are distinguished by which mora in them is accented. The position of the accent was also distinctive on long vowels and diphthongs: either the first or the second mora could be accented. Phonetically, a two-mora vowel had a rising or falling [[pitch contour]], depending on which of its two morae was accented:&lt;ref name="Kiparsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen accent"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=116–124|loc=accent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Final {{lang|grc|-αι, οι}} were sometimes considered long, and sometimes short. This sometimes explains accentual differences between forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§169: short αι οι}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A description of the ultima-length accent rule is needed to explain this. --&gt;

[[Greek diacritics|Accent marks]] were never used until around 200 BC. They were first used in [[Alexandria]], and [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] is said to have invented them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harnvb|Smyth|1920|loc=§161}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three: the [[acute accent|acute]], [[circumflex]], and [[grave accent|grave]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|´ ῀ `}}}}. The shape of the circumflex is a merging of the acute and grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§156: the circumflex and its pronunciation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robins|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hTZHbNmFfpsC&amp;pg=PA50 50]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acute represented high or rising pitch, the circumflex represented falling pitch, but what the grave represented is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Allen accent marks"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=124–126|loc=accent marks and their meanings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, the grave was used on every syllable without an acute or circumflex. Here the grave marked all unaccented syllables, which had lower pitch than the accented syllable.
*{{lang|grc|Θὲόδὼρὸς}} {{IPA|/tʰe.ó.dɔː.ros/}}

Later on, a grave was only used to replace a final acute before another full word; the acute was kept before an enclitic or at the end of a phrase. This usage was standardized in the [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine era]], and is used in modern editions of Ancient Greek texts. Here it might mark a lowered version of a high-pitched syllable.
* {{lang|grc|ἔστι τι καλόν.}} {{IPA|/és.ti.ti.ka.lón/}} ('there is something beautiful') ({{lang|grc|καλόν}} is at the end of the sentence)
:: {{lang|grc|καλόν ἐστι.}} {{IPA|/ka.ló.nes.ti/}} ('it is beautiful') ({{lang|grc|ἐστι}} here is an enclitic)
:: {{lang|grc|καλὸν καὶ ἀγαθόν}} {{IPA|/ka.lón.kai.a.ɡa.tʰón/}} ('good and beautiful')

==Sound changes==
Greek underwent many sound changes. Some occurred between [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) and Proto-Greek (PGr), some between the [[Mycenaean Greek]] and Ancient Greek periods, which are separated by about 300 years (the [[Greek Dark Ages]]), and some during the Koine Greek period. Some sound changes occurred only in particular Ancient Greek dialects, not in others, and certain dialects, such as Boeotian and Laconian, underwent sound changes similar to the ones that occurred later in Koine. This section primarily describes sound changes that occurred between the Mycenaean and Ancient Greek periods and during the Ancient Greek period.

For sound changes occurring in Proto-Greek and in Koine Greek, see {{section link|Proto-Greek language|Phonology}} and [[Koine Greek phonology]].

===Debuccalization===
In Proto-Greek, the PIE sibilant {{PIE|*s}} became {{IPA|/h/}} by [[debuccalization]] in many cases.&lt;ref name="initial s"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=168–170|loc=§170: debuccalized initial ''s'' in Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PIE {{PIE|*so, seh₂}} &gt; {{lang|grc|ὁ, ἡ}} {{IPA|/ho hɛː/}} ('the') ({{sm|m f}}) — compare Sanskrit ''{{transl|sa|IAST|sá sā́}}''
: PIE {{PIE|*septḿ̥}} &gt; {{wikt-lang|grc|ἑπτά}} {{IPA|/hep.tá/}} ('seven') — compare Latin ''{{lang|la|septem}}''

Clusters of {{PIE|*s}} and a [[sonorant]] (liquid or nasal) at the beginning of a word became a voiceless resonant in some forms of Archaic Greek. Voiceless {{IPA|[r̥]}} remained in Attic at the beginning of words, and became the regular allophone of {{IPA|/r/}} in this position; voiceless {{IPA|/ʍ/}} merged with {{IPA|/h/}}; and the rest of the voiceless resonants merged with the voiced resonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=170, 171|loc=§171: ''s'' in initial clusters with a sonorant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PIE {{PIE|*srew-}} &gt; {{lang|grc|ῥέϝω}} &gt; Attic {{lang|grc|ῥέω}} {{IPA|/r̥é.ɔː/}} ('flow') — compare Sanskrit ''{{transl|sa|IAST|srávanti}}'' ({{sm|3rd pl}})
::PIE {{PIE|*sroweh₂}} &gt; [[Corfu]] {{lang|grc|{{sc|ΡΗΟϜΑΙΣΙ}}}} {{IPA|/r̥owaisi/}} ({{sm|dat pl}}), Attic {{lang|grc|ῥοή}} {{IPA|[r̥o.ɛ̌ː]}} ('stream')
* PIE {{PIE|*swe}} &gt; Pamphylian {{lang|grc|{{sc|ϜΗΕ}}}} {{IPA|/ʍe/}}, Attic {{lang|grc|ἕ}} {{IPA|/hé/}} ({{sm|[[reflexive pronoun|refl pron]]}})
* PIE {{PIE|*slagʷ-}} &gt; Corfu {{lang|grc|{{sc|ΛΗΑΒΩΝ}}}} {{IPA|/l̥aboːn/}}, Attic {{lang|grc|λαβών}} {{IPA|/la.bɔ̌ːn/}} ('taking') ({{sm|[[Aorist (Ancient Greek)|aor]] [[participle|ppl]]}})

PIE {{PIE|*s}} remained in clusters with stops and at the end of a word:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=169, 170|loc=§169: unchanged ''s'' in Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PIE {{PIE|*h₁esti}} &gt; {{lang|grc|ἐστί}} {{IPA|/es.tí/}} ('is') — compare Sanskrit ''{{transl|sa|IAST|ásti}}'', Latin ''{{lang|la|est}}''
: PIE {{PIE|*seǵʰ-s-}} &gt; {{lang|grc|ἕξω}} {{IPA|/hék.sɔː/}} ('I will have')
: PIE {{PIE|*ǵenH₁os}} &gt; {{lang|grc|γένος}} {{IPA|/ɡénos/}} ('kind') — compare Sanskrit ''{{transl|sa|IAST|jánas}}'', Latin ''{{lang|la|genus}}''

The PIE semivowel {{PIE|*y}}, IPA {{IPA|/j/}}, was sometimes debuccalized and sometimes [[fortition|strengthened]] initially. How this development was conditioned is unclear; the involvement of the [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] has been suggested. In certain other positions, it was kept, and frequently underwent other sound changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=187, 188|loc=§191: ''y'' in initial position}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PIE {{PIE|*yos, yeH₂}} &gt; {{wikt-lang|grc|ὅς}}, {{wikt-lang|grc|ἥ}} {{IPA|[hós hɛ̌ː]}} ('who') ([[relative pronoun|{{sm|rel pron}}]]) — compare Sanskrit [[wikt:यद्#Sanskrit|''{{transl|sa|IAST|yás, yā́}}'']]
* PIE [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/yugóm|{{PIE|*yugóm}}]] &gt; early {{IPA|/dzu.ɡón/}} &gt; Attic {{lang|grc|ζυγόν}} {{IPA|/sdy.ɡón/}} ('yoke') — compare Sanskrit ''{{transl|sa|IAST|yugá}}'', Latin ''{{lang|la|jugum}}''
* {{PIE|*mor-ya}} &gt; {{lang|grc|μοῖρα}} {{IPA|/mói.ra/}} ('part') (by [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]) — compare {{lang|grc|μόρος}}

Between vowels, {{PIE|*s}} became {{IPA|/h/}}. Intervocalic {{IPA|/h/}} probably occurred in Mycenaean. In most cases it was lost by the time of Ancient Greek. In a few cases, it was [[metathesis (linguistics)|transposed]] to the beginning of the word.&lt;ref name="Sihler intervocalic s"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=171, 172|loc=§172: intervocalic ''s''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, initial {{IPA|/h/}} was lost by [[#Psilosis|psilosis]].
* PIE [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/ǵénh₁os|*ǵénh₁es-os]] &gt; PGr {{PIE|*genehos}} &gt; Ionic {{lang|grc|γένεος}} {{IPA|/ɡé.ne.os/}} &gt; Attic {{lang|grc|γένους}} ('of a race') {{IPA|/ɡé.nuːs/}} (contraction; {{sm|gen.}} of {{wikt-lang|grc|γένος}})
* Mycenaean ''pa-we-a₂'', possibly {{IPA|/pʰar.we.ha/}}, later {{lang|grc|φάρεα}} {{IPA|/pʰǎː.re.a/}} ('pieces of cloth')
* PIE {{PIE|*(H₁)ewsoH₂}} &gt; Proto-Greek {{PIE|*ewhō}} &gt; {{lang|grc|εὕω}} {{IPA|/heǔ.ɔː/}} ('singe')

By [[morphological leveling]], intervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} was kept in certain noun and verb forms: for instance, the {{IPA|/s/}} marking the [[word stem|stems]] for the [[future tense|future]] and [[Aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist tense]]s.&lt;ref name="Sihler intervocalic s" /&gt;
*{{lang|grc|λύω, λύσω, ἔλυσα}} {{IPA|/lyý.ɔː lyý.'''s'''ɔː é.lyy.'''s'''a/}} ('I release, I will release, I released')

===Grassmann's law===
Through [[Grassmann's law]], an aspirated consonant loses its aspiration when followed by another aspirated consonant in the next syllable; this law also affects {{IPA|/h/}} resulting from debuccalization of {{PIE|*s}}; for example:
* PIE {{PIE|*dʰéh₁-}} &gt; {{lang|grc|ἔθην}} {{IPA|/é'''tʰ'''ɛːn/}} ('I placed') ({{sm|aor}})
:: {{PIE|*dʰí-dʰeh₁-}} &gt; {{lang|grc|τίθημι}} {{IPA|/'''t'''í.tʰɛː.mi/}} ('I place') ({{sm|pres}})
:: {{PIE|*dʰé-dʰeh₁-}} &gt; {{lang|grc|τέθηκα}} {{IPA|/'''t'''é.tʰɛː.ka/}} ('I have placed') ({{sm|perf}})
* {{PIE|*tʰrikʰ-s}} &gt; {{wikt-lang|grc|θρίξ}} {{IPA|/'''tʰ'''ríks/}} ('hair') ({{sm|nom sg}})
:: {{PIE|*tʰrikʰ-es}} &gt; {{lang|grc|τρίχες}} {{IPA|/'''t'''rí.kʰes/}} ('hairs') ({{sm|nom. pl}})
* PIE {{PIE|*seǵʰ-s-}} &gt; {{lang|grc|ἕξω}} {{IPA|/'''h'''é.ksɔː/}} ('I will have') ({{sm|fut}})
:: {{PIE|*seǵʰ-}} &gt; {{wikt-lang|grc|ἔχω}}{{IPA|/é.kʰɔː/}} ('I have') ({{sm|pres}})

===Palatalization===
In some cases, the sound {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ττ}}}} {{IPA|/tː/}} in Attic corresponds to the sound {{angbr|{{lang|grc|σσ}}}} {{IPA|/sː/}} in other dialects. These sounds developed from [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of {{lang|grc|κ, χ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0007:smythp=112 §112]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes {{lang|grc|τ}}, {{lang|grc|θ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0007:smythp=114 §114]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|γ}} before the pre-Greek [[semivowel]] {{IPA|/j/}}. This sound was likely pronounced as an affricate {{IPAblink|ts}} or {{IPAblink|tʃ}} earlier in the history of Greek, but inscriptions do not show the spelling {{angbr|{{lang|grc|τσ}}}}, which suggests that an affricate pronunciation did not occur in the Classical period.&lt;ref name="Allen tt ss"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=60, 61|loc=ττ/σσ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* *{{PIE|ēk-yōn}} &gt; {{PIE|*ētsōn}} &gt; {{lang|grc|ἥσσων}}, Attic {{lang|grc|ἥττων}} ('weaker') — compare {{lang|grc|ἦκα}} ('softly')
* PIE {{PIE|*teh₂g-yō}} &gt; {{PIE|*tag-yō}} &gt; {{PIE|*tatsō}} &gt; {{lang|grc|τάσσω}}, Attic {{lang|grc|τάττω}} ('I arrange') — compare {{lang|grc|ταγή}} ('battle line') and Latin ''{{lang|la|tangō}}''
* PIE {{PIE|*glōgʰ-yeh₂}} &gt; {{PIE|*glokh-ya}} &gt; {{PIE|*glōtsa}} &gt; {{lang|grc|γλῶσσα}}, Attic {{lang|grc|γλῶττα}} ('tongue') — compare {{lang|grc|γλωχίν}} ('point')

===Loss of labiovelars===
Mycenaean Greek had three [[labialized velar consonant|labialized velar stops]] {{IPA|/kʷʰ kʷ ɡʷ/}}, aspirated, tenuis, and voiced. These derived from [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Dorsals|PIE labiovelars]] and from sequences of a velar and {{IPA|/w/}}, and were similar to the three regular velars of Ancient Greek {{IPA|/kʰ k ɡ/}}, except with added [[labialization|lip-rounding]]. They were written all using the same symbols in [[Linear B]], and are transcribed as ''q''.&lt;ref name="Sihler velars"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|loc=§154: reflexes of palatals, plain velars, and labiovelars in Greek, Italic, and Germanic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Greek, all labialized velars [[Phonological change#Merger|merged]] with other stops: labials {{IPA|/pʰ p b/}}, dentals {{IPA|/tʰ t d/}}, and velars {{IPA|/kʰ k ɡ/}}. Which one they became depended on dialect and phonological environment. Because of this, certain words that originally had labialized velars have different stops depending on dialect, and certain words from the same root have different stops even in the same Ancient Greek dialect.&lt;ref name="Sihler labiovelars"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=160–164|loc=§161-164 A: examples of reflexes of labiovelar stops in Greek; remarks on them}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*PIE, PGr {{PIE|*kʷis, kʷid}} &gt; Attic {{lang|grc|τίς, τί}}, Thessalian Doric {{lang|grc|κίς, κί}} ('who?, what?')&lt;!-- May be true in all Doric. --&gt; — compare Latin ''{{lang|la|quis, quid}}''
::PIE, PGr {{PIE|*kʷo-yos}} &gt; Attic {{lang|grc|ποῖος}}, Ionic {{lang|grc|κοῖος}} ('what kind?')
*PIE {{PIE|*gʷʰen-yō}} &gt; PGr {{PIE|*kʷʰenyō}} &gt; Attic {{lang|grc|θείνω}} ('I strike')
::{{PIE|*gʷʰón-os}} &gt; PGr {{PIE|*kʷʰónos}} &gt; Attic {{lang|grc|φόνος}} ('slaughtering')
*PIE {{PIE|kʷey(H₁)-}} ('notice') &gt; Mycenaean ''qe-te-o'' ('paid'), Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|τίνω}} ('pay')
:{{lang|grc|τιμή}} ('honor')
:{{lang|grc|ποινή}} ('penalty') &gt; Latin ''poena'')

Near {{IPA|/u uː/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}, the labialized velars had already lost their labialization in the Mycenaean period.&lt;ref name="Sihler velars" /&gt;
*PG {{PIE|*gʷow-kʷolos}} &gt; Mycenaean ''qo-u-ko-ro'', Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|βουκόλος}} ('cowherd')
:Mycenaean ''a-pi-qo-ro'', Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|ἀμφίπολος}} ('attendant')

===Psilosis===
Through ''[[psilosis]]'' ('stripping'),&lt;!-- Smyth doesn't use this term. --&gt; from the term for lack of {{IPA|/h/}} ([[#Terminology|see below]]), the {{IPA|/h/}} was lost even at the beginnings of words. This sound change did not occur in Attic until the Koine period, but occurred in East Ionic and Lesbian Aeolic, and therefore can be seen in certain Homeric forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|loc=§9 D: footnote on loss of rough breathing}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dialects are called ''psilotic''.&lt;ref name="initial s" /&gt;
* Homeric {{lang|grc|ἠέλιος}} {{IPA|/ɛɛ.é.li.os/}}, Attic {{lang|grc|ἥλιος}} {{IPA|/hɛɛ́.li.os/}} '(sun')
* Homeric {{lang|grc|ἠώς}} {{IPA|/ɛɛ.ɔɔ́s/}}, Attic {{lang|grc|ἑώς}} {{IPA|/he(.)ɔɔ́s/}} ('dawn')
* Homeric {{lang|grc|οὖρος}} {{IPA|[óo.ros]}}, Attic {{lang|grc|ὅρος}} {{IPA|/hó.ros/}} ('border')

Even later, during the Koine Greek period, {{IPA|/h/}} disappeared totally from Greek and never reappeared, resulting in Modern Greek not possessing this phoneme at all.

===Spirantization===
The Classical Greek aspirated and voiced stops changed to voiceless and voiced [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] during the period of Koine Greek (spirantization, a form of [[lenition]]).

Spirantization of {{IPA|/tʰ/}} occurred earlier in Laconian Greek. Some examples are transcribed by [[Aristophanes]] and [[Thucydides]], such as {{lang|grc|ναὶ τὼ σιώ}} for {{lang|grc|ναὶ τὼ θεώ}} ('Yes, by the two gods!') and {{lang|grc|παρσένε σιά}} for {{lang|grc|παρθένε θεά}} ("virgin goddess!') (''[[Lysistrata]]'' 142 and 1263), {{lang|grc|σύματος}} for {{lang|grc|θύματος}} ('sacrificial victim') (''[[History of the Peloponnesian War|Histories]]'' book 5, chapter 77).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|parse/nos|παρσένος}}, {{LSJ|sia/|σιά}}, {{LSJ|siw/2|σιώ}}, {{LSJ|su{{=}}ma|σῦμα|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spellings indicate that {{IPA|/tʰ/}} was pronounced as a dental fricative {{IPAblink|θ}} or a sibilant {{IPA|[s]}}, the same change that occurred later in Koine. Greek spelling, however, does not have a letter for a labial or velar fricative, so it is impossible to tell whether {{IPA|/pʰ kʰ/}} also changed to {{IPA|/f x/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|pp=23–26|loc=development of aspirated stops to fricatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensatory lengthening===
In Attic, Ionic, and Doric, vowels were usually lengthened when a following consonant was lost. The syllable before the consonant was originally heavy, but loss of the consonant would cause it to be light. Therefore, the vowel before the consonant was lengthened, so that the syllable would continue to be heavy. This sound change is called compensatory lengthening, because the vowel length compensates for the loss of the consonant. The result of lengthening depended on dialect and time period. The table below shows all possible results:

Wherever the digraphs {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ει ου}}}} correspond to original diphthongs they are called "genuine diphthongs", in all other cases, they are called "[[spurious diphthong]]s".&lt;ref name="Smyth ei ou" /&gt;

===Contraction===
In Attic, some cases of long vowels arose through [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of adjacent short vowels where a consonant had been lost between them. {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ει}}}} {{IPA|/eː/}} came from contraction of {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|εε}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ου}}}} {{IPA|/oː/}} through contraction of {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|εο}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|οε}}}}, or {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|oo}}}}. {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ω}}}} {{IPA|/ɔː/}} arose from {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|αο}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|οα}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|grc|η}}}} {{IPA|/ɛː/}} from {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|εα}}}}, and {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ᾱ}}}} {{IPA|/aː/}} from {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|αε}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|αα}}}}. Contractions involving diphthongs ending in {{IPA|/i̯/}} resulted in the long diphthongs {{IPA|/ɛːi̯ aːi̯ ɔːi̯/}}.

Uncontracted forms are found in other dialects, such as in Ionic.

===Monophthongization===
The diphthongs {{IPA|/ei ou/}} became the long [[monophthong]]s {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} before the Classical period.

===Vowel raising and fronting===
In Archaic Greek, upsilon {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Υ}}}}}} represented the [[close back rounded vowel|back vowel]] {{IPA|/u uː/}}. In Attic and Ionic, this vowel was [[fronting (phonology)|fronted]] around the 6th or 7th century BC. It likely first became [[close central rounded vowel|central]] {{IPA|[ʉ ʉː]}}, and then the [[close front rounded vowel|front]] {{IPA|[y yː]}}.&lt;ref name="Allen u" /&gt;

During the Classical period, {{IPA|/oː/}} was raised to {{IPA|[uː]}}, and thus took up the empty space of the earlier {{IPA|/uː/}} phoneme. The fact that {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|υ}}}} was never confused with {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ου}}}} indicates that {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|υ}}}} was fronted before {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ου}}}} was raised.

In early Koine Greek, {{IPA|/eː/}} was raised and merged with original {{IPA|/iː/}}.

===Attic–Ionic vowel shift===
In Attic and Ionic, the Proto-Greek long {{IPA|/aː/}} shifted to {{IPA|/ɛː/}}. This shift did not happen in the other dialects. Thus, some cases of Attic and Ionic {{lang|grc|η}} correspond to Doric and Aeolic {{lang|grc|ᾱ}}, and other cases correspond to Doric and Aeolic {{lang|grc|η}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§30, 30 D: Attic {{lang|grc|η ᾱ}}; footnote on Doric, Aeolic, and Ionic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Doric and Aeolic {{lang|grc|μᾱ́τηρ}}, Attic and Ionic {{lang|grc|μήτηρ}} {{IPA|[mǎː.tɛːr mɛ̌ːtɛːr]}} ('mother') — compare Latin ''{{lang|la|māter}}''

The vowel first shifted to {{IPA|/æː/}}, at which point it was distinct from Proto-Greek long {{IPA|/eː/}}, and then later {{IPA|/æː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} merged as {{IPA|/ɛː/}}. This is indicated by inscriptions in the [[Cyclades]], which write Proto-Greek {{IPA|/eː/}} as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Ε}}}}}}, but the shifted {{IPA|/æː/}} as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Η}}}}}} and new {{IPA|/aː/}} from compensatory lengthening as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Α}}}}}}.&lt;ref name="Sihler Attic-Ionic" /&gt;

In Attic, both {{IPA|/æː/}} and Proto-Greek {{IPA|/eː/}} were written as {{angbr|{{lang|grc|{{sc|Η}}}}}}, but they merged to {{IPA|/ɛː/}} at the end of the 5th century BC. At this point, nouns in the [[Ancient Greek nouns#Masculine a-stem|masculine first declension]] were confused with [[Ancient Greek nouns#S-stems|third-declension nouns with stems in {{IPA|/es/}}]]. The first-declension nouns had {{IPA|/ɛː/}} resulting from original {{IPA|/aː/}}, while the third-declension nouns had {{IPA|/ɛː/}} resulting from contraction of {{IPA|/ea/}}.&lt;ref name="Sihler Attic-Ionic" /&gt;
* {{lang|grc|Αἰσχίνης}} [[Aeschines]] ({{sm|1st decl}})
: {{lang|grc|Αἰσχίνου}} ({{sm|gen sg}})
:: incorrect {{sm|3rd decl gen sg}} {{lang|grc|Αἰσχίνους}}
: {{lang|grc|Αἰσχίνην}} ({{sm|acc sg}})
* {{lang|grc|Ἰπποκράτης}} [[Hippocrates]] ({{sm|3rd decl}})
: {{lang|grc|Ἱπποκράτους}} ({{sm|gen sg}})
: {{lang|grc|Ἱπποκράτη}} ({{sm|acc sg}})
:: incorrect {{sm|1st decl acc sg}} {{lang|grc|Ἱπποκράτην}}

In addition, words that had original {{lang|grc|η}} in both Attic and Doric were given false Doric forms with {{lang|grc|ᾱ}} in the choral passages of Athenian plays, indicating that Athenians could not distinguish the Attic-Ionic shifted {{lang|grc|ᾱ}} from original Proto-Greek {{lang|grc|η}}.&lt;ref name="Sihler Attic-Ionic" /&gt;
* Attic and Doric {{lang|grc|πηδός}} ('blade of an oar')
: incorrect Doric form {{lang|grc|πᾱδός}}

In Attic, {{IPA|/aː/}} rather than {{IPA|/εː/}} is found immediately after {{IPA|/e i r/}}, except in certain cases where the sound {{lang|grc|ϝ}} {{IPA|/w/}} formerly came between the {{IPA|/e i r/}} and the {{IPA|/aː/}} ([[#Semivowels|see above]]).&lt;ref name="Sihler Attic-Ionic" /&gt;
* Doric {{lang|grc|ᾱ̔μέρᾱ}}, Attic {{lang|grc|ἡμέρᾱ}}, Ionic {{lang|grc|ἡμέρη}} {{IPA|/haː.mé.raː hɛː.mé.raː hɛː.mé.rɛː/}} ('day')
* Attic {{lang|grc|οἵᾱ}}, Ionic {{lang|grc|οἵη}} {{IPA|[hoǰ.jaː hoǰ.jɛː]}} ('such as') ({{sm|fem nom sg}})
* Attic {{lang|grc|νέᾱ}}, Ionic {{lang|grc|νέη}} {{IPA|/né.aː né.ɛː/}} ('new') ({{sm|fem nom sg}}) &lt; {{lang|grc|νέϝος}}
* But Attic {{lang|grc|κόρη}}, Ionic {{lang|grc|κούρη}}, Doric {{lang|grc|κόρᾱ}} and {{lang|grc|κώρᾱ}} ('young girl') &lt; {{lang|grc|κόρϝᾱ}} (as also in Arcadocypriot)

The fact that {{IPA|/aː/}} is found instead of {{IPA|/εː/}} may indicate that earlier, the vowel shifted to {{IPA|/ɛː/}} in all cases, but then shifted back to {{IPA|/aː/}} after {{IPA|/e i r/}} (reversion), or that the vowel never shifted at all in these cases. Sihler says that Attic {{IPA|/aː/}} is from reversion.&lt;ref name="Sihler Attic-Ionic" /&gt;

This shift did not affect cases of long {{IPA|/aː/}} that developed from the contraction of certain sequences of vowels that contain {{lang|grc|α}}. Thus, the vowels {{IPA|/aː/}} and {{IPA|/aːi̯/}} are common in verbs with ''a''-contracted present and imperfect forms, such as {{wikt-lang|grc|ὁράω}} "see". The examples below are shown with the hypothetical original forms from which they were contracted.
* infinitive: {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} {{IPA|/ho.râːn/}} "to see" &lt; {{lang|grc|*ὁράεεν}} {{IPA|/ho.rá.e.en/}}
* third person singular present indicative active: {{lang|grc|ὁρᾷ}} {{IPA|/ho.râːi̯/}} "he sees" &lt; {{lang|grc|*ὁράει}} {{IPA|*/ho.rá.ei/}}
* third person singular imperfect indicative active: {{lang|grc|ὥρᾱ}} {{IPA|/hɔ̌ː.raː/}} "he saw" &lt; {{lang|grc|*ὥραε}} {{IPA|*/hǒː.ra.e/}}

Also unaffected was long {{IPA|/aː/}} that arose by [[#Compensatory lengthening|compensatory lengthening]] of short {{IPA|/a/}}. Thus, Attic and Ionic had a contrast between the feminine genitive singular {{lang|grc|ταύτης}} {{IPA|/taú.tɛːs/}} and feminine accusative plural {{lang|grc|ταύτᾱς}} {{IPA|/taú.taːs/}}, forms of the adjective and pronoun {{lang|grc|οὗτος}} "this, that". The first derived from an original ''*tautās'' with shifting of ''ā'' to ''ē'', the other from ''*tautans'' with compensatory lengthening of ''ans'' to ''ās''.

===Assimilation===
When one consonant comes next to another in verb or noun conjugation or word derivation, various [[sandhi]] rules apply. When these rules affect the forms of nouns and adjectives or of compound words, they are reflected in spelling. Between words, the same rules also applied, but they are not reflected in standard spelling, only in inscriptions.

Rules:
* '''Most basic rule''': When two sounds appear next to each other, the first [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] in voicing and aspiration to the second.
** This applies fully to stops. Fricatives assimilate only in voicing, sonorants do not assimilate.
* Before an {{IPA|/s/}} (future, aorist stem), velars become {{IPA|[k]}}, labials become {{IPA|[p]}}, and dentals disappear.
* Before a {{IPA|/tʰ/}} (aorist passive stem), velars become {{IPA|[kʰ]}}, labials become {{IPA|[pʰ]}}, and dentals become {{IPA|[s]}}.
* Before an {{IPA|/m/}} (perfect middle first-singular, first-plural, participle), velars become {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, nasal+velar becomes {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, labials become {{IPA|[m]}}, dentals become {{IPA|[s]}}, other sonorants remain the same.

The alveolar nasal {{IPA|/n/}} assimilates in [[place of articulation]], changing to a labial or velar nasal before labials or velars:
* {{lang|grc|μ}} {{IPA|[m]}} before the labials {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, {{IPA|/m/}} (and the cluster {{IPA|/ps/}}):
: {{lang|grc|ἐν- + βαίνω &gt; ἐμβαίνω; ἐν- + πάθεια &gt; ἐμπάθεια; ἐν- + φαίνω &gt; ἐμφαίνω; ἐν- + μένω &gt; ἐμμένω; ἐν- + ψυχή + -ος &gt; ἔμψυχος}};
* {{lang|grc|γ}} {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before the velars {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/kʰ/}} (and the cluster {{IPA|/ks/}}):
: {{lang|grc|ἐν- + γίγνομαι &gt; ἐγγίγνομαι; ἐν- + καλέω &gt; ἐγκαλέω; ἐν- + χέω &gt; ἐγχέω; συν- + ξηραίνω &gt; συγξηραίνω}}

When {{IPA|/n/}} precedes {{IPA|/l/}}, the first consonant assimilates to the second, [[gemination]] takes place, and the combination is pronounced {{IPA|[lː]}}, as in {{angbr|{{lang|grc|συλλαμβάνω}}}} from [[underlying representation|underlying]] {{lang|grc|*συνλαμβάνω}}.

The sound of zeta {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ζ}}}} develops from original {{PIE|*sd}} in some cases, and in other cases from {{PIE|*y dy gy}}. In the second case, it was likely first pronounced {{IPAblink|dʒ}} or {{IPAblink|dz}}, and this cluster underwent [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] early in the Ancient Greek period. Metathesis is likely in this case; clusters of a voiced stop and {{IPA|/s/}}, like {{IPA|/bs gs/}}, do not occur in Ancient Greek, since they change to {{IPA|/ps ks/}} by assimilation ([[#Assimilation|see below]]), while clusters with the opposite order, like {{IPA|/sb sɡ/}}, pronounced {{IPA|[zd zɡ]}}, do occur.&lt;ref name="Allen z" /&gt;

==Terminology==
Ancient grammarians, such as Aristotle in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' and [[Dionysius Thrax]] in his [[Art of Grammar]], categorized letters ({{LSJ|gra/mma|γράμματα}}) according to what speech sounds ({{LSJ|stoixei{{=}}on|στοιχεῖα}} 'elements') they represented. They called the letters for vowels {{LSJ|fwnh/eis|φωνήεντα}} ('pronounceable', singular {{lang|grc|φωνῆεν}}); the letters for the nasals, liquids, and {{IPA|/s/}}, and the letters for the consonant clusters {{IPA|/ps ks sd/}}, {{LSJ|h(mi/fwnos|ἡμίφωνα}} ('half-voiced', singular {{lang|grc|ἡμίφωνον}}); and the letters for the stops {{LSJ|a)/fwnos|ἄφωνα}} ('voiceless', singular {{lang|grc|ἄφωνον}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aristotle|loc=1456b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius also called consonants in general {{LSJ|su/mfwnos|σύμφωνα}} ('pronounced with [a vowel]', {{lang|grc|σύμφωνον}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dionysius|loc=§6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the Greek terms for letters or sounds are [[nominalization|nominalized]] adjectives in the [[grammatical gender|neuter gender]], to agree with the neuter nouns {{lang|grc|στοιχεῖον}} and {{lang|grc|γράμμα}}, since they were used to modify the nouns, as in {{lang|grc|φωνῆεν στοιχεῖον}} ('pronounceable element') or {{lang|grc|ἄφωνα γράμματα}} ('unpronounceable letters'). Many also use the root of the [[deverbal noun]] {{LSJ|fwnh/|φωνή}} ('voice, sound').

The words {{lang|grc|φωνῆεν, σύμφωνον, ἡμίφωνον, ἄφωνον}} were [[calque|loan-translated]] into Latin as ''{{lang|la|vōcālis, cōnsōnāns, semivocālis, mūta}}''. The Latin words are feminine because the Latin noun ''{{lang|la|littera}}'' ('letter') is feminine. They were later [[loanword|borrowed]] into English as ''vowel'', ''consonant'', ''semivowel'', ''mute''.

The categories of vowel letters were {{lang|grc|δίχρονα, βραχέα, μακρά}} ('two-time, short, long'). These adjectives describe whether the vowel letters represented both long and short vowels, only short vowels or only long vowels. Additionally, vowels that ordinarily functioned as the first and second elements of diphthongs were called {{lang|grc|προτακτικά}} ('prefixable') and {{lang|grc|ὑποτακτικά}} ('suffixable'). The category of {{lang|grc|δίφθογγοι}} included both diphthongs and the [[spurious diphthong]]s {{lang|grc|ει ου}}, which were pronounced as long vowels in the Classical period.

The categories {{lang|grc|ἡμίφωνα}} and {{lang|grc|ἄφωνα}} roughly correspond to the modern terms ''continuant''&lt;!-- Allen says so unreservedly, but "continuant" does not include nasals in modern phonological theory: see Distinctive feature. --&gt; and ''stop''. Greek grammarians placed the letters {{angbr|{{lang|grc|β δ γ φ θ χ}}}} in the category of stops, not of continuants, indicating that they represented stops in Ancient Greek, rather than fricatives, as in Modern Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1987|p=19|loc=Ancient Greek terminology for consonants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stops were divided into three categories using the adjectives {{lang|grc|δασέα}} ('thick'), {{lang|grc|ψιλά}} ('thin'), and {{lang|grc|μέσα}} ('middle'), as shown in the table below. The first two terms indicate a [[binary opposition]] typical of Greek thought: they referred to stops with and without [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]]. The voiced stops did not fit in either category and so they were called "middle". The concepts of [[voice (phonetics)|voice]] and [[voicelessness]] (presence or absence of vibration of the [[vocal folds]]) were unknown to the Greeks and were not developed in the Western grammatical tradition until the 19th century, when the [[Shiksha|Sanskrit grammatical tradition]] began to be studied by Westerners.&lt;ref name="Allen voiced plosives" /&gt;

The glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}} was originally called {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα}} ('breath'), and it was classified as a {{lang|grc|προσῳδία}}, the category to which the acute, grave, and circumflex accents also belong. Later, a diacritic for the sound was created, and it was called [[pleonasm|pleonastically]] {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα δασύ}} ('rough breathing'). Finally, a diacritic representing the absence of {{IPA|/h/}} was created, and it was called {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα ψιλόν}} ('smooth breathing').&lt;ref name="Allen h" /&gt; The diacritics were also called {{lang|grc|προσῳδία δασεῖα}} and {{lang|grc|προσῳδία ψιλή}} ('thick accent' and 'thin accent'), from which come the Modern Greek nouns {{lang|el|δασεία}} and {{lang|el|ψιλή}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Reconstruction==
The above information is based on a large body of evidence which was discussed extensively by linguists and philologists of the 19th and 20th centuries. The following section provides a short summary of the kinds of evidence and arguments that have been used in this debate, and gives some hints as to the sources of uncertainty that still prevails with respect to some details.

===Internal evidence===

====Evidence from spelling====
Whenever a new set of written symbols, such as an alphabet, is created for a language, the written symbols typically correspond to the spoken sounds, and the spelling or orthography is therefore [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] or ''[[orthographic depth|transparent]]'': it is easy to pronounce a word by seeing how it is spelled, and conversely to spell a word by knowing how it is pronounced. Until the pronunciation of the language changes, spelling mistakes do not occur, since spelling and pronunciation match each other.

When the pronunciation changes, there are two options. The first is [[spelling reform]]: the spelling of words is changed to reflect the new pronunciation. In this case, the date of a spelling reform generally indicates the approximate time when the pronunciation changed.

The second option is that the spelling remains the same, while the pronunciation changes. In this case, the spelling system is called ''conservative'' or ''historical'', since it reflects the pronunciation at an earlier period in the language. It is also called ''opaque'', because there is not a simple correspondence between written symbols and spoken sounds: it is more difficult to pronounce a word by seeing its spelling, and conversely to spell a word by knowing how to pronounce it.

In a language with a historical spelling system, spelling mistakes indicate change in pronunciation. Writers with incomplete knowledge of the spelling system will misspell words, and in general their misspellings reflect the way they pronounced the words.

* If scribes very often confuse two letters, this implies that the sounds denoted by the two letters were the same: that the sounds have merged. This happened early with {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ι ει}}}}. A little later, it happened with {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|υ οι}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ο ω}}}}, and {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ε αι}}}}. Later still, {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|η}}}} was confused with the already merged {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ι ει}}}}.
* If scribes omit a letter where it would usually be written, or insert it where it does not belong ([[hypercorrection]]), this implies that the sound that the letter represented had been lost in speech. This happened early with word-initial rough breathing ({{IPA|/h/}}) in most forms of Greek. Another example is the occasional omission of the iota subscript of long diphthongs (see above).

Spelling mistakes provide limited evidence: they only indicate the pronunciation of the scribe who made the spelling mistake, not the pronunciation of all speakers of the language at the time. Ancient Greek was a language with many regional variants and social registers. Many of the pronunciation changes of Koine Greek probably occurred earlier in some regional pronunciations and [[sociolect]]s of Attic even in the Classical Age, but the older pronunciations were preserved in more learned speech.

====Onomatopoeic words====
Greek literature sometimes contains representations of animal cries in Greek letters. The most often quoted example is {{lang|grc|βῆ βῆ}}, used to render the cry of sheep, and is used as evidence that beta had a voiced bilabial plosive pronunciation and eta was a long open-mid front vowel. [[Onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeic]] verbs such as {{lang|grc|μυκάομαι}} for the lowing of cattle (cf. Latin ''{{lang|la|mugire}}''), {{lang|grc|βρυχάομαι}} for the roaring of lions (cf. Latin ''{{lang|la|rugire}}'') and {{lang|grc|κόκκυξ}} as the name of the cuckoo (cf. Latin ''{{lang|la|cuculus}}'') suggest an archaic {{IPA|[uː]}} pronunciation of long upsilon, before this vowel was fronted to {{IPA|[yː]}}.

====Morpho-phonological facts====
Sounds undergo regular changes, such as assimilation or dissimilation, in certain environments within words, which are sometimes indicated in writing. These can be used to reconstruct the nature of the sounds involved.
* &lt;{{lang|grc|π,τ,κ}}&gt; at the end of some words are regularly changed to &lt;{{lang|grc|φ,θ,χ}}&gt; when preceding a rough breathing in the next word. Thus, e.g.: {{lang|grc|ἐφ' ἁλός}} for {{lang|grc|ἐπὶ ἁλός}} or {{lang|grc|καθ' ἡμᾶς}} for {{lang|grc|κατὰ ἡμᾶς}}.
* &lt;{{lang|grc|π,τ,κ}}&gt; at the end of the first member of composite words are regularly changed to &lt;{{lang|grc|φ,θ,χ}}&gt; when preceding a ''spiritus asper'' in the next member of the composite word. Thus e.g.: {{lang|grc|ἔφιππος, καθάπτω}}
* The Attic dialect in particular is marked by contractions: two vowels without an intervening consonant were merged in a single syllable; for instance uncontracted (disyllabic) {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|εα}}}} ({{IPA|[e.a]}}) occurs regularly in dialects but contracts to {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|η}}}} in Attic, supporting the view that {{lang|grc|η}} was pronounced {{IPA|[ɛː]}} (intermediate between {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[a]}}) rather than {{IPA|[i]}} as in Modern Greek. Similarly, uncontracted {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|εε}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|οο}}}} ({{IPA|[e.e], [o.o]}}) occur regularly in Ionic but contract to {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ει}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ου}}}} in Attic, suggesting {{IPA|[eː], [oː]}} values for the spurious diphthongs {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ει}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ου}}}} in Attic as opposed to the [i] and [u] sounds they later acquired.

====Non-standard spellings====
Morphophonological alternations like the above are often treated differently in non-standard spellings than in standardised literary spelling. This may lead to doubts about the representativeness of the literary dialect and may in some cases force slightly different reconstructions than if one were only to take the literary texts of the high standard language into account. Thus, e.g.:

*non-standard epigraphical spelling sometimes indicates assimilation of final {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|κ}}}} to {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|γ}}}} before voiced consonants in a following word, or of final {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|κ}}}} to {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|χ}}}} before aspirated sounds, in words like {{lang|grc|ἐκ}}.

====Metrical evidence====
The metres used in Classical Greek poetry are based on the patterns of light and heavy syllables, and can thus sometimes provide evidence as to the length of vowels where this is not evident from the orthography. By the 4th century AD poetry was normally written using stress-based metres, suggesting that the distinctions between long and short vowels had been lost by then, and the pitch accent had been replaced by a stress accent.

===External evidence===

====Orthoepic descriptions====
Some ancient grammarians attempt to give systematic descriptions of the sounds of the language. In other authors one can sometimes find occasional remarks about correct pronunciation of certain sounds. However, both types of evidence are often difficult to interpret, because the phonetic terminology of the time was often vague, and it is often not clear in what relation the described forms of the language stand to those which were actually spoken by different groups of the population.

Important ancient authors include:

* [[Dionysius Thrax]]
* [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]
* [[Aelius Herodianus]]

====Cross-dialectal comparison====
Sometimes the comparison of standard Attic Greek with the written forms of other [[Ancient Greek dialects|Greek dialects]], or the humorous renderings of dialectal speech in Attic theatrical works, can provide hints as to the phonetic value of certain spellings. An example of this treatment with Spartan Greek is given [[#Fricatives|above]].

====Loanwords====
The spelling of Greek [[loanword]]s in other languages and [[vice versa]] can provide important hints about pronunciation. However, the evidence is often difficult to interpret or indecisive. The sounds of loanwords are often not taken over identically into the receiving language. Where the receiving language lacks a sound that corresponds exactly to that of the source language, sounds are usually mapped to some other, similar sound.

In this regard, Latin is of great value to the reconstruction of ancient Greek phonology because of its close proximity to the Greek world which caused numerous Greek words to be borrowed by the Romans. At first, Greek loanwords denoting technical terms or proper names which contained the letter {{lang|grc|Φ}} were imported in Latin with the spelling ''{{lang|la|P}}'' or ''{{lang|la|PH}}'', indicating an effort to imitate, albeit imperfectly, a sound that Latin lacked. Later on, in the 1st centuries AD, spellings with ''{{lang|la|F}}'' start to appear in such loanwords, signaling the onset of the fricative pronunciation of {{lang|grc|Φ}}. Thus, in the 2nd century AD, ''{{lang|la|Filippus}}'' replaces ''{{lang|la|P(h)ilippus}}''. At about the same time, the letter ''{{lang|la|F}}'' also begins to be used as a substitute for the letter {{lang|grc|Θ}}, for lack of a better choice, indicating that the sound of Greek theta had become a fricative as well.

For the purpose of borrowing certain other Greek words, the Romans added the letters ''{{lang|la|Y}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Z}}'' to the Latin alphabet, taken directly from the Greek one. These additions are important as they show that the Romans had no symbols to represent the sounds of the letters {{lang|grc|Υ}} and {{lang|grc|Ζ}} in Greek, which means that in these cases no known sound of Latin can be used to reconstruct the Greek sounds.

Latin often wrote {{angbr|{{lang|la|i u}}}} for Greek {{angbr|{{lang|grc|ε ο}}}}. This can be explained by the fact that Latin {{IPA|/i u/}} were pronounced as near-close {{IPA|[ɪ ʊ]}}, and therefore were as similar to the Ancient Greek mid vowels {{IPA|/e o/}} as to the Ancient Greek close vowels {{IPA|/i u/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen short mid" /&gt;
*{{lang|grc|Φιλουμένη}} &gt; ''{{lang|la|Philumina}}''
*{{lang|grc|ἐμπόριον}} &gt; ''{{lang|la|empurium}}''

Sanskrit, Persian, and Armenian also provide evidence.

The quality of short {{IPA|/a/}} is shown by some transcriptions between Ancient Greek and Sanskrit. Greek short {{IPA|/a/}} was transcribed with Sanskrit long {{transl|sa|IAST|ā}}, not with Sanskrit short {{transl|sa|IAST|a}}, which had a closer pronunciation: {{IPA|[ə]}}. Conversely, Sanskrit short {{transl|sa|IAST|a}} was transcribed with Greek {{lang|grc|ε}}.&lt;ref name="Allen a" /&gt;
* Gr {{lang|grc|ἀπόκλιμα}} {{IPA|[apóklima]}} &gt; Skt {{transl|sa|IAST|āpoklima-}} {{IPA|[aːpoːklimə]}} (an [[astrology|astrological]] term)
* Skt {{transl|sa|IAST|brāhmaṇa-}} {{IPA|[bɽaːɦməɳə]}} &gt; Gr {{lang|grc|{{sc|ΒΡΑΜΕΝΑΙ}}}}

====Comparison with older alphabets====
The Greek alphabet developed from the older [[Phoenician alphabet]]. It may be assumed that the Greeks tended to assign to each Phoenician letter that Greek sound which most closely resembled the Phoenician sound. But, as with loanwords, the interpretation is not straightforward.

====Comparison with younger/derived alphabets====
The Greek alphabet was in turn the basis of other alphabets, notably the [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]] and [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] and later the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. Similar arguments can be derived in these cases as in the Phoenician-Greek case.

For example, in Cyrillic, the letter [[ve (Cyrillic)|{{script|Cyrs|В}}]] (''ve'') stands for {{IPA|[v]}}, confirming that beta was pronounced as a fricative by the 9th century AD, while the new letter [[be (Cyrillic)|{{script|Cyrs|Б}}]] (''be'') was invented to note the sound {{IPA|[b]}}. Conversely, in Gothic, the letter derived from beta stands for {{IPA|[b]}}, so in the 4th century AD, beta may have still been a plosive in Greek although according to evidence from the Greek papyri of Egypt, beta as a stop had been generally replaced by beta as a voiced bilabial fricative {{IPA|[β]}} by the first century AD.

====Comparison with Modern Greek====
Any reconstruction of Ancient Greek needs to take into account how the sounds later developed towards Modern Greek, and how these changes could have occurred. In general, the changes between the reconstructed Ancient Greek and Modern Greek are assumed to be unproblematic in this respect by historical linguists, because all the relevant changes ([[spirantization]], chain-shifts of long vowels towards {{IPA|[i]}}, loss of initial {{IPA|[h]}}, restructuring of vowel-length and accentuation systems, etc.) are of types that are cross-linguistically frequently attested and relatively easy to explain.

====Comparative reconstruction of Indo-European====
Systematic relationships between sounds in Greek and sounds in other Indo-European languages are taken as strong evidence for reconstruction by historical linguists, because such relationships indicate that these sounds may go back to an inherited sound in the proto-language.

==History of the reconstruction of ancient pronunciation==

===The Renaissance===
Until the 15th century (during the time of the Byzantine Greek Empire) ancient Greek texts were pronounced exactly like contemporary Greek when they were read aloud. From about 1486, various scholars (notably [[Antonio of Lebrixa]], [[Girolamo Aleandro]], and [[Aldus Manutius]]) judged that this pronunciation appeared to be inconsistent with the descriptions handed down by ancient grammarians, and suggested alternative pronunciations.

[[Johann Reuchlin]], the leading Greek scholar in the West around 1500, had taken his Greek learning from Byzantine émigré scholars, and continued to use the modern pronunciation.&lt;!-- need to check up on attribution of Reuchlin source --&gt; This pronunciation system was called into question by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466–1536) who in 1528 published ''{{lang|la|De recta Latini Graecique sermonis pronuntiatione dialogus}}'', a philological treatise clothed in the form of a philosophical dialogue, in which he developed the idea of a historical reconstruction of ancient Latin and Greek pronunciation. The two models of pronunciation became soon known, after their principal proponents, as the "[[Reuchlinian pronunciation|Reuchlinian]]" and the "[[Erasmian pronunciation|Erasmian]]" system, or, after the characteristic vowel pronunciations, as the "[[Iotacism|iotacist]]" (or "itacist" ) and the "etacist" system, respectively.

Erasmus' reconstruction was based on a wide range of arguments, derived from the philological knowledge available at his time. In the main, he strove for a more regular correspondence of letters to sounds, assuming that different letters must have stood for different sounds, and same letters for same sounds. That led him, for instance, to posit that the various letters which in the iotacist system all denoted {{IPA|[i]}} must have had different values, and that {{lang|grc|ει}}, {{lang|grc|αι}}, {{lang|grc|οι}}, {{lang|grc|ευ}}, {{lang|grc|αυ}}, {{lang|grc|ου}} were all diphthongs with a closing offglide. He also insisted on taking the accounts of ancient grammarians literally, for instance where they described vowels as being distinctively long and short, or the acute and circumflex accents as being clearly distinguished by pitch contours. In addition, he drew on evidence from word correspondences between Greek and Latin as well as some other European languages. Some of his arguments in this direction are, in hindsight, mistaken, because he naturally lacked much of the knowledge developed through later linguistic work. Thus, he could not distinguish between Latin-Greek word relations based on loans (e.g. {{lang|grc|Φοῖβος}} — ''{{lang|la|Phoebus}}'') on the one hand, and those based on common descent from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (e.g. {{lang|grc|φῶρ}} — ''{{lang|la|fūr}}'') on the other. He also fell victim to a few spurious relations due to mere accidental similarity (e.g. Greek {{lang|grc|θύειν}} 'to sacrifice' — French ''{{lang|fr|tuer}}'', 'to kill'). In other areas, his arguments are of quite the same kind as those used by modern linguistics, e.g. where he argues on the basis of cross-dialectal correspondences within Greek that {{lang|grc|η}} must have been a rather open ''e''-sound, close to {{IPA|[a]}}.

Erasmus also took great pains to assign to the members in his reconstructed system plausible phonetic values. This was no easy task, as contemporary grammatical theory lacked the rich and precise terminology to describe such values. In order to overcome that problem, Erasmus drew upon his knowledge of the sound repertoires of contemporary living languages, for instance likening his reconstructed {{lang|grc|η}} to Scots ''a'' ({{IPA|[æ]}}), his reconstructed {{lang|grc|ου}} to Dutch ''{{lang|nl|ou}}'' ({{IPA|[oʊ]}}), and his reconstructed {{lang|grc|οι}} to French ''{{lang|fr|oi}}'' (at that time pronounced {{IPA|[oɪ]}}).

Erasmus assigned to the Greek consonant letters {{lang|grc|β}}, {{lang|grc|γ}}, {{lang|grc|δ}} the sounds of voiced plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, while for the consonant letters {{lang|grc|φ}}, {{lang|grc|θ}}, and {{lang|grc|χ}} he advocated the use of fricatives {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}} as in Modern Greek (arguing, however, that this type of {{IPA|/f/}} must have been different from that denoted by Latin {{angle bracket|f}}).

The reception of Erasmus' idea among his contemporaries was mixed. Most prominent among those scholars who resisted his move was [[Philipp Melanchthon]], a student of Reuchlin's. Debate in humanist circles continued up into the 17th century, but the situation remained undecided for several centuries. (See [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching]].)

===The 19th century===
A renewed interest in the issues of reconstructed pronunciation arose during the 19th century. On the one hand, the new science of [[historical linguistics]], based on the method of comparative reconstruction, took a vivid interest in Greek. It soon established beyond any doubt that Greek was descended in parallel with many other languages from the common source of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] proto-language. This had important consequences for how its phonological system must be reconstructed. At the same time, continued work in philology and archeology was bringing to light an ever-growing corpus of non-standard, non-literary and non-classical Greek writings, e.g. inscriptions and later also papyri. These added considerably to what could be known about the development of the language. On the other hand, there was a revival of academic life in Greece after the [[Greek War of Independence|establishment of the Greek state]] in 1830, and scholars in Greece were at first reluctant to accept the seemingly foreign idea that Greek should have been pronounced so differently from what they knew.

Comparative linguistics led to a picture of ancient Greek that more or less corroborated Erasmus' view, though with some modifications. It soon became clear, for instance, that the pattern of long and short vowels observed in Greek was mirrored in similar oppositions in other languages and thus had to be a common inheritance (see [[apophony|Ablaut]]); that Greek {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|υ}}}} had to have been {{IPA|[u]}} at some stage because it regularly corresponded to {{IPA|[u]}} in all other Indo-European languages (cf. Gr. {{lang|grc|μῦς}} : Lat. ''{{lang|la|mūs}}''); that many instances of {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|η}}}} had earlier been {{IPA|[aː]}} (cf. Gr. {{lang|grc|μήτηρ}} : Lat. ''{{lang|la|māter}}''); that Greek {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ου}}}} sometimes stood in words that had been lengthened from {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ο}}}} and therefore must have been pronounced {{IPA|[oː]}} at some stage (the same holds analogically for {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ε}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ει}}}}, which must have been {{IPA|[eː]}}), and so on. For the consonants, historical linguistics established the originally plosive nature of both the aspirates {{angbr|{{lang|grc|φ,θ,χ}}}} {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}} and the mediae {{angbr|{{lang|grc|β, δ, γ}}}} {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ]}}, which were recognised to be a direct continuation of similar sounds in Indo-European (reconstructed {{PIE|*bʰ, *dʰ, *gʰ}} and {{PIE|*b, *d, *g}}). It was also recognised that the word-initial ''spiritus asper'' was most often a reflex of earlier {{PIE|*s}} (cf. Gr. {{lang|grc|ἑπτά}} : Lat. ''{{lang|la|septem}}''), which was believed to have been weakened to {{IPA|[h]}} in pronunciation. Work was also done reconstructing the linguistic background to the rules of ancient Greek versification, especially in Homer, which shed important light on the phonology regarding syllable structure and accent. Scholars also described and explained the regularities in the development of consonants and vowels under processes of assimilation, reduplication, compensatory lengthening etc.

While comparative linguistics could in this way firmly establish that a certain source state, roughly along the Erasmian model, had once obtained, and that significant changes had to have occurred later, during the development towards Modern Greek, the comparative method had less to say about the question ''when'' these changes took place. Erasmus had been eager to find a pronunciation system that corresponded most closely to the written letters, and it was now natural to assume that the reconstructed sound system was that which obtained at the time when Greek orthography was in its formative period. For a time, it was taken for granted that this would also have been the pronunciation valid for all the period of classical literature. However, it was perfectly possible that the pronunciation of the living language had begun to move on from that reconstructed system towards that of Modern Greek, possibly already quite early during antiquity.

In this context, the freshly emerging evidence from the non-standard inscriptions became of decisive importance. Critics of the Erasmian reconstruction drew attention to the systematic patterns of spelling mistakes made by scribes. These mistakes showed that scribes had trouble distinguishing between the orthographically correct spellings for certain words, for instance involving {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ι}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|η}}}}, and {{angle bracket|{{lang|grc|ει}}}}. This provided evidence that these vowels had already begun to merge in the living speech of the period. While some scholars in Greece were quick to emphasise these findings in order to cast doubt on the Erasmian system as a whole, some western European scholars tended to downplay them, explaining early instances of such orthographical aberrations as either isolated exceptions or influences from non-Attic, non-standard dialects. The resulting debate, as it was conducted during the 19th century, finds its expression in, for instance, the works of {{Harvtxt|Jannaris|1897}} and {{Harvtxt|Papadimitrakopoulos|1889}} on the anti-Erasmian side, and of [[Friedrich Blass]] (1870) on the pro-Erasmian side.

It was not until the early 20th century and the work of G. Chatzidakis, a linguist often credited with having first introduced the methods of modern historical linguistics into the Greek academic establishment, that the validity of the comparative method and its reconstructions for Greek began to be widely accepted among Greek scholars too. The international consensus view that had been reached by the early and mid-20th century is represented in the works of {{Harvtxt|Sturtevant|1940}} and {{Harvtxt|Allen|1987}}.

===More recent developments===
Since the 1970s and 1980s, several scholars have attempted a systematic re-evaluation of the inscriptional and papyrological evidence (Smith 1972, Teodorsson 1974, 1977, 1978; Gignac 1976; Threatte 1980, summary in Horrocks 1999). According to their results, many of the relevant phonological changes can be dated fairly early, reaching well into the classical period, and the period of the Koiné can be characterised as one of very rapid phonological change. Many of the changes in vowel quality are now dated to some time between the 5th and the 1st centuries BC, while those in the consonants are assumed to have been completed by the 4th century AD. However, there is still considerable debate over precise dating, and it is still not clear to what degree, and for how long, different pronunciation systems would have persisted side by side within the Greek speech community. The resulting majority view today is that a phonological system roughly along Erasmian lines can still be assumed to have been valid for the period of classical Attic literature, but biblical and other post-classical [[Koine Greek]] is likely to have been spoken with a pronunciation that already approached that of Modern Greek in many crucial respects.

Recently, there has been one attempt at a more radically revisionist, anti-Erasmian reconstruction, proposed by the theologian and philologist Chrys Caragounis, Professor Emeritus at [[Lund University]] (1995, 2004). On the basis of the inscriptional record, Caragounis dates virtually all relevant vowel changes into or before the early classical period. He relies heavily upon Threatte and Gignac for data from the papyri, but he provides little if any actual interaction with their own markedly different analyses of the very same historical data. He also argues for a very early fricative status of the aspirate and medial consonants, and casts doubt on the validity of the vowel-length and accent distinctions in the spoken language in general. These views are currently isolated within the field.

All speech consists of these categories: element [letter], syllable, conjunction, noun, verb, inflection, phrase.

A '''letter''' is an indivisible sound — not any sound, but a sound from which a compound sound [syllable] can naturally be made, since the sounds of animals are also indivisible, and I call none of them a letter. The categories of sound are sounding [vowels], half-sounding [semivowels: fricatives and sonorants], and unsounded [silent or mute: stop].

These categories are the '''vowel''', which has audible sound but no contact [between lips or between tongue and the inside of the mouth]; the '''semivowel''', which has audible sound and contact (for example ''s'' and ''r''); and the '''mute''', which has contact and no sound by itself, becoming audible only with [letters] that have a sound (for example ''g'' and ''d'').

[Letters] differ in the shape of the mouth and place [in the mouth], in '''thickness''' and '''thinness''' [aspiration and unaspiration], in length and shortness — and still more in '''sharpness''' and '''depth''' and '''middle''' [high and low pitch, and pitch between the two]: but theorizing about these things in detail is the job of those who study [poetic] meter.

There are 24 '''letters''', from ''a'' to ''ō''.... Letters are also called elements [of speech] because they have an order and classification.

Of these, seven are vowels: ''a, e, ē, i, o, y, ō''. They are called '''vowels''' because they form a complete sound by themselves.

Two of the vowels are '''long''' (''ē'' and ''ō''), two are '''short''' (''e'' and ''o''), and three are two-timed (''a i y''). They are called '''two-timed''' since they can be lengthened and shortened.

Five are prefixable vowels: ''a, e, ē, o, ō''. They are called '''prefixable''' because they form a complete syllable when prefixed before ''i'' and ''y'': for instance, ''ai au''. Two are '''suffixable''': ''i'' and ''y''. And ''y'' is sometimes prefixable before ''i'', as in ''myia'' and ''harpyia''.

Six are '''diphthongs''': ''ai au ei eu oi ou''.

The remaining seventeen letters are consonants [pronounced-with]: ''b, g, d, z, th, k, l, m, n, x, p, r, s, t, ph, kh, ps''. They are called '''consonants''' because they do not have a sound on their own, but they form a complete sound when arranged with vowels.

Of these, eight are semivowels: ''z, x, ps, l, m, n, r, s''. They are called '''semivowels''', because, though a little weaker than the vowels, they still sound pleasant in hummings and hissings.

Nine are mutes: ''b, g, d, k, p, t, th, ph, kh''. They are called '''mute''', because, more than the others, they sound bad, just as we call a performer of tragedy who sounds bad ''voiceless''. Three of these are '''thin''' (''k, p, t''), three are '''thick''' (''th, ph, kh''), and three of them are middle [intermediate] (''b, g, d''). They are called '''middle''', because they are thicker than the thin [mutes], but thinner than the thick [mutes]. And ''b'' is [the mute] between ''p'' and ''ph'', ''g'' between ''k'' and ''kh'', and ''d'' between ''th'' and ''t''.

The thick [mutes] alternate with the thin ones, ''ph'' with ''p'', as in [an example from the Odyssey]; ''kh'' with ''k'': [another example from the Odyssey]; ''th'' with ''t'': [an example from the Iliad].

In addition, three consonants are double: ''z, x, ps''. They are called '''double''' because each one of them is made up of two consonants: ''z'' from ''s'' and ''d'', ''x'' from ''k'' and ''s'', and ''ps'' from ''p'' and ''s''.

There are four unchangeable [consonants]: ''l, m, n, r''. They are called unchangeable because they do not change in the future [tense]s of verbs and in the declensions of nouns. They are also called '''liquids'''.

The '''Austronesian peoples''', or more accurately '''Austronesian-speaking peoples'''&lt;ref&gt;According to the anthropologist [[Wilhelm Solheim II]]: "I emphasize again, as I have done in many other articles, that 'Austronesian' is a linguistic term and is the name of a super language family. It should never be used as a name for a people, genetically speaking, or a culture. To refer to people who speak an Austronesian language the phrase 'Austronesian-speaking people' should be used." Origins of the Filipinos and Their Languages. (January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;, are a group of various peoples in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Oceania]] and [[East Africa]] that speak [[Austronesian languages]].

They include [[Taiwanese aborigines]], the majority of ethnic groups in the [[Philippines]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Madagascar]], as well as the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] of [[Malay Singaporeans|Singapore]], the [[Polynesians]] of [[Māori people|New Zealand]] and [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaii]], the non-[[Papuan people]]s of [[Melanesia]]. All of these peoples can be connected through the Austronesian language family. They are also found in the regions of [[Southern Thailand]], the [[Cham people|Cham]] areas in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], and the [[Hainan]] island province of China, parts of [[Sri Lanka]], southern [[Myanmar]], the southern tip of [[South Africa]], [[Suriname]], and some of the [[Andaman Islands]]. On top of that, modern-era migration brought Austronesian-speaking people to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Mauritius]], as well as the [[West Asia|West Asian countries]]. Ethnic [[Maldivians]] also possess a genetic connection to  the Austronesian-speaking groups of [[Maritime Southeast Asia|maritime Southeast Asia]] via gene flow from the [[Malay Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Maloney|first= C. |title= People of the Maldive Islands|publisher= Orient Longman Ltd, Madras |year= 1980 |isbn= 0-86131-158-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Duckworth|first= Wynfrid L.H. |title=n the Anthropometric Data collected by Professor John Stanley Gardiner, F.R.S., in the Maldive Islands and Minicoy|publisher= [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]]|year= 1914|quote=There were three major sources of immigration into the country. These are... the western shores of the Malay Peninsula, and the islands of the Malaya  Archipelago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nations and territories predominantly populated by Austronesian-speaking peoples are known collectively as [[Austronesia]].

Archaeological evidence demonstrates a technological connection between the farming cultures of the "south", meaning [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Melanesia]], and sites that are first known from [[mainland China]]; whereas a combination of archaeological and linguistic evidence has been interpreted as supporting a "northern" origin for the [[Austronesian language family]] in mainland [[southern China]] and [[Taiwan]].

It is theoretically possible that a few thousand years before the [[southward expansion of the Han dynasty]] that Austronesian speakers spread down the coast of southern China past Taiwan as far as the Gulf of Tonkin. In time, the spread of other language groups such as [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] (such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) led to the assimilation and eventual [[sinicization]] of all (proto) Austronesian-speaking populations that remained on the mainland (a process which continues today in Taiwan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, Volume 86, Part 5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XiELAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=in+the+southward+spread+of+Han+Chinese+led+to+the+sinicization+of+all+AN-speakers#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20southward%20spread%20of%20Han%20Chinese%20led%20to%20the%20sinicization%20of%20all%20AN-speakers&amp;f=false|isbn= 9780871698650|author1= Goodenough|first1= Ward Hunt|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent treatment, all Austronesian languages were classified into 10 subfamilies, with all the extra-Formosan languages grouped in one subfamily and with representatives of the remaining nine known only in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Blust1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Blust R |chapter=Subgrouping, circularity and extinction: some issues in Austronesian comparative linguistics |editor=Zeitoun E |editor2=Jen-kuei Li, P |title=Selected papers from the Eighth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics |publisher=Academia Sinica |location=Taipei |year=1999 |isbn=9576716322 |pages=31–94 |oclc=58527039}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that these patterns are best explained by dispersal of an agricultural people from Taiwan into insular Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and, ultimately, the remote [[Pacific]].

Genetic analyses suggest that the Southeast Asian Austronesians had spread over [[Sundaland]] (the land mass of Southeastern Asia before rising sea-level created the archipelago of Southeast Asia) and evolved ''in situ'' over the last 35,000 years.&lt;ref name=Soares09 /&gt; Nevertheless, in 2016, DNA analysis carried out found that one of the genetic markers used in the study but not the others supports a small-scale "out-of-Taiwan" hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Soares2016"/&gt; The studies suggest that only a small fraction of the Taiwan genetic lineages are found among the people of South East Asia, and it is argued that these movements of people from Taiwan, while smaller in scale, had a strong impact on the culture and language of the people.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160128122004.htm|title=New research into the origins of the Austronesian languages: Complex genetic data now confirms that Mitochondrial DNA found in Pacific islanders was present in Island Southeast Asia at a much earlier period|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melton|first=T.|last2=Clifford|first2=S.|last3=Martinson|first3=J.|last4=Batzer|first4=M.|last5=Stoneking|first5=M.|date=December 1998|title=Genetic evidence for the proto-Austronesian homeland in Asia: mtDNA and nuclear DNA variation in Taiwanese aboriginal tribes|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1807–1823|doi=10.1086/302131|issn=0002-9297|pmc=1377653|pmid=9837834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newhistorian.com/5879-2/5879/|title=DNA Analysis Gives Insight into Austronesian Languages|date=2016-02-01|work=New Historian|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration and dispersion===

{{further|Austronesian languages#History}}

Genomic analysis of cultivated coconut (''[[Cocos nucifera]]'') has shed light on the movements of Austronesian peoples. By examining 10 microsatelite loci, researchers found that there are 2 genetically distinct subpopulations of coconut – one originating in the Indian Ocean, the other in the Pacific Ocean. However, there is evidence of [[Genetic admixture|admixture]], the transfer of genetic material, between the two populations. Given that coconuts are ideally suited for ocean dispersal, it seems possible that individuals from one population could have floated to the other. However, the locations of the admixture events are limited to [[Madagascar]] and coastal east Africa and exclude the [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritius]]. Sailing west from Maritime Southeast Asia in the Indian Ocean, the Austronesian peoples reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 CE, and reached other parts thereafter. This forms a pattern that coincides with the known trade routes of Austronesian sailors. Additionally, there is a genetically distinct sub-population of coconuts on the eastern coast of South America which has undergone a genetic bottleneck resulting from a founder effect; however, its ancestral population is the pacific coconut, which suggests that Austronesian peoples may have sailed as far east as the Americas.&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Bee|author2=Luc Baudouin |author3=Kenneth M.

An element in the ancestry of Austronesian-speaking peoples, the one which carried their ancestral language, originated on the island of [[Taiwan]].

Based on recent archaeological evidence as well as linguistic evidence, [[Roger Blench]] (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2014. ''[https://www.academia.edu/9261653/Suppose_we_are_wrong_about_the_Austronesian_settlement_of_Taiwan Suppose we are wrong about the Austronesian settlement of Taiwan?]'' m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Austronesians in Taiwan to have been a [[melting pot]] of immigrants from various parts of the coast of eastern China that had been migrating to Taiwan by 4,000 B.P. These immigrants included people from the [[foxtail millet]]-cultivating [[Longshan culture]] of [[Shandong]] (with Longshan-type cultures found in southern Taiwan), the fishing-based [[Dapenkeng culture]] of coastal [[Fujian]], and the [[Yuanshan culture]] of northernmost Taiwan which Blench suggests may have originated from the coast of [[Guangdong]]. Based on geography and cultural vocabulary, Blench believes that the Yuanshan people may have spoken [[East Formosan languages|Northeast Formosan languages]]. Thus, Blench believes that there is in fact no "apical" ancestor of Austronesian in the sense that there was no true single [[Proto-Austronesian language]] that gave rise to present-day Austronesian languages. Instead, multiple migrations of various pre-Austronesian peoples and languages from the Chinese mainland that were related but distinct came together to form what we now know as Austronesian in Taiwan. Hence, Blench considers the single-migration model to be inconsistent with both the archaeological and linguistic (lexical) evidence.

Tianlong Jiao (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Jiao, Tianlong. 2007. ''The Neolithic of Southeast China: Cultural Transformation and Regional Interaction on the Coast''. Cambria Press.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Neolithic peoples from the coast of southeastern China migrated to Taiwan from 6,500-5,000 B.P. The Neolithic period in southeastern China lasted from 6,500 B.P. until 3,500 B.P., and can be divided into the early (ca, 6500-5000 B.P.), middle (ca. 5000-4300 B.P.), and late (ca. 4300-3500 B.P.) Neolithic periods. The Neolithic in southeastern China started off with pottery, polished stone tools, and bone tools, with technology continuing to progress over the years. Neolithic peoples in Taiwan and mainland China continued to maintain regular contact with each other until 3,500 B.P., which was when bronze artefacts started to appear. Jiao (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Jiao, Tianlong. 2013. "The Neolithic Archaeology of Southeast China." In Underhill, Anne P., et al. ''A Companion to Chinese Archaeology'', 599-611. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; notes the Neolithic appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, alongside with limited agriculture.

According to the mainstream "out-of-Taiwan model", a large-scale Austronesian expansion began around 3000–1500 BCE. [[Population growth]] primarily fuelled this migration. These first settlers may have landed in northern [[Luzon]] in the archipelago of the Philippines, intermingling with the earlier Australo-[[Melanesian]] population who had inhabited the islands since about 23,000 years earlier. Over the next thousand years, Austronesian peoples migrated southeast to the rest of the Philippines, and into the islands of the [[Celebes Sea]], Borneo, and Indonesia. The Austronesian peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia sailed eastward, and spread to the islands of Melanesia and Micronesia between 1200 BCE and 500 CE, respectively. The Austronesian inhabitants that spread westward through Maritime Southeast Asia had reached some parts of mainland Southeast Asia, and later on Madagascar.&lt;ref name="Gray-et-al2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pawley2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=A. |chapter=The Austronesian dispersal: languages, technologies and people |editor1-first=Peter S. |editor1-last=Bellwood |editor2-first=Colin |editor2-last=Renfrew |title=Examining the farming/language dispersal hypothesis |publisher=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge |year=2002 |isbn=1902937201 |pages=251–273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sailing to Micronesia and the previously uninhabited islands of remote Oceania by 1000 BCE, the Austronesian peoples founded Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/10/game-changing-study-suggests-first-polynesians-voyaged-all-way-east-asia&lt;/ref&gt; These people settled most of the [[Pacific Islands]]. They had settled Rapa Nui ([[Easter Island]]) by AD 300, [[Hawaii]] by AD 400, and into [[New Zealand]] by about 1280 CE. 
There is evidence, based in the spreading of the [[sweet potato]], that they reached South America where they traded with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Tilburg, Jo Anne. 1994. ''Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture.'' Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, Robert.

In the Indian Ocean they sailed west from Maritime Southeast Asia; the Austronesian peoples reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 CE.&lt;ref name="Dewar1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burney2004"/&gt;

===="Southeast Asian origin" model====
This "out of Taiwan model" has been  challenged by a 2008 study. Examination of [[mitochondrial DNA]] lineages shows that they have been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) for a longer period than previously believed. Population dispersals occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which may have resulted in migrations to the Philippines as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years.&lt;ref name=Soares09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soares P, Trejaut JA, Loo JH |title=Climate change and postglacial human dispersals in southeast Asia |journal=Mol.

The migrations were likely driven by climate change — the effects of the drowning the [[Sundaland]] subcontinent (which had extended the Asian landmass as far as Borneo and Java). This happened during the period 15,000 to 7,000 years ago following the Last Glacial Maximum. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses caused flooding and the partial submergence of the Sunda subcontinent, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer1998"/&gt; Genetic evidence found in 2016 indicates that movements of people from Taiwan to the islands of South East Asia did occur, albeit smaller in scale, which  nevertheless may have brought about linguistic and cultural changes.&lt;ref name="Soares2016"/&gt;

Findings from HUGO ([[Human Genome Organization]]) in 2009 also show that Asia was populated primarily through a single migration event out of Africa whereby an early population  first entered South East Asia before they moved northwards to East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They found genetic similarities between populations throughout Asia and an increase in genetic diversity from northern to southern latitudes. Although the Chinese population is very large, it has less variation than the smaller number of individuals living in South East Asia, because the Chinese expansion occurred very recently, following the development of rice agriculture — within only the last 10,000 years.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Formation of tribes and kingdoms ===

[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudur-04.jpg|thumb|[[Borobudur]], the world's largest [[Buddhist]] temple, was built under the reign of the [[Sailendra dynasty]], which was bound by dynastic alliance with the city-state of [[Srivijaya]].]]
By the beginning of the first millennium CE, most of the Austronesian inhabitants in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] began trading with [[India]] and [[China]]. The adoption of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] statecraft model allowed the creation of [[Indianized kingdom]]s such as [[Tarumanagara]], [[Champa]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Melayu Kingdom|Melayu]], [[Srivijaya]], [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]], [[Majapahit]], and [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. Between the 5th to 15th century [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were established as the main religion in the region.

Muslim traders from the [[Arabian peninsula]] were thought to have brought [[Islam]] by the 10th century. Islam was established as the [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|dominant religion in the Indonesian archipelago]] by the 16th century. The Austronesian inhabitants of Polynesia were unaffected by this cultural trade, and retained their indigenous culture in the Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;Philippine History by Maria Christine N. Halili. "Chapter 3: Precolonial Philippines" (Published by Rex Bookstore; Manila, Sampaloc St. Year 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kingdom of Larantuka]] in [[Flores]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]] was the only [[Christian]] ([[Roman Catholic]]) [[Native Indonesians|indigenous]] kingdom in [[Indonesia]] and in [[Southeast Asia]], with the first king named Lorenzo.&lt;ref name="kps"&gt;{{cite news|language=Indonesian|last1=Oktora|first1=Samuel|last2=Ama|first2=Kornelis Kewa|title=Lima Abad Semana Santa Larantuka|url=http://regional.kompas.com/read/2010/04/03/04233954/Lima.Abad.Semana.Santa.Larantuka|accessdate=19 August 2017|agency=Kompas|date=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Europeans in search of spices and gold later colonized most of the Austronesian-speaking countries of the Asia-Pacific region, beginning from the 16th century with the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of some parts of Indonesia (present day [[East Timor]]), the Philippines, [[Palau]], [[Guam]], and the [[Mariana Islands]]; the Dutch colonization of the Indonesian archipelago; the British colonization of Malaysia and [[Oceania]]; the French colonization of [[French Polynesia]]; and later, the American governance of the Pacific.

Meanwhile, the British, Germans, French, Americans, and Japanese began establishing spheres of influence within the Pacific Islands during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Japanese later invaded most of Southeast Asia and some parts of the Pacific during [[World War II]]. The latter half of the 20th century initiated independence of modern-day Indonesia, Malaysia, East Timor and many of the Pacific Island nations, as well as the re-independence of the Philippines.

According to a recent studies by [[Stanford University]], there is wide variety of paternal ancestry among the Austronesian people, aside from European introgression found in Maritime Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Madagascar. They constitute the dominant ethnic group in the Malay Peninsula, Maritime Southeast Asia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia and Madagascar. An estimated 380,000,000 people living in these regions are of Austronesian descent.

The peoples constitute the dominant ethnic groups in [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Brunei]], the [[Philippines]], the southernmost part of [[Thailand]] and [[East Timor]], together with [[Singapore]]. Outside this area, they inhabit Palau, Guam and the Northern Marianas, most of Madagascar, the Cham areas of Vietnam and Cambodia (the remnants of the Champa kingdom which covered central and southern Vietnam), and all countries in the Micronesian and Polynesian sphere of influence.

== Culture ==
The native culture of Austronesia varies from region to region. The early Austronesian peoples considered the sea as the basic feature of their life.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Following their diaspora to [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]&lt;nowiki&gt;, they migrated by boat to other islands. Boats of different sizes and shapes have been found in every Austronesian culture, from Madagascar, Maritime Southeast Asia, to Polynesia, and have different names.
In Southeast Asia, head-hunting was restricted to the highlands as a result of warfare. Mummification is only found among the highland Austronesian [[Filipinos]], and in some Indonesian groups in Celebes and Borneo.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Body art among Austronesian peoples is common, especially elaborate tattooing which has ancient origins.&lt;ref name="kirch"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirch, Patrick V.|editor =Goodenough, Ward H.|title =Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, Volume 86, Part 5|chapter =Lapita and Its Aftermath: the Austronesian Settlement of Oceania|publisher =American Philosophical Society|year =1998|page=70|isbn = 0-87169-865-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly prominent in Polynesian cultures, from where the word "[[tattoo]]" derives.

Among the [[Māori people|Māori]] of New Zealand, tattoos (''[[Tā moko|moko]]'') were originally carved into the skin using bone chisels (''uhi'') rather than through puncturing as in usual practice.&lt;ref name="best"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Best, Eldson|year=1904|title=The Uhi-Maori, or Native Tattooing Instruments|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|volume=13|issue=3|pages=166–172|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_13_1904/Volume_13,_No._3,_September_1904/The_Uhi-Maori_or_native_tattooing_instruments,_by_Elsdon_Best,_p166-172/p1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being pigmented, the skin was also left raised into ridges of swirling patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-RobMoko-t1-body-d1-d2.html |title=Moko; or Maori Tattooing|chapter=Moko and Mokamokai — Chapter I — How Moko First Became Knows to Europeans | page=5 | author=Major-General Robley |year=1896 |publisher=Chapman and Hall Limited |accessdate=2009-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorated jars and other forms of pottery are also common, with patterns often resembling those used in tattoos. Austronesian peoples living close to mainland Asia were also influenced by [[Chinese art|Chinese]], [[India]]n, and [[Arabic]] art forms.

In the [[Philippines]] these are called [[Nipa hut|Bahay kubo]] with many styles and variants, in [[Indonesia]] these are called [[Rumah adat]] also with many variants, and in [[Malaysia]] these are called [[Malay houses|Rumah Melayu]] which are also found in Indonesia and part of the Rumah Adat family.

Indigenous religions were initially predominant. Mythologies vary by culture and geographical location, but are generally bound by the belief in an all-powerful divinity. Other beliefs such as [[ancestor worship]], [[animism]], and [[shamanism]] are also practiced. Currently, many of these beliefs have gradually been replaced. Examples of native religions include: [[Anito]], [[Gabâ]], [[Sunda Wiwitan]], [[Kejawen]], and the [[Māori religion]]. The [[moai]] of the [[Rapa Nui]] is another example since they are built to represent deceased ancestors.

Southeast Asian contact with India and China allowed the introduction of Hinduism and Buddhism. Later, Muslim traders introduced the Islamic faith between the periods of the 10th, and 13th century. The European [[Age of Discovery]], brought [[Christianity]] to various parts of the region, including both New Zealand and Australia. Currently, the dominant religions are [[Christianity]] in the Philippines, much of eastern Indonesia, some parts of Indonesian Sumatra and Borneo, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, most of the Pacific Islands, and Madagascar; [[Islam]] found in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Thailand, the southern Philippines and Brunei; [[Hinduism]] in Singapore, Bali, and some parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. There is also a tiny population in [[Manado]] on the island of [[Sulawesi]] who professed [[History of the Jews in Indonesia|Judaism]], most of whom either have Jewish ancestry who later mixed with the indigenous [[Minahasa people|Minahasans]] or are converts.

=== Music ===

The Austronesian music in Maritime Southeast Asia had a mixture of Chinese, Indian, and Arabic musical styles and sounds that had fused together with the indigenous Austronesian culture and music. In Indonesia, [[Gamelan]], a type of orchestra that incorporates Xylophone and Metallophone elements, is widely used in its Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic cultural tradition. In some parts of the southern, and northern Philippines, an Arabic gong-drum known as [[Kulintang]], and a gong-chime known as [[Gangsa]], is also used. The Austronesian music of Oceania have retained their indigenous Austronesian sounds. The [[Slit drums]] is an indigenous Austronesian musical instrument that were invented and used by the Southeast Asian-Austronesian, and Oceanic-Austronesian ethnic groups.

==Genetic studies==
Genetic studies have been done on the people and related groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.ndhu.edu.tw/zh/7_publish/%E5%AD%A3%E5%88%8A/2%5B1%5D.2--peterson.pdf The Austronesian Moment]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haplogroup O1 (Y-DNA)]]a-M119 [[genetic marker]] is frequently detected in Native Taiwanese, northern Philippines and Polynesians, as well as some people in Indonesia, Malaysia and non-Austronesian populations in southern [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.nmns.edu.tw/PubLib/NewsLetter/98/259/a-4.pdf|title=臺灣原住民族的Y 染色體多樣性與華南史前文化的關連性|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2007 analysis of the DNA recovered from human remains in archeological sites of prehistoric peoples along the [[Yangtze River]] in China also shows high frequencies of Haplogroup O1 in the [[Neolithic]] [[Liangzhu culture]], linking them to Austronesian and [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]] peoples. The Liangzhu culture existed in coastal areas around the [[Yangtze River Delta|mouth of the Yangtze]]. Haplogroup O1 was absent in other archeological sites inland. The authors of the study suggest that this may be evidence of two different human migration routes during the peopling of Eastern Asia; one coastal and the other inland, with little genetic flow between them.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Li, Hui |author2=Huang, Ying |author3=Mustavich, Laura F. |author4=Zhang, Fan |author5=Tan, Jing-Ze |author6=Wang, ling-E |author7=Qian, Ji |author8=Gao, Meng-He |author9=Jin, Li |last-author-amp=yes |year=2007 |title=Y chromosomes of prehistoric people along the Yangtze River |journal=Human Genetics |volume=122 |issue=3–4 |pages=383–388 |doi=10.1007/s00439-007-0407-2 |url=http://www.humpopgenfudan.cn/p/E/E3.pdf |pmid=17657509 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214115924/http://www.humpopgenfudan.cn/p/E/E3.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis in 2008 suggests that the populations in the islands of South East Asia may have evolved ''in situ'' over the last 35,000 years, that they had already established themselves in the region before the [[Neolithic]] period, long before the Taiwanese people were proposed to have moved out of Taiwan into the region.&lt;ref name=Soares09 /&gt; Nevertheless, in 2016, DNA analysis carried out found that one of the genetic markers used in the study, haplogroup M7c3c, supports the "out-of-Taiwan" hypothesis, although not from the other genetic markers. Results from these studies suggest that there were movements of Neolithic people from Taiwan to the islands of South East Asia around 4,000 years ago, but they were small-scale affairs, with greater impact in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Soares2016"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pedro A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9375">'''Bisha'a''' or '''Bisha''' (ordeal by fire, trial by fire or fire test) is a [[ritual]] practiced by [[Bedouin]] tribes of the [[Judea]]n, [[Negev]] and [[Sinai]] deserts for the purpose of [[lie detection]]. It is also practiced, and is said to have originated among, some Bedouin tribes of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is the best-known of various forms of [[trial by ordeal]] which are practiced by the Bedouin, which are now dying out. It is one of the rituals in the [[Bedouin systems of justice|Bedouin justice dispensary system]] for maintaining [[Honor codes of the Bedouin|Sharaf]] - the Bedouin honor code.

==Ritual==
The basic ritual consists of the accused being asked to lick a hot metal object (spoon, ladle, rod, etc.) thrice. He is provided with water for rinsing after the ceremony. He is then inspected by the official who presides over the ceremony - the ''Mubesha'' (or ''Mubasha'') and by the designated witnesses of the ritual. If the person undergoing the ritual is found to have a scarred or burnt [[tongue]], it is concluded that he was lying. The Howeitat Bedouin call this ritual "the true light of God".

The Bisha'a is usually performed only to resolve the gravest of civil or criminal offences, and is a voluntary ritual in the sense that consent on the part of the ritual undergoer is required. Typically, Bisha'a is only performed for those cases where there are no witnesses regarding the disputed issue. Societal peer and hierarchy pressures may, however, force consent. In the case of the defendant agreeing to a Bisha'a ceremony, and subsequently declining to perform the ritual or running away, the defendant is considered guilty.

The ritual is usually a public affair, with both parties arriving with fanfare. [[Tea]] is often served. Women are allowed to participate in the occasion, unlike other judiciary hearings of the Bedouins.

The instrument of the ritual - typically a metal ladle called the ''tassa bil basha'' is heated up by sticking the ladle down into the flames, the convex side being pressed into the ashes. Gasoline is often poured on the metal to heat it up. In the absence of a ladle, other metal objects like knives, spoons and rods are also used, and use of non-metals like rocks have also been documented. Both parties recount their side of the story during the process of heating, with the Mubesha interrupting for clarification. The Mubesha can also summarize the events. When the Mubesha decides that the ladle is sufficiently heated, both parties swear to God that the issue will end with the ritual, and the [[defendant]] undertakes the test. In some variants, the [[claimant]] can lick the spoon before the defendant in a bid to worry the defendant (This rare variant is practiced by the [[Armilat Bedouin]]). The Mubesha then counts [[worry beads]] (possibly [[prayer beads]]), and after a suitable lapse of time, inspects the tongue of the person undergoing the ritual. He decides whether or not the tongue is burnt (or the degree of the burn in some cases), and relates his decision to the assembly. The defendant then shows his tongue to the witnesses for inspection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/BESHA.htm Of Bedouins and tasting fire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118081532/http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/BESHA.htm |date=2006-11-18 }} by Larry W.

Roeder, Jr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mubesha==
The right to perform Bisha'a is granted only to the Mubesha, and this right is passed on from father to son, along paternal lineages. The Mubesha hears the account of the dispute before performing the ceremony, and is also responsible for pressing the metal spoon against the tongue of the person undergoing the Bisha'a. There are only a few practitioners of the Bisha'a in Bedouin society. A single Mubesha might arbitrate over several tribes and large geographical areas, like the Mubesha of [[Abu Sultan]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name = "besharoeder1"/&gt;
In the Sinai Peninsula, Bisha's is widely used.

==Legend==
The legend behind the Bisha'a goes back to a man of great powers named ''Weymer abu Ayad'' of the ''Sultani'' branch of the [[Ayayideh]] tribe of the [[Qahtan]] confederation of Bedouins in southern Saudi Arabia. Many Mubesha claim to be able to trace their heritage to the tribe of Ayayideh. Weymer was a tracker but was robbed of a personal possession. He figured out the criminal, but there were no witnesses. Apparently, Weymer challenged the suspect to lick a red-hot [[branding iron]] three times which he would also lick three times, saying that the guilty would be shown. The suspect ran away.&lt;ref name = "besharoeder1"/&gt;

==Legitimacy==
The Bisha'a was illegal under [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] rule, though numerous accounts of the performance of the ritual are documented in the records of the [[Foreign Office]] &lt;ref&gt;Records of the [[Foreign Office]] for Sinai and [[Egypt]], [[Public Record Office]], [[Kew Gardens]], [[London]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bisha'a is illegal under the [[Israeli judicial system]]. It is also inconsistent with some interpretations of the [[Sharia]], rules of Islam, being an old ritual passed on by Bedouins from pre-[[Islam]]ic times. Most [[Arab state]]s thus denounce the Bisha'a. The practice is getting rarer, with more and more Bedouins preferring standard courts of law for enactment of justice.

==Documentation==
The Bisha'a has been variously described in ethnographic and cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/law.htm The Sinai Bedouin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127041404/http://members.nova.org/~lroeder/law.htm |date=2007-01-27 }}, by Larry W.

W. Tilley (trans.); Jerusalem, Cosmos Publ. House / New York: AMS Press; 1944 / 1974&lt;/ref&gt; also refer to the practice. Glubb Pasha's account mentions the high rate of correct judgement, which he attributes to the skill of the ''mubesha''. A quote from his account:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In practice, more than half the accused persons who set out to lick the spoon lose their nerve while the spoon is in the fire, and voluntarily confess to their guilt without blistering their tongues. A further twenty-five per cent probably blister their tongues, and twenty-five per cent are declared innocent. The efficiency of the process depends, of course, entirely on the skill of the “mubesha.” The days of the “true light of God” are doubtless numbered, and in the full glare of modern democracy and (doubtless) enlightenment, the little red-hot spoon will soon vanish. Before it does so, I cannot resist paying a tribute to the skill of those who practise this infamous superstition, and to the considerable number of miscarriages of justice which were by this means avoided.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The quasiscientific explanation of the ordeal is that [[stress (medicine)|stress]] would cause the mouth of liar to dry up, hence increasing the possibility of a burn.&lt;ref name = "besharoeder1"/&gt; However, the stress of the ordeal could just as easily cause the same physical symptoms in an innocent person.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==In popular culture==

Recent interest in the Bisha'a stems from two contemporary [[Israel]]i films which portray the Bisha'a - [[Yellow Asphalt]] (2001) and [[Bisha: The Awesome Fire Test]] (2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13056">'''Chronological dating''', or simply '''dating''', is the process of attributing to an object or event a date in the past, allowing such object or event to be located in a previously established [[chronology]]. This usually requires what is commonly known as a "dating method". Several dating methods exist, depending on different criteria and techniques, and some very well known examples of disciplines using such techniques are, for example, [[history]], [[archaeology]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[astronomy]] and even [[forensic science]], since in the latter it is sometimes necessary to investigate the moment in the past in which the death of a [[cadaver]] occurred.

== Dating methods ==

Dating methods are most commonly classified following two criteria: [[relative dating]] and [[absolute dating]].

=== Relative dating ===
{{Main article|Relative dating}}
[[Relative dating]] methods are unable to determine the absolute age of an object or event, but can determine the impossibility of a particular event happening before or after another event of which the absolute date is well known. In this relative dating method, [[Latin]] terms ''[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]'' and ''[[Terminus post quem|post quem]]'' are usually used to indicate both the oldest and the most recent possible moments when an event occurred or an artifact was left in a [[stratum]]. But this method is also useful in many other disciplines. Historians, for example, know that Shakespeare's play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' was not written before 1587 because Shakespeare's primary source for writing his play was the second edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'', not published until 1587.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Clayton A. "Shakespeare's Use of The Famous Victories of Henry V," Notes &amp; Queries. n. s. 1 (June, 1954): 238-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 1587 is the ''post quem'' dating of Shakespeare's play ''Henry V''. That means that the play was without fail written after (in Latin, ''post'') 1587.

The same inductive mechanism is applied in archaeology, geology and paleontology, by many ways. For example, in a stratum presenting difficulties or ambiguities to absolute dating, [[paleopalynology]] can be used as a relative referent by means of the study of the pollens found in the stratum. This is admitted because of the simple reason that some botanical species, whether extinct or not, are well known as belonging to a determined position in the scale of time.

For a non-exhaustive list of relative dating methods and relative dating applications used in geology, paleontology or archaeology, see the following:

* [[Cross-cutting relationships]]
* [[Harris matrix]]
* [[Law of included fragments]]
* [[Law of superposition]]
* [[Principle of original horizontality]]
* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]
* [[Principle of faunal succession]]
* [[Melt inclusions]]
* [[Nitrogen dating]]
* [[Fluorine absorption dating]]
* [[Seriation (archaeology)]]
* [[Sequence dating]] (a type of seriation)
* [[Palynology]] (the study of modern-dated pollens for the relative dating of archaeological strata, also used in [[forensic palynology]])
* [[Paleopalynology]] (also spelt "Palaeopalynology", the study of fossilized pollens for the relative dating of geological strata)
* [[Morphology (archaeology)]]
* [[Typology (archaeology)]]
* [[Varnish microlamination]]
* [[Vole clock]]
* Lead corrosion dating&lt;ref&gt;Chemistry Professor Shimon Reich, a specialist in [[superconductivity]], has demonstrated a method for dating artifacts based on the magnetic properties of [[lead]], a material widely used in Israel and elsewhere in antiquity.  Reich and coworkers found that at cryogenic temperatures, lead becomes a superconductor, but the corrosion products formed from centuries of exposure to air and water ([[lead oxide]] and [[lead carbonate]]) do not superconduct.  On the basis of magnetic measurements and comparison with artifacts that were known (using other techniques) to be up to 2500 years old, the group showed that the mass of lead corrosion products is directly proportional to an object's age (New Journal of Physics, 2003, 5, 99)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, "[https://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/85/8510cover.html Chemistry in the Holy Land]", ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News'', 5 March 2007, page 20, published by American Chemical Society&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusively used in archaeology)

* [[Tephrochronology]]
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]

[[Absolute dating]] methods, by using absolute referent criteria, mainly include the [[radiometric dating]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of both radiometric and non-radiometric absolute dating methods are the following:

== Dating methods in archaeology ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dating methodologies in archaeology]] --&gt;
Same as [[Geology|geologists]] or [[paleontology|paleontologists]], [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] are also brought to determine the age of ancient materials, but in their case, the areas of their studies are restricted to the history of both ancient and recent humans. Thus, to be considered as archaeological, the remains, objects or artifacts to be dated must be related to human activity. It is commonly assumed that if the remains or elements to be dated are older than the human species, the disciplines which study them are sciences such geology or paleontology, among some others.

Nevertheless, the range of time within archaeological dating can be enormous compared to the average lifespan of a singular human being. As an example [[Pinnacle Point]]'s caves, in the southern coast of [[South Africa]], provided evidence that marine resources (shellfish) have been regularly exploited by humans as of 170,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} On the other hand, remains as recent as a hundred years old can also be the target of archaeological dating methods. It was the case of an [[18th century|18th-century]] [[sloop]] whose [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was led in [[South Carolina]] ([[United States]]) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nauticalarch.org/projects/clydesdale-plantation-18th-century-sloop-excavation/ Clydesdale Plantation 18th-Century Sloop Excavation]", [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]], Texas, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the oldest to the youngest, all [[archaeological site]]s are likely to be dated by an appropriate method.

Dating material drawn from the [[archaeological record]] can be made by a direct study of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], or may be deduced by [[Archaeological association|association]] with materials found in the [[archaeological context|context]] the item is drawn from or inferred by its point of discovery in the [[Sequence (archaeological)|sequence]] relative to datable contexts. Dating is carried out mainly [[post excavation]], but to support good practice, some preliminary dating work called "spot dating" is usually run in tandem with [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Dating is very important in archaeology for constructing models of the past, as it relies on the integrity of dateable objects and samples. Many disciplines of [[archaeological science]] are concerned with dating evidence, but in practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of [[Relationship (archaeology)|stratigraphic relationships]].

In addition, because of its particular relation with past human presence or past human activity, archaeology uses almost all the dating methods that it shares with the other sciences, but with some particular variations, like the following:

===Written markers===
* [[Epigraphy]] – analysis of inscriptions, via identifying graphemes, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers.
* [[Numismatics]] – many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record.
* [[Palaeography]] – the study of ancient writing, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.

=== Seriation ===
[[Seriation (archaeology)|Seriation]] is a relative dating method (see, above, the list of relative dating methods). An example of a practical application of seriation, is the comparison of the known [[Style (visual arts)#Style in archaeology|style]] of artifacts such as [[stone tool]]s or pottery.

===Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers===
* [[Paleomagnetism]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Tephrochronology]] (an absolute dating method, see the corresponding list above)

=== Stratigraphic relationships ===

The [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] of an archaeological site can be used to date, or refine the date, of particular activities ("contexts") on that site. For example, if a context is sealed between two other contexts of known date, it can be inferred that the middle context must date to between those dates.

[[File:Basilica de Nuestra Señora de la Merced. Lima, Perú.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica and Convent of Nuestra Señora de la Merced, Lima]]]]
'''Churrigueresque''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|tʃ|ʊər|ɪ|ɡ|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|s|k}}) refers to a [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque]] style of elaborate sculptural [[Ornament (architecture)|architectural ornament]] which emerged as a manner of [[stucco]] decoration in [[Spain]] in the late 17th century and was used up to about 1750, marked by extreme, expressive and florid decorative detailing, normally found above the entrance on the main facade of a building. 

==Origins==
Named after the architect and sculptor, [[José Benito de Churriguera]] (1665–1725), who was born in [[Madrid]] of a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] family (originally named Xoriguera), and who worked primarily in Madrid and [[Salamanca]], the origins of the style are said to go back to an architect and sculptor named [[Alonso Cano]], who designed the facade of the [[Granada Cathedral|cathedral at Granada]], in 1667.

A distant, early 15th century precursor of the highly elaborate Churrigueresque style can be found in the Lombard [[Charterhouse of Pavia]], yet the sculpture-encrusted facade still has the Italianate appeal to rational narrative. Churrigueresque appeals to the proliferative geometry, and has a more likely origin in the [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] or [[Mudéjar]] architecture that still remained through south and central Spain. The interior stucco roofs of, for example the [[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos]] in [[Córdoba, Spain]], flourish with detail and ornamentation.

==Development==
The development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized [[Guarino Guarini]]'s blend of [[Solomonic column]]s and [[composite order]], known as "supreme order". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or [[estipite]], in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation towards [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] balance and sobriety. 

Among the highlights of the style, interiors of the [[Granada Charterhouse]] offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, [[Narciso Tomé]] achieved striking [[chiaroscuro]] effects in his [[El Transparente|''Transparente'']] for the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. Perhaps the most visually intoxicating form of the style was Mexican Churrigueresque, practised in the mid-18th century by [[Lorenzo Rodriguez]], whose masterpiece is the [[Sagrario Metropolitano]] (1749–69) in [[Mexico City]], [[New Spain]].

==Spain==
The first of the Churriguera was [[José Benito de Churriguera]] (1665-1725), who trained as a joiner of [[altarpieces]], drawing some very important for various churches of [[Salamanca]], [[Madrid]], [[Valladolid]] and other cities in Spain. Some in Spain have gone and some remain only a sites:
*Altarpiece of [[Convent of St. Stephen, Salamanca|Convent of San Esteban]] in Salamanca.
*Town of [[Nuevo Baztán]] (Church of san Francisco Javier and Goyeneche Palace).
*Choir of the [[New Cathedral, Salamanca|New Cathedral of Salamanca]].
*[[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor of Salamanca]].
*[[Capilla de la Vera Cruz (Salamanca)|Capilla de la Vera Cruz]], in Salamanca.
*[[Colegio de Calatrava (Salamanca)|College of Calatrava]], in Salamanca.
*[[Palace of San Telmo]], in Seville.

==Mexico==
[[File:Sagrario Metropolitano, 2011.jpg|thumb|Sagrario Metropolitano, 2011]]

In [[Mexico]], the [[Zacatecas Cathedral|Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas]], [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]], capital of [[Zacatecas]] state, and the [[Santa Prisca de Taxco|Templo de Santa Prisca]], located in [[Taxco]], [[Guerrero]] state are considered as masterpieces of Churrigueresque style. The building of [[Parroquia Antigua]] in [[Salamanca, Guanajuato]], founded on August 24, 1603, was completed in the year 1690, and the Churrigueresque facade in 1740. The altarpiece of the church of San Francisco Javier ([[Museo del Virreinato, Tepotzotlán|National Museum of Viceroyalty]]) in [[Tepotzotlán]], [[State of Mexico]] is also considered, along with its facade, one of the most important baroque churrigueresque works created by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in [[New Spain]]. The [[Retablo de los Reyes|Altar de los Reyes]] of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] and the facades of the Sagrario Metropolitano, which is attached to the same Cathedral, are also representatives of the style.

==The Philippines==

It was late introduced in the Philippines. The best examples were the San Juan de dios Hospital in Intramuros, [[Daraga Church]] in Albay, and Tigbauan Church in Iloilo.

==Churrigueresque revival==
[[File:Casa del Prado Theater, 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Casa del Prado]] Theater, at Balboa Park.]]
The Churrigueresque decorative style was used in [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] in the [[New World]] colonial town's important buildings. The style enjoyed a resurgence after architect [[Bertram Goodhue]] and [[Carleton Winslow]] Sr. studied [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]] Churrigueresque and [[Plateresque]] ornament in Mexico, using it in designing the [[Panama-California Exposition|1915 Panama-California Exposition]] buildings at [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].  The Exposition popularized its use in [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] styles in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11708">'''Control reconfiguration''' is an active approach in [[control theory]] to achieve [[Fault-Tolerant Control|fault-tolerant control]] for [[dynamic systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blanke|Kinnaert|Lunze|Staroswiecki|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used when severe [[Fault (technology)|faults]], such as actuator or sensor outages, cause a break-up of the [[control loop]], which must be restructured to prevent [[failure]] at the system level. In addition to loop restructuring, the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] parameters must be adjusted to accommodate changed plant dynamics. Control reconfiguration is a building block toward increasing the [[dependability]] of systems under [[feedback]] control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Patton|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconfiguration problem ==

[[Image:ReconfStructure.png|frame|Schematic diagram of a typical active fault-tolerant control system. In the nominal, i.e. fault-free situation, the lower control loop operates to meet the control goals. The fault-detection (FDI) module monitors the closed-loop system to detect and isolate faults. The fault estimate is passed to the reconfiguration block, which modifies the control loop to reach the control goals in spite of the fault.]]

=== Fault modelling ===

The figure to the right shows a plant controlled by a controller in a standard control loop.

The nominal linear model of the plant is

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}} &amp; = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u}\\
\mathbf{y} &amp; = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{x}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The plant subject to a fault (indicated by a red arrow in the figure) is modelled in general by

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}}_f &amp; = \mathbf{A}_f\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{B}_f\mathbf{u}\\
\mathbf{y}_f &amp; = \mathbf{C}_f\mathbf{x}_f\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the system is faulty. This approach models multiplicative faults by modified system matrices. Specifically, actuator faults are represented by the new input matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}_f&lt;/math&gt;, sensor faults are represented by the output map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}_f&lt;/math&gt;, and internal plant faults are represented by the system matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_f&lt;/math&gt;.

The upper part of the figure shows a supervisory loop consisting of ''fault detection and isolation'' (FDI) and ''reconfiguration'' which changes the loop by

# choosing new input and output signals from {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;} to reach the control goal,
# changing the controller internals (including dynamic structure and parameters),
# adjusting the reference input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;.

To this end, the vectors of inputs and outputs contain ''all available signals'', not just those used by the controller in fault-free operation.

Alternative scenarios can model faults as an additive external signal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; influencing the state derivatives and outputs as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}}_f &amp; = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{E}\mathbf{f}\\
\mathbf{y}_f &amp; = \mathbf{C}_f\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{F}\mathbf{f}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reconfiguration goals ===

The goal of reconfiguration is to keep the reconfigured control-loop performance sufficient for preventing plant shutdown. The following goals are distinguished:

# Stabilization
# Equilibrium recovery
# Output trajectory recovery
# State trajectory recovery
# Transient time response recovery

Internal stability of the reconfigured closed loop is usually the minimum requirement. The equilibrium recovery goal (also referred to as weak goal) refers to the steady-state output equilibrium which the reconfigured loop reaches after a given constant input. This equilibrium must equal the nominal equilibrium under the same input (as time tends to infinity). This goal ensures steady-state reference tracking after reconfiguration. The output trajectory recovery goal (also referred to as strong goal) is even stricter. It requires that the dynamic response to an input must equal the nominal response at all times. Further restrictions are imposed by the state trajectory recovery goal, which requires that the state trajectory be restored to the nominal case by the reconfiguration under any input.

Usually a combination of goals is pursued in practice, such as the equilibrium-recovery goal with stability.

The question whether or not these or similar goals can be reached for specific faults is addressed by [[reconfigurability]] analysis.

== Reconfiguration approaches ==

=== Fault hiding ===
[[Image:FaultHiding with Goals.png|frame|Fault hiding principle. A reconfiguration block is placed between faulty plant and nominal controller. The reconfuigured plant behaviour must match the nominal behaviour. Furthermore, the reconfiguration goals are pointed out.]]
This paradigm aims at keeping the nominal controller in the loop. To this end, a reconfiguration block can be placed between the faulty plant and the nominal controller. Together with the faulty plant, it forms the reconfigured plant. The reconfiguration block has to fulfill the requirement that the behaviour of the reconfigured plant matches the behaviour of the nominal, that is fault-free plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Steffen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linear model following ===
In linear model following, a formal feature of the nominal closed loop is attempted to be recovered. In the classical pseudo-inverse method, the closed loop system matrix &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B}\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; of a state-feedback control structure is used. The new controller &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}_f&lt;/math&gt; is found to approximate &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{A}}&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of an induced matrix norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gao|Antsaklis|1991}} {{Harv|Staroswiecki|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In perfect model following, a dynamic compensator is introduced to allow for the exact recovery of the complete loop behaviour under certain conditions.

In eigenstructure assignment, the nominal closed loop eigenvalues and eigenvectors (the eigenstructure) is recovered to the nominal case after a fault.

=== Optimisation-based control schemes ===
Optimisation control schemes include: linear-quadratic regulator design (LQR), model predictive control (MPC) and eigenstructure assignment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Looze|Weiss|Eterno|Barrett|1985}}{{Harv|Lunze|Rowe-Serrano|Steffen|2003}}{{Harv|Esna Ashari|Khaki Sedigh|Yazdanpanah|2005}}{{Harv|Maciejowski|Jones|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probabilistic approaches ===
Some probabilistic approaches have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mahmoud|Jiang|Zhang|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning control ===
There are learning automata, neural networks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rauch|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical tools and frameworks ==
The methods by which reconfiguration is achieved differ considerably. The following list gives an overview of mathematical approaches that are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Zhang|Jiang|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Adaptive control]] (AC)
* Disturbance decoupling (DD)
* Eigenstructure assignment (EA)
* [[Gain scheduling]] (GS)/linear parameter varying (LPV)
* Generalised internal model control (GIMC)
* Intelligent control (IC)
* [[Linear matrix inequality]] (LMI)
* [[Linear-quadratic regulator]] (LQR)
* Model following (MF)
* [[Model predictive control]] (MPC)
* [[Pseudoinverse|Pseudo-inverse]] method (PIM)
* [[Robust control]] techniques

== See also ==
Prior to control reconfiguration, it must be at least determined whether a fault has occurred ([[fault detection]]) and if so, which components are affected ([[fault isolation]]). Preferably, a model of the faulty plant should be provided ([[Fault Identification|fault identification]]). These questions are addressed by [[fault diagnosis]] methods.

[[Fault Accommodation|Fault accommodation]] is another common approach to achieve [[Fault Tolerance|fault tolerance]]. In contrast to control reconfiguration, accommodation is limited to internal controller changes. The sets of signals manipulated and measured by the controller are fixed, which means that the loop cannot be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blanke|Kinnaert|Lunze|Staroswiecki|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3894">'''Dan Kwian''' ({{lang-th|ด่านเกวียน}}) is a village and [[tambon|subdistrict]] in [[Chok Chai District]], [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]]. It is known for its [[pottery]] and [[handicrafts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Joe|title=Thailand|year=2001|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=1 86450 251 7|pages=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village name Dan Kwian means toll station or check point (''Dan'') for oxcarts (''Kwian'').

==Location==
Dan Kwian sits at a [[narrows]] of the [[Mun River|Mun]] (Thai: แม่น้ำมูล) river and was a convenient [[Ford (river)|river crossing]] point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Louis|title=Traditional Thai Pottery Guide and Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Louis Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river provided the means for distributing utilitarian pottery produced in Dan Kwian to a wide market. The village, located on the road connecting [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] and [[Chok Chai]], is broken into two distinct parts. Dan Kwian Din Phao (ด่านเกวียนดินเผา), a congregation of larger [[Factory|factories]] and a roadside sales area for ceramics, both local and sourced from other centers in Thailand, is located about 2 kilometers north of the historic village Moo Baan Dan Kwian (หมู่บ้านด่านเกวียน). The Tambon covers a 10.17 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area. The people of Dan Kwian are mostly employed in handicrafts and farming.

==History==
Pottery production is said to have started around 1740, although this date has not been verified. The same account states that pottery production began with [[Mon people|Mon]] (Thai: มอญ) refugees similar to the potters of [[Ko Kred]] (Kred Island). This claim, although popularly held, may not be accurate.&lt;ref name=Chiminok&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiminok|first=Nikom|title=Dankwean|year=2000|publisher=Publisher Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to approximately 1972 nearly all the products of Dan Kwian kilns were functional vessels. Common forms were water storage [[jar]]s of around 50 liters capacity, lidded jars for preparing fermented fish, [[mortar and pestle|mortars]], and [[Sink|basins]]. There is no evidence of [[tableware]] production at Dan Kwian.&lt;ref name=Chiminok/&gt; Most of the pottery is fired in above-ground [[Anagama kiln|anagama]]-style wood [[kiln]]s, although at least one [[Anagama kiln#Kiln variants|noborigama]] chamber kiln, many gas kilns, and at least one electric kiln have been used in recent years. Ceramic ware in Dan Kwian was traditionally fired in two distinct styles, Phao Dam (Thai:เผาดำ), or "fired black," and Phao Deng (Thai:เผาแดง), "fired red." Phao Dam ware was fired to temperatures between approximately {{convert|1200|°C|°F}} and {{convert|1250|°C|°F}}. The ware at this temperature became dark brown and vitreous. Phao Dam wares were prized for durability and lack of [[porosity]]. Most notable of these products are the once ubiquitous Dan Kwian water jars.

Starting around 1972, decorative ware started to be made in Dan Kwian to serve a new market of urban consumers centered in Bangkok. University-based designers became involved with developing new products for hotels and other public spaces as well as private homes. At first this decorative ware consisted simply of water jars ornamented with carved [[Decorative arts|decoration]]. Gradually the decorative ware expanded to include varied ornamental vessel forms, clay [[tile]], carved [[ceramic]] [[mural]]s, ceramic [[jewellery]], and free-standing [[sculpture]]. Other media are also now produced in Dan Kwian, most notably [[cement]]-based carved [[sandstone]] replicas.&lt;ref name=Chiminok/&gt;

'''Douglas R. White''' (born 1942) is an American [[complexity|complexity researcher]], [[Social anthropology|social anthropologist]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[social network]] researcher at the [[List of University of California, Irvine people|University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki|title=InterSciWiki|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Douglas White was born in [[Minneapolis]] in 1942. He attended the [[University of Michigan]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Minnesota]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1964, an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1967, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1969, all under advisor E. Adamson [[Hoebel]] and the Travelling Scholars Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.uiuc.edu/programs/TravelingScholars/ CIC: Travelling Scholars Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405145357/http://www.cic.uiuc.edu/programs/TravelingScholars/ |date=April 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White taught at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1967 to 1976. Since then he has been a Social Science Professor at the [[University of California, Irvine]], teaching in Social Relations, in Comparative Culture, in Social Networks and in Anthropology. He co-founded and chaired the [[Social network|Social Networks]] PhD program and within the Institute for Mathematical [[Behavioral Sciences]] chaired the Social Dynamics and Complexity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socsci.uci.edu/socdyn/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; research group and the [[University of California|UC]] four-campus videoconference group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/center/cac.html|title=Human Sciences and Complexity (HSC-UC)|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is on the external faculty at the [[Santa Fe Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Douglas_R._White|title=Douglas R. White|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was on the governing Council of the European Complex Systems Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://complexsystems.lri.fr/ECSS/tiki-index.php European Complex Systems Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901090924/http://complexsystems.lri.fr/ECSS/tiki-index.php |date=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as President of the [http://computationalsocialscience.org/ Social Science Computing Association] and of the Linkages Development Research Council.

He founded the [[World Cultures]] electronic journal in 1985 as part of the movement for [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] scientific data and publication and founded the open access and [[peer reviewed]] [[Structure and dynamics|Structure and Dynamics]] electronic journal in 2005, where he continues as editor-in-chief.

He is a recipient of the U.S. Distinguished Scientist Award of the [[Alexander von Humboldt#The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Alexander von Humboldt]] Foundation, the "Best Paper in Mathematical Sociology of 2004" Award of the [[American Sociological Association]] (2004), and the 2007 "Viviana Zelizer Distinguished Scholarship Award" for the outstanding article published in the field of economic sociology in the previous two years.

== Work ==
Major contributions of Douglas R. White:
* White is known for [[Cross-cultural studies]], studies of the [[division of labor]], sexual division of labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pw/SexualDivision_ofLabor.htm|title=Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: The Sexual Division of Labor Page, Causes and Entailments|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; polygyny,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pw/Polygyny.htm|title=Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: The Polygyny Page|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marriage and [[kinship]], his collaborative creation of the [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]] (SCCS), and [http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Standard_Cross-Cultural_Sample#Download_for_Spss:_Standard_Cross-Cultural_Sample_Spss_data_file public domain distribution of SCCS data, courseware and software], which has given way to the [http://www.xsede.org/gateways-listing UCI Complex Social Science Gateway] that hosts Anthropology's [http://intersci.ss.uci.edu Ethnographics of the Lives of World Peoples] along with software used in solving [[Galton's problem]] of autocorrelation [http://SocSciCompute.ss.uci.edu for analysis of observational data],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/DEf|title=DEf|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for research on:
* [[Longitudinal study|Longitudinal]] historical evolution and field studies of human groups, larger societies, and city systems&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Realistic_modeling_of_complex_interactive_systems Realistic modeling of complex interactive systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mathematical modeling]] of social, economic, and historical dynamics, as well as statistical [[entailment]] analysis, [[Galton's problem]], the Natchez Paradox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pub/NatchezPeople.pdf the Natchez Paradox]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Structural endogamy]] and network simulation, [[Weighted networks#cite note-5|regular equivalence]], flow [[centrality]], and [[structural cohesion#cite note-1|structural cohesion]],
* [[Social networks]], including, more specifically, the network realism&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/NetworkRealism.htm network realism]&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm,
* Social complexity and [[Social-circles network model|complex-network]] system dynamics.
* [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]]
* [[System dynamics]] Studies of world system dynamics and urban studies, including his current studies of urban dynamics over the last millennium,

A reaction to his latest book, [[Network Analysis and Ethnographic Problems]], by one reviewer, was that this "could be the most important book in anthropology in fifty years." His work on implications of feedback and feedforward processes, published in [[Physical Review]] in collaboration with the founder of [[Constantino Tsallis|nonextensive physics]], a founder of [[J. Doyne Farmer|chaos theory]], and two young computer scientists, provides one of the foundational network simulations for understanding complex networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16310">The '''Draft Universe''' ({{lang-ru|Вселенная «Черновика»}}) is a fictional setting for a [[science fiction]] duology written by [[Sergei Lukyanenko]] and consisting of the novels ''[[Rough Draft (novel)|Rough Draft]]'' and ''[[Final Draft (novel)|Final Draft]]''.

== Overview ==
Besides our world, there exist alternate worlds whose development did not follow ours. All of these worlds are called the worlds of the Fan. Passages exist between these worlds, which are opened through the houses of customs officers-functionals, which often look like towers (at least most of the ones operated by males). Some of these worlds are inhabited, while others are devoid of human presence. However, it is possible that all worlds are inhabited. Initially, it is stated that there are only two dozen worlds. Later, though, it is revealed that the number is much higher.

== Functionals ==
All inhabited worlds feature a small percentage (about 1 in 20,000) of special people called functionals.

Functionals are people who have been "erased" from their lives and granted certain superhuman abilities, which work only within a certain area no more than 200 square kilometers (about 77 square miles). There is also a very small number of functionals who are not attached to a specific location. Usually, all abilities of a functional are directly linked to his or her function.

Functionals began to appear on our [[Earth]] in the 1810s.

=== Becoming a functional ===
The process of a human turning into a functional starts with everyone forgetting him or her, starting with random acquaintances and ending with immediate family members. This process can take anyone from two-three days to several weeks. The "forgetting" is not instantaneous. Other people will, at first, still recognize the future functional, albeit with some difficulty. Then they will get a sense of [[deja vu]] upon meeting him or her and, eventually, forget about the functional completely. At the same time, all official documents and records related to the person disappear, and most personal effects (ID, apartment/house keys, etc.) turn to dust. His or her house or apartment is occupied by other people who are convinced that they have always lived there. If the functional meets anyone during this period, the new acquaintance immediately forgets him or her upon departure.

At the end of this period, the new functional receives a message, inviting him or her to a certain place. The type of the message depends on the level of technology at the time. For example, in modern times, the functional gets a [[Text messaging|text message]], while in the 1920s, one would get a [[telegram]] delivered by a postman-functional. Upon arriving to the specified location, the functional sees a house, which becomes his or her function (place of residence/work). The message is sent by a midwife-functional, whose function is to help the process of "birthing" new functionals.

=== Abilities and limitations of functionals ===
Functionals have superhuman abilities related to their function as well as all the necessary knowledge. Some functionals (such as customs officers and police officers) are granted advanced physical abilities ([[superstrength]] and [[superspeed]]) and knowledge of [[martial arts]], allowing them to easily defeat several well-trained humans. There are, however, not equal in combat abilities — while a customs officer is a superior combatant, even he or she is incapable of defeating a police officer.

Functionals do not age or get sick; they look younger than their biological age and are able to [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]]. A functional's regenerative ability is more advanced the closer he or she is to his or her function. Inside his or her function, a functional is nearly invulnerable (it is suggested that even beheading a functional inside his or her function would not kill him or her).

The functional's place of work/residence restructures itself in accordance with the functional's wishes. There are, however, limitations to this: the function will only create the bare minimum required for a more or less comfortable life. It will not create food, items of luxury, money or anything living.

Functionals are allowed (and, usually, welcome) to use the services of other functionals.

A functional is tied to his or her function with a so-called "leash". A typical length of a "leash" is 10-11 kilometers (about 6.5 miles). While a functional is able to go beyond this radius, he or she loses all functional abilities. It should be noted that a functional's "leash" also extends to other worlds through customs. For example, if a functional lives 4 kilometers away from a customs office, he or she can only go 6-7 kilometers away from the customs office on another world.

A functional is incapable of completely reject his or her function but can make his or her duties extremely easy (for example, a maid-functional whose hotel is never occupied).

=== Types of functionals ===
Most functionals have regular human jobs (doctor, restaurant owner, etc.). Their services are available to other functionals and the select humans who are aware of their existence. These humans are usually the social elite, such as politicians, moguls, artists, and others. The relations between the social elite and the functionals differ from world to world.

Police officer-functionals maintain order among the functionals. They are granted highly developed reasoning as well as combat abilities. Their function is not a specific place but a certain territory.

Customs officer-functionals operate the customs between worlds. They open doors to other worlds, let people through them and prevent the import and export of illegal goods. They also charge tariffs for certain items. All proceeds are kept by the customs officers. Only a customs officer is able to open doors in his or her function. They instinctively know everything the visitors are carrying and all the appropriate tariffs.

Midwife-functionals help new functionals leave their lives behind and find their function. They are extremely powerful and are able to kill a human in another room by stopping his or her heart with a thought. They can also destroy a functional's function, which would usually kill the affected functional as well. Midwives are not tied to specific locations or territories; their function covers an entire world.

== Customs ==
Customs are doorways to other worlds. The customs are operated by a customs officer-functional, the only person who is able to let others through the doors. A customs office is not dependent on the outside worlds and can only be destroyed by a [[Thermonuclear device|thermonuclear warhead]].

The ratio of customs officers to all functionals is surprisingly high. For example, [[Moscow]] has 17 customs officers for only 700 functionals.

Passageways between worlds are usually limited to 2 square meters (i.e. the size of a door). It is extremely difficult to create a passageway that would allow a large object (such as a [[tank]]) to pass, while anything larger is physically impossible.

== Worlds of the Fan ==

=== Earth 1 (Arkan) ===
This world was long thought to be most similar to ours but historically ahead by 35 years. It was later discovered that, historically, Arkan is actually behind. However, in several areas, most notably in military technology, it is more advanced than Demos. Uses the other worlds as test sites for various experiments. For example, Demos is used as a platform for developing technology. However, this use of other worlds by Arkan led to its war with the world of Tverd, which was originally supposed to be the test site for the development of [[biotechnology]]. Arkan controls other worlds with the use of functionals. Geographically, Arkan is very similar to Demos.

=== Earth 2 (Demos) ===
Our world. One of the most technologically advanced worlds in the Fan. Named so due to [[democracy]] being the prevailing form of government.

=== Earth 3 (Veroz) ===
A world without [[petroleum]], which caused its technological development to stall (due to interference from Arkan) at the level of Demos in the 19th century (making Veroz an example of a [[steampunk]] world). Veroz [[fauna]] is also different from Demos fauna. For example, traveling the seas is dangerous, as [[kraken]]s are real in this world. Also, there are nearly two dozen species of dinosaurs in existence in [[Africa]]. The generic shape of continents on Veroz is similar to Demos continents with some significant differences. For example, [[India]] is an island not a peninsula. Also, Veroz's complex political system is also radically different from ours. It includes elements of [[feudalism]] and democracy, while our version of democracy is seen as primitive. There are no [[nation-state]]s on Veroz. While there are occasional alliances between the many [[city-state]]s, they are usually fragile and do not survive the end of wars. As such, wars on Veroz would be seen by Demos inhabitants as nothing more than localized conflicts. Known cities: Kimgim in place of [[Stockholm]], Orysultan in place of [[Moscow]], and Zarhtan in place of [[Saint-Petersburg]]. [[Islam]] is a peaceful religion and is most prominent in Orysultan. Isa the Prophet is the Veroz version of [[Jesus Christ]], with [[Christianity|Christians]] being an aggressive religious minority.

=== Earth 4 (Antik) ===
A world artificially stalled at the level of [[Ancient Greece]] (hence the name). [[Slavery]] is a major part of everyday life on Antik, with several major differences between slavery in Demos history. A master may not claim a slave's property for himself. This means that it is not uncommon for a slave to be wealthier than his master and have servants and [[concubine]]s (but not slaves of his own). Twice a year, slaves are handed out weapons, so that they can rebel. If a slave succeeds, he trades places with his master.

=== Earth 5 ===
A friendly and attractive world, whose technological development is at the level of Demos in the 1950s. Its inhabitants are close to developing space travel. There is, however, a biological curiosity which makes the sociopolitical structure of Earth 5 very complicated — humans have a set [[mating season]] in spring, just like animals.

=== Earth 8 (Tverd) ===
A world dominated by the [[Catholic Church]]. While several nations do exist on Tverd, their governments handle the lower-level day-to-day management of their countries. The Church handles the theological and higher-level international issues. While the Church does exercise control over the entire world, they are so secure in their rule that they allow other religions to exist without persecution, including Islam, [[Judaism]], and [[Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]], preferring to convince nonbelievers to convert through the use of philosophical debate rather than force. Tverd's level of development is mostly equal to the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval]] period of Demos history. The significant exceptions are the fields of biotechnology and [[genetics]]. Most devices and appliances are made from living things. For example, genetically modified [[Medusa (biology)|medusae]] are used to create the Tverd equivalent of [[contact lenses]], which can also be used to see certain wavelengths invisible to the naked eye (e.g. [[infrared]]). The Church has but one rule for [[genetic engineering]]: a human may not be modified in any way, as humans are made in the image of [[God]]. Other results of Tverd bioengineering efforts include [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s able to leap many times their height into the air and kill a person within a few seconds, songbirds which act as biological recordings of songs, and flying [[gargoyle]]s which act as the Church's air force. Tverd is the only well-known inhabited world that exists without interference from Arkan. Centuries ago, after the Church cardinals (the Church is ruled by the Cardinal Council instead of a single [[Pope]]) discovered the existence of functionals, they were systematically hunted down and eliminated in a manner similar to the [[witch-hunt]]s of Demos during the Middle Ages. All known customs offices were [[Immurement|immured]], leaving one in [[Vatican City|Vatican]], protected round-the-clock by female [[Swiss Guard]]s and killer Yorkshire Terriers, to allow for diplomacy with the agents of Arkan. This customs office was also immured during the attempt by Arkan special forces to capture Kirill Maximov.

=== Earth 12 ===
This world is only mentioned once throughout both novels. Humanity does not exist on Earth 12, its place having been taken over by giant hairy spiders.

=== Earth 14 (Janus) ===
A world which is officially considered to be uninhabited. Later, it is discovered that Janus is populated by [[Stone Age]]-level humans. The geography of this world is unknown, but the climate is extremely harsh: furious winters and scorching summers. This is explained by the lack of sufficient solar energy (i.e. either the [[Sun]] is too far away, or it is weaker than ours).

=== Earth 16 ===
The functional homeworld and, possibly, Demos's future. Less than 10% of the surface is habitable, and the remaining inhabitants of this once-prosperous world live on islands. The remaining 90% of the planet, including the mainlands, is covered by a volcanically-active [[Radiation|radioactive]] wasteland. All customs that open to Earth 16 only open to the mainlands, ensuring that no one finds out the truth about this world (most functionals believe Earth 16 to be [[Hell]]). The only remaining sign of this worlds former greatness is a strange-looking skyscraper on an inhabited island, unseen to most humans. The structure is, actually, a museum and holds little value to functionals. It is protected by an angel-like functional.

=== Earth 18 (Preserve) ===
An uninhabited world, although some believe that to be false. Used by functionals and some humans as a popular vacation spot.

=== Earth 22 (Nirvana) ===
A world used by functionals as a prison of sorts. This is achieved using the naturally occurring [[fungus]] which produces spores that have a narcotic effect on humans. The spores can only exist on Nirvana. A settlement has been built by humans who have been sent to this world by functionals. The settlement is located close to two customs offices (one after Kirill's was destroyed). Vasilisa, a customs officer-functional, helps the inhabitants and teaches their children. The humans themselves are so used to the narcotic effect of the fungus, that they are incapable of leaving Nirvana without suffering severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]].

=== Earth 46 ===
An unknown world, the existence of which is known only to the top functionals. It can be inferred that its level of technological development far exceeds all known worlds of the Fan. The humans of Earth 46 have advanced knowledge of [[quantum physics]], putting them on the level with Earth 16 functionals. They are capable of building powerful combat robots, whose consciousnesses are copied from living or deceased humans. For example, on Earth 16, Kirill meets a robot from Earth 46, whose consciousness was copied from a poet named Anatol Lars, who was killed during the functional invasion of that world. On Earth 46, humans live in peace with the robots, and there are more of the latter. It is likely that robots are used as vessels for deceased humans who wish to live on in any form. After the functional invasion, Earth 46 was sealed forever from the rest of the Fan, preventing anyone from coming or leaving that world.

== Main characters ==
* Kirill Maximov — the protagonist of the duology. Customs official-functional, although later gains some curator abilities and is revealed to be essential to the survival of Demos.
* Konstantin Chagin — Kirill's best friend and the curator of Demos. Born in [[Byzantium]] centuries ago. Became the curator by killing the previous one. Afraid of suffering a similar fate. Likes writing trashy, perverted stories for a local magazine.

An ''English-medium education'' system is one that uses [[English language|English]] as the primary [[medium of instruction]]&amp;mdash;particularly where English is not the mother tongue of the students.

Initially associated with the expansion of English from its homeland in England and the lowlands of [[Scotland]] and its spread to the rest of Great Britain and Ireland, the rise of the British Empire increased the language's spread,&lt;ref name="qub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/imperial.htm |title=The Imperial Archive. A site dedicated to the study of Literature, Imperialism, Postcolonialism |publisher=Qub.ac.uk |date=30 January 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527093311/http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/imperial.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ehistling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehistling-pub.meotod.de/01_lec06.php |title=Lecture 7: World-Wide English |accessdate=26 March 2007|publisher=&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;HistLing }}&lt;/ref&gt; as has the increased economic and cultural influence of the United States since [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="qub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehistling"/&gt;

A working knowledge of English is perceived as being valuable; for example, English is very dominant in the [[English in computing|world of computing]]. As a result, many states throughout the world where English is not the predominant language encourage or mandate the use of English as the normal medium of instruction.

==By country==
[[File:British School.jpg|thumb|Public advert on a street hoarding in Livorno, Italy]]

===Canada===
{{main|Education in Canada}}
{{further|Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories|Official bilingualism in Canada|Timeline of official languages policy in Canada}}
Education is a provincial matter under the [[Canadian constitution, section 92]].  French language rights have been guaranteed in the province of Quebec since the [[Treaty of Paris 1763]], French outside of Quebec and all other minority languages have faced laws against them at one time or another.  English-only education laws were gradually rolled out across Canada during the nineteenth and twentieth century, culminating in the [[Manitoba Schools Question]] 1896 and [[Regulation 17]] in Ontario in 1912, which both attacked French and other European minority languages, and the [[Indian residential schools system]] which attacked Aboriginal languages.

These policies were gradually abolished in the wake of Canada's adoption of official bilingualism (French/English) in 1969 and multiculturalism in 1971, but English remains the predominant language of education outside of Quebec and New Brunswick.

===Wales===
{{see|Welsh medium education}}
The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]], passed by the [[Parliament of England]], annexing [[Wales]] to the [[Kingdom of England]] are sometimes known as the "Acts of Union."

An often quoted example of the effects on the [[Welsh language]] is the first section of the 1535 Act, which states: "the people of the same dominion have and do daily use a speche nothing like ne consonant to the naturall mother tonge used within this Realme" and then declares the intention "utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs" belonging to Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApknBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44|title=Centres and Peripheries: Metropolitan and Non-Metropolitan Journalism in the Twenty First Century|year=2014|isbn=978-1443827577|editor= David Hutchison and Hugh O'Donnell|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 20 of the 1535 Act makes English the only language of the law courts and that those who used Welsh would not be appointed to any public office in Wales: 
{{quote|Also be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Justices, Commissioners, Sheriffs, Coroners, Escheators, Stewards, and their Lieutenants, and all other Officers and Ministers of the Law, shall proclaim and keep the Sessions Courts, Hundreds, Leets, Sheriffs Courts, and all other Courts in the English Tongue;
(2) and all Oaths of Officers, Juries and Inquests, and all other Affidavits, Verdicts and [[Wager of Law]], to be given and done in the English Tongue;
(3) and also that from henceforth no Person or Persons that use the Welsh Speech or Language, shall have or enjoy any manner Office or Fees within this Realm of England, Wales, or other the King's Dominion, upon Pain of forfeiting the same Offices or Fees, unless he or they use and exercise the English Speech or Language.}}

An effect of this language clause was to lay the foundation for creating a thoroughly Anglicised ruling class of landed gentry in Wales, which would have many consequences.

The parts of the 1535 Act relating to language were definitively repealed only in 1993, by the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]], though annotations on the [[Statute Law Database]] copy of the act reads that sections 18–21 were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1887]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In July 1846, the British Government appointed three commissioners to enquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all monoglot English-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/CGN/CommsEnq.html |title=Report of Commission of Enquiry into the State of Education in Wales, 1847 |publisher=GENUKI |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioners reported to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' (The [[Treachery of the Blue Books]]) as, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, Non-conformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was for a belief to take root in the minds of ordinary people that the only way for Welsh people to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as "the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/glencoe-of-welsh-history-is-published-online-6112711.html|title='Glencoe of Welsh history' is published online|date=4 January 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/common.htm |title=CAIN: CSC: The Common School |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=5 May 1993 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in (1596) a recommendation that "the Irish ... be educated in English, in grammar and in science ... for learning hath that wonderful power of itself that it can soften and temper the most stern and savage nature."

The setting up of 'Royal Schools' in Ireland, was proclaimed in 1608 by [[James I]], with the intended purpose "that there shall be one Free School at least appointed in every County, for the education of youth in learning and religion."

These schools provided an English-medium education to the sons of landed settlers in Ireland, most of whom were of Scottish or English descent.

However, only five such schools were actually set up; [[The Royal School, Armagh]] in County Armagh, [[Portora Royal School]] in County Fermanagh, The Cavan Royal School in County Cavan, The [[Royal School Dungannon]] in Tyrone and The Royal and Prior School in County Donegal.

The ''National Education System''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proni.gov.uk/Education/Ed2.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229124833/http://www.proni.gov.uk/Education/Ed2.htm |date=29 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sic) was founded in 1831, by the British Government, under the direction of the Chief Secretary, E.G. Stanley. Some 2,500 national schools were established in Ulster in the period 1832–1870, built with the aid of the Commissioners of National Education and local trustees.

Prof. S. Ó Buachalla states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the first four decades of their existence, there is no mention of the Irish language in the programme of regulations of the Commissioners of National Education; furthermore no provision whatsoever was made in 1831 when the original scheme was drawn up for education of those children who spoke Irish only. According to the official opinion of later Commissioners, expressed in a formal reply to the Chief Secretary in 1884, " the anxiety of the promoters of the National Scheme was to encourage the cultivation of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=European Journal of Education |volume=19 |issue=1 |year=1984 |page=75 |title=Educational Policy and the Role of the Irish Language from 1831 to 1981 |author=Séamas Ó Buachalla |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |jstor=1503260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 April 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Irish patriot [[P.H. Pearse]] published a series of studies of the English-medium education system in Ireland. His article entitled The Murder Machine&lt;ref&gt;The Murder Machine http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E900007-001/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; embodies an article which appeared in the Irish Review for February 1913.

Pearse wrote in his pamphlet the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And English education in Ireland has seemed: to some like the bed of [[Procustes]], the bed on which all men that passed that way must lie, be it never so big for them, be it never so small for them: the traveller for whom it was too large had his limbs stretched until he filled it; the traveller for whom it was too small had his limbs chopped off until he fitted into it—comfortably. It was a grim jest to play upon travellers. The English have done it to Irish children not by way of jest, but with a purpose. Our English-Irish systems took, and take, absolutely no cognisance of the differences between individuals, of the differences between localities, of the: differences between urban and rural communities, of the differences springing from a different ancestry, Gaelic or Anglo-Saxon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Scotland===

Attempts were made by legislation, in the later medieval and early modern period, to establish English at first among the aristocracy and increasingly amongst all ranks by education acts and parish schools. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed some ten such acts between 1494 and 1698.

In 1609 nine Gaelic [[tribal chief|chieftains]] were abducted and forced to sign the [[Statutes of Iona]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040718082847/http://www.saorsamedia.com/library/gaelicinscotland.html Gaelic in Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; which would seem to have been designed specifically to [[Anglicize]] leaders and institutions of Gaelic society, in order to bring it under control of central government.

Among the items listed in this agreement was the "planting of the gospell among these rude, barbarous, and uncivill people" by Protestant churches; the outlawing of bards who were traditionally on circuit between the houses of noblemen; the requirement that all men of wealth send their heirs to be educated in Lowland schools where they would be taught to "speik, reid, and wryte Inglische."

The then King [[James VI]], followed this by the [[School Establishment Act 1616]], which sought to establish schools in every parish in the [[Scottish Highlands]] so that "the youth be exercised and trayned up in civilitie, godlines, knawledge, and learning, that the vulgar Inglische toung be universallie plantit, and the Irische language, whilk is one of the chief and principall causes of the continewance of barbaritie and incivilitie amongis the inhabitantis of the Ilis and Heylandis, may be abolisheit and removeit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqE0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95&amp;lpg=PT95|title=Gaelic Scotland: The Transformation of a Culture Region|author=Charles W. J. Withers|date=July 1990|journal=[[Geographical Review]]|volume=80|number=3|pages=327–329|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1709 the [[Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge]] (SSPCK) was established in order to further funding sources for Highland church schools. All manner of incentives and punishments were used to stop children from speaking [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The SSPCK had five schools by 1711, 25 by 1715, 176 by 1758 and 189 by 1808, by then with 13,000 pupils attending. At first the SSPCK avoided using the Gaelic language with the result that pupils ended up learning by rote without understanding what they were reading. In 1741 the SSPCK introduced a Gaelic-English vocabulary, then in 1766 brought in a [[New Testament]] with facing pages of Gaelic and English texts for both languages to be read alongside one another, with more success. After a number of years of unsuccessful attempts at English-only teaching methods, it was realized that literacy in Gaelic was a much more effective means of teaching and a bridge towards fluency in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkX2BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61|page=61|title=National Literacy Campaigns: Historical and Comparative Perspectives|first1=R.F.|last1=Arnove|first2=H.J.|last2=Graff|isbn=978-0-306-42458-8|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1918 education acts have provided for teaching Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas, but development was very slow until Gaelic
became an initial teaching medium in the Gaelic areas of [[Inverness-shire]] and [[Ross-shire]] from 1958. In 1975 the newly created [[Western Isles]] education authority introduced bilingual [[primary education]] shortly followed by [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] Region in [[Skye]]. Gaelic-medium primary education commenced with two schools in 1985, growing to 42 units by 1993/94.

In [[secondary education]], Gaelic has long been taught as a subject—often through the medium of English, even to native speakers. A move towards bilingual secondary education in the [[Western Isles]] was frustrated by a change of government in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 United Kingdom general election]]. Gaelic-medium secondary education has developed less satisfactorily. [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic-medium streams]] followed on from primary in [[Glasgow]] and [[Inverness]], with some experimentation in the Western Isles, but the sector is hampered by acute teacher shortage, and an [[Ofsted]] inspectorate report of 1994 regarded Gaelic-medium secondary education as divisive and inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/document/gaelic/an/i1/i1.html#2.3(Glasgow) |title=Euromosaic – Gaelic in Scotland (United Kingdom) |publisher=Uoc.es |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third level provision through Gaelic is provided by [[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig]] (literally: "the great barn at Ostaig") a Gaelic-medium college based in [[Sleat]], on the Isle of Skye in north west Scotland. It is part of the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]], and also has a campus on [[Islay]] known as [[Ionad Chaluim Chille Ìle]].

In 2004, [[Prince Charles]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], (who is patron of the College) stated  that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The beauty of Gaelic music and song is inescapable. But without the living language, it risks becoming an empty shell. That is why an education system, up to the level represented by the college here in Skye, is so important – to ensure fluency and literacy which will continue to renew the health and creativity of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/speeches/speech-hrh-the-prince-charles-duke-of-rothesay-sabhal-mor-ostaig-isle-of-skye|title=A speech by HRH The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, at Sabhal Mor Ostaig, Isle of Skye|work=princeofwales.gov.uk|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]] is the first piece of legislation to give formal recognition to the Gaelic language in Scotland.  It recognises Gaelic as an official language of Scotland, commanding "equal respect" with English.

Education Minister [[Peter Peacock]], who has ministerial responsibility for Gaelic, said: "This is a momentous day for Gaelic as we open a new chapter in the language's history. We have come a long way since the dark days of 1616 when an Act of Parliament ruled that Gaelic should be 'abolishit and removit' from Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=4560&amp;i=34453|title=Official Report|date=2 February 2005|publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]]|accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornwall===
[[File:DSCN1948PenrynPrayerBookRebellionMemorial.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], Prayer Book Rebellion Memorial, near the site of [[Glasney College]].]] In the [[Prayer Book rebellion]] of 1549, where the English state sought to suppress [[Cornish language]] speaking with the introduction of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which was made available only in English. In replacing [[Latin]] with English, and under the guise of suppressing Catholicism, English was effectively imposed as the language of the Church, with the intent of it becoming the language of the people. At the time people in many areas of [[Cornwall]] did not speak or understand English.

The forced introduction of English to church services in Cornwall  provided a major reason for the rebellion. The articles of the rebels states: "and we the cornyshe men (whereof certen of vs vnderstande no Englysh) vtterly refuse thys new English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Looking at the Mermaid: A Reader in Cornish Literature 900-1900|page=267|editor=[[Alan M. Kent]], [[Tim Saunders]]|publisher=Francis Boutle Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-1903427019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The British Raj===

British records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_goyal_education.htm |title=Education in Pre-British India |publisher=Infinityfoundation.com |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. Subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. The schools were attended by students from all classes of society. Gandhi is said to have described the traditional educational system as a beautiful tree that was destroyed by British rule.

The [[Charter Act]] of 1813 decreed that English would be taught in the Indian education system although not as a replacement for indigenous languages. Instead, it was anticipated that English would co-exist with Oriental studies as a means by which moral law could be reinforced.

The 1817 publication of James Mill's ''History of British India''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=0sITK8fQAK-wEdh_22v1sG6&amp;id=4c8NAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 |title=The history of British India, Volume 6 |author=James Mill, Horace Hayman Wilson |publisher=James Madden |year=1847 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved to be a defining text in the theories of how education policies should be formed (ed. Horace Hayman Wilson: London, Piper, Stephenson and Spence, 1858). Mill advocated the introduction of European knowledge to counter balance Indian traits judged to be irrational. Instilling ideals of reason would accordingly 'reform' Indians by the example of Western systems of thought and outlook. His ideas discredited Indian culture, language and literature even as its assumptions of moral superiority authorised and justified the presence of the British in India.

The current system of education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/educate.htm |title=Western Education in Nineteenth-Century India |publisher=Qub.ac.uk |date=4 June 1998 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415132111/http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/educate.htm |archivedate=15 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced and funded by the British in the 19th century, following recommendations by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]]. Traditional structures were not recognized by the British government and have been on the decline since.

Thomas MacAulay's infamous 'Minute On Indian Education' (1835) encapsulates both the overt and covert agendas for such a policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Macaulay's Children'  is used to refer to people born of Indian ancestry who adopt Western culture as a lifestyle. It is usually used in a derogatory fashion, and the connotation is one of disloyalty to one's country and one's heritage.

The passage to which the term refers is from his 'Minute on Indian Education' delivered in 1835. It reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1835 Lord William Bentninck revitalised the earlier Charter Act with his New Education Policy which determined that English should be the official language of the courts, diplomacy and administration. Prior to this Persian had been the accepted language of diplomacy. Bentninck's motive was ostensibly to "regenerate" society, but the ramifications were boundless. From this moment on only those with Western style education and a knowledge of English were eligible for government employment or for a career in public life.

In 1854 Sir Charles Wood published his Education Dispatch which was aimed at widening the availability of Western oriented knowledge. Universities were established under the London examining model in [[Calcutta]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]], and [[Madras]].

Lord Ripon's Hunter Commission of 1882 somewhat belatedly advocated that there should be increased provision of education at primary level and for women. The theory was that there would be a subsequent rise in the calibre of applicants for third level entry.

The inevitable result was that an Indian-based education was viewed as being second rate in comparison to an English-medium education.

===India===
Private English medium schools are gaining popularity throughout India as urban middle class Indians who feel that English is  the global language send their children to these schools. Increasingly, many poor families too are sending their children to English medium schools due the poor quality of education in Government run vernacular medium schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Malaysia===
{{main|Education in Malaysia}}
Up until 1981 in [[West Malaysia]] (and some years later in [[East Malaysia]]), there were English-medium schools set up by the former British colonial government and Christian missionaries. However, following the implementation of the 1967 National Language Act which stipulated the conversion of all English-medium schools to Malay-medium schools; all English-medium schools were definitely phased out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Hickey|title=Standards of English: Codified Varieties around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2kgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA280|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-85121-3|pages=280–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has now caused many newly graduates to become unemployed as they cannot find jobs especially in the [[private sector]] due to the lack of English proficiency; with the graduates can only depends on [[public sector]] jobs provided by the government.

===Indonesia===
English medium school in Indonesia consists of [[International school]] and [[National Plus school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian National "Plus" and International Schools|url=http://www.expat.or.id/orgs/plusschools.html|work=Living in Indonesia|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A National Plus school in Indonesia refers to a school that offers education beyond the minimum requirements of the national Indonesian accreditation authorities. National Plus school offers some subjects taught in English  and may provide some native English speakers on staff or may offer international curriculum such as from [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) or the [[International Baccalaureate Organisation]] (IBO).
National Plus schools can typically be differentiated from international schools by their core market. International schools tend to primarily exist to serve the needs of expatriate students and national plus schools for Indonesian students; however there is significant overlap on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guides for Foreign Residents &amp; Expats|url=http://livinginindonesia.info/item/national-plus-schools/|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===

The Government of [[Pakistan]] has recently{{when|date=February 2018}} announced the introduction of English lessons on a phased basis to all schools across the country. This new policy states that "English language has been made compulsory from Class-1 onwards" and the "Introduction of English as medium of instruction for science, mathematics, computer science and other selected subjects like economics and geography in all schools in a graduated manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.pk/  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208235230/http://www.moe.gov.pk/ |date=8 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caretaker Minister for Education Mr. Shujaat Ali Beg declared 25 January 2008 that 18 colleges of the city of Karachi would be made ''"Model English Medium Colleges,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interface.edu.pk/students/Jan-08/English-medium-colleges.asp|title=18 colleges declared 'English medium'|work=interface.edu.pk|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===

In [[Bangladesh]] the system of education is divided into three different branches. Students are free to choose anyone of them provided that they have the means. These branches are: The English Medium, The Bengali Medium, and The Religious Branch. In the English Medium system, courses are all taught in English using English books with the exception for Bengali and Arabic. English medium schools are mainly private and thus traditionally were reserved for the upper and upper middle class. However huge demand in urban areas has resulted in large number of English-medium schools mushrooming. This has caused a fall in quality. O and A level exams are arranged through the [[British Council]] in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/systems.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010307131603/http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/systems.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 March 2001 |title=Education in Bangladesh |publisher=Sanisoft.tripod.com |accessdate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Union of Myanmar===

In the [[Burma|Union of Myanmar]], the education system is based on the British Colonial model, due to nearly a century of British and Christian presences. Nearly all schools are government-operated, and also there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools.

===The Philippines===
The United States of America won the [[Philippine–American War]] (1898–1901), and declared the Philippines a US colony. US imperial rule followed. [[Tomás Mac Síomóin|Mac Síomóin]] quotes the Filipino scholar [[E. San Juan]] who made the following comment regarding the use made by the US administration of the English language to rule his country:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Its conquest of hegemony or consensual rule was literally accomplished through the deployment of English as the official medium of business, schooling and government. This pedagogical strategy was designed to cultivate an intelligencia, a middle stratum divorced from its roots in the plebeian masses, who would service the ideological apparatus of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. Americanization was mediated through English, sanctioned as the language of prestige and aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;'Ó Mhársa go Magla' by Tomás Mac Síomóin. First published in 2006. ISSN 1649-3079&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English is used for instruction at the [[University of the Philippines]].

===Slovenia===
[[University of Ljubljana]] teaches at least 100 courses in English.  In ''[[Where to Invade Next]]'', Michael Moore interviews several American citizens studying at the university who were taking courses taught in English.

===South Africa===

====Colonial education====
The earliest European schools in South Africa were established in the Cape Colony in the late seventeenth century by Dutch Reformed Church elders committed to biblical instruction, which was necessary for church confirmation. In rural areas, itinerant teachers (meesters) taught basic literacy and math skills. British mission schools proliferated after 1799, when the first members of the London Missionary Society arrived in the Cape Colony.[8]

Language soon became a sensitive issue in education. At least two dozen English-language schools operated in rural areas of the Cape Colony by 1827, but their presence rankled among devout Afrikaners, who considered the English language and curriculum irrelevant to rural life and Afrikaner values. Throughout the nineteenth century, Afrikaners resisted government policies aimed at the spread of the English language and British values, and many educated their children at home or in the churches.

====Milner Schools====
In order to anglicize the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] area during the [[Anglo Boer war]], [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]] set out to influence British Education in the area for the English-speaking populations. He founded a series of schools known as the "Milner Schools" in South Africa. These schools consist of modern day [[Pretoria High School for Girls]], [[Pretoria Boys High School]], [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], Hamilton Primary School, and St. Marys DSG.

===China===
{{main|Education in China}}
A number of universities are involved English-medium education by International Scholarly Exchange Curriculum program (ISEC program). ISEC program establishes a platform for those universities to communicate with other international institutions who use English-medium education. Other famous universities that offer English-medium education (China-Foreign cooperative universities), such as [[University of Nottingham Ningbo, China]], [[United International College]], [[Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University]], Shanghai Newyork University and Wenzhou-Kean University.

''Euphiction'' is a writing genre where writers do literary "[[cover versions]]" of specific songs, a marriage of musical inspiration with the written word, or a story that works like a three-minute single. The word combines euphonious and [[fiction]].

To write a euphictional story, writers select a song and either use the song's title or a lyric from the song as the title of the story, and then write a story that reflects the song itself. The goal of the piece is to create a literary cover of the song, by emulating the song's message or theme, or simply replicating the mood of the song in the story. The song's influence can be overt or cryptic, or the song can simply be recognized as a kind of soundtrack to the story. Some euphictional writers challenge themselves further by inserting as many of the lyrics from the song into the story. It must be stressed, however, that permission to use lyrics from the musician or band is paramount, especially if seriously considering the publication of the story.

Euphiction is a form of [[flash fiction]], where the maximum word count for the story is 1,000 words, not including the title. The imposed word limit helps to reflect the ephemeral nature of a song.

Euphiction, as a writing genre, fits neatly into [[Warren Ellis]]' concept of burst culture. Euphictional pieces, like the songs that inspire them, are meant to be digested quickly and provide readers with satisfying narratives in bursts. And like music, collected euphiction can be shuffled (read in any order) and encourages repeat readings.

==History==
The term euphiction was originally used in ''Cover Stories: A Euphictional Anthology'', where ten writers each chose different albums and wrote ten stories based on the songs from the selected album. The book collected 100 euphictional stories inspired by the music of [[Combichrist]], the [[Walkmen]], By Hook or Crook, the [[Twilight Singers]] and others. The writers included in the anthology were Simon Neil, Derrek Carriveau, Christian A. Dumais (''Empty Rooms Lonely Countries''), T.P. Whited, Erik Schmidt, Suzi M. (''Nemesis''), A.C. Noia, Derek Handley (''Introduction to the Japanese Language: Nihongo Ganbaroo''), Matt Gamble and N. Pendleton (''What Trees Have Done''). An introduction was written by ''Freddie &amp; Me'' creator [[Mike Dawson (cartoonist)|Mike Dawson]] and an afterword by [[Florida Atlantic University]] Associate Director of Bands, Dr. Sean Murray. The anthology was collected and edited by Dumais.

In February 2010, N. Pendleton's [http://nfpendleton.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/mcast-v3-episode-3-six-euphictions-featuring-the-music-of-nest/ Museioncast Volume 3, Episode 3: "Six Euphictions"], which featured the music of Nest from their self-titled EP, was made available online. Pendleton imposed further restrictions to these euphictional pieces, such as no story could be longer than 500 words, no rewrites, and all six stories had to be recorded for the podcast in one take.

The first officially published euphictional piece was in issue 2 of [[Shock Totem Magazine]], "Leave Me the Way I was Found," written by Christian A. Dumais.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">In [[J. L. Austin]]'s formulation of [[speech act]] theory, a [[performative utterance]] is neither true nor false, but can instead be deemed "felicitous" or "infelicitous" according to a set of conditions whose interpretation differs depending on whether the [[utterance]] in question is a declaration ("I sentence you to death"), a request ("I ask that you stop doing that") or a warning ("I warn you not to jump off the roof").

==Felicity conditions for declarations==
* ''Conventionality of procedure'': the procedure (e.g. an [[oath]]) follows its conventional form
* ''Appropriate participants and circumstances'': the participants are able to perform a felicitous speech act under the circumstances (e.g. a judge can sentence a criminal in court, but not on the street)
* ''Complete execution'': the speaker completes the speech act without errors or interruptions

==Felicity conditions for requests==
* ''Propositional content condition'': the requested act is a future act of the hearer
* ''Preparatory precondition'': 1) the speaker believes the hearer can perform the requested act; 2) it is not obvious that the hearer would perform the requested act without being asked
* ''Sincerity condition'': the speaker genuinely wants the hearer to perform the requested act
* ''Essential condition'': the utterance counts as an attempt by the speaker to have the hearer do an act 

==Felicity conditions for warnings==
* ''Propositional content condition'': it is a future event
* ''Preparatory precondition'': 1) the speaker believes the event will occur and be detrimental to the hearer; 2) the speaker believes that it is not obvious to the hearer that the event will occur
* ''Sincerity condition'': the speaker genuinely believes that the event will be detrimental to the hearer
* ''Essential condition'': the utterance counts as an attempt by the speaker to have the hearer recognize that a future event will be detrimental

'''Flava Works, Inc.''' is a company that produces gay media featuring black and Latino men. Its headquarters are  in [[Miami, Florida]], and it has a satellite office in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

==Overview==
Flava Works was founded in 1999 and is owned and operated by CEO Phillip Bleicher. It began with its "CocoBoyz" website showcasing African-American men in nude and erotic photos and videos. In 2000, Flava Works started "Thugboy", and a year later expanded with the creation of the "CocoDorm." Flava Works moved its operations to Miami, Florida, in 2006 and continues to operate a satellite office in Chicago, Illinois. Flava Works' titles are available in Europe through a distribution partnership with XY Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/34344.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707214942/http://business.avn.com/company-news/34344.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=XY-Studios Celebrates 10 Years |publisher=''AVN'' |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In  July/August 2008, FlavaWorks Cocodorm signed its FIRST white male model, named Snowflake, to sign a 5-year modeling contract to be featured on camera as their first white adult entertainment model and in January 2009, Flava Works announced its production and distribution partnership with RocaFellaz Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/104131 |title=FlavaWorks Announces Production Partnership With Rockafellaz|work=XBIZ|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, Flavaworks announced a distribution partnership with Black Rayne Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=107502 |title=Black Rayne Productions, FlavaWorks Distribution Team Up|work=XBIZ|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Flava Works signed its first white exclusive model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/107943 |title=Flava Works Signs Cody Kyler as Exclusive|work=XBIZ|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products and services==
Flava Works operates several websites offering pornographic images and videos to its patrons including Cocodorm.com, PapiCock.com, ThugBoy.com, CocoBoyz.com, and FlavaMen.com. Thugsforsex.com is an online dating portal for black and Latin men. It has a chat room with video chat capabilities to its users. The CocoDorm is a live, interactive residence where models are hired to live together in a dorm-like environment. The ''Miami Herald'' described the operation as follows: "CocoDorm offers its young, muscular males $1,200 a month along with free room and board while requiring they [[masturbation|masturbate]] and have group sex in front of [web] cameras."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Vasquez, "Miami fights to shutter house where online porn is filmed," The Miami Herald (August 14, 2008), p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Flava Works produces a quarterly magazine, ''FlavaMen'', which showcases the Flava Works models and contains editorials from contributing writers.

==Blatino Awards==
In May 2009, Flava Works announced that it was launching the FlavaMen Blatino Awards, which will honor ethnic clubs, adult performers, and websites in a variety of categories.

==The Chicago controversy==
In 2006, a report surfaced from the Chicago Department of Public Health, which alleged that there was a high level of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, among the models of the Cocodorm. Allegations were also made that the CocoDorm models were engaging in [[Bareback (sex)|bareback sex]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Investigation of a Cluster of Syphilis and HIV Infections associated with an Internet Pornography Site—Chicago, 2006," ''Chicago Department of Public Health, STD|HIV|AIDS Chicago'' (Winter, 2006), pp. 1–2. Available online at [http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/StdHivAidsChgoWinter06.pdf http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/StdHivAidsChgoWinter06.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Flava Works denied the accusations contained in the report.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bejata.com/archives/2006/05/cocodorm_responds.php Bejata.com] for a response by the Cocodorm dated May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "House Next Door" controversy and its legal resolution==
On May 8, 2007, NBC 6 aired a news investigation entitled "The House Next Door." &lt;ref&gt;The investigation can be viewed on the [http://video.nbc6.net/player/?id=101806 NBC 6 website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation surfaced when neighbors and zoning authorities were sent anonymous printed copies of webpages, a DVD of a sex show and of a fight that happened at the dorm, and photos of the red brick home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rodonline.typepad.com/rodonline/2009/02/cocodorm-wins-federal-lawsuit-xxx-shows-can-continue-at-miami-home.html |title=Rod 2.0|work=typepad.com|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary, models were shown half-dressed behind windows, and these images were juxtaposed with those of children playing in the street and unsuspecting neighbors being interviewed. The Miami Department of Code Enforcement visited the residence on May 8, 2007, and imposed five citations:
# Illegal rooming house. Flava Works denied these allegations, on the grounds that the company was not charging any of its models for rent while they were residents in the CocoDorm. 
#Adult entertainment not permitted in C-1 zone property. Flava Works responded stating that they do not run an "Adult Entertainment" service on the property. 
#Failure to Maintain Exterior of Commercial or Residential Property. Flava Works maintained in response that the property's landscape was well maintained and cleaned. 
# Failure to maintain lot in safe, clean condition; not allowing accumulation of debris, trash or dense growth of grass. Flava Works maintained that the yard was in good condition. 
# Illegally operating a business in a residential zone. Flava Works responded that the company was not operating a business at the property; all business activities and Internet servers are located off-site.

On August 13, 2007, and after "three acrimonious public meetings … in sessions going past midnight,&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Archbold, "The Best Little Sex Dorm in Miami …," [http://www.miamisunpost.com/0816cocodorm.htm ''The Miami SunPost'' (August 16, 2007).]&lt;/ref&gt; Miami's Code Enforcement Board ruled that Flava Works was "illegally running an adult entertainment business out of a single-family home … and ordered that those operations cease.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Morales, "Miami Code Enforcement: Porn house illegal, city rules," ''The Miami Herald'' (August 15, 2007), p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Flava Works filed a lawsuit against the City of Miami in response to the verdict, invoking First Amendment rights and arguing that it was not running an adult-oriented business out of the "House Next Door." Flava Works also argued that business transactions do not take place in a residential neighborhood in Miami, but rather in virtual space.&lt;ref&gt;See Michael Vasquez, "Miami fights to shutter house where online porn is filmed," ''The Miami Herald'' (August 14, 2008), p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; The case attracted some interest in legal circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arthur S. Leonard |date=Summer 2008 |title=Internet porn business challenges application of local adult zoning ordinance |journal=Lesbian/Gay Law Notes |pages=134–135 |url=http://www.nyls.edu/documents/justice-action-center/lesbiangay_law_notes/ln0807.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruling on the case was made in January 2009, when Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, ruled in favor of Flava Works.&lt;ref&gt;"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment," United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 07-22370-CIV Cooke/Balestra.&lt;/ref&gt; She based her judgment on the precedent of a very similar case involving a heterosexual porn site, "Voyeur Dorm," operating webcams in a Tampa, Florida, residence. The judge ruling on the Voyeur Dorm case came to the conclusion that the residence provided no "offer[ing] [of adult entertainment] to members of the public." The offering occurs when the videotaped images are dispersed over the internet and into the public eye for consumption &lt;ref&gt;"Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment," United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 07-22370-CIV Cooke/Balestra, p. 6, quoted from {{cite court |litigants=Voyeur Dorm, L.C. v. City of Tampa |vol=265 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1232 |pinpoint=1236–37 |court=11th Cir. |date=2001 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/265/1232/632661/ |accessdate=2017-10-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cooke agreed, writing on the CocoDorm: "Because the public offering by Flava Works, Inc. occurs via cocodorm.com in cyberspace, and not in a particular geographic location, the City of Miami zoning ordinance cannot be applied to the 503 residence.&lt;ref&gt;Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment," pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the servers necessary to transmit the live and recoded video feeds to subscribers are not housed in either the 503 residence or the North Miami avenue business office. Here, although the performers are paid to be at the residence and captured on video, the processing and transmitting of the resulting images is done at a different location; a location not at issue in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment," p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cooke's decision was featured on NBC 6 on February 3, 2009, in a story entitled, "Porn House Can Stay". The report indicated that the City of Miami's intended to appeal the decision &lt;ref&gt;The NBC 6 report can be viewed here: [http://video.nbc6.net/player/?id=986581 http://video.nbc6.net/player/?id=986581].&lt;/ref&gt;

The city appealed, and in June 2010 the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that regardless of whether the CocoDorm was an adult entertainment establishment, it was a business operation, and Miami zoning ordinances forbid operating a business in a residential zone.  The court distinguished the Voyeur Dorm case by pointing out that the latter involved a Tampa ordinance against adult entertainment establishments, not business operations in general.

==Flava Works Inc. v. Gunter lawsuit==
{{main|Flava Works Inc. v. Gunter}}

In 2010 Flava Works filed a lawsuit against Gunter who was operating myVidster.com claiming copyright and trademark infringement. This case became an important case in copyright law as it shows the boundaries of the safe harbour provisions in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. The case resulted in a preliminary injunction in favor of Flava Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2010cv06517/248465/77/0.pdf|title=Memorandum opinion|first=John F.|last=Grady|date=27 July 2011|work=Court rule in favour of plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Frieza'''|フリーザ|Furīza|lead=yes}}, romanized as '''Freeza''' in Japanese merchandise, [[Funimation]]'s English subtitles and [[Viz Media]]'s release of the manga, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. Frieza makes his debut in Chapter #247: {{nihongo4|''Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet Namek''|暗雲うずまくナメック星|An'un Uzumaku Namekkusei}}, first published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine on October 6, 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazines/322264 |title=週刊少年ジャンプ　1989/10/06　表示号数47 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.

Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Frieza is considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as [[Goku]]'s arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. In his appearances in the manga itself, he is also directly responsible for the murder of Goku's father [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Bardock|Bardock]], the [[genocide]] of the Saiyan race, the death of [[Vegeta]], and the second death of Goku's best friend [[Krillin]], arguably making him Goku's [[archenemy|most personal and significant enemy]], and the final confrontation between Goku and Frieza has been hailed as one of the most memorable manga and anime battles ever.

Frieza later appeared as the antagonist in the theatrical film ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F']]'' and as an antagonist and recurring character in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''.

== Creation and conception ==
Frieza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]] and was inspired by [[real estate]] [[Speculation|speculators]], whom Toriyama called the "worst kind of people."&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=261–265|language =Japanese|isbn=4-08-782752-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Frieza is close. Therefore, he paid special attention to how Frieza spoke; because villains typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty.&lt;ref name="SuperHistory"&gt;{{cite book |title=30th Anniversary DRAGON BALL 超史集 - SUPER HISTORY BOOK -|year=2016|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=88–93|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-08-792505-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's name is a pun on [[freezer]], and because of this the members of the [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Ginyu Force|Ginyu Force]] are named after items one would normally put in a refrigerator.&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 天下一伝説|year=2004|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=80–91|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shenlong Times'' issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the ''[[Dragon Ball#Companion books|Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide]]'' guidebook, says that Frieza was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Yū Kondō.&lt;ref name="ST2"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Shenlong Times 2 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |page=6 |year=1995| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frieza so far possesses five transformation forms, each one being quite different and more powerful from the previous ones. It is implied that Frieza's fourth form is actually his basic one, with the other three being transformations that suppress his power in order to conserve it,&lt;ref&gt;'''Vegeta:''' "There are some beings who change their shape as the need arises... for camouflage... to conserve energy." / '''Frieza:''' "Or, in my case, because I become so powerful I can't keep myself under control!" (''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 9, chapter 102)&lt;/ref&gt; while the fifth one unleashes his true power. Toriyama revealed that he did not think to have Frieza transform until about midway through. He said he has a habit of making characters gradually more tough and complex-looking, until finally making them very sleek, as it is a pain to draw them if their appearance is too complex. The author confirmed this is why Frieza's third and most intricate form is only shown for a short time, and joked that three transformations might be one too many.&lt;ref name="SuperHistory"/&gt;

==Appearances==

===''Dragon Ball''===
Before the start of the series, Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta, as Beerus asked him to do so, out of both fear of a potential uprising by the Saiyans due to their increasing power and the prophecy of the coming of the legendary Super Saiyan. Frieza spares only [[Vegeta]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Nappa|Nappa]], and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Raditz|Raditz]], offering them wealth for their loyalty. However, when Raditz's father made a final stand when Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, he did not notice the Saiyan's second son being sent to Earth where he became known as Goku.

Frieza makes his official appearance in the story after Vegeta's defeat on Earth at Goku's hands, having traveled to Planet Namek to find the seven Namekian Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. He and his men massacre Namekian villages one after another, until [[Gohan]], Krillin, and Vegeta begin to hamper his efforts in their own way. Though Frieza manages to gain the Dragon Balls, with the Ginyu Force dealing with the interlopers, his inability to speak Namekian forces him to find the Great Elder of Namek. Frieza ends up fighting Namekian warrior Nail, whom he beats repeatedly until Nail reveals that their fight was only to buy time for [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Dende|Dende]] to give the words needed to activate the Namekian Dragon Balls, for the warriors from Earth. With his entire army killed by Vegeta and the Ginyu Force defeated by Goku, Frieza intercepts Vegeta and the others personally.

Frieza briefly battles Vegeta, with the Saiyan Prince goading him into transforming and revealing his true power. Frieza transforms into his second form, and during the battle he finally admits to be the one who had destroyed the planet where the Saiyans had settled. After defeating Vegeta, Frieza takes on [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], who has at this point fused with Nail. Although Piccolo appears to be even with him, he transforms into his third form and dominates the powerful Namekian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Frieza's Second Transformation|airdate=March 20, 1991|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|number=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a brief tussle with Gohan, Frieza decides to transform into his final form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Another Transformation|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|airdate=March 27, 1991|number=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kills Dende to stop him from healing the others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dende's Demise|number=84|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|airdate=April 3, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mortally wounds Vegeta just as Goku arrives, who just recovered following his fight with the Ginyu Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The End of Vegeta|number=86|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|airdate=April 17, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frieza fights Goku and brutally beats him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Trump Card|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|date=May 29, 1991|number=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Goku manages to seriously wound him with a Genki-Dama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Power of the Spirit|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|date=June 12, 1991|number=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frieza then critically injures Piccolo and murders Krillin, which sends Goku over the edge to assume Super Saiyan form for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Transformed at Last|number=95|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|date=June 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frieza starts to realize that he is outmatched and damages the core of Namek in an act of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title="The Destruction of Planet Namek!? A Demonic Flash Pierces the Ground|number=97|date=June 26, 1991|series=''Dragon Ball Z''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then uses 100% of his power (he had been using 50% up until that point), and regains the advantage, however he cannot sustain this form and is ultimately cut in half. Though Goku spares the crippled Frieza while leaving for his ship to escape the planet's destruction, he ends up seemingly killing Frieza when he makes a final attempt on Goku's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Frieza Defeated!!

A year later, Frieza and King Cold travel to Earth in order to exact revenge on Goku and his friends, but they are confronted by [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], Vegeta and [[Bulma]]'s son from the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Frieza Halved by a Single Stroke!! Another Super Saiyan|number=120|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|date=December 11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief battle, Frieza is sliced to pieces by Trunks and blasted into oblivion, with his father following shortly afterwards. Despite finally being dead, his cells are used as a catalyst for the future villain [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]].

===''Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F''' / ''Dragon Ball Super''===
After Frieza's death, his spirit was kept imprisoned in Earth's Hell, where he was tortured by being forced to endure the playful antics of an overly saccharine cadre of angels while reliving the memories of his defeats at the hands of Goku and Trunks. But fourteen years after Frieza's demise, his two surviving subordinates Sorbet and Tagoma collected all of the Dragon Balls with the aid of the Pilaf Gang and resurrect him as his disemboweled Mecha Frieza form. The two bring Frieza to their ship and use their advanced medical technology to restore Frieza to full organic form. Bent on revenge while learning that Goku defeated Majin Buu and fought Beerus to a stalemate (the only two beings in the universe Frieza was warned never to cross by his father), Frieza decides to undergo four months of intensive training and achieves a new form which he dubs "Golden Frieza" and sets off for Earth with his army. On Earth, the Z Fighters battle Frieza's minions to stall for time so that Goku and Vegeta, off on a training session with the gods Whis and Beerus, can return. Frieza executes his defeated army for their incompetence just as Goku, Vegeta, Beerus, and Whis arrive. Goku and Vegeta reveal their new Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan forms, and battle Frieza, killing Sorbet in the crossfire. Although Frieza's Golden form is stronger than Goku's strongest form, Frieza's stamina can not endure a prolonged fight with this form, and he is eventually cornered by Vegeta. Frieza destroys the Earth in retaliation for his defeat, killing Vegeta while he survives, but Whis rewinds time and allows Goku to kill Frieza once more. Frieza returns to Hell, where he is once more tormented by the angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Key Visual For 2015 Dragon Ball Z Film Reveals Frieza|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-11-17/1st-key-visual-for-2015-dragon-ball-z-film-reveals-frieza/.81112|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later story arc featuring the tournament between the 6th and 7th Universes, Frieza himself does not appear, however his Universe 6 counterpart [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Frost|'''Frost''']] (フロスト, ''Furosuto'') makes an appearance as the second fighter on Team Universe 6. Frieza appears in the manga adaption omake alongside Sorbet and Susami in Hell.

In the Universal Tournament Arc, Frieza becomes the 10th member of the Universe 7 team after Majin Buu is ineligible to fight. When visited by Goku in Hell, later revealed to have mentally trained himself maintain his Golden form, Frieza accepts the offer on the condition of being revived by the Dragon Balls after the tournament. Universe 4 finds out about Frieza's enrollment into the Universe 7 team, and convinces Universe 9 to hire assassins to kill him as he is brought back to the living world by Fortuneteller Babba for 24 hours. Goku meets up with Frieza, but before they can meet up with the others they are stopped by a group of assassins that are claiming their heads. Frieza kills most of the assassins before trapping Goku in an energy attack, taking one of the assassin's communicators as he attempted to deal with Universe 9's leaders to join their group before being forced to destroy the item when Beerus and Whis appear. Beerus believes Frieza is plotting something, but Goku vouches for him and the two return to meet with the rest of their team. During the tournament, meeting Frost and setting up an alliance with him to take out the Saiyans, Frieza forces Universe 9's Roselle to forfeit and then easily disposes of Universe 10's Murichim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Oh, Uncertainty! A Universe Despairs!!|series=''Dragon Ball Super''|number=98|date=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frieza later spots Gohan struggling against Universe 2's Jimeze, eventually deciding to intervene and brutally defeats Jimeze. When Frost appears to commence their arrangement Frieza, revealed to tricked his Universe 6 counterpart, momentarily knocks Gohan out so he can eliminate Frost while his guard was down before aiding Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Androids 17 and 18 in defeating Universe 3's fighter. Frieza becomes one of the four combatants standing alongside Goku, Android 17 and Universe 11's Jiren, unexpectedly teaming up with Goku to force Jiren out in a triple elimination with 17 declared the winner. Frieza is resurrected soon after by Whis at the behest of Beerus as a reward for his efforts and take his leave to begin rebuilding his empire.

Shortly after the Tournament, Frieza will be teaming up with Vegeta and Goku to fight [[Broly]] in the film ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]''.

== Abilities ==
Frieza is capable of moving at superhuman speeds, [[Flight|flying]], and has quick reflexes.&lt;ref name="DBZv9c97"&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 9, chapter 100&lt;/ref&gt; Like most characters in the series, he can harness a supernatural energy known as ''Ki'' and manipulate it into powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy, with which he is able to destroy planets with relative ease. Some of Frieza's signature ''ki'' techniques include the {{nihongo4|Death Beam|デスビーム|Desu Bīmu}}, a sharp piercing beam from his finger, and the {{nihongo4|Death Ball|デスボール|Desu Bōru}}, a large energy sphere he used to destroy planet Namek. He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space, and also seems to possess some form of telekinesis, being able to lift opponents without touching them and cause them to explode.

Frieza's power was so great over time, that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of [[Shapeshifting|physical transformations]] were developed that limit his actual strength.&lt;ref&gt;While other beings in ''Dragon Ball'' transform to increase their power, Frieza transforms to control and contain it. His true form is his fourth form (''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 10, chapter 109), with each of his other transformations meant to restrict his power and conceal it from his enemies. Frieza even says upon transforming to his second state that he has a harder time controlling himself and his power due to the immensity of his current strength (''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 9, chapter 102).&lt;/ref&gt; While changing shape from his "first-form", each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Frieza has three transformed states, each with increasing power, some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes, although the two transformed states (along with his first form) were merely to suppress Frieza's power, and that his third transformed state is actually his true form, while a fourth further transformation that he discovered after his four months of training actually increases his power drastically and lets out most of his latent strength.

;First form
[[File:Frieza Forms 1-3.PNG|thumb|250px|Frieza's first three forms, from right to left.]]
In his weakest form, Frieza is a relatively short humanoid with a large [[chestnut|chestnut-shaped]] skull and two horns. He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 5, chapter 50&lt;/ref&gt; Frieza wears the same upper-body armor and shorts that many of his subordinates are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his "dirty work". Though frail in comparison with his succeeding forms, Frieza still boasts sufficient force to destroy planets.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku|Bardock: The Father of Goku]]'', ©1990 Bird Studio/Toei Animation/Funimation Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; While shifting to his next stage, Frieza breaks his battle-jacket, revealing a natural white armor covering his chest and shoulders.

Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also initially appears in this form.

;Second form
His second form is much larger, both in height and muscle mass. He grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his head curve sharply upwards into near right angles.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 9, chapter 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, Frieza does not have any trouble taking out Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan. However, Frieza notices that Piccolo's power level is about equal to his own level, leaving Frieza with no choice but to transform again. This form largely resembles his father, King Cold.

Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart Frost also takes on a second form, however it bears a greater resemblance to Frieza's third form and is said to be the equivalent of it by Piccolo.

;Third form
Frieza's third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull (like an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]]). His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak. His original horns recede and are now white in color, erupting in pairs along the length of his head. His tail tip, which had been cut off by Kuririn, did not regenerate and he now has a slight hunch. Although his tail was surprisingly not regenerated, the rest of his wounds disappeared as if nothing ever touched him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 10, chapter 108&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fourth form
Drastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final, true form, Frieza's third form (being more like a shell for this final form) cracks and shatters open, revealing a shorter and less bulky appearance. His horns and spikes disappear with his physique becoming entirely streamlined and his skin is now a pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest and shins. All injuries taken in other forms are healed. This is the form that allows him to release his full potential. Frieza is also able to attain 100% power of this form, his muscle mass becoming engorged compared to his previously sleek frame.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 11, chapter 127&lt;/ref&gt; This is the peak of Frieza's natural potential, and the maximum amount of power his body can output. This form gives Frieza enough strength and speed to make even Super Saiyan Goku struggle; however to obtain such power, Frieza's body is subjected to a muscle strain, which slowly lowers his energy, reducing his speed until he cannot compete with Super Saiyan Goku anymore. This transformation is therefore not suitable for prolonged combat, with Frieza trying to finish the fight as quickly as possible by destroying Planet Namek.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 11, chapter 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also briefly uses this form during the Tournament of Power.

;Mecha Frieza
After being cut in half by his own attack and being caught in Namek's huge explosion, what remains of the still-living Frieza is salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold; this form is referred to as {{nihongo4|Mecha Frieza|メカフリーザ}} in video games. The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced, as is his left arm from the shoulder down, with scarring and metal accoutrements covering what little was left of his organic self. It is stated that these enhancements have made him even more powerful. However, he was never able to unleash his full power in this form, since he was quickly destroyed by Trunks.&lt;ref&gt;'''Frieza:''' "With the two of us together, it will be no trouble. I could probably do it by myself, since I've grown even more powerful." (''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 12, chapter 136)&lt;/ref&gt;

;Golden Frieza
Frieza attains another transformation in the 2015 film ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F']]'' and ''Dragon Ball Super''. According to Frieza, his fifth transformation is achieved after undergoing intensive training for four months, enabling him to gain the strength to progress even further beyond his previous transformations by drawing out all of his latent power (as he had never trained a day in his life beforehand).&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Fukkatsu no F manga, chapter April 1 issue of 2015 V-Jump'' February 21, 2015''&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, Frieza's physique is similar to his previous fourth form except his skin is now a golden color as opposed to white, with purple sections on his head, chest, forearms and shins, thus he is known as {{nihongo4|"Golden Frieza"|ゴールデンフリーザ|Gōruden Furīza}} in this form. In this form at peak power, Frieza is able to overpower Goku in his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form with relative ease. This form however, drains his energy much like when he used 100% of his power in his fourth form, due to him not training himself further to become accustomed to the form, and thus is also unsuitable for prolonged combat, as he soon finds himself unable to compete with Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan forms. After his second revival, Frieza reveals he mastered his Golden form due to intense meditation while in hell. This "True Golden Frieza" can be used indefinitely without any drain on Frieza's stamina or even while he is barely conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Worst! The Most Evil! Frieza's Rampage!|series=''Dragon Ball Super''|number=95|date=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frieza's Japanese voice actor, Ryūsei Nakao jokingly placed Golden Frieza's power level at “one hundred [[quintillion]]” (or 1.2 billion times stronger than the Fourth form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buzz-plus.com/article/2015/04/21/dragon-z/|title=映画『ドラゴンボールZ 復活のF』の亀仙人が強すぎて観客がビビる！ その件について鳥山明先生がコメント - バズプラスニュース Buzz+|date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dragon Ball Heroes]] there is a version of Golden Frieza called "Rage Golden Frieza" which is an empowered version of Golden Frieza fuelled by Rage which also appears in Super as well.

;Full-Powered form
In the GT live action stage play, it shows Frieza had gain this transformation alongside Cell who escaped Hell and searching for Goku They easily beat Trunks but Pan tricks them into Searching Goku elsewhere.

== Appearances in other media ==
In numerous filler episodes of the anime and ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief, causing trouble in Hell, having somehow been permitted to keep his body despite his wrongdoings. In Hell, he is defeated and sent to prison by Goku and Pikkon along with Cell, his father and the Ginyu Force, and he is later seen watching Goku's final battle with Majin Buu in a crystal ball, comically hoping for Goku to lose. In ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn]]'', Frieza briefly escapes from Hell with an army of villains to attack Earth, but he is swiftly defeated by Gohan. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', when Goku is sent to Hell by accident, Frieza and Cell confront him, their bodies having been rendered temporarily immortal due to the unbalance between the two worlds. Using a joint attack, Frieza and Cell send Goku to a lower level where he is frozen by a witch, but the two villains end up frozen themselves when they foolishly venture downwards to gloat at Goku. Goku accidentally breaks the ice holding Frieza and Cell and it shatters to pieces, implying that Frieza and Cell have been erased from existence. However, in a future scene, Frieza and Cell are seen being taken away in a jail cell with tape over their mouths and appear in the live action GT show where he and Cell gained new forms to track down Goku. He appeared in a TV ad for ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'', as he makes a non-speaking appearance in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Dragon Ball Film's TV Ad Has Voice Cameo by Cell |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-03-21/2013-dragon-ball-film-tv-ad-has-voice-cameo-by-cell |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=March 21, 2013 |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appears in a chapter of Toriyama's ''[[Neko Majin]]'' manga, published in August 2003, which also introduces Frieza's son, {{nihongo4|Kuriza|クリーザ}}. He briefly appears in the 2006 ''Dragon Ball'' crossover chapter, {{nihongo4|"This is the Police Station in front of Dragon Park on Planet Namek"|こちらナメック星ドラゴン公園前派出所|Kochira Namekku-sei Dragon Kōen-mae Hashutsujo}}, of [[Osamu Akimoto]]'s manga ''[[Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Akimoto|first1= Osamu|authorlink1= Osamu Akimoto|title= Super Kochikame|series=''[[Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo]]''|date= September 15, 2006|publisher= [[Shueisha]]|language= Japanese|isbn= 4-08-874096-3|chapter= This is the Dragon Police Station in front of the Park on Planet Namek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frieza appears in Naho Ōishi's 2011 ''Dragon Ball'' spin-off manga ''[[Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock|Episode of Bardock]]'', but it predominately features his ancestor {{nihongo4|Chilled|チルド}}. He also appears in Toriyama's 2014 ''[[Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child]]'' special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama |first=Akira |date=January 6, 2015 |title=Jaco the Galactic Patrolman |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |pages=232–247 |isbn= 978-1-4215-6630-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frieza has made numerous appearances in other media. The Japanese nu metal/hardcore punk band [[Maximum the Hormone]] released the song "[[Tsume Tsume Tsume/F|F]]" as part of a double A-side single on July 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B001A4NX5O|title=爪爪爪/「F」|accessdate=December 30, 2016|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entirety of the song references Frieza, with the single itself rising as high as number two on the [[Oricon]] music chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumthehormone.jp/news.html|title=MAXIMUM THE HORMONE -Official English Website-|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was the source of reference used by Toriyama for the title of the film ''Fukkatsu no F'' and is featured in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximum the Hormone Performs 'Battle Song' for 2015 Dragon Ball Film|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-01-04/maximum-the-hormone-performs-battle-song-for-2015-dragon-ball-film/.82889|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 4, 2015|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seikima-II]] frontman [[Demon Kakka]] wrote and performed the song {{nihongo4|"Tada Kogoeru Elegy ~The Theme of Frieza~"|ただ凍える挽歌(Elegy)〜The Theme Of FREEZER〜}} that appeared in two episodes of ''Dragon Ball Kai'' and on the 2009 ''Dragon Ball Kai Song Collection'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragonball Kai Song Collection |url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/COCX-35798|website=''cdjapan.co.jp''|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the manga ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]'', the character [[List of Black Cat characters#Sven Vollfied|Sven Vollfied]] is often seen using his cell phone with a wrist strap of a miniature-sized badge of Frieza's head.&lt;ref name="BlackCat"&gt;''Black Cat'' manga, chapter 6, page 153&lt;/ref&gt; A [[caricature]] of Frieza mixed with a [[grey alien]] was parodied as a [[Mecha|mech pilot]] in an episode of ''[[Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Hook Up!

=== Video games ===
Frieza has been featured in many of the video games based on the series. Often, he's both a [[playable character]] and [[Boss (video games)|boss]], though more frequently the latter. He is also usually able to transform into his many different forms.

Frieza appears in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] game (and later [[Playdia]] remake) ''[[Dragon Ball Z Gaiden: Saiyajin Zetsumetsu Keikaku (video game)|Dragon Ball Z Gaiden: Saiyajin Zetsumetsu Keikaku]]''. Frieza seems to be somehow resurrected, and he and other past villains start attacking Goku and his friends. Once it's revealed these are merely ghost-warriors meant to distract the heroes, however, the false Frieza and his allies are easily dealt with. Other games highlight Frieza in alternate story paths; including those where he successfully attains immortality and goes on to threaten Earth such as ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai]]'', and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2]]'' where Frieza and Cell are resurrected and controlled by [[Bobbidi]] as a distraction for the player.

Frieza also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', ''[[Battle Stadium D.O.N]]'', and ''[[J-Stars Victory Vs]]''.

== Voice actors ==
[[File:ChrisAyres.jpg|thumb|Chris Ayres has been Frieza's voice actor since ''[[Dragon Ball Z Kai]]''.]]
In the original Japanese version, Frieza is voiced by [[Ryūsei Nakao]] in all media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.81produce.co.jp/list.cgi?man%204111058273030|title=女性俳優：81produce|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, Frieza was voiced by [[Linda Young]] in the original Funimation dub of ''Dragon Ball Z'' and all subsequent media up until the first episode of ''[[Dragon Ball Z Kai]]''. He has since been voiced by [[Christopher Ayres]] in all media. Due to Ayres being diagnosed with end-stage [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)]] and requiring a double lung transplant, he has since been voiced by his understudy Daman Mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' Casts Chris Ayres as Frieza|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-04-25/dragon-ball-z-resurrection-f-casts-chris-ayres-as-frieza/.87533|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his treatment, Ayres returned to voice Frieza for the film ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/VoiceOfVegeta/status/1020145450056220677&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Yū Kondō, Toriyama's second editor from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell, and Fuyuto Takeda, his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series, said that ''Dragon Ball'' hit its peak in popularity during the Frieza arc. In a one-thousand ballot popularity poll held in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'', ''Dragon Ball'' received 815 of them.&lt;ref name="Shenlong1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shenlong Times 1 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 1: COMPLETE ILLUSTRATIONS |publisher=Shueisha |year=1995 |language =Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, fans of the series voted Frieza the ninth most popular character for a poll in the book ''Dragon Ball Forever''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dragon Ball Forever |year=2004 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |isbn=4-08-873702-4|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frieza was mentioned as one of the "most beloved characters" in an article by ''[[GamePro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/57390/the-real-dbz-rundown-page-2/ |title=The Real DBZ Rundown -- Page 2, page 2, Feature Story from GamePro |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607145138/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/57390/the-real-dbz-rundown-page-2/ |archivedate=June 7, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The casting and direction of his English voices has often been criticized over the years, with [[IGN]]'s Ramsey Isler writing that, coupled with the ambiguous physical features, the "old lady" voice lead to some gender confusion with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://anime.ign.com/articles/865/865869p2.html|title= What's Wrong With Dragon Ball Z Part One, Even Goku's popular anime franchise isn't perfect.|accessdate= January 18, 2009|last= Isler|first= Ramsey|publisher= [[IGN]]|date= April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ledger]]'''s December 8, 1999, paper, names him as one of the reasons that ''Dragon Ball Z'' was listed as a violent show for children stating, "In one recent episode, beads of sweat form on the brow of a character named Vegeta, as he is nearly strangled to death by an evil foe named Frieza. In another, Frieza uses the horns on his head to impale a good guy named Kuririn through the chest." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0u4SAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vv0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3775,9543409&amp;dq=frieza%20dbz%20-tv-com|title=Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as opinions on his appearance: "Little Gohan is abruptly in the icy metallic grip of one of his arch-nemeses [''sic''], Frieza, a silvery [[androgynous]] giant who looks like a cross between the monster in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and [[Batman]]'s [[Mr. Freeze]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/international-incident-6396506|title=International incident|first=Jimmy|last=Fowler|date=January 20, 2000|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Project Physics Text cover.jpg|thumb|''Project Physics'', cover, main text]]
'''Harvard Project Physics''', also called '''Project Physics''', was a national [[curriculum development]] project to create a [[secondary school]] [[physics education]] program in the United States during the [[Cold War]] era. 

==History==
The project was active from 1962 to 1972, and produced the ''Project Physics'' series of texts, which were used in physics classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s. The project was centered at [[Harvard University]], but drew from schools and educators from across the country. The directors of this project were: [[F. James Rutherford]], project coordinator (and after completion of the project, professor of [[science education]] at [[New York University]]); [[Gerald Holton]], professor of physics and of the [[history of science]] at Harvard University; and [[Fletcher Watson|Fletcher G. Watson]], professor of science education at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].

==Course materials==
Project Physics course work was broken into six main subject areas, organized into separate books each called a "Project Physics Text and Handbook" or "Student Guide":&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection Project Physics Collection at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Concepts of Motion
#Motion in the Heavens
#The Triumph of Mechanics
#Light and Electromagnetism
#Models of the Atom 
#The Nucleus

The books presented the material from a historical perspective, with aspects of human interest wrapped into the text. The intent was to build a sophisticated conceptual understanding of physics, while not over-simplifying the curriculum. Frequent references to historical works where concepts were first discovered and debated highlighted the drive to make physics a fundamental search for understanding of the universe.&lt;ref name="AOTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=High School Reform Projects: Physics|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/mos/5.2.html|website=artofteachingscience.org|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course materials also included readers, tests, and other teaching aids. The course readers allowed students to further explore a topic, and lab exercises enabled students to verify that their understanding was confirmed by experimental outcomes. Special lab equipment, brief film loops, films, and a teacher's guide were also developed.&lt;ref name="AOTS" /&gt; The texts and all other aids are now available for free on the Project Physics Collection web site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Māori mythology]], '''Haumia-tiketike''' or '''Haumia''' (also '''Haumia-roa''', and '''Haumia-tikitiki''') is the god (''[[atua]]'') of the fernroot and uncultivated plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/955| title=Māori Dictionary search results for 'Haumia-tiketike'| publisher=John C Moorfield| accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is particularly associated with the starchy rhizome (''aruhe'') of the ''[[Pteridium esculentum]]''{{efn|name=differentbracken|Elsdon Best in his book, ''Maori Religion and Mythology Part 1'', wrote that the Māori ate the rhizomes of ''Pteris aquilina'',&lt;ref name="MiReligion&amp;Myths"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elsdon Best|date=1924|title=Maori Religion and Mythology Part 1|publisher=Dominion Museum|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]''.}} (''rarauhe''), which became a major element of the Māori diet in former times.&lt;ref name="MiReligion&amp;Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/6554| title=Māori Dictionary search results for 'rarauhe'| publisher=John C Moorfield| accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasts with his brother [[Rongo]], the god of the [[Sweet potato#New Zealand|kumara]] and all cultivated plants.

In different regional and tribal variations of the stories involving him, he is often a son or grandson of [[Rangi and Papa|Rangi (Raki)]] and/or [[Rangi and Papa|Papa]].

==Separation of the primordial parents==
In the [[Arawa (canoe)|Arawa]] version of the origin story, Haumia was a son of Rangi and Papa, and agreed to the forced separation of his parents. Because of this he was subjected to the fury of his brother [[Tāwhirimātea]], god of winds and storms, who would have killed him if their mother had not hidden him in her body, that is, in the ground. While he escaped from Tāwhirimātea, he was later discovered by [[Tūmatauenga|Tū]], god of war (here representing [[humankind]]), who saw Haumia's hair (bracken fronds) sticking up out of the earth&lt;ref name="MiReligion&amp;Myths"/&gt; (Grey 1956:7-10, Orbell 1998:29, Tregear 1891:54).

==Bracken==
[[Image:Fern dsc06699.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Haumia-tiketike is the deity associated with wild plants such as the [[Pteridium esculentum|bracken fern]].]]
{{Main article|Pteridium esculentum}}

Food-quality rhizomes were only obtained from bracken growing in deep, moderately fertile soils. Bracken became abundant after the arrival of Māori, "mainly a result of burning to create open landscapes for access and ease of travel" (McGlone et al., 2005:1). Rhizomes were dug in early summer and dried for use in the winter. Although it was not liked as much as kumara, it was appreciated for its ready availability and the ease with which it could be stored (Orbell 1998:29).

The rhizomes were air-dried so that they could be stored and become lighter; for consumption, they were briefly heated and then softened with a'' patu aruhe'' (rhizome pounder); the starch could then be sucked from the fibres, or collected to be prepared for a larger feast. Several distinct styles of ''Patu aruhe'' were developed.

The plants of the bracken genus (''[[Bracken|Pteridium]]'') contain the known carcinogen [[ptaquiloside]],&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher M.T., Hayes P.Y., Somerville M.J., De Voss J.J."Ptesculentoside, a novel norsesquiterpene glucoside from the Australian bracken fern Pteridium esculentum".  Tetrahedron Letters. 51 (15) (pp 1997-1999), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; identified to be responsible for [[bleeding|haemorrhagic]] disease, as well as [[esophageal cancer]], and [[gastric cancer]] in humans.

==Genealogy==
* Haumia is a son of Rangi and Papa, according to the tribes of the Arawa canoe.
* [[Elsdon Best]] noted that Haumia was not recognised as a son of Rangi and Papa by the tribes of the [[Tākitimu]] canoe.&lt;ref name="MiReligion&amp;Myths"/&gt;
* In the southern [[Bay of Plenty]] and parts of the east coast, Haumia is a son of [[Tāne]], who is the son of Rangi and Papa (Orbell 1998:29).
* In the southern [[Ngāi Tahu|Kāi Tahu]] version, Haumia is a son of Tamanuiaraki (Tama-nui-a-raki), who is a son of [[Rangi and Papa|Raki]] and Hekehekeipapa (Hekeheke-i-papa) (White 1887-1891, I:20).

{{IPA notice}}

'''Kurdish phonology''' is the sound system of the [[Kurdish language|Kurdish language continuum]]. This article includes the phonology of the three Kurdish dialects in their standard form respectively. Phonological features include the distinction between [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[Unaspirated consonant|unaspirated]] [[Stop consonant|voiceless stop]]s and the presence of facultative phonemes.{{sfnp|Khan|Lescot|1970|pp=3-7}}{{sfnp|Haig|Matras|2002|p=5}}

* {{IPA|/n, t, d/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̪}}, {{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}]}}, while {{IPA|/s, z/}} are dentalized laminal alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|s̪}}, {{IPA link|z̪}}]}},{{sfnp|Khan|Lescot|1970|p=5}} pronounced with the blade of the tongue very close to the back of the upper front teeth, with the tip resting behind lower front teeth.
*Kurdish contrasts plain alveolar {{IPA|/l/}} and velarized [[postalveolar]]{{sfnp|Sedeeq|2017|p=82}} {{IPA|/ɫ/}} lateral approximants. Unlike in English, the sounds are separate phonemes rather than [[allophone]]s.{{sfnp|Rahimpour|Dovaise|2011|p=75}}
*Postvocalic {{IPA|/d/}} is [[lenition|lenited]] to an approximant {{IPAblink|ð̞}}. This is a regional feature occurring in other Iranian languages as well and called by Windfuhr the "Zagros d".{{sfnp|Windfuhrt|2012|p=597}}
*Kurdish has two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] sounds; the [[alveolar flap]] ({{IPA|/ɾ/}}) and the [[alveolar trill]] ({{IPA|/r/}}). While the former is alveolar, the latter has an [[alveo-palatal]] articulation.{{sfnp|Rahimpour|Dovaise|2011|pp=75-76}}
*According to {{Harvcoltxt|Hamid|2015}}, {{IPA|/x, xʷ, ɣ, ɣʷ/}} are uvular {{IPA|[{{IPA link|χ}}, χʷ, {{IPA link|ʁ}}, ʁʷ]}} in Central Kurdish.{{sfnp|Hamid|2015|p=18}}
*Northern Kurdish distinguishes between aspirated and unaspirated [[voiceless stop]]s, which can be aspirated in all positions. Thus {{IPA|/p/}} contrasts with {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} with {{IPA|/tʰ/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} with {{IPA|/kʰ/}}, {{IPA|/q/}} with {{IPA|/qʰ/}}, and the affricate {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} with {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰ/}}.{{sfnp|Haig|Matras|2002|p=5}}{{sfnp|Rahimpour|Dovaise|2011|p=75}}{{sfnp|Campbell|King|2000|p=899}}
*Although {{IPAblink|ɥ}} is considered an allophone of {{IPA|/w/}}, some phonologists argue that it should be considered a phoneme.{{sfnp|Fattahi|Anonby|Gheitasi|2016}}
*Kurdish distinguishes between the plain {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} and the velarized {{IPA|/sˠ/}} and {{IPA|/zˠ/}}. These velarized counterparts are less emphatic than the Semitic [[emphatic consonant]]s.{{sfnp|Fattah|2000|pp=96-97}}{{sfnp|McCarus|1958|pp=12}}
*{{IPAblink|ɲ}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} in Southern Kurdish, occurring in the about 11 to 19 words that have the consonant group {{angbr|nz}}. The word ''yânza'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[jɑːɲzˠa]}}.{{sfnp|Fattah|2000|pp=97-98}}

===Labialization===
*Kurdish has labialized counterparts to the velar plosives, the voiceless velar fricative and the uvular stop. Thus {{IPA|/k/}} contrasts with {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} with {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}} with {{IPA|/xʷ/}}, and {{IPA|/q/}} with {{IPA|/qʷ/}}.{{sfnp|Gündoğdu|2016|pp=61-62}} These labialized counterparts do not have any distinct letters or [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]. Examples are the word ''xulam'' ('servant') which is pronounced as {{IPA|[xʷɪˈlɑːm]}}, and ''qoç'' ('horn') is pronounced as {{IPA|[qʷɨnd͡ʒ]}}.{{sfnp|Gündoğdu|2016|p=65}}

===Palatalization===
*After {{IPA|/ɫ/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} is palatalized to {{IPA|[tʲ]}}. An example is the Central Kurdish word ''gâlta'' ('joke'), which is pronounced as {{IPA|[gɑːɫˈtʲæ]}}.{{sfnp|Rahimpour|Dovaise|2011|p=75}}
*{{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are strongly palatalized before the front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} as well as {{IPAblink|ɥ}}, becoming acoustically similar to {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}.{{sfnp|Haig|Matras|2002|p=5}}
*When preceding {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, {{IPA|/s, z/}} are palatalized to {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. In the same environment, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} also becomes {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurdish language i. History of the Kurdish language|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i|website=Iranicaonline|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharyngealization===
*In some cases, {{IPA|/p, t, k, s, z/}} are [[pharyngealized]] to {{IPA|[pˤ, tˤ, kˤ, sˤ, zˤ]}}. For example, the word ''sed/ṣed'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[ˈsˤɛd]}}{{sfnp|Rahimpour|Dovaise|2011|p=75}}{{sfnp|Thackston|2006a|pp=1-2}}{{sfnp|Thackston|2006b|pp=2-4}}
*Furthermore, while {{IPA|[fˤ]}} and {{IPA|[ɡˤ]}} are unique to Central Kurdish,{{sfnp|Asadpour|Mohammadi|2014|p=109}} Northern Kurdish has {{IPA|[t͡ʃˤ]}}.{{sfnp|Thackston|2006b|p=2}}

===Facultative consonants===
*{{IPA|/ħ/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} are non-native phonemes that are mostly present in words of Arabic origin. Even though they are usually replaced by {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/x/}} respectively, they are facultative. Thus the word ''heft/ḧeft'' ('seven' {{IPA|/ˈħɛft/}}) can be pronounced as either {{IPA|[ˈhɛft]}} or {{IPA|[ˈħɛft]}}, and ''xerîb/ẍerîb'' ('stranger', {{IPA|/ɣɛˈriːb/}}) as either {{IPA|[xɛˈriːb]}} or {{IPA|[ɣɛˈriːb]}}.{{sfnp|Khan|Lescot|1970|p=6}}
*{{IPA|/ʕ/}} is only present in words of Arabic and Persian origin and is only present in initial position.{{sfnp|Asadpour|Mohammadi|2014|p=114}} An Arabic loanword like "Hasan" would thus be pronounced as {{IPA|/ʕɛˈsɛn/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.26 Pharyngeal substitution |website=Dialects of Kurdish |url=http://kurdish.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/pharyngeal-substitution/ |publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phoneme is absent in some Northern and Southern Kurdish dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1.27 Pharyngeal retention in ‘animal’|url=http://kurdish.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/pharyngeal-retentionloss-animal/ |website=Dialects of Kurdish |publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowels==
The vowel inventory differs by dialect, some dialect having more vowel phonemes than others. {{IPA|/iː, ʊ, uː, ɛ, eː, oː, ɑː/}} are the only vowel phonemes present in all three Kurdish dialects.

===Notes===
*In Central Kurdish, {{IPA|/a/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|æ}}, except before {{IPA|/w/}} where it becomes mid-centralized to {{IPAblink|ə}}. For example, the word ''gawra'' ('grey' or 'fair-skinned') is pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡəwˈɾæ]}}.{{sfnp|Thackston|2006a|p=3}}
*{{IPA|/ɪ/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|ɨ}} in certain environments.{{sfnp|Thackston|2006a|p=1}}{{sfnp|Thackston|2006b|p=1}}{{sfnp|Gündoğdu|2016|p=62}}
*In some words, {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are realized as {{IPAblink|ɨ}}. This allophone occurs when {{angbr|i}} is present in a closed syllable that ends with {{IPA|/m/}} and in some certain words like ''dims'' ('molasses'). The word ''vedixwim'' ('I am drinking') is thus pronounced as {{IPA|[vɛdɪˈxʷɨm]}},{{sfnp|Thackston|2006b|p=1}} while ''dims'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[dɨms]}}.{{sfnp|Gündoğdu|2016|p=61}}

===Facultative vowels===
*{{IPA|/øː/}} only exists in Southern Kurdish, represented by {{angbr|ö}}. In Northern Kurdish, it is only present facultatively in loan words from [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as it mostly merges with {{IPA|/oː/}}. The word ''öks'' (from Turkish ''ökse'' meaning 'clayish mud') is pronounced as either {{IPA|[øːks]}} or {{IPA|[oːks]}}.{{sfnp|Khan|Lescot|1970|p=16}}

A '''lamba''' is the traditional garment worn by  men and women that live in  [[Madagascar]]. The textile, highly emblematic of Malagasy culture, consists of a rectangular length of cloth wrapped around the body.&lt;ref&gt;Tortora, P.G. &amp; Merkel, R.S. (1996). ''Fairchild's Dictionary of Textiles.'' New York: Fairchild Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional lambas used for burial were often made of [[silk]] and cow hides while those for daily wear were more often made of [[raffia]], pig skin, [[cotton]] or [[Bast fibre|bast]]. They could range in color from a tie-dyed mess or solid white cloth, to striped red, white and black cloth found in most parts of the island, the geometric patterns in unique shades of green and brown produced by a handful of [[Sakalava]] villages, or the brilliantly multi-colored, complex weaves favored by the pre-colonial [[Merina]] aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. (Ed.). (1996). "Madagascar", in ''The Dictionary of Art, Volume 20''. London: Macmillan Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is common to find printed cotton or rayon lambas produced in India for the Malagasy market in addition to those fabricated locally.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;Green, R.L. (2003). Lamba hoany: proverb cloths from Madagascar. ''Africa Arts, 36''(22), pp. 30–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides its daily use as basic clothing, the lamba is also used for tying children to mothers' backs or as a cushion when carrying a heavy object on top of the head. The lamba is also used ritually to wrap the remains of the dead before placing them in the family tomb. Which after the ceremony are then 
placed on the dead for an order of respect to their souls.

==In Malagasy culture==
[[File:Merina woman wearing lamba.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Merina woman in a white lamba]]
The term ''lamba'' is the name in the Highlands dialect of the woven cloth that traditionally formed the essential article of clothing throughout Madagascar.  This garment is known by other words in various regions where other dialects are spoken; in some parts of the east, for instance, the garment is known by the word ''simbo''.&lt;ref name="envoys"&gt;Mullen Kreamer, Christine and Fee, Sarah. ''Objects as Envoys: Cloth, Imagery and Diplomacy in Madagascar.'' Smithsonian Institution, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the ways in which the cloth may be wrapped around the wearer are specified by a wide variety of terms that vary from region to region.&lt;ref name="envoys"/&gt; The color, print and type of cloth varies from region to region.  The largest lambas (''lambamena'') are made of a heavy white silk and are used to wrap the bodies of the deceased before placing them in [[architecture of Madagascar|the family tomb]].  Among some ethnic groups, lambas were also traditionally exchanged between a man and woman as part of their engagement ceremony, or as diplomatic gifts, as demonstrated by the two detailed silk ''lamba akotofahana'' (one multicolored, the other white-on-white) given in 1886 to President [[Grover Cleveland]] by Queen [[Ranavalona III]] on display at the [[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of African Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmafa.si.edu/exhibits/malagasy/queen.html ''Gifts and Blessings: The Textile Arts of Madagascar.''] Smithsonian National Museum of African Art. Accessed on November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
[[File:Lamba of Madagascar - comparison coastal style.JPG|thumb|lright|Colorful prints from Asia are popular in coastal towns.]]
There are numerous types of lambas produced in Madagascar.  The names can serve to distinguish the material used, pattern type, ritual purpose of the garment or the intended wearer.  Names of lambas vary from one region to the next according to local dialects, so the list below is not exhaustive but rather representative of some of the most commonly distinguishable types of lamba.It is many types in Madagascar

====Lambahoany====
[[File:Lamba of Madagascar - detail lambahoany.JPG|thumb|right|Lambahoany reading ''Coming home is lovely'']]
A printed cotton lamba typically featuring a proverb on the lower border of the design, identical to the [[Kanga (African garment)|kangas]] worn throughout eastern Africa.  The lambahoany is presently the most commonly worn type of lamba.  These are traditionally made of printed cotton featuring a repeated border design that encloses either a secondary pattern (often around a central medallion) or a large image depicting a pastoral scene from daily life.  A popular proverb, or ''[[hainteny#Ohabolana|ohabolana]]'', is typically written just above the center of the lower border. 
The uses of the ubiquitous lambahoany are numerous and varied.  They are often wrapped to attach an infant to its mother's back, freeing her hands for other uses.  They may also serve as light blankets, sheets, an apron, a transport sack, a table cloth or a sunshade, and when tightly coiled they can be used as a cushion when carrying heavy objects on top of the head.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

====Lamba akotofahana====
A woven silk lamba featuring highly complex geometric designs.

====Lamba mpanjaka====
A ceremonial lamba traditionally worn by nobles, the wealthy, or elders.

====Lambamena====
[[File:Madagascar lambas in shop.JPG|thumb|Lambamena shop]]
A silk burial shroud.

====Lamba arindrano====
A traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and cotton.

====Jabo-landy====
A traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and raffia fibers.

====Laimasaka====
A traditional [[Sakalava]] raffia lamba commonly decorated with geometric [[ikat]]-dyed patterns and often used as a burial shroud.
It is still a tradition in Madagascar..

====Salaka====
A lamba worn as a loincloth, measuring about 30&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 300&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name="envoys"/&gt;

===Modes of use===
[[File:Hira gasy musicians 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|Hiragasy musicians wearing coordinating lambas]]
The style of wearing the lamba likewise varies between regions and according to the gender of the wearer.  Both sexes will wrap it around the waist, much like a sarong.  Women will also wear it wrapped over or beneath the bust to form a sheath dress, often with matching lamba headdress.  These styles can be paired with a tank top or other light shirt.

Men may drape the lamba over one shoulder as a shawl over shorts or – in cooler weather – over a ''malabary,''  a long-sleeved, knee-length cotton tunic.  Traditionally, the lamba is draped over the left shoulder but is draped over the right when in mourning.  Among mature [[Merina]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Betsileo]] women, wearing a narrower version of the traditionally white lamba around the shoulders is a mark of "elegance, dignity, femininity and respect for tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Ranaivoson, D. (2007). ''100 Mots pour comprendre Madagascar.''  Paris: Maisonneuve &amp; Larose. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrow lambas may be worn like a sash.  Men drape them diagonally across the chest or knot them around the waist, while women may wear them loosely over the shoulders.  The sash-like fashion was popularized due to European influence and is especially typical of the costume of [[hiragasy]] dancers.

==Production==
Traditional lambas were most often woven on horizontal ground looms, the most common type of loom found in Madagascar. The weaver was most often a woman and would be seated to one side of the loom as she worked the threads.&lt;ref name="unwrapping"&gt;Kusimba, Chapurukha; Odland, J. Claire; Bronson, Bennet (Eds.). ''Unwrapping the Textile Traditions of Madagascar.'' Regents of the University of California, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For many women, weaving formed a basic domestic responsibility required to produce clothing for family members. Surplus could be sold to supplement family income; this occurred most often among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands.&lt;ref name="envoys"/&gt;

==As art==
[[File:Lamba of Madagascar - three styles of lambahoany.JPG|thumb|left|Three lambahoany showing pastoral scenes from daily life]]
The ''lamba akotofahana,'' the highly colorful lamba weaving style associated with the [[andriana|Merina aristocracy]], consisted of complex geometric designs created by the uniquely [[Merina]] practice of using extra heddles across the loom to create raised bands of pattern.  This striking statement of [[andriana]] class distinction in the imperial era was preserved in a toned-down form under colonial rule: the same intricate patterns were retained but the designs were woven in white-on-white to draw less attention to the statement of class and ethnic identity they made.&lt;ref&gt;Spring, C. (2010). ''African Art in Detail.'' London: British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the interest in (and demand for) traditional, highly-colored ''lamba akotofahana'' has increased among well-to-do Malagasy expatriates, tourists and textile aficionados, which has led to a resurgence in their production and sale in fine art galleries in Antananarivo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/s/silk_textile_lamba_akotofahan.aspx Silk Textile: Lamba Akotofahana] British Museum.  Accessed on November 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary artists have turned their attention to the resurrection of these ancient, half-forgotten techniques, producing unique works of art featured in exhibitions at internationally renowned museums.  At the [[American Museum of Natural History]], for instance, a ''lamba akotofahana'' was displayed that had been woven entirely from the silk threads produced by the female [[Nephila inaurata|golden orb-weaver spider]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/spidersilk/ One Million Wild Spiders from Madagascar Supplied Silk for Rare Textile.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017002613/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/spidersilk/ |date=2010-10-17 }} American Museum of Natural History.

Public [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] play an extremely significant role in the life of the [[Mende people]] - one of the two largest [[ethnic groups in Sierra Leone]]. 

Art historian [[Ruth Phillips]] writes that '''Mende masquerades''' "are a means of mediating between the general community and the medicine societies that are central to Mende social life. Through masking performances, the public is kept informed of important events which occur in the private domain and is enabled to witness and to share in rituals that transform the status of relatives and friends. The masquerades make visible the powerful medicines (''haleisa'', sing. ''hale'') of these [[Sodality (social anthropology)|sodalities]] without compromising their essential mystery. Maskers personify and dramatize the powers of the medicines and elicit ritualized gestures of respect and tribute from the spectators. At the same time participants and audience drawn into a common sphere of performance, aesthetically heightened by theater, music and dance."&lt;ref name="Philips 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Ruth B.|title=Representing woman : Sande masquerades of the Mende of Sierra Leone|year=1995|publisher=UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=0930741447}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Mende people|Mende]] define the visual features and performance of each masker in relation to a standard set of [[masquerade ceremony|masquerades]]. The occasions for each masquerade are fixed according to an annual calendar of ritual and secular events and, within a single celebration, there is a carefully orchestrated sequence of masquerades.

==''Hale''==
''Hale'', meaning "medicine," is believed to be a material substance found in nature that has powerful inherent properties that the officials of Mende secret societies know how to manipulate. These "medicine societies" are the men's [[Poro]] society, and women's [[Sande society]], and ''hale'' can also refer to these.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boone|first=Sylvia Ardyn|title=Radiance from the waters : ideals of feminine beauty in Mende art|year=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300035764|author2=Busselle, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maskers of a medicine society embodies the spirit (''ngafa'') as well as the power associated with its ''hale''; the Mende refer to maskers by both of these terms.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt; The standard set of Mende maskers includes about a dozen personalities embodying spirits of varying degrees of power and importance. The ''goboi'' and ''gbini'' of the Poro society, the ''sowei'' of the Sande society, and the ''njaye'' and ''humoi'' maskers belonging to the eponymous medicine societies.

==Types of maskers and masquerade==
The maskers of the Sande and Poro societies are responsible for enforcing laws and are important symbolic presences in the rituals of initiation and in public ceremonies that mark the coronations and funerals of chiefs and society officials. Another group of maskers, including the male ''gongoli'' and the female ''gonde'' and ''samawa'', are clownlike figures that feature in performances characterized by humor, satire and parody. These maskers are not true ''haleisia'', 

==''Gbini''==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 2004.77.1 Gbini Mask.jpg|thumbnail|Gbini Mask, Mende (Wood, leopard skin, sheepskin, antelope skin, raffia fiber, cotton cloth, cotton string, cowry shells), from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
''Gbini'' is considered to be the most powerful of all Mende maskers. ''Gbini'' appears at the final "pulling" ceremony of Poro initiation for a son of the paramount chief and also at the coronation of funeral of a paramount chief. Because of its power, women must stand far back from ''gbini'' and if a woman accidentally touches it, she must be anointed with medicine immediately. 

''Gbini'' wears a large leopard skin which indicates its association with the paramount chief. The flat, round headpiece resembles the chief's crown. The headpiece is constructed of animal hide stretched over a bamboo framework. The hide is decorated with cowrie shells and black, white and red strips of cloth that are worked into a geometric pattern. At the center is a round mirror. Several flaps that are similarly decorated hang down from the base of the headpiece and overlap the [[raffia]] cape which covers much of the wearer's torso.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt; 

==''Sowei''==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 69.39.2 Helmet Mask ndoli jowei for Sande Society.jpg|thumbnail|Helmet Mask (ndoli jowei) for Sande Society, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 1992.135.1 Helmet Mask Zogbe for Sande Society (2).jpg|thumbnail|Helmet Mask (Zogbe) for Sande Society, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
The [[Sande society]] is one of the most influential patrons of the visual arts in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986" /&gt; The Sande ''sowei'' masquerades promote and represent the images of women in specific ritual and festive contexts. 

The ceremonies of the Sande society are the only occasions in Africa in which women customarily wear masks. Wooden masks worn during these public ceremonies, such as funerals or the installations of chiefs, are called ''sowo'' (sing. ''sowei'') and represent the society's guardian spirit. The irreducible elements of sowei are a helmet form, lustrous blackness, beautifully arranged hair, downcast eyes, a closed mouth and an expression of inner spiritual concentration.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt;  The features of the mask illustrate the group's ideal of feminine beauty. The elegant hairstyles also symbolize the importance of social cooperation, since a woman needs the help of her friends to dress her hair. &lt;ref name="BM Collections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helmet Mask (ndoli jowei) for Sande Society|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4809/Helmet_Mask_ndoli_jowei_for_Sande_Society|work=Collections: Arts of Africa|publisher=Brooklyn Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mende honor outstanding carvers of sowei masks, which are typically men, with the name ''Sowo Gande''. According to Philips, the Sowo Gande demonstrates virtuosity through "the triumphant conjuring of new forms which are recognizable variations of old forms."&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt; 

According to [[Mende people|the Mende]], ''hojo''- white clay or kaolin- stands for the concept of the Sande society.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986" /&gt; Symbolically, it reflects a lot of the characteristics the Sande treasure, such as purity and elusiveness. The Sande society daubs objects and people with hojo to indicate that they are under Sande's control and protection and are subject to the full authority of Sande law and punishment. At Sande ceremonies, the pure white of ''hojo'' and of the clothes worn by Sande officials is thrown into dramatic contrast with the blackness of sowei masks.

The most important participant in the sowei masquerade is the ''ndoli jowei'', "the expert in dancing," the woman who dances in the mask in public and teaches dancing to the girls in the encampment.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986" /&gt;

An important part of initiation into the Sande society is the taking of a new name, which the girl herself usually chooses.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt;

'''Yue Fei''', a Chinese general of the [[Song Dynasty]] remembered for his exploits in the [[Jin campaigns against the Song Dynasty|Jin–Song wars]], has appeared in various types of '''media'''; including [[black-and-white]] films, plays, games, [[wuxia]] novels, and folktales.

==Literature==
[[Image:Grown up yue fei.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Illustration of Yue Fei and his soldiers in the comic book ''[[Media about Zhou Tong#Comic book|The Legend of Zhou Tong]]'']]
*''Xiyoubu'' (西遊補; ''Supplement to Journey to the West'', 1640), a [[Ming Dynasty]] addendum to the classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', which takes place between the end of chapter 61 and the beginning of 62. In the novel, the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]] faces a representation of his own carnal desires and is trapped inside of a tower full of mirrors, each with its own powers. One mirror causes him to travel forward in time from the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] to the [[Song Dynasty]]. There, some junior devils appear and tell him that the ruler of the underworld [[King Yama]] has recently died of an illness and so Monkey must take his place until a suitable replacement can be found. Monkey ends up judging the fate of the recently deceased Prime Minister [[Qin Hui (Song Dynasty)|Qin Hui]]. He tortures Qin into confessing his sins. These tortures include having millions of embroidery needles shoved into his flesh, being ground into paste, thrown onto a mountain of swords and spears, hacked into bits, forced to drink human puss, and his rib cage ripped apart to give him the appearance of a dragonfly. A demon is charged with using his magic breath to "blow" Qin back into his proper form. Monkey finally sends a demon to heaven to retrieve a powerful magic gourd that sucks anyone who speaks before it inside and melts them down into a bloody stew. He uses this gourd for Qin's final punishment. Meanwhile, Monkey invites the ghost of Yue Fei to the underworld and takes him as his third master. (He claims this completes his lessons on the three religions since: 1) the immortal Subhodhi taught him Taoist magic; 2) the monk [[Tang Sanzang]] taught him Buddhist restraint; 3) Yue Fei taught him Confucian ideals.) He entertains Yue Fei until Qin Hui has been reduced to liquid and offers the general a cup of Qin's "blood wine". Yue, however, refuses on the grounds that drinking it would sully his soul. Monkey then does an experiment where he makes a junior devil drink of the wine. Sometime later, the devil, apparently under the evil influence of the blood wine, murders his personal religious teacher and escapes into the "gate of ghosts," presumably being reborn into another existence. Yue Fei then takes his leave to return to his heavenly abode. Monkey sends him off with a huge display of respect by making all of the millions of denizens of the underworld kowtow before him.&lt;ref&gt;Dong, Yue, Shuen-fu Lin, Larry James Schulz, and Chengẻn Wu.

==Film and television==
Shortly after filming ''[[New Police Story]]'' in 2004, [[Jackie Chan]] reported that he would produce and play Yue Fei in a bioepic about the general's life. [[Jaycee Chan]], Jackie Chan's son, will share the role as young Yue Fei. Jackie Chan said, “There's already a rough draft right now, we've even found a co-star. In fact, filming of ''Genghis Khan'' is also under consideration, but it must be a good script, because a lot of people have filmed this story, and the story itself is complicated and randomized, so up to now, there isn't a concrete plan yet. And [the script for] ''Yue Fei'' is nearly completed." He continues, "I think Yue Fei is a man with great sense of loyalty, so am I. I've been loyal to [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]], to friends and to my country!" Filming will not begin until Chan finishes filming several other projects (including ''[[Rush Hour 3]]''), but he is willing to work for reduced pay so he can work with his son. This is because he believes the box office results will be good. However, director [[Stanley Tong]] says the role of Yue Fei could possibly go to [[Andy Lau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cn.ent.yahoo.com/040320/127/20w8j.html Article about Jackie Chang’s future portrayal of Yue Fei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224111630/http://cn.ent.yahoo.com/040320/127/20w8j.html |date=2005-02-24 }} (Chinese only)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jc-news.net/news.php?id=308 JACKIE CHAN WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK FOR A REDUCED SALARY TO WORK WITH HIS SON]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monkeypeaches.com/0403M.html Jackie Chan And Son Will Portray Yue Fei, An 11th Century Chinese General (MonkeyPeaches Exclusive)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416032010/http://www.monkeypeaches.com/0403M.html |date=2007-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singtaonet.com:82/name/t20061130_406375.html Japanese internet page which talks about Jackie Chan’s plans to play Yue Fei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011716/http://www.singtaonet.com:82/name/t20061130_406375.html |date=2007-09-27 }} (Japanese/Chinese mix)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackiechan.cc/newsof2004.htm Jackie Chan Makes Preparation for Yue Fei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310235948/http://www.jackiechan.cc/newsof2004.htm |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930065625/http://lateline.muzi.net/news/ll/chinese/1304398.shtml?cc=10071&amp;ccr=22842 Becomes outstanding the fathers and sons to ally "Yue Fei"?

===Yue Fei studies archery===
According to ''You Er Hua Bao'' (幼兒畫報; ''Children's Pictorial Magazine''), a Chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven, the young Yue Fei purchased a bow, a sword, and a spear to practice martial arts on his own since he did not have a teacher to train him properly. One day when he was chopping firewood, he passed by a village with a martial training hall ran by a famous master. Yue Fei immediately asked the master to become his student, not even knowing that this person was none other than [[Zhou Tong (archer)|Zhou Tong]]. Zhou told the boy, "Your skill in martial arts is inadequate, so you must first train your eyes."

As a part of his training, Yue Fei began to stare directly into the morning sunrise. At first the training was hard because the bright sunlight hurt his eyes, but he continued to practice the skill of the "far-sighted person" for many years. One day, Zhou came to Yue Fei and pointed to an object high up in the sky. When he focused his trained vision, Yue saw that it was a lone goose. Zhou then directed Yue to scan some trees that were one hundred paces away. Yue again focused his vision and caught sight of two black cicadas on a tree. Zhou then laughed in approval and said "Now that your eyesight is practiced, I not only accept you as my student, but also as my adopted son. I will now teach you martial arts."

Yue Fei practiced diligently and became a master of the [[Eighteen Arms of Wushu|eighteen weapons of war]]. He could draw a bow weighing 300 [[Catty|catties]] and, with a "whiz" of the arrow, shoot a leaf from 100 paces away. The moral of the story is that achievements are only made through diligent practice. It also warns that staring directly into the sun is very dangerous and could permanently damage the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nmgnews.com.cn/pdeb/article/20060922/7326_1.html Yue Fei studies archery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206041257/http://news.nmgnews.com.cn/pdeb/article/20060922/7326_1.html |date=2012-02-06 }} (Chinese only)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wytg.net/html/2004311141814-1.html About "Children’s Pictorial" Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231083949/http://www.wytg.net/html/2004311141814-1.html |date=2006-12-31 }} (Chinese only)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The general and the water tank===
When Yue Fei was born, there was a red auspicious glow around the Yue family residence so neighbors brought buckets of water to put out some perceived fire. However, they found out that Lady Yue had given birth to a son. With all the people crowded around their house, a [[Peng (mythology)|Peng]] landed on the roof and spread its wings over the length of the entire residence.  The bird then flew high into the sky and disappeared. The sight of the Chinese [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] is why Yue's father named him ''Fei'' (飛; "fly").

Days after his birth, a monk warned Yue Fei's father to put his wife and newborn child inside of a water tank if the baby were to cry. Three days later, the baby began to cry, so Yue's father followed the monk's instructions. Then the [[Yellow River]] flooded and mother and child were swept to safety, whereas Yue's father drowned in the torrent. In his previous life, Yue had indeed been a Peng himself. He had blinded the eye of a mischievous dragon living within the Yellow River. So when the dragon heard his newly reborn enemy cry, he flooded the river to kill Yue and get his revenge, but failed.

Lady Yue raised Yue Fei on money that she saved up from doing sewing for the family who had saved them from the river and taken them into their home. When Yue Fei was 13, he entered a cave and found a monstrous snake sleeping by a stream. He picked up a rock and threw it at the beast. The snake lunged at him in anger, but Yue Fei dodged to one side and pulled on its tail with his supernatural strength. The snake instantly disappeared in a puff of smoke, leaving only a marvelous golden spear named the "Magic Spear of the Flowing Spring" ({{zh|s=沥泉神矛|p= Lìquán Shénmáo}}). He later found a military teacher who taught him how to wield the spear efficiently.

Yue eventually joined the army and became one of the most beloved heroes and martyrs in Chinese history. This story is a derivative of an episode from his fictional biography ''[[Yue Fei#Story of Yue Fei|Shuo Yue Quanzhuan]]''.&lt;ref name=Qian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsilai.org/english/merittimes/detail.asp?index=15763&amp;page=D The General &amp; The Water Tank] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419034133/http://www.hsilai.org/english/merittimes/detail.asp?index=15763&amp;page=D |date=2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qin Hui: The Stinker===
After Yue Fei's execution, iron statues of [[Qin Hui (Song Dynasty)|Qin Hui]], the man responsible for the general's execution; his wife Madam Wang; and two other accomplices were cast in iron and knelt outside Yue's memorial tomb as punishment for their deeds. During the [[Ming Dynasty]], the new Provincial Governor-General of [[Hangzhou]], who was a direct descendant of Qin Hui and Madam Wang, had both iron statues thrown into the [[West Lake]] under cover of night. The next day, the lake turned pitch-black and stank of vomit. The townsfolk realized that the lake's condition coincided with the statues' disappearance. When the Governor-General arrived on the scene, the people questioned him about his relationship with Qin Hui. As he knew the statues had sunk to the bottom of the lake, he boasted, "If anyone can really scoop the statues out of the lake, I'm waiting to resign and ask for punishment." At that exact moment, the murky water became clear and the statues drifted ashore as if propelled by an invisible force. The cowardly Governor-General bolted for his carriage when he saw this miraculous sight. The townsfolk pelted his carriage with rocks as he fled, many of them ripping through the curtain, giving him huge lumps on his head. That night, the Governor-General escaped from Hangzhou, never to be heard from again. [http://media.soundofhope.org/audio01/2006/1/13/chinese_stories_lan3.mp3 Listen to this story]

===The mad monk sweeps Qin Hui out of the temple===
During the Southern Song Dynasty there were two famous Buddhists named the "Crazy Monk" [[Ji Gong]] and the "Mad Monk" Fengbo. Fengbo lived during the time of Yue Fei and became famous for "sweeping Qin Hui's face with a broom". The story is told after having Yue Fei imprisoned on false charges, Qin Hui went to [[Lingyin Temple]] to have his fortune read. There he was confronted by a laughing Fengbo who asked, "[[Cao Cao]] was once a big hero, but where is he today?" Qin Hui asked him what he meant in confusion. Fengbo said, "The principles of Heaven are clear. Loyalty and treachery are self-evident. Goodness and evil will be met with reward or retribution. You, as the Prime Minister, hold a lot of power. Why do you want to murder a man who is as important to the country as a pillar is to a house? Does the safety of the nation mean nothing to you?" Qin countered "Who is that pillar of the country?" "General Yue Fei!" screamed Fengbo. When Qin Hui seemed unaffected by his words, Fengbo laughed and said, "What a fool! Repent now before it is too late." He then grabbed a broom and raked it across Qin Hui's face and quickly ran off. Feeling embarrassed, Qin returned to the palace a defeated man.
 
The boldness of the monk caught the attention of the common folk. It is said he would appear in crowded areas and begin to sweep the floor, even in the cleanest of places, and proclaim "sweeping Qin" as a reminder to the people that they should band together to eliminate the traitor Qin Hui from office. The "Mad Monk" was later raised to the status of an [[Arhat (Buddhism)|arhat]].

The statues of the "Mad and Crazy Monks" were often seen together in various temples throughout the Southern Song Dynasty. There are two such statues of these arhats in the Daxiong Temple Hall of Zhantan Forest on [[Mount Jiuhua]]. One of them is the "Crazy Monk" [[Ji Gong]] in the form of a deity and the other is the "Mad Monk" Fengbo holding a duster in one hand and a broom under his left armpit, standing ever ready to give the wicked Prime Minister another sweep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pureinsight.org/pi/index.php?news=1458 An Allusion from History: A Buddhist Monk Feng Bo Upholds Righteousness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023110/http://www.pureinsight.org/pi/index.php?news=1458 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a derivative of an episode from ''[[Yue Fei#Story of Yue Fei|Shuo Yue Quanzhuan]]'', which mentions no "sweeping" at all. The fortuneteller's name was "Xie Renfu of [[Chengdu]]" and he told the fortunes of both [[Emperor Gaozong of Song|Emperor Gaozong]] and Qin Hui, who were in disguise, in the Dragon's Intonation Monastery. When Qin returned to the palace he sent men to arrest the fortuneteller, but he had fled the city out of fear once he discovered who they really were.&lt;ref name=Qian/&gt;

The '''Museum of World Cultures''' ({{lang-de|Museum der Weltkulturen}}) is an [[Ethnology|ethnological]] museum in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].  Until 2001 it was called the Museum of Ethnology (''Museum für Völkerkunde'').

==History==

It was founded in 1904, as a civic institution, to bring together the ethnographic collections of the city of Frankfurt.  In 1908 the museum moved into the [[Palais Thurn und Taxis]] in the city centre.  In 1925 the city acquired the collections of the Institute of Cultural Morphology (today the Frobenius Institute), founded by the ethnologist [[Leo Frobenius]]. He relocated to Frankfurt along with the institute and become an honorary professor of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]].  In 1934 he became the director of the museum.  The roles of museum director and institute director continued to be occupied by the same person (including Frobenius's successors) until 1966, when the university became state-run, since when the museum has again been run by the city.

Significant parts of the collection were lost when the Palais was destroyed by [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|bombs in World War II]].  However, some items had already been evacuated from the Palais – these survived the war, and in 1973 they were put on display in an old villa on the banks of the [[River Main|Main]], where they have been ever since.  The Museum of World Cultures therefore counts as one of the earliest museums on what is now the [[Museumsufer]].

The museum has expanded since 1973 and now occupies three adjacent buildings on the [[Schaumainkai]] – nos. 29 (the main building), 35 (the original villa), and 37 ("Gallery 37"), which were acquired and/or rebuilt in the 1980s.  The collections include over 65,000 objects from [[Oceania]], [[Australia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/kunst/ferne-lichter--die-unsere-welt-erhellen/-/1473354/2792394/-/index.html Ferne Lichter, die unsere Welt erhellen] Arno Widmann, ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', 29 October 2009. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery 37 hosts exhibitions of contemporary works by [[India]]n, African, Oceanian and [[Indonesia]]n artists.

In 2010, plans were announced for a new phase of construction to further expand the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/RubFAE83B7DDEFD4F2882ED5B3C15AC43E2/Doc~E3BB57A4B4523482784F38FDE265E4F22~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Viel neuer Raum für Museum der Weltkulturen] Michael Hierholzer, ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 26 June 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">'''Mythical theology''' (''theologica mythica'') is one of three types of [[theology]] defined by the Roman scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116&amp;ndash;27 BC) in his lost work ''Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum''. The other two are [[political theology]] (''theologia civilis'') and [[natural theology]] (''theologia naturalis'').

Mythical theology is practiced by story-tellers, especially poets, based on narratives ''([[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythoi]])'' pertaining to divine matters. Divine revelation was claimed or implied by some of these story-tellers, or their disciples.

Theologians of civil or political theology are administrators, defining how the gods relate to daily life and the state (see [[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]). Theologians of natural theology are [[philosophy|philosophers]], inquiring into the nature of the gods,
as evidenced by nature and reason.

"Mythical theology" should be distinguished from the ''[[theologia mystica]]'' of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]].

Core activities are organised in teams: Subject material development, technical development, applications management, content management, NDLA interactive, and desk support.&lt;ref&gt;From Chapter 2 in NDLAs Annual Report for 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2006 The [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] allocated NOK 50 mill for the development of digital learning resources for subjects in secondary education. Among the targets was the intention to enhance the access to and use of digital learning resources in secondary education, and increase the volume and the variety of such resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dok/andre/brev/utvalgte_brev/2006/digitale-laremidler-i-videregaende-oppla.html?id=91754 Letter from the Ministry of Education dated 19.06.2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Increased volume and diversity were seen as significant conditions for the introduction of free learning material in upper secondary education. The incentive was an amendment imposing the counties to provide free educational material, in print as well as digital, including digital hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1998-07-17-61#KAPITTEL_3 Norwegian Education Act § 3-1. The right to upper secondary education for youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

20 September 2006 the county chief executives of education agreed to establish a joint project to develop digital subject material for all subjects in secondary education. The project was named Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA).&lt;ref&gt;"Digitale læremiddel i vidaregåande opplæring - Nasjonal digital læringsarena", political issue with case number 200702708-9 in Hordaland County Council&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary project work started early 2007; all counties except Oslo were parts of the collaboration. The first year the project was fully funded by the Ministry of Education and Research, and on 26 September Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg officially opened Norwegian Digital Learning Arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ Norwegian Digital Learning Arena opened by PM Jens Stoltenberg. (From the web site of Hordaland County.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052740/http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ |date=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic year 2008–2009 subject material for Norwegian, natural science, and health and social care, first year course, was published.

The 18 participating counties took over the further funding of the project, and for the academic year 2009–2010 digital subject material was provided for 17 curricula and more than 30 subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;Many curricula cover more than one subject; it is for example normal that a curriculum for a vocational syllabus is split into three or four different subject areas. Curricula for Norwegian, mathematics, and English also cover more than one subject.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent increases by the year and by school start in 2014 subject material covering approximately 40 curricula and 60 subject areas within upper secondary education is available.

In 2013 [[Akershus]] County decided to withdraw from the project, however, the county resumed its participation from January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akershus.no/file/ec32575da10d58b6582107d0d4343d8c/Sakskart%202%20til%20fylkestinget%2023.09.13.pdf Agenda from the Akershus County Assembly of 23 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of visits to the digital learning resources on ndla.no has been rising since the start of the project. Based on ratings by [[Google Analytics]] the figures are:&lt;ref&gt;Figures of ratings quoted from [http://om.ndla.no/brukerstatistikk/ NDLA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2010: 1 431 017
* 2011: 2 876 541
* 2012: 4 799 181
* 2013: 7 022 812
* 2014: 8 200 000
* 2015 10 000 000
* 2016: 11 800 000
* 2017: 12 400 000 

[[Oslo]] County does not take part in the NDLA project, but is the county with most visits and use of the resources on ndla.no. In 2013 there were 1 139 129 visits from Oslo.

==Technology==
NDLA is developed in the publishing system [[Drupal]] 6. The solution was initially created by the developing group Utdanning.no,&lt;ref&gt;[https://kgv.doffin.no/app/docmgmt/downloadPublicDocument.asp?DVID=292751&amp;FMT=1&amp;AT=15&amp;ID=96478 Basis of qualification from Doffin for acquisition of securing, running, and storage of a digital learning platform for NDLA. ]&lt;/ref&gt; but further development and operation now lies with the Cerpus group. The core code of the system is [[open source software]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://bitbucket.org/ndla/profile/repositories The ndla open source project]&lt;/ref&gt; open for anyone aiming to develop digital learning resources. In 2018 NDLA will relaunch on a [https://github.com/ndlano new technological platform]. 

==Prizes and Nominations==
In 2011 NDLA was nominated for [[European Public Service Award]] (EPSA).&lt;ref&gt;Theme 1 - Nominees: [http://www.epsa2013.eu/en/content/show/&amp;tid=160 European Public Service Award i 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is awarded annually within the EU/EEC area, the ambition is to develop and improve solutions within public and civil administration. NDLA was candidate for the prize with the entry: NDLA Innovation in Acquisition, Development and Distribution of Digital Learning Resources. A total of 274 initiatives were evaluated, and 15 candidates were shortlisted for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa Press release: Norwegian Way on Top in Europe (from om.ndla.no)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727043551/http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa |date=27 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 2014 NDLA won the [[Boldic Award]] for its open and innovative web repository at ndla.no.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boldic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Boldic_Award_2014_diplom1_original_us_final1.pdf BOLDIC AWARD 2014, Stockholm 23 October 2014, The Boldic Award Jury 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In the jury statement, it was pointed out that NDLA's project strategy and solutions can be scalable across the Nordic and Baltic countries, and that NDLA provides a unique way of working together to promote distance learning and ICT-supported flexible lifelong learning.


In 2017 NDLA won the [http://www.oeconsortium.org/projects/open-education-awards-for-excellence/2017-oe-award-winners-oer-categories/ Open Educational Resources Awards for best OER Site].

==External evaluations==
The NDLA learning resources are continually evaluated by independent third parties. An external users’ study from 2013 revealed that NDLA was mostly used as supplement to a traditional textbook, and the use was largely managed by the teacher. Students pointed out e-lectures and differentiated tasks as most useful. Both teachers and students emphasized the value of the possibility to differentiate material and tasks designed for students with varying learning capability.&lt;ref&gt;Athenae AS [http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerundersøkelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf Evaluation of NDLA -- User Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022222111/http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerunders%C3%B8kelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procurement and Production==
By publicly inviting tenders NDLA searches the market for digital learning resources to cover the competence aims of the different subject areas. NDLA asks for production services, developing groups of digital learning material, for either parts of, or prospective total solutions for a complete curriculum.

The responsibility for the editorial work, organising, meta-tagging, and putting together the material in the respective subject areas lies with competent editing groups recruited from upper secondary schools in the counties. The contents of each site are quality controlled by academy and university expertise, or otherwise specialists in that particular field. All the core material is published in the two forms of Norwegian.

When the demand is not met by the supply, the editing groups will produce their own material. The publishing companies are invited to collaborate in every round of purchase, and are free to make an offer of their material that will benefit their interests.

==Funding==
The basic income of NDLA rests on a joint contribution from the part-taking counties, of NOK 400, - per student, which constitutes an annual income of estimated NOK 64 mill. In 2013 this figure was lower due to Akershus’ leaving the project.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 7 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 66% of NDLA’s net expenses in 2013 were spent on purchase in the market.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 8 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 NDLA was indicted by the [[Norwegian Publishers' Association]] before the [[European System of Financial Supervisors|European Surveillance Authority]] (ESA). The publishers claimed that the state funding of more than NOK 150 mill did not comply with the international regulation of financial state support, and represented an obstacle to the establishing of a free market for digital learning resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf Annual Report from Norwegian Publishers' Association 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105033/http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf |date=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment was initially rejected by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] on 12 October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2011-10-12: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1535 State aid: Norwegian support to provider of digital learning material cleared] 12.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftasurv.int/media/decisions/311-11-COL.pdf EFTA Surveillance Authority decision] 2011-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2012 the dismissal was set aside by the EFTA Court after an appeal from the Publishers’ Association. In March 2013 the [[EFTA Court]] announced a formal investigation of the funding of NDLA,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2013-03-27: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1905 State Aid: Investigation opened into funding of Norwegian provider of digital learning material]&lt;/ref&gt; and ESA reopened the case. After a close examination ESA reached the same conclusion; the funding of NDLA is in compliance with the rules of state funding.&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2014-06-26: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/2278 State aid: Norwegian support to the provider of digital learning material does not involve state aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7792">[[File:CPC-audio.jpg|200px|right|The Chronology Protection Case by Paul Levinson, 1995]]
'''Dr. Phil D’Amato''' is the central character in three [[science fiction]] [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] [[Novella|novelette]]s and three novels written by [[Paul Levinson]].  The first novelette, "The Chronology Protection Case", was adapted into a [[radio play]] which was nominated for an [[Edgar Award]] by the [[Mystery Writers of America]].  The first novel, ''The Silk Code'', won the [[Locus Award]] for the Best First Novel of 1999. The fictional D'Amato, who has a PhD in [[forensic science]], is a detective with the [[NYPD]].

==The Novelettes==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Detective fiction]] --&gt;
==="The Chronology Protection Case"===
Dr. Phil D’Amato debuted in "The Chronology Protection Case", published in the American magazine ''[[Analog Magazine|Analog]]'' in 1995.  The novelette was nominated for [[Nebula]] and [[Sturgeon]] Awards.  

It has been reprinted five times: 
*''The Mammoth Book of Time Travel SF'' edited by [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], 2013
*''The Best Time Travel Stories of All Time'' edited by [[Barry Malzberg]],  2003
*''Nebula Awards 32: SFWA's Choices for the Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year'' edited by [[Jack Dann]], 1998
*''Supernatural Sleuths'' edited by Charles G. Waugh &amp;  [[Martin H. Greenberg]], 1996
*''Infinite Edge'', a webzine, 1997  

The novelette was adapted into a radio play written by  Mark Shanahan (with Paul Levinson and Jay Kensinger) in 2002, and performed at New York City's [[The Paley Center for Media|Museum of Television and Radio]]. In addition to being nominated for the [[Edgar Award|Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Play]], the radio play was later recorded and released as an [[audiobook]] by Listen &amp; Live/[[Audible.com]] in 2004. 

"The Chronology Protection Case" was also adapted into a student film by director Jay Kensinger, which premiered at the I-Con SF Convention in 2002, and was later released on DVD by MODVEC Productions. A review can be found [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue263/screen4.html here].   A re-cut version of the movie, in black-and-white and with a new extended ending, was released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfscope.com/2013/11/the-chronology-protection-case-released-with-new-extended-ending/|title=The Chronology Protection Case released with new, extended ending|publisher=SFScope|date=November 14, 2013|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Chronology Protection Case" extrapolates from [[Stephen Hawking]]’s [[chronology protection conjecture]], &lt;ref name="Nahin"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Nahin |title=A Writer's Guide to the Real Science of Plausible Time Travel |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2011 |ISBN=1-421-40082-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and posits a vengeful universe that seeks to protect itself from time travel by killing any scientists who discover or even begin to understand how to do it.

==="The Copyright Notice Case"=== 
D’Amato returned in "The Copyright Notice Case", published in Analog in 1996.  The novelette was nominated for a [[Nebula Award]], won the [[HOMer Award]], and was reprinted in Levinson’s anthology, ''Bestseller: Wired, Analog, and Digital Writings'' in 1999.  

The novelette explores what might happen had an inviolable [[copyright notice]] been embedded in human [[DNA]] in the prehistoric past.  Phil meets Jenna Katen for the first time in this story.

==="The Mendelian Lamp Case"===
D’Amato’s last appearance in short fiction to date came in "The Mendelian Lamp Case", a novelette published in Analog in 1997.   

It was reprinted three times:
*''The Hard SF Renaissance'' edited by [[David G. Hartwell]] &amp; [[Kathryn Cramer]],  2002
*''Science Fiction Theater'' edited by Brian Forbes, 1999 
*''Year's Best SF3'' edited by [[David G. Hartwell]],  1998 

While investigating the mysterious death of a friend, D'Amato discovers an [[Amish]]-like group who use innocent-looking bio-technology for nefarious ends.

==The Novels==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lindisfarne]] --&gt;
[[File:Silk_Code.jpg|100px|left|thumb|''The Silk Code ''(1999).]]
===''The Silk Code''===
Levinson continues the intrigue of "The Mendelian Lamp Case" in his first novel, ''The Silk Code'' (Tor Books, 1999).  Phil D’Amato uses his debut in longer form to explore not only bio-technology and groups masquerading as Amish, but the possible survival of [[Neanderthals]] into the present day.  

''The Silk Code'' won the Locus Award for Best First Novel of 1999.  A Polish translation —''Kod Jedwabiu''— was published in 2003.  An "author's cut" Kindle edition was published by JoSara Media in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josaramedia.com/2012/08/25/paul-levinson%E2%80%99s-the-silk-code-published-as-ebook-by-josara-media/|title=Paul Levinson’s The Silk Code Published as eBook by JoSara MeDia|publisher=JoSara|date=August 25, 2012|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Consciousness_Plague.jpg|100px|thumb|The Consciousness Plague ''(2002).]]

===''The Consciousness Plague''===
D’Amato’s next novelistic outing was in ''The Consciousness Plague'', published in 2002 by Tor Books.  Here D’Amato gets caught up in the possibility that our very consciousness may be engendered by microorganisms that live in the brain.  Paths of exploration in this novel range from [[Lindisfarne]]  to [[Julian Jaynes]]’s ''[[Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]''.   

''The Consciousness Plague'' won the [[Media ecology|Media Ecology Association]]’s Mary Shelley Award and was translated into Polish as ''Zaraza Swiadomosci'' and published in 2005.  An audiobook narrated by Mark Shanahan was released by Listen and Live in 2005, and nominated for the [[Audie Awards|Audie Award]] that year.  An "author's cut" Kindle edition was published by JoSara Media in 2013.

[[File:Pixel_Eye.jpg|100px|thumb|''The Pixel Eye'' (2003).]]

===''The Pixel Eye''===
Phil D’Amato’s most recent appearance is in ''The Pixel Eye'', published in 2003 by Tor Books.  In this chilling post 9/11 tale set in [[New York City]], D’Amato contends with [[squirrel]]s and other critters whose brains are outfitted with microchips that transmit everything they see and hear. [[Holography]] figures prominently in the story. Although all of the D’Amato stories are set in New York, ''The Pixel Eye'' has the most extensive New York ambiences - from [[Central Park]] to the [[New York Public Library]] on Fifth Avenue to [[Grand Central Terminal]].  

''The Pixel Eye'' was nominated for the [[Prometheus Award]] in 2004.  An "author's cut" Kindle edition was published by JoSara Media in 2014.

==Critical commentary about Phil D’Amato==
Multiple Nebula and Hugo Award winning author [[Connie Willis]] said "Forensic detective Phil D’Amato is one of my favorite characters."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/w/connie-willis/ ''Connie Willis Recommends'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pitkern''', also known as '''Pitcairn-Norfolk'''&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt; or '''Pitcairnese''', is a [[creole language]] [[English-based creole languages|based]] on an [[Modern English|18th-century]] [[dialect]] of [[English language|English]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]. It is a primary language of [[Pitcairn Islands]], though it has more speakers on [[Norfolk Island]]. Unusually, although spoken on [[Pacific Ocean]] islands, it has been described as an [[English-based creole languages|Atlantic Creole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Avram |first=Andrei |authorlink= |year=2003 |title=Pitkern and Norfolk revisited |journal=[[English Today]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=44–49 |doi=10.1017/S0266078403003092 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=163683# |accessdate=2007-04-09 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 70 speakers on Pitcairn Island, Britain's last remaining colony in the South Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pacific Pidgins and Creoles|last=Tryon|first=Darrell T.|last2=Charpentier|publisher=Jean-Michel|year=2004|isbn=3-11-016998-3|location=Berlin|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] on April 28, 1789, the British mutineers stopped at [[Tahiti]] and took eighteen Polynesians, mostly women, to remote Pitcairn Island and settled there. Initially, the Tahitians spoke little English, and the ''Bounty'' crewmen knew even less Tahitian. Isolated from the rest of the world, they had to communicate with each other, and, over time, they formed a unique new language that blended a simplified English with Tahitian words and speech patterns.

Pitkern was influenced by the diverse [[English dialects]] and accents of the crew. Geographically, the mutineers were drawn from as far as the West Indies, with one mutineer being described as speaking a forerunner of a Caribbean patois.  One was a Scot from the [[Isle of Lewis]]. At least one, the leader [[Fletcher Christian]], was a well-educated man, which at the time made a major difference in speech. Both [[Geordie]] and [[West Country dialects]] have obvious links to some Pitkern phrases and words, such as ''whettles'', meaning food, from ''victuals''.

'''Rachel Held Evans''' (née '''Rachel Grace Held''', June 8, 1981) is an American Christian columnist, blogger and author. Her book ''A Year of Biblical Womanhood'' was on ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} e-book non-fiction best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best Sellers - The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-11-18/e-book-nonfiction/list.html |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Evans was born to Peter and Robin Held. She grew up in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. At age 14, she and her family moved to [[Dayton, Tennessee]], where her father took an administrative position at [[Bryan College]]. She attended [[Rhea County High School]] and then went to Bryan College where she majored in English literature. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in 2003 and married her college boyfriend, Dan Evans, that year. They moved to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where she worked as an intern for the ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alumna Rachel Held Evans - published, working and improving |work=The Bryan College Triangle |date=October 23, 2013 |url=http://www.bryantriangle.com/features/alumna-rachel-held-evans-published-working-and-improving/ |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Evans returned to Dayton where she worked full-time for the local paper, ''The Herald-News''. In 2006, she transitioned from full-time to writing [[pro bono]] as the paper's humor columnist; in 2007, she won an award for "Best Personal Humor Column" from the Tennessee Press Association.&lt;ref name="tpa_award"&gt;{{cite web

In September 2008, Evans signed with [[Zondervan]] for her first book, ''Evolving in Monkey Town''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolving in Monkey Town: How a Girl Who Knew All the Answers Learned to Ask the Questions |last=Evans |first=Rachel Held |publisher=Zondervan |year=2010 |isbn=9780310293996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores her journey from religious certainty to a faith which accepts doubt and questioning; the title is based on the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]] that occurred in Dayton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolving in Monkey Town |work=''RachelHeldEvans.com'' |url=http://rachelheldevans.com/monkey-town/ |accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second book, ''A Year of Biblical Womanhood: How a Liberated Woman Found Herself Sitting on Her Roof, Covering Her Head, and Calling Her Husband Master'', was released in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Year of Biblical Womanhood |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/09/a_year_of_biblical_womanhood.html |newspaper=Slate |date=September 1, 2011 |access-date=August 21, 2015 |issn=1091-2339  |first=Ruth |last=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;{{cite web |last=Compton |first=Allie |title=Rachel Held Evans, Author of "A Year of Biblical Womanhood", Spent a Year Living the Bible Literally |date=October 23, 2012 |work=HuffPost |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/a-year-of-biblical-womanhood_n_2006184.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recounts how she spent an entire year of living a Biblical lifestyle literally. The book also garnered national media attention for Evans as she appeared on ''[[The Today Show]]''.&lt;ref name="todayshow"/&gt; In 2014, Evans re-released ''Evolving in Monkey Town'' with the new title of ''Faith Unraveled''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Faith Unraveled: How a Girl Who Knew All the Answers Learned to Ask Questions |last=Evans |first=Rachel Held |publisher=Zondervan |year=2014 |isbn=9780310339168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, she wrote a column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that was entitled: "Want millennials back in the pews? Stop trying to make church 'cool'”. In the column she self-identified as a [[Millennials|millennial]], and expressed her belief that while churches in the United States are attempting to get more millennials in the church, their approach is wrong because they focus primarily on stylistic aspects, which she believes "are not the key to drawing millennials back to God in a lasting and meaningful way. Young people don’t simply want a better show." She believes that while the church is acting in good faith in their efforts to bring millennials back to the church, they too frequently use misguided strategies to do so.&lt;ref name="Millennial Mission"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Devlin |first=Nathanael |title=Millennial Mission: The Transmission of Christianity Is Not a New Task. |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=781e0df8-fe3a-480c-8973-a793f89c0b23%40sdc-v-sessmgr05 |format=PDF |journal=[[Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity]] |type=Article |language=en-US |location=Pennsylvania |publication-place=Chicago |date=Spring 2018 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=42–45 |issn=0897-327X |id=128120637 |access-date=2018-10-11 |subscription=yes |lay-url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=0575d016-0c81-43d6-a939-a8362aa91f5b%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=128120637&amp;db=aph |via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serindian art''' is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century C.E. in [[Serindia]] or [[Xinjiang]], the western region of China that forms part of [[Central Asia]].

It derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Gandharan sculpture combined Indian traditions with Greek influences. Greek-influenced culture was most probably in existence prior to [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasions, Afghanistan natives retained this influence which was lost in Greece.{{Verify source|date=November 2017}}

Modern researchers hypothesize that Buddhist missionaries travelling on the [[Silk Road]] introduced this artistic influence, along with [[Buddhism]] itself, into Serindia, resulting in a style that is a hybrid of Greek, Chinese and Persian.

In modernity, Serindian art was rediscovered through the expeditions of [[Sir Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia at the beginning of the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18024">'''Social justice educational leadership''' emphasizes the belief that all students can and will reach proficiency, without exceptions or excuses, and that schools ought to be organized to advance the [[educational equity|equitable]] learning of all students. Rather than focusing on one group of students who traditionally struggle, or who traditionally succeed, social justice leaders address the learning needs of all students. Social justice educational leadership specifically addresses how differences in race, income, language, ability, gender, and sexual orientation influence the design and effectiveness of learning environments. Social justice leadership draws from [[inclusive education]] practices from disability education, but extends the concepts further to support students from diverse groups with a wide range of needs. Through restructuring staff allocation and assessing student progress through disaggregated data, school leaders strive to create schools with equal access and equitable support for all students.

==Goals==
Social justice [[educational leadership|educational leaders]] recognize the role race, ethnicity, family income, ability, gender, and sexual orientation play in predicting student success in school. They commit to creating schools that address societal inequalities by striving to help all students reach academic proficiency. As described by Scheurich and Skrla, "In striving for both equity and excellence... we are aiming for schools in which there are no persistent patterns of differences in academic success or treatment among students grouped by race, ethnicity, culture, neighborhood, income of parents, or home language. In other words, we are aiming to foster schools that literally serve each and every student really well." (pg. 2).&lt;ref name="Scheurich &amp; Skrla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glickman|first1=James Joseph Scheurich, Linda Skrla ; foreword by Carl D.|title=Leadership for equity and excellence creating high-achievement classrooms, schools, and districts|date=2003|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks (Calif.)|isbn=978-0761945864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to assess whether these patterns of difference exist, social justice leaders use data tools, such as equity audits, to uncover structures that create differences in student learning outcomes.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle" /&gt; Equity audits use data such as standardized test scores, [[school discipline|discipline]] rates, family involvement in schools, advanced course participation, [[special education]] labeling, at-risk identification, and [[Response to Intervention|intervention]] placement to create profiles of achievement for different student groups in the school. Equity audits reveal [[achievement gap]] trends in these areas, in which traditionally [[marginalized]] students frequently perform at lower levels than their more privileged peers.&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper" /&gt; Many schools find demographically similar groups of students struggling in academics, language, discipline, graduation rates, and other markers of student success. Once these patterns are identified, social justice leaders equip staff and students with the skills necessary to address discrepancies in student learning needs.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frattura|first1=Colleen A. Capper, Elise M.|title=Meeting the needs of students of all abilities : how leaders go beyond inclusion|date=2009|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412966955|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student services==

Social justice leadership builds on concepts of [[inclusive education]], in which services are brought to students in the general classroom environment, rather than pulling students out to a resource room. However, social justice leadership diverges somewhat from inclusive education in that full inclusion at all times is not required.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura" /&gt; Social justice leaders focus on providing services in classrooms and other flexible spaces that can be accessed by all students, rather than removing students to receive special support in separate classrooms.&lt;ref name=Theoharis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theoharis|first1=George|title=The school leaders our children deserve : seven keys to equity, social justice, and school reform|date=2009|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0807749517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice leadership also emphasizes assigning students to classrooms and groups using proportional representation. This means that the proportion of students in any classroom or group should match the natural proportion of students from all demographic groups in the school.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salle|first1=Ruth S. Johnson, Robin Avelar La|title=Data strategies to uncover and eliminate hidden inequities : the wallpaper effect|date=2010|publisher=Corwin|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412914932}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if 15% of the student body is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], then 15% of every classroom should be Latino, only 15% of students who qualify for special education should be Latino and only 15% of students receiving discipline should be Latino.

This method of bringing services to students in general education environments with proportional representation also differs from pull-out models like [[response to intervention]] (RtI). Many pull-out models identify students struggling in the classroom and assign them to interventions led by educator specialists outside the general education classroom, rather than by their classroom teachers. For students with more significant needs, pull-out interventions may be from several staff, such as from the Title I teacher, reading interventionist, speech therapist, and social worker, introducing multiple adults and environments to students who would most benefit from consistency. This practice locates the responsibility for educating students with additional needs with the interventionist, rather than the classroom teacher, reducing their efficacy.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura" /&gt;

== Behavior Management ==
Many school behavior management efforts criminalize small infractions, and maintain a focus on retribution rather than restoration.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Heather S.|date=2002|title=Restorative justice in elementary schools|url=|journal=University of Lethbridge|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with institutional and individual bias, results in a significant overrepresentation of students of color in suspension and expulsion rates.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Thalia|date=2012|title=Keeping kids in schools: Restorative justice, punitive discipline, and the school to prison pipeline.|url=|journal=JL &amp; Educ|volume=41|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of social justice in schools purport that exclusionary discipline practices such as suspension and expulsion actively remove students from their school communities and exacerbate feelings of isolation and resentment.

Zero tolerance policies, popularized in the 1990s, have been shown to be ineffective on multiple measures, leaving school leaders looking for alternative strategies to promote safe and orderly learning environments.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; School leaders focused on social justice are additionally compelled to find strategies that disrupt persisting inequities. This is where restorative justice practices, culturally and linguistically responsive practices (CLRP) and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) come into play as approaches aiming to address both institutional inequities and the need for safe learning environments.

=== CLR-PBIS ===
PBIS comes with a variety of acronyms. Some schools cut out the “intervention” part, going with the proactive-only PBS system. PBIS is more akin to the three-tiered Response to Intervention system. Others add in the necessity of schoolwide (SW) implementation, dubbing the program SWPBIS.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Closing the school discipline gap: Equitable remedies for excessive exclusion|last=Losen|first=Daniel J.|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8077-5613-3|location=New York, NY|pages=151–165; 207–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever variation is used (here, PBIS), the primary practices included in the system are listed below. PBIS has shown promise in reducing exclusionary discipline practices overall, but has not shown, on its own, to be effective at reducing the racial disparities in student discipline, and in some cases has even been shown to exacerbate the discrepancies by further reducing discipline referrals for White students, but not for students of color.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These criticisms have led to a call for examination of PBIS, and the integration of CLRP with PBIS in order to address systemic inequities in school discipline.

CLRP has its roots in the work of Gloria Ladson-Billings surrounding culturally relevant pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|date=1995|title=Toward a theory of culturally relevant pedagogy|url=|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=32 |issue=3|pages=465–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on this initial thinking, Ladson-Billings more recently stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;By focusing on student learning and academic achievement versus classroom and behavior management, cultural competence versus cultural assimilation or eradication, and sociopolitical consciousness rather than school-based tasks that have no beyond-school application, I was able to see students take both responsibility for and deep interest in their education. This is the secret behind culturally relevant pedagogy: the ability to link principles of learning with deep understanding of (and appreciation for) culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|date=2014|title=Culturally responsive pedagogy 2.0: aka the remix|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=84 |issue=1|pages=74–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other scholars have echoed and built upon this work, giving linguistic relevance footing in the literature, proposing specific practices that may help teachers improve pedagogical relevance, and considering how to best integrate PBIS and CLRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Claudia|last2=Randall|first2=Carla|last3=Cartledge|first3=Gwendolyn|last4=Tobin|first4=Tary|last5=Swain-Bradway|first5=Jessica|date=2011|title=Toward a conceptual integration of cultural responsiveness and schoolwide positive behavior support|url=|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|volume=13 |issue=4|pages=219–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culturally and linguistically responsive teaching and learning: Classroom practices for student success|last=Hollie|first=Sharroky|publisher=Shell Educational Publishing, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4258-0686-6|location=Huntington Beach, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Key Features of PBIS ====
* Clearly defining behavioral expectations valued by the school community.
* Proactively teaching what those expected behaviors look like in various school settings at least once a year.
* Frequently rewarding students who comply with behavioral expectations.
* Administering a clearly defined continuum of consequences for behavioral violations.
* Continuously collecting and analyzing data to assess students’ responsiveness to the behavioral support provided.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Restorative Justice ===
Thalia González describes restorative justice in schools as “an approach to discipline that engages all parties in a balanced practice that brings together all people impacted by an issue or behavior.”&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Heather Alexander details the roots of these practices, stating, “The principles of restorative justice are consistent with many indigenous traditions, including Canadian First Nations people and the Maori in New Zealand.”&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; She also links restorative justice to “entangled roots in native, religious, and legal communities.”&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Alexander and González have studied how the underpinnings of various cultural, religious, and judicial practices have made their way into the philosophy and practice of restorative justice.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Multiple scholars advocate for restorative practices as an alternative to exclusionary approaches to discipline, both in schools and in the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karp|first=David R.|last2=Breslin|first2=Beau|date=2001|title=Restorative justice in school communities|url=|journal=Youth &amp; Society|volume=33 |issue=2|pages=249–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Many different practices (including, but not limited to: circles, mediation, conferencing, and youth courts) are labeled as restorative justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mapping Leadership: The tasks that matter for improving teaching and learning in schools.|last=Halverson|first=Richard|publisher=Jossey Bass|year=2017|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=98–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor Fronius, et. al describe restorative justice as “a broad term that encompasses a growing social movement to institutionalize peaceful and non-punitive approaches for addressing harm, responding to violations of legal and human rights, and problem solving.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fronius|first=Trevor|last2=Persson|first2=Hannah|last3=Guckenburg|first3=Sarah|last4=Hurley|first4=Nancy|last5=Petrosino|first5=Anthony|date=2016|title=Restorative justice in US schools: A research review|url=http://www.antoniocasella.eu/restorative/Fronius_feb16.pdf|journal=WestEd Justice and Prevention Research Center|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition speaks to restorative justice as more of a collection of practices rooted in a common philosophy than a specific “program.” Fronius, et. al go on to say that “the emphasis on the harm done rather than the act is a widely recognized principle across the RJ literature.”&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; and they speak to Dorothy Vaandering’s work surrounding “how to use shame as a path toward reintegration rather than stigmatization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaandering|first=Dorothy|date=2010|title=The significance of critical theory for restorative justice in education|url=|journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy &amp; Cultural Studies|volume=32 |issue=2|pages=145–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Key Principles of Restorative Justice''' 
* Repairing Harm, 
* Involving Stakeholders 
* Transforming Community Relationships&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Staff allocation==

Both inclusive and pull-out models seek to reduce the student to teacher ratio, but inclusive models do so by bringing services and staff expertise to students. Thus, social justice leaders need to strategically plan how to effectively allocate their limited staff resources.&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capper|first1=Elise M. Frattura, Colleen A.|title=Leading for social justice : transforming schools for all learners|date=2007|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-0761931782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than having several specialists who work with students with specific needs, leaders structure collaborative teams of classroom teachers, cross-categorical special education teachers, and bilingual resource teachers to support classrooms of students.&lt;ref name=Theoharis /&gt;

==Critiques==

Social justice educational leadership has been critiqued in several ways. Some feel social justice leadership reinforces the categorization of students, even though the approach emphasizes reducing unnecessary student labeling.&lt;ref name="Scheurich &amp; Skrla" /&gt; The data equity audits 
focus mostly on identifying inequitable learning outcomes,&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle" /&gt; but few solutions and strategies are suggested for improving these outcomes. By identifying the classroom teacher as responsible for ensuring all students reach proficiency, many teachers feel unsupported in the work and struggle to adequately [[differentiated instruction|differentiate]] lessons for their students. Finally, social justice educational leadership emphasizes proficiency as measured by [[standardized test]] scores,&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper" /&gt; which limits the space for innovation and teaching that builds higher-order thinking, which is difficult to measure on standardized tests.

'''Standard Average European''' ('''SAE''') is a concept introduced in 1939 by [[Benjamin Whorf]] to group the modern [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[languages of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language", published in (1941), ''Language, Culture, and Personality: Essays in Memory of [[Edward Sapir]]'' Edited by [[Leslie Spier]], [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|A. Irving Hallowell]], Stanley S. Newman. [[Menasha, Wisconsin|Menasha]], [[Wisconsin]]: Sapir Memorial Publication Fund. p 75-93.&lt;br /&gt;Reprinted in (1956), ''Language, Thought and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamins Lee Whorf.'' Edited by [[John Bissell Carroll|John B. Carroll]]. [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts|Mass.]]: [[MIT Press|The M.I.T. Press]]. p. 134-159.&lt;br /&gt;Quotation is Whorf (1941:77-78) and (1956:138).&lt;blockquote&gt;The work began to assume the character of a comparison between [[Hopi language|Hopi]] and western European languages. It also became evident that even the grammar of Hopi bore a relation to Hopi culture, and the grammar of European tongues to our own "Western" or "European" culture. And it appeared that the interrelation brought in those large subsummations of experience by language, such as our own terms "time," "space," "substance," and "matter." Since, with respect to the traits compared, there is little difference between [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], or other [[Languages of Europe|European languages]] with the 'possible' (but doubtful) exception of [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] and [[Languages of Europe#Languages not from the Indo-European family|non-Indo-European]], I have lumped these languages into one group called SAE, or "Standard Average European."&lt;/blockquote&gt; (quotation p. 77--78) and as Whorf, B. L.&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf argued that these [[language]]s were characterized by a number of similarities including syntax and [[grammar]], vocabulary and its use as well as the relationship between contrasting words and their origins, idioms and word order which all made them stand out from many other language groups around the world which do not share these similarities; in essence creating a continental [[sprachbund]]. His point was to argue that the disproportionate degree of knowledge of SAE languages biased [[linguist]]s towards considering grammatical forms to be highly natural or even universal, when in fact they were only peculiar to the SAE [[language group]].

Whorf contrasted what he called the SAE tense system which contrasts past, present and future tenses with that of the [[Hopi language]], which Whorf analyzed as being based on a distinction not of [[grammatical tense|tense]], but on distinguishing things that have in fact occurred (a [[realis mood]] encompassing SAE past and present) as opposed to things that have as yet not occurred, but which may or may not occur in the future ([[irrealis mood]]). The accuracy of Whorf's analysis of Hopi tense has later been [[Hopi time controversy|a point of controversy]] in linguistics.

Whorf likely considered [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] to form the core of the SAE, i.e. the [[literary language]]s of [[Europe]] which have seen substantial cultural influence from [[Latin]] during the [[Medieval Latin|medieval period]]. The [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages]] tend to be more peripheral members.

[[Alexander Gode]], who was instrumental in the development of [[Interlingua]], characterized it as "Standard Average European".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lecorde.com/interlinguaus/pakupaku/uploads/GodeManifestodeInterlingua.pdf|title=Manifesto de Interlingua|author=Alexander Gode, Ph.D|language=Interlingua|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romance, [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] control languages of Interlingua are reflective of the language groups most often included in the SAE ''Sprachbund''.

==As a ''Sprachbund''==
According to [[Martin Haspelmath]] (2001), the SAE languages form a ''[[Sprachbund]]'' characterized by the following features, sometimes called "euroversals" by analogy with [[linguistic universal]]s:&lt;ref name="haspelmath1"&gt;[http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/seminar/abteilungen/sprachwissenschaft/ls_kortmann/Courses/Kortmann/Variation/index_html/2008-05-27.8724094854 "Language Typology and Language Universals"] accessed 2015-10-13&lt;/ref&gt;
* definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)|article]]s (e.g. English ''the'' vs. ''a'');
* postnominal [[relative clause]]s with inflected [[relative pronoun]]s that signal the role of the head in the clause (e.g. English ''who'' vs. ''whose'');
* a [[periphrastic]] perfect formed with 'have' plus a passive participle (e.g. English ''I have said'');
* a preponderance of generalizing [[wikt:predicate|predicates]] to encode [[experiencer]]s, i.e. experiencers appear as surface subjects in [[nominative case]] (e.g. English ''I like music'' instead of ''Music pleases me,'' though compare Spanish ''Me gusta la música'' and German ''Musik gefällt mir,'' which are of the form "Music pleases me");
* a passive construction formed with a passive participle plus an intransitive copula-like verb (e.g. English ''I am known'');
* a prominence of [[anticausative verb]]s in inchoative-causative pairs (e.g. Russian inchoative anticausative ''izmenit’-sja'' 'to change ([[intransitive verb|intransitive]])' is derived from causative ''izmenit’'' 'to change [something], make [something] change');
* [[Dative case|dative]] external possessors (e.g. German ''Die Mutter wusch '''dem Kind''' die Haare'' "The mother washed the child's hair" (lit. "The mother washed the hair to the child"), Portuguese ''Ela lavou-'''lhe''' o cabelo'' "She washed his hair");
* negative indefinite pronouns without verbal negation (e.g. German ''Niemand kommt'' "nobody comes" vs. Modern Greek ''Kanénas dhen érxete'' "nobody (lit. not) comes");
* particle comparatives in comparisons of inequality (e.g. English ''bigger '''than''' an elephant'');
* equative constructions (i.e. constructions for comparison of equality) based on adverbial relative-clause structures, e.g. Occitan ''tan grand '''coma''' un elefant'', Russian ''tak že X kak Y'', where ''coma/kak'' (historically coming from the adverbial interrogative pronoun "how") are "adverbial relative pronouns" according to Haspelmath;
* subject person affixes as strict [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] markers, i.e. the verb is inflected for person and number of the subject, but subject pronouns may not be [[null-subject language|dropped]] even when this would be unambiguous (only in some languages, such as German, French and [[Spoken Finnish]], e.g. '''mä''' oo'''n''', "I am" and '''sä''' oo'''t''', "you are"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaino.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=716|title=§ 716 Minä, sinä, hän, me, te, he|language=Finnish|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Colloq/Colloq0708/helasvuo.html|title=Competing strategies in person marking: double-marking vs. economy|author=Marja-Liisa Helasvuo|date=January 24, 2008|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
* differentiation between intensifiers and [[reflexive pronoun]]s (e.g. German intensifier ''selbst'' vs. reflexive ''sich'').

Besides these features, which are uncommon outside Europe and thus useful for defining the SAE area, Haspelmath (2001) lists further features characteristic of European languages (but also found elsewhere):
* verb-initial order in yes/no questions;
* comparative inflection of adjectives (e.g. English ''bigger'');
* conjunction "A and-B" instead of "A-and B", "A-and B-and", "A B-and", or "with";
* syncretism of [[instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[comitative case|comitative]] cases (e.g. English ''I cut my food '''with''' a knife when eating '''with''' my friends'');
* [[suppletivism]] in ''second'' vs. ''two'';
* no distinction between alienable (e.g. legal property) and [[inalienable possession|inalienable]] (e.g. body part) possession;
* no distinction between [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive]] first-person plural pronouns ("we and you" vs. "we and not you");
* no productive usage of [[reduplication]];
* [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] expressed by intonation and word order;
* word order [[subject–verb–object]];
* only one [[converb]], preference for finite subordinate clauses;
* specific "neither-nor" construction;
* phrasal adverbs (e.g. English ''already'', ''still'', ''not yet'');
* tendency towards replacement of [[past tense]] by the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]].

There is also a broad agreement in the following parameters (not listed in Haspelmath 2001):{{fact|date=June 2015}}
* absence of phonemic opposition [[velar consonant|velar]]/[[uvular consonant|uvular]];
* phonemic voicing oppositions (/p/ vs. /b/ etc.);
* initial consonant clusters of the type "stop+sonorant" allowed;
* only [[pulmonic consonant]]s;
* at least three degrees of vowel height (minimum inventory ''i e a o u'');
* lack of [[lateral consonant|lateral]] fricatives and affricates;
* predominantly suffixing morphology;
* moderately synthetic [[fusional language|fusional]] morphological typology;
* nominative–accusative [[morphosyntactic alignment]].

The ''Sprachbund'' defined this way consists of the following languages:&lt;ref name="haspelmath1" /&gt;
* [[Germanic languages]];
* [[Romance languages]];
* [[Baltic languages]];
* [[Slavic languages]];
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]];
* [[Modern Greek language|Greek]];
* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

The [[Balkan sprachbund]] is thus included as a subset of the larger SAE, while the [[Baltic language area]] is a coordinate member.

Not all the languages listed above show all the listed features, so membership in SAE can be described as gradient. Based on nine of the above-mentioned common features, Haspelmath regards French and German as forming the '''nucleus''' of the Sprachbund, surrounded by a '''core''' formed by English, the other Romance languages, the Nordic languages, and the Western and Southern Slavic languages. Hungarian, the Baltic languages, the Eastern Slavic languages, and the [[Finnic languages]] form more peripheral groups.&lt;ref name="howyoung"&gt;Haspelmath, Martin, 1998. How young is Standard Average European? ''Language Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; All languages identified by Haspelmath as core SAE are [[Indo-European languages]], except Hungarian and the Finnic languages. However, not all Indo-European languages are SAE languages: the [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Armenian languages|Armenian]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages]] remain outside the SAE ''Sprachbund''.&lt;ref name=haspelmath&gt;[Haspelmath, Martin, 2001. The European linguistic area: Standard Average European. In: Martin Haspelmath, Ekkehard König, Wolfgang Oesterreicher and Wolfgang Raible (eds.),Language Typology and Language Universals. Sprachtypologie und sprachliche Universalien. Sprachtypologie und sprachliche Universalien: La typologie des langues et les universaux linguistiques: An International Handbook: Ein internationales Handbuch: Manuel international, 1492–1510. Berlin/New York: Walter de Gruyter.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standard Average European ''Sprachbund'' is most likely the result of ongoing [[language contact]] in the time of the [[Migration Period]]&lt;ref name=haspelmath/&gt; and later, continuing during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
Inheritance of the SAE features from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] can be ruled out because Proto-Indo-European, as currently reconstructed, lacked most of the SAE features.&lt;ref name="howyoung"/&gt;

Taiwanese Mandarin is almost identical to the official language of mainland China, called ''Standard Chinese([[Standard Chinese|Pǔtōnghuà]]''), with the exception of their [[Chinese characters|writing systems]]. However, Mandarin as spoken informally in Taiwan has some notable differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation with Standard Mandarin, differences which have arisen mainly &lt;!--aoth dutch/port.traces?/cantones?--&gt;under influence from [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] ({{citation needed span|the native variety of about 70% of the population of Taiwan|date=June 2015}}), other [[Languages of Taiwan|mother tongues of Taiwan]] like [[Taiwanese Hakka]] ({{citation needed span|spoken natively by about 15% of Taiwanese|date=June 2015}}) and [[Formosan languages]], additionally [[English language|English]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] from the prior [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese period]].

==Usage==
In 1945 when the [[Republic of China]] took over Taiwan and surrounding islands from [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], Mandarin was introduced as the official language and made compulsory in schools. A [[Mandarin Promotion Council]] (now called [[National Languages Committee]]) was established in 1946 by Taiwan Chief Executive [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] to standardize and popularize the usage of [[Standard Mandarin]] in Taiwan. The Council was led by 21 Chinese Scholars such as [[Wei Jiangong]] (魏建功), [[He Rong]] (何容), [[Qi Tiehen]] (齊鐵恨), [[Wang Yuchuan]] (王玉川), [[Fang Shiduo]] (方師鐸), [[Zhu Zhaoxiang]], [[Wu Shouli]] (吳守禮) etc. (From 1895 to 1945, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] was the official language and taught in schools.) Since then, Mandarin has been established as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the various groups in Taiwan: the majority Han ethnic [[Hoklo (ethnic group)|Hoklo]], the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] who have their own [[Hakka Chinese|spoken variant]], [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlanders]] whose native tongue may be any Chinese variant from mainland China, and the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] who speak [[Formosan languages]].

Until the 1980s the [[Kuomintang]] administration heavily promoted the use of Standard Mandarin and discouraged the use of Hokkien and other vernaculars, even portraying them as inferior. Mandarin was the only sanctioned Chinese variety for use in the media. This produced a backlash in the 1990s. Although some supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] tend to be opposed to standard Mandarin in favor of Hokkien, efforts to replace standard Mandarin either with Hokkien or with a multi-lingual standard have not been successful. Today, Mandarin is taught by immersion starting in elementary school. After the second grade, the entire educational system is in Mandarin, except for local language classes that have been taught for a few hours each week starting in the mid-1990s.

Taiwanese Mandarin (as with [[Singlish]] and many other situations of a [[diglossia]]) is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers.  Formal occasions call for the [[acrolect]]al level of ''Guoyu'' (Standard Mandarin).  Less formal situations often result in the [[basilect]] form, which has more uniquely Hokkien features. Bilingual speakers often [[Code-switching|code-switch]] between Mandarin and Hokkien, sometimes in the same sentence.

Mandarin is spoken fluently by almost the entire Taiwanese population, except for some elderly people who were educated under Japanese rule. In the capital [[Taipei]], where there is a high concentration of [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlanders]] whose native variety is not Hokkien, Mandarin is used in greater frequency and fluency than other parts of Taiwan.

==Differences from Mainland Mandarin==
{{Further|Standard Mandarin}}

===Divisions===
Taiwanese Mandarin can be divided into three dialects, [[Taipei]] Mandarin ({{zh|labels=no |t=臺北腔 |p=Táiběi qiāng}}), [[Taichung]] Mandarin ({{zh|labels=no |t=臺中腔 |p=Táizhōng qiāng}}) and Southern Taiwan Mandarin ({{zh|labels=no |t=南臺話 |p=Nántái huà}}).

===Script===
Taiwanese Mandarin uses [[traditional Chinese characters]], as opposed to the [[simplified Chinese characters]] on the mainland. [[Taiwanese braille]] is based on different letter assignments than [[Mainland Chinese braille]]. Romanization had once been distinct, but now the [[pinyin]] system can be seen in both sides, though [[pinyin]] is mainly used in Mainland China while the [[Wade-Giles]] and [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] system is more prominent in Taiwan.

===Pronunciation===
There are two categories of pronunciation differences. The first is of characters that have an official pronunciation that differs from ''Putonghua'', primarily in the form of differences in [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], rather than in vowels or consonants. The second is more general, with differences being unofficial and arising through [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] influence on ''Guoyu''.

====Variant official pronunciations====
There are a few [http://www.zhongwen.com/x/guopu.htm differences] in official pronunciations, mainly in [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], between ''Guoyu'' and ''Putonghua''.

The following is a partial list of such differences:

|}

====Hokkien-influenced====
In [[acrolect]]al Taiwanese Mandarin:
* The [[retroflex]] sounds (zh, ch, sh, r) from ''Putonghua'' tend to merge with the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] series (z, c, s), becoming more [[Relative articulation|retracted version]] of alveolar consonants like [t͡s̠ʰ][t͡s̠][s̠][z̠].{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=47}}
* [[Erhua]] is rarely heard as a diminutive.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=47}}
* [[Isochrony]] is considerably more syllable-timed than in other Mandarin dialects (including ''Putonghua''), which are stress-timed. Consequently, the "neutral tone" (輕聲) does not occur as often.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=47}}
* The syllable written as {{zh|p=eng}} after b, f, m, p and w is pronounced as [oŋ].{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=48}}

In [[basilect]]al Taiwanese Mandarin, sounds that do not occur in Hokkien are replaced by sounds from Hokkien. These variations from Standard Mandarin are similar to the variations of Mandarin spoken in southern China. Using the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system, the following sound changes take place (going from ''Putonghua'' to Taiwanese Mandarin followed with an example):

* Complete replacement of retroflex sounds (zh, ch, sh, r) by alveolar consonants (z, c, s, l). ''r'' may also become {{IPA|[z]}}.
* ''f-'' becomes ''hu-'' (''fan → huan'' {{lang|zh-tw|反 → 緩}}) (This applies to native Hokkien speakers - [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] speakers maintain precisely the opposite: (e.g. ''hua → fa'' {{lang|zh-tw|花 → 發}}))
* ''-ie, ye'' becomes ''ei'' (''tie → tei'')
* ''yu'' becomes ''yi'' (''yue → ye'' {{lang|zh-tw|月 → 夜}})
* the [[diphthong]]s ''ei'' and ''ou'' are [[monophthong]]ized as [e] and [o] respectively.

===Grammar===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The standard Mandarin construct {{lang|zh-tw|有…沒有}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} (have or not have) is not as commonly used in Taiwanese Mandarin as in standard Mandarin. For example, the sentence "Do you have a car?" is as follows:
:Taiwanese Mandarin: {{lang|zh-cn|你有沒有汽車？}} (lit. "you have or not have a car?")
:PRC Mandarin: {{lang|zh-tw|你有汽车沒有?}} (lit. "you have a car or not have?")

For non-recurring events, the construction involving {{lang|zh-tw|有}} is used where the sentence final particle {{lang|zh-tw|了}} would normally be applied to denote [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]. For instance, Taiwanese Mandarin more commonly uses "{{lang|zh-tw|你有看醫生嗎？}}" to mean "Have you seen a doctor?" whereas Putonghua uses "{{lang|zh-cn|你看醫生了嗎？}}". This is due to the influence of [[Hokkien]] grammar, which uses {{lang|zh-tw|有}} ''ū'' in a similar fashion. For recurring or certain events however, both Taiwanese and Mainland Mandarin use the latter, as in "{{lang|zh-cn|你吃飯了嗎？}}", meaning "Have you eaten?"

Another example of Hokkien grammar's influence on Taiwanese Mandarin is the use of {{lang|zh-tw|會}} as "to be" verbs before adjectives, in addition to the usual meanings "would" or "will". For instance:

:Taiwanese Mandarin: {{lang|zh-tw|你會冷嗎?}} (lit. "you are cold INT?")
:Taiwanese Mandarin: {{lang|zh-tw|我會冷}} (lit. "I am cold.")  
:Taiwanese Mandarin: {{lang|zh-tw|我不會冷}} (lit. "I not am cold.")

This reflects Hokkien syntax, as shown below:

:Hokkien: {{lang|nan|你會寒𣍐?}} (lit. "you are cold, not?") 
:Hokkien: {{lang|nan|我會寒}} (lit. "I am cold.") 
:Hokkien: {{lang|nan|我𣍐寒}} (lit. "I not cold.")

In Putonghua, sentences would more likely be rendered as follows:

:Putonghua: {{lang|zh-ch|你冷不冷?}} (lit. "you cold, not cold?"), or {{lang|zh-ch|你冷嗎?}} (lit. "you cold INT?"). 
:Putonghua: {{lang|zh-ch|我冷}} (lit. "I cold")
:Putonghua: {{lang|zh-ch|我不冷}} (lit. "I not cold").{{sfnp|Lu|2011|p=}}

===Vocabulary===
Vocabulary differences can be divided into several categories – particles, different usage of the same term, [[loan words]], [[jargon|technological words]], [[idiom]]s, and words specific to living in Taiwan.  Because of the limited transfer of information between mainland China and Taiwan after the Chinese civil war, many items that were invented after this split have different names in ''Guoyu'' and ''Putonghua''. Additionally, many terms were adopted from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] both as a result of its close proximity ([[Okinawa]]) as well as Taiwan's status as a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese territory]] in the first half of the 20th century.

====Particles====
Spoken Taiwanese Mandarin uses a number of Taiwan specific (but not exclusive) final particles, such as 囉 (luō), 嘛(ma), 喔 (ō), 耶 (yē), 咧 (lie), 齁 (hō), 咩 (mei), 唷 (yō), etc.

====Same words, different meaning====
Some terms have different meanings in Taiwan and mainland China, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings between speakers of different sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]]. Often there are alternative, unambiguous terms which can be understood by both sides.

|-
| {{lang|zh-tw|搞}}&lt;br&gt;gǎo
| to carry out something insidious, to have sex (vulgar/slang)
| to do, to perform a task
| As such, it is a verb that is rarely seen in any official or formal setting in Taiwan, whereas it is widely used in mainland China even by its top officials in official settings.
The word {{lang|zh-tw|弄}} (nòng) can be used inoffensively in place of 搞 in both Taiwan and mainland China to covey the action "to do; to perform a task" as 弄 is widely used in both places and does not carry the vulgar connotation.  
|-
| {{lang|zh-tw|窩心}} ([[Traditional Chinese character|T]])&lt;br&gt;{{lang|zh-cn|窝心}} ([[Simplified Chinese character|S]])&lt;br&gt;wōxīn

====Loan words====
[[Loan words]] may differ largely between Putonghua and Taiwanese Mandarin, as different characters or methods may be chosen for [[transliteration]] (phonetical or [[semantics|semantical]]), even the number of characters may differ. For example, U.S. President Barack Obama's surname is called {{lang|zh-hant|[[Barack Obama|奥巴馬]]}} ''Àobāmǎ'' in Putonghua and {{lang|zh-hant|歐巴馬}} or {{lang|zh-hant|歐巴瑪}} ''Ōubāmǎ'' in Guoyu. Also, in Taiwanese Mandarin, rhotacization ([[erhua]]) is generally avoided.

=====From English=====
The term ({{lang|zh-tw|[[wikt:麻吉|麻吉]]}} ''májí'') borrowed from the English term "match", is used to describe items or people which complement each other well. Note that this term has become popular in mainland China as well.

The English term "[[hamburger]]" has been adopted in many Chinese-speaking communities. In Taiwan, the preferred form is {{lang|zh-tw|[[wikt:漢堡|漢堡]]}} (''hànbǎo'') rather than the mainland Chinese {{lang|zh-tw|[[wikt:漢堡包|漢堡包]]}} (''hànbǎobāo'').

=====From Taiwanese Hokkien=====
The terms "{{lang|zh-tw|阿公}} ''agōng''" and "{{lang|zh-tw|阿媽}} ''amà''" are more commonly heard than the standard Mandarin terms {{lang|zh-tw|爺爺}} ''yéye'' (paternal grandfather), {{lang|zh-tw|外公}} ''wàigōng'' (maternal grandfather), {{lang|zh-tw|奶奶}} ''nǎinai'' (paternal grandmother) and {{lang|zh-tw|外婆}} ''wàipó'' (maternal grandmother).

Some local foods usually are referred to using their Hokkien names.  These include:

'''Taurus''' ([[Latin]] for "the '''Bull'''") is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]], which means it is crossed by the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the [[Early Bronze Age]] when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring [[equinox]]. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced [[sacred bull|various bull figures]] in the mythologies of Ancient [[Sumerian religion|Sumer]], [[Akkadian religion|Akkad]], [[Assyrian religion|Assyria]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylon]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek religion|Greece]], and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome]].

A number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest [[open cluster]]s to Earth, the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the [[red giant]] [[Aldebaran]] is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the [[supernova remnant]] [[Messier 1]], more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation. The [[variable star]] [[T Tauri]] is the prototype of a class of [[pre-main-sequence star]]s.

==Characteristics==
Taurus is a big and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky, between [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] to the west and [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] to the east; to the north lies [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], to the southeast [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], to the south [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], and to the southwest [[Cetus]]. In September and October, Taurus is visible in the evening along the eastern horizon. The most favorable time to observe Taurus in the night sky is during the months of December and January. By March and April, the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight.&lt;ref name="Garfinkle 1997" /&gt;

This constellation forms part of the zodiac and hence is intersected by the [[ecliptic]]. This circle across the [[celestial sphere]] forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in the constellation Taurus during some part of each year.&lt;ref name="Garfinkle 1997" /&gt; The [[galactic plane]] of the [[Milky Way]] intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the [[galactic anticenter]] is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as [[Gould's Belt]] passes through the constellation.&lt;ref name="crossen_rhemann2004" /&gt;

The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is "Tau".&lt;ref name="pa30_469" /&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|03|23.4}} and {{RA|05|53.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 31.10° and −1.35°.&lt;ref name="boundary" /&gt; Because a small part of the constellation lies to the south of the [[celestial equator]], this can not be a completely [[circumpolar constellation]] at any latitude.&lt;ref name="seeds2007" /&gt;

==Features==

[[File:TaurusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Taurus as it can be seen by the naked eye.&lt;ref name="allthesky" /&gt; The constellation lines have been added for clarity.]]

During November, the [[Taurid]] [[meteor shower]] appears to radiate from the general direction of this constellation. The [[Beta Taurid]] meteor shower occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques.&lt;ref name="lewis1997" /&gt; Between 18 and 29 October, both the [[Northern Taurids]] and the [[Southern Taurids]] are active; though the latter stream is stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 22 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Sky &amp; Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 23 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brightest member of this constellation is [[Aldebaran]], an orange-hued, [[spectral class]] K5&amp;nbsp;III [[giant star]].&lt;ref name="Burnham" /&gt; Its name derives from '''{{lang|ar|[[wikt:الدبران|الدبران]]}}''' ''{{transl|ar|al-dabarān}}'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "the follower", probably from the fact that it follows the [[Pleiades]] during the nightly motion of the  [[celestial sphere]] across the sky.{{sfn|Chartrand|1993|p=188}}&lt;ref name="schaff" /&gt;{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=383}} Forming the profile of a Bull's face is a ''V'' or ''K''-shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]],&lt;ref name="Olcott" /&gt; the nearest distinct open [[star cluster]] after the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]].&lt;ref name="inglis2004" /&gt; In this profile, Aldebaran forms the bull's bloodshot eye, which has been described as "glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion",&lt;ref name="saski_boddy2003" /&gt; a constellation that lies just to the southwest. The Hyades span about 5° of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2003|p=55}} It includes a naked eye double star, [[Theta Tauri]] (the proper name of Theta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Tauri is ''Chakumuy'')&lt;ref name="IAU-LSN"/&gt;, with a separation of 5.6&amp;nbsp;[[arcminutes]].&lt;ref name="kaler_theta_tauri" /&gt;

In the northeastern quadrant of the Taurus constellation lie the [[Pleiades]] ([[Messier object|M45]]), one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the naked eye. The seven most prominent stars in this cluster are at least visual [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] six, and so the cluster is also named the "Seven Sisters". However, many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope.&lt;ref name="marx_pfau_lamble1992" /&gt; Astronomers estimate that the cluster has approximately 500-1,000 stars, all of which are around 100 million years old. However, they vary considerably in type. The Pleiades themselves are represented by large, bright stars; also many small [[brown dwarf]]s and [[white dwarf]]s exist. The cluster is estimated to dissipate in another 250 million years.&lt;ref name="objects" /&gt; The Pleiades cluster is classified as a Shapley class c and Trumpler class I 3 r n cluster, indicating that it is irregularly shaped and loose, though concentrated at its center and detached from the star-field.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=94}}

In the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of [[NGC 1514]]. This [[planetary nebula]] is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer [[William Herschel]] in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that [[nebula]]e were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer [[William Huggins]] used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|pp=74–77}}

To the west, the two horns of the bull are formed by [[Beta Tauri|Beta (β) Tauri]] and [[Zeta Tauri|Zeta (ζ) Tauri]]; two star systems that are separated by 8°. Beta is a white, spectral class B7 III giant star known as ''El Nath'', which comes from the Arabic phrase "the butting", as in butting by the horns of the bull.{{sfn|Chartrand|1993|p=184}} At magnitude 1.65, it is the second brightest star in the constellation, and shares the border with the neighboring constellation of [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. As a result, it also bears the designation Gamma Aurigae. Zeta Tauri (the proper name is ''Tianguan''&lt;ref name="IAU-LSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/ | title=Naming Stars |publisher=IAU.org |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[eclipsing binary]] star that completes an orbit every 133 days.&lt;ref name="Burnham" /&gt;

A degree to the northwest of ζ Tauri is the [[Crab Nebula]] (M1), a [[supernova remnant]]. This expanding [[nebula]] was created by a [[Type II supernova]] explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak, the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe.&lt;ref name="hawkins2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="covington2002" /&gt; [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American peoples]] also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when [[John Bevis]] found it.&lt;ref name="objects" /&gt;

The star [[Lambda Tauri|Lambda (λ) Tauri]] is an eclipsing binary star. This system consists of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The [[orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of their orbit]] lies almost along the line of sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 [[astronomical unit]]s, so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.&lt;ref name="apj263_289" /&gt;

[[File:Central area of constellation Taurus.jpg|thumb|Central area of constellation Taurus, showing [[Aldebaran]] at the lower left.]]

Located about 1.8° west of [[Epsilon Tauri|Epsilon (ε) Tauri]] is [[T Tauri]], the prototype of a class of [[variable star]]s called [[T Tauri star]]s. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between [[visual magnitude|magnitude]] 9 to 13 over a period of weeks or months.&lt;ref name="Garfinkle 1997" /&gt; This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a [[main sequence]] star.&lt;ref name="araa27_1_351" /&gt; The surrounding [[reflection nebula]] [[NGC 1555]] is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity.&lt;ref name="noao_1555" /&gt; To the north lies [[Kappa Tauri]], a visual [[double star]] consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|p=475}}

This constellation includes part of the Taurus-Auriga complex, or Taurus dark clouds, a star-forming region containing sparse, filamentary clouds of gas and dust. This spans a diameter of {{Convert|98|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} and contains 35,000&amp;nbsp;[[solar mass]]es of material, which is both larger and less massive than the [[Orion Nebula]].&lt;ref name="schulz2005" /&gt; At a distance of {{Convert|490|ly|pc|abbr=off}}, this is one of the nearest active star forming regions.&lt;ref name="babu_feigelson1996" /&gt; Located in this region, about 10° to the northeast of Aldebaran, is an asterism [[NGC 1746]] spanning a width of 45 [[arcminute]]s.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|p=84}}

The identification of the [[constellation]] of Taurus with a bull is very old, certainly dating to the [[Chalcolithic]], and perhaps even to the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Michael Rappenglück of the [[University of Munich]] believes that Taurus is represented in a [[cave painting]] at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at [[Lascaux]] (dated to roughly 15,000 BC), which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades.&lt;ref name="arxiv0810.1592" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehouse20000809" /&gt; The name "seven sisters" has been used for the Pleiades in the languages of many cultures, including indigenous groups of [[Australia]], [[North America]] and [[Siberia]]. This suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin.&lt;ref name="brown2008" /&gt;

Taurus marked the point of [[vernal equinox|vernal (spring) equinox]] in the [[Chalcolithic]] and the [[Early Bronze Age]], from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].&lt;ref name="noonan05" /&gt; The Pleiades were closest to the Sun at vernal equinox around the [[23rd century BC]]. In [[Babylonian astronomy]], the constellation was listed in the [[MUL.APIN]] as  {{lang|sux-Latn|GU&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.AN.NA}}, "The [[Bull of Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="rogers1998" /&gt; As this constellation marked the vernal equinox, it was also the first constellation in the Babylonian zodiac and they described it as "The Bull in Front".&lt;ref name="wilson1997" /&gt; The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] name was ''Alu''.&lt;ref name="white2008" /&gt;

In the [[Akkadian language|Old Babylonian]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the goddess [[Ishtar]] sends Taurus, the [[Bull of Heaven]], to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.&lt;ref name="hines2002" /&gt; Enkidu tears off the bull's hind part and hurls the quarters into the sky where they become the stars we know as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], facing Taurus as if in combat,&lt;ref name="ns120_36" /&gt; while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian religion|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for "star-constellation"), there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.&lt;ref name="white2008" /&gt;

The same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the [[Dendera zodiac]], an [[Egypt]]ian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the [[celestial hemisphere]] using a [[planisphere]]. In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward.&lt;ref name="jbaa108_1_9" /&gt; To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began. This "sacrifice" led to the renewal of the land.&lt;ref name="ptak1998" /&gt; To the early [[Hebrews]], Taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet, [[Aleph]].{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=381}}

In [[Greek mythology]], Taurus was identified with [[Zeus]], who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull to abduct [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation is depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife [[Hera]], Zeus changed Io into the form of a heifer.&lt;ref name="ridpath2018" /&gt; Greek mythographer [[Acusilaus]] marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the [[Cretan Bull]], one of [[Labors of Hercules|The Twelve Labors]] of [[Heracles]].&lt;ref name="palaephatus_stern1996" /&gt;

Taurus became an important object of worship among the [[Druid]]s. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation.&lt;ref name="noonan05" /&gt; Among the arctic people known as the [[Inuit]], the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing the spirit of the [[polar bear]]. Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay.&lt;ref name=penprase2010/&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], legends hold that [[Gautama Buddha]] was born when the [[Full Moon]] was in [[Vaisakha]], or Taurus.&lt;ref name="grundwedel1901" /&gt; Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or [[Vesākha]], which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.&lt;ref name="mr2007" /&gt;

===Astrology===
{{main|Taurus (astrology)}}

===Space exploration===
The [[space probe]] ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its batteries will be long dead.&lt;ref name=NASA20030225/&gt;

===Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919===
Several stars in Hyades cluster include [[Kappa Tauri]] were photographed during [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]] by the expedition of [[Arthur Eddington]] in [[Príncipe]] and others in [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral, Brazil]] that [[tests of general relativity|confirmed]] [[Albert Einstein]]'s prediction of the [[gravitational lens|bending of light]] around the [[Sun]] from his [[general theory of relativity]] which he published in 1915.&lt;ref name="Eddington1920"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dyson|author2=Eddington, A.S.|author3=Davidson, C.R. |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|Phil.

'''''The Eye''''' ({{lang-ru|Соглядатай}}, ''Sogliadatai'', literally 'voyeur' or 'peeper'), written in 1930, is [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s fourth [[novel]]. It was translated into English by the author's son [[Dmitri Nabokov]] in 1965.

At just over 100 pages, ''The Eye'' is Nabokov's shortest novel. Nabokov himself referred to it as a 'little novel' and it is a work that sits somewhere around the boundary between extended short story and novella. It was produced during a hiatus in Nabokov's creation of short stories between 1927 and 1930 as a result of his growing success as a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 – The Eye|url=http://www.mantex.co.uk/2009/09/25/the-eye/|publisher=Mantex|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many of Nabokov's early works, the characters are largely Russian [[émigré]]s relocated to Europe, specifically Berlin. In this case, the novel is set in two houses where a young Russian tutor, Smurov, is renting room and board.

==Plot summary==
The action of the novel largely begins after the attempted (perhaps successful) suicide of the [[protagonist]]. This occurs after he suffers a beating at the hands of a cuckolded husband (the protagonist has been having an affair with a woman called Matilda with whom he has also, apparently, been rather bored).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D. Barton|title=The Books Reflected in Nabokov's Eye|journal=The Slavic and East European Journal|date=Winter 1985|volume= 29| issue =  4|pages=393–404|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/307461?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103881731951|accessdate=20 June 2014|doi=10.2307/307461}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his supposed death, and assuming everything in the world around him to be a manifestation of his 'leftover' imagination, his "eye" observes a group of Russian émigrés as he tries to ascertain their opinions of the character Smurov, around whom much uncertainty and suspicion exists.

==Themes==
The novel deals largely with indeterminate locus of [[identity (social science)|identity]] and the [[social construction]] of identity in the reactions and opinions of others. Smurov exists as a fraud, nobleman, scoundrel, "sexual adventurer", thief, and spy in the eyes of the various characters. In some senses, Smurov is akin to the narrator of Dostoevsky's ''[[Notes from Underground]]''. As the protagonist carefully collects these observations, he attempts to build a stable perspective on Smurov — whom we only belatedly discover is the narrator himself. The result is a meditation on the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity.

The work is the first one in Nabokov's oeuvre involving a first-person narrator and, specifically, one who imposes his fantasy world upon the real world. This was to be a structure that was developed further in later works such as [[Despair (novel)|''Despair'']] (1934), ''[[Pale Fire]]'' (1962) and his final novel, ''[[Look at the Harlequins!]]'' (1974). In a 1967 interview with [[Alfred Appel|Alfred Appel Jr]], Nabokov retrospectively suggested that the work might have represented a turning-point in his career in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=D.

'''''The Liberal Imagination: Essays on Literature and Society''''' (1950) is a collection of sixteen essays by American literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]], published by [[The Viking Press|Viking]] in 1950. The book was edited by Pascal Covici, who had worked with Trilling when he edited and introduced Viking's ''Portable Matthew Arnold'' in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter to Pascal Cavici," 8 August 1949, Lionel Trilling Papers, Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Columbia University in the City of New York.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the preface, which was written specifically for the publication of the book, all the essays included in ''The Liberal Imagination'' were individually published in the decade before the book's publication in literary and critical journals, such as ''[[The Partisan Review]]'', ''[[The Kenyon Review]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', and ''The American Quarterly''. The essays, then, represent Trilling's written work and critical thoughts of the 1940s.

In the essays, Trilling explores the theme of what he calls "liberalism" by looking closely at the relationship between literature, culture, mind, and the imagination. He offers passionate critiques against literary ideas of reality as material and physical, such as those he ascribes to [[Vernon Louis Parrington|V. L. Parrington]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and the writers of the [[Kinsey Reports]]. He supports writers who engage in "moral realism" through an engaged imagination and a "power of love," which he sees expressed in works by [[Henry James]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Tacitus]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], and [[William Wordsworth]]—and in the ideas of human nature in the works of [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', (New York: The Viking Press, 1950), pp. ix, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Liberal Imagination'' enjoyed a relatively large commercial success, selling 100,000 hardcover and 70,000 paperback copies, and was later to be understood as an essential book for a group of influential literary, political, and cultural thinkers of the era, called “[[The New York Intellectuals]]."  The initial reviewers, such as [[Irving Howe]], R. P. Blackmore, [[Norman Podhoretz]], and [[Delmore Schwartz]], represent the importance of this book to the "Intellectuals."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Kirsch, ''Why Trilling Matters'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2011), pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, scholars turned to ''The Liberal Imagination'' as a work representative of the post-war politics and culture of the United States, which was entering the early stages of the [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;"''The Liberal Imagination'' sits at the center of the emerging postwar positions of the New York Intellectuals because of both its intrinsic and its symbolic importance." Alexander Bloom, ''Prodigal Sons: The New York Intellectuals and Their World'' (Cary, US: Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopses ==

=== “Preface” ===

Trilling introduces the book, writing that though the essays that comprise the volume “are diverse in subject, they have...a certain unity.” The unity, he suggests, is an interest in liberalism. Trilling argues that because his contemporary America is predominantly tending to an intellectually liberal tradition, the lack of a robust conservative intellectual tradition causes the lack of a cultural dialectic, making liberal ideas also weak. He writes that a critical view on literature is the best way to “recall liberalism to its first essential imagination” because it is the “human activity that takes the fullest and most precise account of variousness, possibility, complexity, and difficulty.” In this way, Trilling introduces that his essays on literature will inevitably broach topics of culture, politics, and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. ix-xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== “Reality in America” ===

Trilling confronts the influence of literary critic V.L. [[Vernon Louis Parrington|Parrington]]’s ''Main Currents in American Thought'' (1927), and the response to the novels of American writer Theodore [[Dreiser]], to discuss what he sees as the dangerous consequences of a writer's supposed responsibility to a conception of reality as material and physical. Trilling argues that Parrington believed in a reality that is "immutable; it is wholly external, it is irreducible," and that Parrington believed the job of a literary writer to be the transmission of this reality by loyal reproduction. This conception of reality can turn Americans toward an unwarranted "sympathetic indulgence" of writers, such as Dreiser, who claim to represent material reality ("hard, resistant, unformed, impenetrable, and unpleasant.") when they are really representing an ideology of reality, such as Dreiser's [[nihilism]]. It also informs a disavowal of writers, such as [[Henry James]], that engage in the "electrical qualities of the mind," and are not easily conformed to a social mission or politic.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Sherwood Anderson" ===

Trilling addresses the literary work and career of novelist [[Sherwood Anderson]], trying to reconcile his admiration for the man with the problems of his work. He assesses Anderson as victim to the fate "of the writer who at one short past moment has had a success with a simple idea which he allowed to remain simple and fixed." Trilling describes Anderson's "standing quarrel with respectable society" as one that once bred a truth related to the "precious secret essence" of individuals, but then led to a negation of the life of his characters through an excess of intellection, feeling, and a "love made wholly abstract." Trilling writes, "the more Anderson says about people, the less alive they become—and the less loveable." Though Trilling's evaluation of Anderson's truth is that it failed in literary expression—and that his lifeless worlds suggest a politic of subservient "marching men"—Trilling still admires the truthfulness of Anderson's "personal struggle with modernity," likening Anderson's work to an adolescence one must experience and eventually move on from.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, The Liberal Imagination, pp. 22-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Freud and Literature" ===

Trilling sees [[Sigmund Freud]]’s psychology as the "only systematic account of the human mind which, in point of subtlety and complexity, of interest and tragic power, deserves to stand beside the psychological insights which literature has accumulated through the centuries." Trilling argues that Freud's relationship of influence with literature is reciprocal; that Freud was positivistic and rationalistic, and not devoted only to the "night side of life"; and that one can make a connection between Freud's conceptions of the dream, neurosis, and art to explain how an artist "is in command of his fantasy, while it is exactly the mark of the neurotic that he is possessed by his fantasy." Trilling rejects psychoanalytic readings of literary works that rely on an author's intention, and proposes that readers look for the "whole conception of the mind" implicit in a work's psychological "effects" and the psychological "temperament of the artist as a man." Trilling ends the essay reflecting on Freud's later work, in which the "death instinct" was introduced to compliment the "pleasure principle," forming a state of man as "a kind of hell from within him from which rise everlastingly the impulses which threaten his civilization," where "compromise and the compounding with defeat constitute his best way of getting through the world." Thus, Trilling applauds Freud's tragic sense of the state of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 34-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Princess Casamassima" ===

Trilling places [[Henry James]]’s novel, ''[[The Princess Casamassima]]'' (1886), as among the greatest of novels from the nineteenth century. In his reading of the novel, Trilling points out James's "penetrating imagination" that gives an accurate account and imagining of not only the anarchy of the 1880s, but also the "social actuality" of anarchy's general moral claim on the goodness of humanity and the corruptive character of society. Trilling investigates the autobiographical aspects of the novel to conclude that the novel also acts as James's "demonstrative message," and that the artist possesses social responsibility. James's novel is an achievement of what Trilling calls "moral realism," which rests on James's "knowledge of complication," a penetrating awareness of "modern ironies," and an "imagination of disaster" complimented by an "imagination of love." Trilling concludes that James's moral realism in the novel results in an incomparable work that tells "the truth in a single luminous creation."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 67-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Function of the Little Magazine" ===

Trilling wrote this essay on the event of the publication of ''The Partisan Reader'', celebrating the ten-year anniversary of the literary magazine [[Partisan Review]], a magazine that, though influential, maintained a relatively low circulation. He argues that this irony is representative of a "great gulf" between the educated class and the best of contemporary literature, caused by a "fatal separation" “between the political ideas of our educated class and the deep places of the imagination." Partisan Review's mission, Trilling writes, is to "organize a union" between political ideas and the imagination by insisting on the realization that "unless we insist that politics is imagination and mind, we will learn that imagination and mind are politics and of the kind that we will not like."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Huckleberry Finn" ===

Trilling offers a reading of [[Mark Twain]]’s ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'' to explain why he believes it to be "one of the greatest books and one of the central documents of American culture."  Trilling argues that the book tells the truth "of moral passion" between the protagonist Huck and the benign and dangerous "river-God", symbolized by the [[Mississippi River]]. Trilling describes Huck's moral crisis as being between his "genuinely good will" and his distrust of others, based on a "profound and bitter knowledge of human depravity." He also mentions that the book's context in the years after the [[American Civil War]] implies that the book is commentary on an America that lost its moral values by serving a "money-god" without moral value, in the place of the moral river-god of ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Kipling" ===

Trilling sees [[Rudyard Kipling]] as a writer belonging "irrevocably to our past;" specifically, the past of childhood, where a justified rejection of him represents "our first literary-political decision." Kipling, Trilling writes, was "one of liberalism's major intellectual misfortunes." Trilling describes Kipling as unlovable because of the mindlessness of his ideas, most especially of his "mindless imperialism," which made readers react against him as a dangerous proponent of nationalism and national values. In so doing, Trilling argues, Kipling did damage to the very national values he cared so much about.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 118-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Immortality Ode" ===

In his reading of [[William Wordsworth]]’s ode, ''[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality]]'', Trilling counters the biographical reading of the poem as what literary critic Dean Sperry calls Wordsworth's "dirge sung over his departing powers." Evoking the context of the poem in comparison with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]’s "Dejection: Ode” and Wordsworth’s autobiographical Prelude, Trilling argues the ode is Wordsworth’s embrace of “new powers” and a “new poetic subject.” Trilling sees Wordsworth’s new power as a “double vision” through which he recognizes the ideal and earthly qualities of life and humanity. In this way, the poem represents Wordsworth’s maturity into adulthood, and an awareness of mortality, that makes the world even more “significant and precious.”&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 129-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== “Art and Neurosis” ===

Trilling confronts the notion that an artist’s imagination and genius comes from a neurotic illness. He concedes that one can gain “psychic knowledge” through psychological suffering, but maintains that an artist’s power is related to the mind in general, not only to the artist’s inner mind. Trilling offers a universal idea of neurosis, in which it is possible that all of humanity is “ill” with neurotic conflicts. An artist’s genius, Trilling argues, is how he articulates and represents the neurotic conflict to effect the readers’ “egos in struggle.” Trilling concludes that we should focus on how an artist “shapes the material of pain we all have.”&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination,'' pp. 160-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== “The Sense of the Past” ===

Trilling believes, countering the formal reading style of the [[New Critics]], that we must read literature with a sense of its past. The aesthetic aspect of a work's "pastness" ("the intellectual conditions in which a work of literature was made") is an important part of understanding its power, validity, and relevance. Trilling also argues that literary artists are both effects and causes of culture, and that historical criticism which treats a literary movement as something that can fail or succeed incorrectly supposes ideas are autonomous "generators of human events," that literature is meant to settle the problems of life "for good," and that the will plays little part in human life. Thus, Trilling suggests (evoking [[Nietzsche]]) "an ambivalent view" of the historical sense that looks to culture as "life's continuing evaluation of itself."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 185-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Tacitus Now" ===

Trilling argues that though his histories "have been put to strange uses," Roman historian [[Tacitus]] had a psychological "conception of history [that] was avowedly personal and moral." Trilling believes the "bitter division" between Tacitus's love of the Roman Republic's virtues and character and his despair at the republic's day having past informed a "secret tension" that "accounts for the poise and energy of his intellect."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 198-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Manners, Morals, and the Novel" ===

Trilling argues that manners, the "hum and buzz of implication," are a significant part of the formation of culture, and therefore are an important part of literature. He sees a novel's focus on social manners as a focus on a moral conflict between reality and appearance, a research into the truth behind the "snobbery" of false appearance and moneyed status. A novelist's creative awareness of manners becomes the "function of his love," making his literary work what Trilling calls "moral realism," in which the moral imagination is given free play. Trilling concludes that the novel of manners has never been "established" in America because of a conception of reality as the "hard, brute facts of existence." Moral realism, he argues, is sorely needed to respond to a contemporary commitment to "moral righteousness."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination,'' pp. 206-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Kinsey Report" ===

Trilling introduces the publication and commercial success of The [[Kinsey Reports]] (1948) as a therapy for society's need for the establishment of a "community of sexuality" and a symptom of that community's need to be "established in explicit quantitative terms." The study's scientific look at sex, Trilling finds, implies a neutrality, but hides a conception of sex as only existing first in its physical fact, rather than in interaction with its emotional reality. Trilling argues that the Report dehumanizes sexual behavior and rejects the idea that sex is involved with an "individual's character." This is especially true in the Report's discussion of sexual taboos, in which the writers reject the innateness of homosexuality and neglect that "the emotional circumstance of breaking of the taboo" is more significant than physically breaking the taboo itself. Trilling concludes that the Report's idea of fact as a "physical fact" rejects the crucial "personal or cultural meaning," or "even the existence," of the social fact of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 223-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ===


Trilling examines the life and literary career of American novelist [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], admiring Fitzgerald's heroism found "in his power of love." Fitzgerald's tragic love, Trilling suggests, is "destructive by reason of its very tenderness," because it was a "delicate tension" between an idea of human free-will along with a belief in the force of circumstance. Trilling calls Fitzgerald "a moralist to the core," because Fitzgerald was able to transcend the historical moment to "seize the moment as a moral fact." Analyzing Fitzgerald's novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', Trilling writes that the character Gatsby, "divided between power and dream, comes inevitably to stand for America itself." Trilling concludes that Fitzgerald's known lack of prudence is in fact his "heroic fault," in that it allowed him to deal, with tenderness, "a true firmness of moral judgment."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 244-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Art and Fortune" ===

Trilling reflects on whether "the novel is still a living form," concluding that he does not believe the novel to be dead. He sees the declining perception of the novel as reflective of a weakness in the "general intellectual life" and a passivity in the political mind. Trilling argues that the novel, as a "celebration and investigation of the human will," can reconstitute the will by teaching it to refuse the temptation of the ideologies of the social world. Trilling predicts that the novels of the future will "deal very explicitly with ideas," and that they should criticize ideas by attaching them to their "appropriately actuality," instead of allowing ideas to be systematized thoughtlessly through ideology. Trilling wants novelists to realize their ability "to maintain ambivalence toward their society," and wants a general understanding of the "fortuitous and gratuitous nature of art" that makes an intellectual atmosphere where novels are possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 256-280&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Meaning of a Literary Idea" ===


Trilling defines an idea as the product of the juxtaposition of two emotions, and as the key dialectic component of literature.  He sees the anxiety about ideas in literature as actually an anxiety that ideology, a "respect for certain formulas" whose "meaning and consequence we have no clear understanding," will intellectualize the power and spontaneity out of life. Poets, Trilling argues, can be attracted to ideas without being "violated" by them, and poets often try to develop consistent intellectual positions along with their poetry. Trilling elevates the importance of "activity" in literary thinking that keeps ideas constantly at play with one another. He categorizes the American writers [[John Dos Passos]], [[Eugene O’Neill]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]] as violated by an idea because of passivity, and argues that the "piety" of writers like [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[William Faulkner]] allowed them to engage their hearts deeply with ideas. Trilling concludes by advocating that we think of ideas as "living things, inescapably connected with our wills and desires," in order to facilitate a more active literature.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Trilling, ''The Liberal Imagination'', pp. 283-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==

Commentators of ''The Liberal Imagination'' note two distinguishing qualities of Trilling's prose: his use of the plural singular and the balanced sentence. The common subject, ‘we,’ in Trilling’s writing produces both an inviting and authoritative effect because readers feel that they are a part of the educated and literate podium behind which Trilling stands, and that they are sharing in not “mere opinion,” but “corporate understanding.”&lt;ref&gt;William M. Chace, Lionel Trilling: Criticism and Politics (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1980), pp. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; His repeated employment of a parallel sentence-structure may symbolize Trilling’s dedication to the “negative capability” he encourages throughout the book, in which a thinker can hold two ideas in his head at once and function nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Krupnick, ''Lionel Trilling and the Fate of Cultural Criticism'' (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1986), pp. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial reception ==

Literary critic and democratic-socialist advocate [[Irving Howe]], in his review of the book in [[The Nation]], finds troubling Trilling's criticism of moral passions that do not account for "an active moral passion against social injustice," and contends that the definition Trilling relies on does not match [[liberalism]]’s history as a "code of intellectual tolerance and freedom," as the bringer of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and as the political doctrine that supports [[capitalism]]. Howe describes Trilling as an ideologue whose work is "excessively dependent on that mere will whose danger he has so often observed."&lt;ref&gt;Irving Howe, "Liberalism, History, and Mr. Trilling," in Ed. by John Rodden, ''Lionel Trilling and the Critics: Opposing Selves'' (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1999), pp. 155-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 21-year-old student at Columbia and writing for British journal [[Scrutiny]], [[Norman Podhoretz]], later to become a substantial figure in the "[[neo-conservative]]" movement that grew out of "[[The New York Intellectuals]]," writes that ''The Liberal Imagination'' is not really about liberalism at all (as Howe argues); it is "a collection of critical essays," whose purpose is to clear the air rather than definitively demonstrate. As criticism, Podhoretz suggests, it represents Trilling's belief that America's future depends on an integration of the European influence of British literary thinker [[Matthew Arnold]]’s criticism into "the American pattern," which Trilling attempts in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Podhoretz, "The Arnoldian Function in American Criticism," in Rodden, ''Lionel Trilling and the Critics'', pp. 176-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay published in [[The Partisan Review]], poet and short-novelist [[Delmore Schwartz]], critically evaluated "Manners, Morals, and the Novel," as representative of what he calls Trilling's ability to make his personal preference for a novel of manners into a "standard of judgment and a program for the novelist."Schwartz explains this personal preference as symptomatic of Trilling's general dislike for the method of modern authors and what Schwartz sees as Trilling's veiled sole concern: not the general welfare of the society in general, but “the welfare of the educated class,” of which Trilling acts a “guardian and critic.”&lt;ref&gt;Delmore Schwartz, “Excerpt from “The Duchess’ Red Shoes,”” in Rodden, ''Lionel Trilling and the Critics'', pp. 185-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critic and Princeton professor of English R.P. Blackmur, in his 1950 review of the book in the [[Kenyon Review]], writes that the core questions of ''The Liberal Imagination'' are what the American mind is to do with "mass urban society," and what is to be done to surmount a pervasive distrust of the intellect. Blackmur posits that the literature Trilling supports never existed. The true subject Trilling addresses, Blackmur suggests, is the "politics of human power," and the place literature has in creating "turbulence" in ordering principles of societal living.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Blackmur, "The Politics of Human Power," ''The Kenyon Review'', Vol. 12, No. 4 (Autumn, 1950), pp. 663-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later interpretations and influence ==

Later commentators on ''The Liberal Imagination'' focus on the historical, political, and cultural contexts and influences of Trilling's work and thoughts. The Liberal Imagination can be seen as Trilling's response to the simplifying force of the [[Marxism]] and disillusionment prevalent in the orthodoxy of the American political left in 1930s life, best exemplified by the Soviet Union's [[Popular Front]], by presenting himself through the essays as the "Intellectuals’ Representative Man." Indeed, ''The Liberal Imagination'' can be read as a pivotal point in the [[New York Intellectuals]]' turn from a Soviet communism to a strong [[anti-Stalinist]] cultural front.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickenstein, "Lionel Trilling and ‘the Liberal Imagination,’" ''The Sewanee Review'', Vol. 94, No. 2 (Spring 1986), pp. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant Webster, ''The Republic of Letters'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979), pp. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Stalinist implications in ''The Liberal Imagination'' exist in the ways Trilling articulates a critical stance against reductive, simplifying, and systematized ideological thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Russel J. Reising, “Lionel Trilling, The Liberal Imagination, and the Emergence of the Cultural Discourse of Anti-Stalinism,” ''boundary 2'', Vol. 20, No. 1 (Spring 1993), pp. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''The Liberal Imagination'' also stands as a critical moment in Trilling’s career as he developed his position as a public intellectual. As a representative of complexity, Trilling, in place of an applicable theory of reading, offers a “certain temper” to serve as the basis of a critical analysis of politics, culture, and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Krupnick, ''Lionel Trilling and the Fate of Cultural Criticism'', pp. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; But, in his expressed ambivalence to exactly what kind of politic or society he envisions, he leaves open the possible results of the critical mindset he proposes; this is perhaps because Trilling was already aware that the logical conclusion of his temper is a profound conservativism.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Chace, ''Lionel Trilling: Criticism and Politics'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1980), pp. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trilling, in the years following the publication of ''The Liberal Imagination'', came to typify a broader “conservative turn” of liberal intellectuals turned anti-communist and suspicious of the reductive character of the intellectual left. Further, many of Trilling’s intellectual heirs include prominent [[neo-conservatives]], such as [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Norman Podhoretz]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kimmage, ''The Conservative Turn: Lionel Trilling, Whitaker Chambers'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2009), pp. 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of literature, the way of reading presented in ''The Liberal Imagination'', in which a single author can embody the essence of his culture, “provided the rationale” of the reduction of American authors from college textbooks between the years of 1940s and 1970s, along with an increased neo-conservative focus on the “tragic vision” that would be pervasive in literature syllabi in mid-twentieth century America.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Jay, ''American Literature and the Culture Wars'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1997),pp. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4313">The '''Third International Congress of the Spanish Language''' (''Tercer Congreso Internacional de la Lengua Española'') was a cultural event that took place in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]], on 17, 18 and 19 November 2004.

The main topics of the Congress were three: ideological and sociologial aspects of linguistic identity; identity and language in literary creation; and the internationalization of Spanish.

It was the first time this Congress was celebrated in [[South America]]; the previous ones were held in [[Zacatecas]] ([[Mexico]]) and [[Valladolid]] ([[Spain]]). Given its importance, the governor of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Jorge Obeid]], decreed a public holiday for the opening day.

The main base of the activities of the Congress was [[El Círculo Theater]], especially restored for the occasion. It started with a welcome session presented by heads of State and writers. The Congress itself comprised a series of lectures and parallel cultural activities. It included a homage to the Argentine writer [[Ernesto Sábato]]. A dictionary of linguistic doubts (''Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas'') was introduced, and the Cervantes Institute presented a new linguistic competence certificate for Spanish as a foreign language.

Commemorating the fourth centennial of the first publishing of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', a brand-new special edition was released by the [[Real Academia Española]] and Editorial Santillana, with the support of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language. Its 12,000 copies were reported sold out in less than a month.

==Guests and lecturers==

Representing [[Spain]], the Congress was attended by the [[Kings of Spain|King]] [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] and the Queen [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sofía]]; Argentine [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Néstor Kirchner]] represented the national government. The presidents of [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other important representatives of Spanish-speaking countries, were also present.

As guest lecturers there were the writers [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[José Saramago]], [[Ernesto Cardenal]], and [[Ernesto Sábato]]. The Rosario-born novelist, comics artist and humorist [[Roberto Fontanarrosa]] broke the ice in a debate about the importance of insults in interpersonal communication.

[[Image:Against_the_Third_International_Congress_of_the_Spanish_Language_(1).jpg|thumb|right|150px|A demonstration protesting the cultural and linguistic dominance legacy of the Spanish conquest.]]

The Congress met opposition on the part of [[activism|activist]] groups representing some linguistic and ethnic minorities, and became a focus for the confluence of many movements related to the [[left-wing politics|left]], from [[anti-globalization]] sympathizers to revisionists of the historic role of Spain and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] in the colonization of the [[Americas]] (and the ensuing decline of native languages and cultures). The beginning of the Congress was protested by a large [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]].

In line with these protests, there was another gathering, the ''[[Congreso de laS LenguaS]]'', to discuss linguistic and cultural diversity in the region. It was presided by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2462">{{Choral voice classification}}
A '''treble voice''' is a voice which takes the [[Treble (sound)|treble]] part. In the absence of a separate [[descant]] part, this is normally the highest-[[pitch (music)|pitch]]ed part, and otherwise the second highest. The term is most often used today within the context of [[choir|choral music]] in reference to youthful singers. The [[American Choral Directors Association]] defines a treble as "a singer, both male and female, ages eight to sixteen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perspectives on the American Children's Choir: Comparing the Ideas of Jean Ashworth Bartle, Helen Kemp, Henry Leck, and Doreen Rao|author=Heather Williams Potter|publisher=University of North Carolina at Greensboro Press|year=2005|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term treble is gender neutral, the term is widely used in place of the term [[boy soprano]] within the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Choral Repertoire|author=Dennis Shrock|year=2009|page=771|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became widely used by English composers of polyphonic choral music during the English pre-Reformation and Reformation eras. At this time choral music written for the Church of England was often voiced in 5 parts with TrMATB (Treble, [[Meane]], Alto, Tenor, Bass) being one of the most common voicings utilized by [[Thomas Tallis]] and his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AAE9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22MAATB%22+choir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAWoVChMIl7LxpoWLxgIVkoQNCh2SLQBq#v=snippet&amp;q=%22meane%22&amp;f=false|title=Music and the Reformation in England 1549-1660|pages=121–122|author=Peter Le Huray|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] the term treble was used differently than it is today. The term was used in operas, cantatas, choral works, and other compositions to refer to three different kinds of singers: adult women, boy sopranos, and castrati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[The Opera Quarterly]]|page=49|volume=5|year=1987|title=Cross-Sexual Casting in Baroque Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still used by opera composers today when a role requires a child vocalist.

The '''Turkish State Theatres''' ({{lang-tr|Devlet Tiyatroları}} - DT) is the official directorate of the national [[theatre companies]] in Turkey. It is bound to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and financed by the state to promote performed arts and enhance the public interest they receive. As of 2007, the directorate employs around 2,200 people including more than 700 actors and about the same number of stage technicians.

==Venues==
The directorate owns more than 52 stages in 19 different cities ([[Ankara]], [[İstanbul]], [[İzmir]], [[Bursa]], [[Adana]], [[Antalya]], [[Trabzon]], [[Konya]], [[Sivas]], [[Diyarbakır]], [[Van, Turkey|Van]], [[Erzurum]], [[Gaziantep]], [[Malatya]], [[Elazığ]], [[Samsun]], [[Çorum]], [[Zonguldak]] and [[Kahramanmaraş]]), staging about 120 productions in its venues and reaching an audience of about 1.5 million each theatre season also by organizing tours all around Turkey.

'''Unintentional discharge''' is the event of a [[firearm]] discharging (firing) at a time not intended by the user. An unintended discharge may be produced by an incompatibility between firearm design and usage, such as the phenomenon of [[cooking off]] a round in a closed bolt machine gun, a mechanical malfunction as in the case of [[slamfire]] in an automatic weapon, user induced due to training issues or negligence, or a simple accident. The phenomenon has also been defined in the scientific literature as ''an activation of the trigger mechanism that results in an unplanned discharge that is outside of the firearm’s prescribed use''. Where prescribed use refers to departmental policies and laws related to the operation of firearms (O'Neill, 2018).

==Accidental discharge==

An '''accidental discharge''' ('''AD''') may occur when the trigger of the firearm is deliberately pulled for a purpose other than shooting—dry-fire practice, demonstration, or function testing—but ammunition is unintentionally left in the chamber.  Unintentionally leaving a firearm loaded is more likely to occur when the individual handling the gun is poorly trained, and perhaps also with removable-magazine-fed firearms (as the magazine may be removed, giving an unloaded appearance even when a round remains chambered—see discussion of magazine-safeties below).

A second common cause of negligent discharges is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided to shoot.  With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress the trigger unintentionally.  For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely.  If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause the trigger finger to compress the trigger.

[[Gun safety]] rules recognize the above possibilities, and aim to prevent them. The primary firearm safety rule usually listed by any source is a version of "Always keep the gun pointed in safe direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izak|first1=Shultz|title=Gun Safe Reviews|url=http://www.shootingandsafety.com/best-gun-safe-reviews/|website=Shooting &amp; Safety|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this rule ensures that, should an accidental discharge occur, no harm will be done.  Second, one's finger should remain outside the trigger guard until the decision has been made to fire the weapon; even if (some would say especially if) one is facing a hostile adversary and has to be prepared to fire at a moment's notice, keeping the finger out of the trigger-guard until one has decided to shoot will prevent an accidental shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html|title=The subtleties of safe firearms handling|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|date=February 2007|website=Issue #103|publisher=Backwoods Home Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a firearm is not in use, storing it unloaded and in a separate container from ammunition may also help prevent accidental discharges, especially if the stored firearm is "accessed" by an unauthorized user.

On occasion, an accidental discharge can occur by means other than the finger pulling the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], such as dropping a loaded weapon.  Because of this possibility, most currently produced pistols are designed with a "drop-safety" or [[Safety (firearms)#Firing pin block|firing pin block]], a mechanism inhibiting or isolating the firing pin, preventing accidental discharge if the firearm is dropped.  However, most long guns do not have drop-safeties.

Prevention of dropped-firearm ADs with long guns therefore depends on the user being familiar with the precautions needed for that particular gun: it is standard practice for all long-gun users to unload the firearm's chamber before any activity that might foreseeably result in a dropped firearm (e.g., climbing a fence while hunting), and before placing the firearm in a vehicle (where sudden deceleration may cause the firearm to act as if dropped).

Accidental discharges not involving trigger-pull can also occur if the firearm is mechanically unsound: poor maintenance, abuse, inept "gunsmithing," or the use of substandard materials or defective [[ammunition]] in the gun may all lead to breakage.

In World War II, early versions of the British [[Sten gun]] were notorious for accidentally discharging when dropped. While dropping any long gun with loaded chamber can be dangerous, the use of a soft bronze bolt in early Stens—allowing the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] contact area to wear down quickly—made ADs even more likely.

As the early Sten gun illustrates, "poor design," including the specification of unsuitable component materials, is sometimes cited as a cause for some firearms being "unsafe."  Surely, any firearm that can discharge by itself when loaded is unsafe, and no user would want to handle a firearm that has a high likelihood of accidental discharge when employed for its intended use.  But, firearm designs incorporating fewer safeties are not intrinsically unsafe—see discussion of long-guns above—even if they do require competence and proper training for safe use.

A relevant discussion attends the use of [[Safety (firearms)#Magazine Interlocks|magazine-safeties]] in semi-automatic pistols.  Such safeties prevent the pistol from firing if there is a round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed.  Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be "disabled" unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed.  Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges.  Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.

One last form of accidental discharge, known as ''[[cooking off]],'' occurs when a weapon becomes overheated, with the firing chamber hot enough to ignite the propellant charge in the ammunition round, causing the cartridge to fire.  As recently as 1979, this problem doomed the innovative [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11]] during NATO trials.

"Cooking off" is typically encountered only in [[fully automatic]] weapons, such as [[machine gun]]s, when they are fired for long periods of time without allowing the barrel and chamber of the weapon to cool down to safe temperatures.  For this reason, modern crew-served machine guns are equipped with spare [[Gun barrel|barrel]]s to allow a machine gun crew to replace an overheated barrel with a cool one, thus restoring the weapon to action while the overheated barrel is allowed to cool. Also, the majority of machine guns fire from an [[open bolt]], so the round is chambered only after pressing the trigger, just before firing.

==Negligent discharge==

A '''negligent discharge''' ('''ND''') is a discharge of a [[firearm]] involving [[Culpability|culpable]] carelessness. In judicial and military technical terms, a negligent discharge is a chargeable offence. A number of [[armed force]]s automatically consider any [[accidental discharge]] to be negligent discharge, under the assumption that a trained soldier has control of his firearm at all times. This is the case in the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, Abel. "Proper Weapons Practices Key to Ending Negligent Discharge Incidents in Iraq." ''army.mil''. United States Army. 1 March 2007. [http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/03/01/2065-proper-weapons-practices-key-to-ending-negligent-discharge-incidents-in-iraq/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] and various Police Forces within the United Kingdom.

From an article on a U.S. Air Force website:

The initial press coverage in British tabloid [[The Daily Mail]] was criticized for basing its entire story on an injury from a single student stunt, and extrapolating this into a "trend" after a [[YouTube]] search showed hundreds of similar videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2255927/pagenum/2 |title=Bogus Trend Smorgasbord |author=Shafer, Jack|date=June 3, 2010 |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5540166/vodka-eyeballing-the-dumbest-trend-piece-ever |title='Vodka Eyeballing': the Dumbest Trend Piece Ever |author=Somaiya, Ravi |publisher=Gawker.com|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/820091--vodka-eyeballing-is-seeing-believing |title=Vodka eyeballing: Is seeing believing? |author=David Graham |date=August 6, 2010 |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Michael Strangelove]] said that the videos, which date back to 2006, seemed genuine and should not be dismissed as a deceptive "prank" against the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715190525/http://www.themarknews.com:80/articles/1678-vodka-in-your-eye |title=Vodka in Your Eye |author=Michael Strangelove |date=June 10, 2010 |work=The Mark |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Where the Wild Things Are'''" is the 18th episode of season 4 of the television show ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.

At a fraternity party, Buffy and Riley are compelled to have sex by a mystical influence. The party is held in a house which was formerly a home for wayward children, that is haunted by the angry ghosts of children who were physically and emotionally abused by the [[Christian fundamentalist]] who managed the home.

==Plot synopsis==
[[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and [[Riley Finn|Riley]] fight a vampire and a demon in the cemetery, finally disposing of both of them. While they intend to go tell [[Rupert Giles|Giles]] about the odd pairing of demon and vampire, they opt instead for sex at Riley's dorm at Lowell House. Riley gets up in the middle of the night, acting as if he hears something from the restroom. All he finds is a dripping faucet in the tub. [[Xander Harris|Xander]]'s driving an ice cream truck for his new job, and [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] rides along with him to complain about their diminishing relationship. Trying to convince her that there is nothing wrong with him or their relationship, Xander suggests they have sex right there in the truck. He doesn't realize that there is a group of kids waiting outside for their ice cream.

The gang talks about patrol the night before, and they realize that Adam is bringing the races of demons together. Buffy and Riley escape for some alone time, which is no secret to the rest of the gang. The two continue their sex romp through the night. While the rest of the house is freezing cold, Buffy and Riley continue to keep occupied, and warm. An initiative agent is badly burned when a fire in a fireplace bursts forth into the room. The next night, [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] jumps out at Anya in the streets, trying to scare her into giving him her money. At the party, Buffy and Riley are making eyes at each other from across the room while their friends attempt to talk to them. Spike and Anya bond over a couple beers at the Bronze, complaining about what it's like to be without their harmful demon powers.

A guy is talking to a girl, when he places his hand on a wall and suddenly gets very excited. Xander flirts with a girl named Julie. Riley and Buffy escape upstairs to resume their own private party. Willow and Tara talk about horses, but Willow had a bad experience with them and she's very afraid of them. Willow touches Tara's knee, but Tara backs away, inexplicably disgusted with the gesture. Anya and Spike then arrive at the frat party and the two verbally gang up on Xander.

A group is playing spin the bottle and Xander joins in. On Xander's turn, the bottle lands on Julie, and he kisses her on the cheek. She suddenly jumps him and starts kissing him aggressively. After she runs away, Xander follows and finds her in the closet cutting off her hair. Willow goes to the restroom looking for Tara and instead finds a body drowning in the bathtub. When she reaches for it, it disappears and reappears behind her. All this time, Buffy and Riley have barely come up for air, not even stopping when they hear Willow scream or the gang calling for them outside the door.

The house begins to shake violently, and vines begin to cover the walls. Forrest and Graham run downstairs for instructions from their commanding officers. A [[ghost]], which resembles a girl, runs straight through Anya, via intangibility, and Spike is strapped to a chair. Spike breaks free of his bonds and everyone escapes outside. The gang goes to Giles for help and find him singing and playing the guitar at the Espresso Bar. He's surprisingly very good, which Willow, Tara, and Anya all find appealing.

Research leads them to information about the Lowell building, which used to be the old Lowell Home for Children. They find the woman, Genevieve Holt, who ran the children's home and she confesses that she rewarded the children when they were good and punished them when they were dirty. She'd cut off the hair of the girls who would preen their hair in the mirror in order to "remove the temptation" of vanity and "baptized" them by holding them under water in a bathtub. After leaving Ms. Holt's place, they conclude that a group of [[poltergeist]]s is now releasing their pent up sexual energy thanks to the repetitive acts of sex by Buffy and Riley. When Buffy and Riley are drained of all their strength, they will die.

Willow, Tara, and Giles perform a spell to stop the ghosts. Xander and Anya hack their way through the vines and try to reach Buffy and Riley. Anya is knocked across the house while Xander is dragged into the bathroom and held underwater. Anya makes her way upstairs to save Xander and they fight against the vines and finally open Riley's dorm. The next day, the gang talks about Giles's "mid-life crisis" and the consequences of Buffy and Riley's endless sex. Unconvincingly, Buffy and Riley say how horrible the experience was.

==Production==
* This episode marks the first time in the series that Anthony Stewart Head displays his singing talents. Giles will sing on screen again in three more episodes: in his apartment in "[[The Yoko Factor]]", during his dream sequence in "[[Restless (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Restless]]", and the musical episode "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Once More, with Feeling]]".
*[[Anthony Stewart Head]] only sings "[[Behind Blue Eyes]]", and music supervisor John King plays guitar. Later, in the episode "[[The Yoko Factor]]", Head will both sing and play "[[Free Bird]]".
* Roy, the boy who first touched the enchanted wall, played by Bryan Cuprill, was also one of the students who turned into a caveman in the episode "[[Beer Bad]]".
* When Anya and Xander are alone in the house fighting through the vines to get to Buffy and Riley, a pair of arms from off camera entangle Anya with the vines.

==Cultural references==
*''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' - In response to the girl pulling off all of her hair in the closet, Xander comments that "people are going all Felicity with their hair," a reference to the show's [[Keri Russell|star]] cutting off her hair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/wildthings/trivia.shtml BBC episode guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' is the title of an award-winning children's book. A mischievous young boy, sent to bed without supper, goes into a land of mythical monsters, becomes homesick and returns to find his supper on the table, still warm.
*The song Giles sings is "[[Behind Blue Eyes]]".

==Continuity==
===Arc significance===

* Anya and Spike first bond in this episode. This becomes important in Season 6's episode "[[Entropy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Entropy]]" where they find physical comfort in each other after being rejected by their lovers.
* Willow tells Buffy and Riley that the events at Lowell House weren't their fault, since they were under the influence of powerful magic. From Season 6 onward, Willow struggles with her addiction to magic.
