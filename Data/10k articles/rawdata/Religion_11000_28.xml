{{Quran}}
'''Sūrat al-Jinn''' ({{lang-ar|سورة الجن}}, “The [[Jinn]]”) is the seventy-second [[sura|chapter]] of the [[Quran]] with 28 [[ayah|verses]]. The name as well as the topic of this chapter is jinn.  Similar to [[angel]]s, the Jinn are spiritual beings invisible to the naked human eye. In the Quran, it is stated that humans are created from the earth and jinn from smokeless fire in more than one instance.

In the second verse the jinn recant their belief in [[Shirk (Islam)|false gods]] and venerate [[Muhammad]] for his [[monotheism]]. The jinn apologize for their past [[blasphemy]] and criticize mankind for either neglecting them or encouraging their disbelief. Verses 20-22 are especially important as [[Monotheism]] ([[tawhid]]) among the Jinn is reaffirmed and the inescapable wrath of [[God]] is emphasized. The Judgement in verse 7, and the Punishment in verse 25, are both references to the [[Islam]]ic [[Last Judgement|Judgement Day]], [[Qiyamah|Yaum al Qiyamah]]. Verse 25-28 establish that Qiyamah is known only to God, and that God takes into account all the deeds of a man when judging him.

==Chronology==
Although ''Al-Jinn'' is a [[Meccan sura]], it is generally agreed that it was revealed much later than any other sura contained in ''[[Juz']] Tabāraka -lladhi'' (which covers suras 67 to 77). [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] says that it is “tolerably certain” that ''Al-Jinn'' was revealed around 2 B.H. when Muhammad was evangelising near present-day [[Ta'if]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Abdullah Yusuf; ''An Interpretation of the Holy Qur’an with Full Arabic Text''; p. 873 {{ISBN|1853267821}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maulana Muhammad Ali]] agrees with the date of around 2 B.H., saying that this sura was revealed at a time when opposition to the Holy Prophet’s message was reaching a climax.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; ''The Holy Qur’an: Arabic Text, Translation and Commentary''; p. 1106 {{ISBN|091332101X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{IAST|Anekāntavāda}}''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:अनेकान्तवाद|अनेकान्तवाद]]}}, "many-sidedness") refers to the [[Jainism|Jain]] doctrine about metaphysical truths that emerged in ancient [[India]].{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=325-326, 342}} It states that the ultimate truth and reality is complex and has multiple aspects.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul | editor =Tara Sethia | title =Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year =2004 | location =Delhi | pages =123–136 | isbn =81-208-2036-3 | chapter =Beyond Anekāntavāda : A Jain approach to religious tolerance }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anekantavada has also been interpreted to mean non-absolutism, "intellectual Ahimsa",{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=324}} [[religious pluralism]],{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=36}} as well as a rejection of fanaticism that leads to terror attacks and mass violence.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor=Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=85–88 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that modern revisionism has attempted to reinterpret anekantavada with religious tolerance, openmindedness and pluralism.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-334}}

According to [[Jainism]], no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. This knowledge (''[[Kevala Jnana]]''), it adds, is comprehended only by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Jaini | first=Padmanabh | year=1998 | location=New Delhi |page=91 | isbn=81-208-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All knowledge claims, according to the ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.

The origins of ''anekāntavāda '' can be traced back to the teachings of [[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]] (599–527 [[BCE]]), the 24th Jain {{IAST|''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthankara]]''}}.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3}} The [[dialectic]]al concepts of ''syādvāda'' "conditioned viewpoints" and ''nayavāda'' "partial viewpoints" arose from ''anekāntavāda'' in the medieval era, providing Jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression. The details of the doctrine emerged in Jainism in the 1st millennium CE, from debates between scholars of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of philosophies.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-2}}

==Etymology==
The word ''anekāntavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words: ''anekānta'' and ''vāda''. The word ''anekānta'' itself is composed of three root words, "an" (not), "eka" (one) and "anta" (end, side), together it connotes "not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness", or "manifoldness".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}&lt;ref name= "grimes34"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''vāda'' means "doctrine, way, speak, thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), "वाद", Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, pages 939-940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Mystical Experience and Religious Doctrine: An Investigation of the Study of Mysticism in World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBSn4dR087YC |year=1982|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-3160-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''anekāntavāda'' is translated by scholars as the doctrine of "many-sidedness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas F. Gier|title=Spiritual Titanism: Indian, Chinese, and Western Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b0uIvu4aBuMC |year= 2000|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn= 978-0-7914-4528-0|pages=80, 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Murphy|title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2O9JlrJ1wwAC |year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9131-9|pages=267–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; "non-onesidedness",{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=1}} or "many pointedness".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

The term ''anekāntavāda'' is not found in early texts considered canonical by Svetambara tradition of Jainism. However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Svetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' by Acharya Umaswami, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

==Philosophical overview==
The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', also known as ''anekāntatva'', states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is ''naya'', or "partial expression of the truth".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}} Language  is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name=iepmahav/&gt; One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is ''syāt'', or valid "in some respect" but it still remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".&lt;ref name=iepmahav&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy], IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}

The ''anekāntavāda'' premises of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The Jain āgamas suggest that Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}} These texts identify ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Māhavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is" and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the absolute reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}} ''Syādvāda'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''Nayavāda'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anekāntavāda''. ''Syādvāda'' recommends the expression of ''anekānta'' by prefixing the epithet ''syād'' to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400–407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48-51}}

The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', according to Bimal Matilal, states that "no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=2}} For a metaphysical proposition to be true, according to Jainism, it must include one or more conditions (''syadvada'') or limitations (''nayavada'', standpoints).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3, 30-32, 52-54}}

===Syādvāda===

''Syādvāda'' ({{lang-sa|स्याद्वाद}}) is the theory of ''conditioned predication'', the first part of which is derived from the Sanskrit word ''syāt'' ({{lang-sa|स्यात्}}), which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb ''as'' ({{lang-sa|अस्}}), 'to be', and which becomes ''syād'' when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with ''sandhi''. The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc.  It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc.  The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'.  The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.

Syat can be translated into English as meaning "perchance, may be, perhaps" (it is).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}  The use of the verb 'as' in the optative tense is found in the more ancient Vedic era literature in a similar sense.  For example, sutra 1.4.96 of [[Pāṇini|Panini]]'s Astadhyayi explains it as signifying "a chance, maybe, probable".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}

In Jainism, however, ''syadvada'' and ''anekanta'' is not a theory of uncertainty, doubt or relative probabilities. Rather, it is "conditional yes or conditional approval" of any proposition, state Matilal and other scholars.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} This usage has historic precedents in classical Sanskrit literature, and particularly in other ancient Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) with the phrase ''syad etat'',  meaning "let it be so, but", or "an answer that is 'neither yes nor no', provisionally accepting an opponent's viewpoint for a certain premise".  This would be expressed in archaic English with the subjunctive: 'be it so', a direct translation of ''syad etat''.  Traditionally, this debate methodology was used by Indian scholars to acknowledge the opponent's viewpoint, but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade the opponent of aspects not considered.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=93–95 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context ''syadvada'' does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism, rather it means "multiplicity or multiple possibilities".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} ''Syat'' in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is "neither yes nor no", but it connotes a "many sidedness" to any proposition with a sevenfold predication.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;

''Syādvāda'' is a theory of qualified predication, states Koller. It states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways, because reality is many-sided.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=90–92 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is done so systematically in later Jain texts through ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or "[[Jaina seven-valued logic|the theory of sevenfold scheme]]".&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; These ''saptibhaṅgī'' seem to be have been first formulated in Jainism by the 5th or 6th century CE Svetambara scholar Mallavadin,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=230}} and they are:&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "grimes"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=29}}
#Affirmation: ''syād-asti''—in some ways, it is,
#Denial: ''syān-nāsti''—in some ways, it is not,
#Joint but successive affirmation and denial: ''syād-asti-nāsti''—in some ways, it is, and it is not,
#Joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial: ''{{IAST|syād-asti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable,
#Joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial: ''{{IAST|syān-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#Joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial: ''{{IAST|syād-asti-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#Joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial: ''{{IAST|syād-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is indescribable.

Each of these seven predicates state the Jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from the perspective of time, space, substance and mode.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes" /&gt; The phrase ''syāt'' declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance (''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]''), place (''kṣetra''), time (''kāla''), and being (''bhāva''), and negation with regard to other substance (''dravya''), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (''bhāva''). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance (''dravya'') – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it simply is not. In regard to place (''kṣetra'') – room, it simply is; terrace, it simply is not.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}} In regard to time (''kāla'') – summer, it simply is; winter, it simply is not. In regard to being (''bhāva'') – brown, it simply is; white, it simply is not. And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}}

According to [[Acharya Samantabhadra|Samantabhadra]]'s text ''Āptamīmāṁsā'' (Verse 105), "''Syādvāda'', the doctrine of conditional predications, and ''kevalajñāna'' (omniscience), are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while ''kevalajñāna'' illumines directly, ''syādvāda'' illumines indirectly".{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 163}} ''Syadvada'' is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 174}}

===Nayavāda===

''Nayavāda'' ({{lang-sa|नयवाद}}) is the theory of standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("standpoint, viewpoint, interpretation") and ''vāda'' ("doctrine, thesis").&lt;ref name="Grimes202"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 198, 202–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt; Nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic, and how to make proper conclusions about that topic.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}

According to Jainism, there are seven ''nayas'' or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using ''syadvada''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}} These seven ''naya'', according to [[Umaswati]], are:{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 119, 198–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt;
#Naigama-naya: common sense or a universal view
#Samgraha-naya: generic or class view that classifies it
#Vyavahara-naya: pragmatic or a particular view assesses its utility

The ''naya'' theory emerged after about the 5th century CE, and underwent extensive development in Jainism. There are many variants of ''nayavada'' concept in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}}

A particular viewpoint is called a ''naya'' or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, ''Nayavada'' does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A ''naya'' reveals only a part of the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (''syādvāda'').{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=28}}

===Jiva, the changing soul===
[[File:Mahavra 1900 art.jpg|thumb|Mahāvīra did not use the word ''anekāntavada'', but his teachings contain the seeds of the concept (painting from [[Rajasthan]], ca. 1900)]]
Ancient India, particularly the centuries in which the Mahavira and the Buddha lived, was a ground of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about ''jiva'' and ''ajiva'' (self, matter) utilizes ''anekantavada''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Benesch|title=An Introduction to Comparative Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cEWDAAAQBAJ |year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-59738-9|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H.

The [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] thought (Hindu) postulated the impermanence of matter and body, but the existence of an unchanging, eternal metaphysical reality of ''[[Brahman]]'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' (soul, self). The Buddhist thought also postulated impermanence, but denied the existence of any unchanging, eternal soul or self and instead posited the concept of [[anatta]] (no-self).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2-5}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} According to the vedāntin (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with ''anekāntavāda''.&lt;ref name="Ronald"&gt;{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html | accessdate =2007-07-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}; Quote: "To counter the proponents of these diametrically opposed positions [Buddhist and Hindu], Jains developed a position knows as syadvada [seeud-VAH-duh], the way or path of "perhaps, maybe or somehow." Syadvada states simply that judgments resting on different points of view may differ without any of them being wholly wrong. [...] A limited and incomplete judgment is called a naya [nuh-yuh], and all human knowledge is a compilation of nayas, judgments resulting from different attitudes. The Jains were thus able to accept equally the Hindu views of "being" and Buddhist views of "becoming," but took neither in the sense that their partisan advocates desired or found comforting. [...] The Jain doctrine of syadvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that Jainism is the right religious path."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arvind" &gt;[[Arvind Sharma|Sharma, Arvind]] (2001) Preface xii&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as ''ekantika'' or only partially true.&lt;ref&gt;Sethia, Tara (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes substances but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes process but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (''dravya'') and process (''paryaya'').&lt;ref name="Burch"&gt;Burch, George (1964) pp. 68–93&lt;/ref&gt;

This philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through ''anekānta'' has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as [[Arvind Sharma]], who wrote:&lt;ref name="Arvind"/&gt;
{{Quote|Our experience of the world presents a profound paradox which we can ignore existentially, but not philosophically. This paradox is the paradox of change. Something – A changes and therefore it cannot be permanent. On the other hand, if A is not permanent, then what changes? In this debate between the "permanence" and "change", Hinduism seems more inclined to grasp the first horn of the dilemma and Buddhism the second. It is Jainism that has the philosophical courage to grasp both horns fearlessly and simultaneously, and the philosophical skill not to be gored by either.}}

===Inclusivist or exclusivist===
Some Indian writers state that Anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that Jainism accepts "non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth", a form of sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in "exclusivist term as the one true path".&lt;ref name=sethia123/&gt; Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text ''Uttaradhyayana Sutra'' in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be "heterodox and heretics" and that they "have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jinas]]".&lt;ref name=sethia123&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that those who do not follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be "approved or accommodated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=125–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Koller states ''anekāntavāda'' to be "epistemological respect for view of others" about the nature of existence whether it is "inherently enduring or constantly changing", but "not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal".&lt;ref name="koller89"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, according to Paul Dundas, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". This is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings, states Dundas.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahavira is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86-91}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The Five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps, just one perspective".{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism, according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

==History and development==
The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' is one of the foundational [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept. The development of ''anekāntavāda'' also encouraged the development of the dialectics of ''syādvāda'' (conditioned viewpoints) and ''nayavāda'' (partial viewpoints).

According to Karl Potter, the Jain ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine emerged in a milieu that included Buddhists and Hindus in ancient and medieval India.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt; The diverse Hindu schools such as Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya-Yoga and Mimamsa-Vedanta, all accepted the premise of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that "unchanging permanent soul, self exists and is self-evident", while various schools of early Buddhism denied it and substituted it with [[Anatta]] (no-self, no-soul). Further, for causation theories, Vedanta schools and Madhyamika Buddhists had similar ideas, while Nyaya-Vaisheshika and non-Madhyamika Buddhists generally agreed on the other side. Jainism, using its ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine occupied the center of this theological divide on soul-self (''jiva'') and causation theories, between the various schools of Buddhist and Hindu thought.&lt;ref name=johnson232/&gt;&lt;ref name=potter114&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0779-2|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The origins of ''anekāntavāda'' are traceable in the teachings of Mahāvīra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, Mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.&lt;ref name="bhagvati"&gt;Charitrapragya, Samani (2004) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Early Jain texts were not composed in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-62}} According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial ''anekantavada'' doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}} These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}}

The early Svetambara canons and teachings do not use the terms ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. ''Śvētāmbara'' text, ''[[Sutrakritanga]]'' contains references to ''Vibhagyavāda'', which, according to [[Hermann Jacobi]], is the same as ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī''.&lt;ref name="sutra"&gt;Jacobi, Hermann (1895) 14:21–22&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted ''vibhagyavada'' as ''syadvada'', the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text ''[[Sutrakritanga]]''.&lt;ref name="jacobi327"/&gt; However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.&lt;ref name=britcanonjaina&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jaina-canon Jaina canon], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
A monk should be modest, though he be of a fearless mind; he should expound the ''syādvāda'', he should use the two permitted kinds of speech, living among virtuous men, impartial and wise.

According to Upadhyaye, the ''Bhagvatisūtra'' (also called Vyākhyāprajñapti) mentions three primary predications of the ''saptibhaṅgīnaya''.&lt;ref name= "Upadhyaye"&gt;Upadhyaye, A. N. (2001) pp. 6136–37&lt;/ref&gt; This too is a Svetambara text, and considered by Digambara Jains as unauthentic.&lt;ref name=britcanonjaina/&gt;

The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Slaje| title=Śāstrārambha: Inquiries Into the Preamble in Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fD0Ypvxmzj8C| year=2008| publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn=978-3-447-05645-8|page=35 with footnote 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81}}&lt;ref name=dundaspo395&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2006|pp=395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digambara scholar [[Kundakunda]], in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the doctrine of ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī'' in ''Pravacanasāra'' and  ''[[Pancastikayasara|Pancastikayasāra]]''.&lt;ref name= "Upadhyaye" /&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} Kundakunda also used ''nayas'' to discuss the essence of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] in ''[[Samayasara|Samayasāra]]''. Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the earliest available secondary literature on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on ''anekantavada'' to the late 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=107-109}}

===Parable of the blind men and elephant===
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|Seven blind men and an elephant parable]]
The Jain texts explain the ''anekāntvāda'' concept using the parable of blind men and elephant, in a manner similar to those found in both Buddhist and Hindu texts about limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Snyder|author2=Carol E.

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

This parable is called ''Andha-gaja-nyaya'' maxim in Jain texts.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=40–43 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Jain references to this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century).&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt;

While the [[Blind men and an elephant|same parable]] is found in Buddhist and Hindu texts to emphasize the need to be watchful for partial viewpoints of a complex reality, the Jain text apply it to isolated topic and all subjects.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=John D.

*from a certain point of view, or in a certain sense, the pot exists
*from a certain point of view, the pot does not exist
*from a certain point of view, the pot exists and does not exist
*from a certain point of view, the pot is inexpressible
*from a certain point of view, the pot both exists and is inexpressible
*from a certain point of view, the pot both does not exist and is inexpressible
*from a certain point of view, the pot exists, does not exist, and is also inexpressible

===Medieval developments===

Ācārya [[Haribhadra]] (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of ''anekāntavāda''. He wrote a [[doxography]], a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Amrtacandra starts his famous 10th century CE work ''Purusathasiddhiupaya'' with strong praise for ''anekāntavāda'': "I bow down to the principle of ''anekānta'', the source and foundation of the highest scriptures, the dispeller of wrong one-sided notions, that which takes into account all aspects of truth, reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity."&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. P. (2006) Verse no. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Vidyānandi (11th century CE) provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in ''Tattvarthaslokavārtikka'', 116:&lt;ref&gt;T. W. Rhys Davids (1980) pp. 576&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IAST|[[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya Gaṇi]]}}, a 17th-century Jain monk, went beyond ''anekāntavāda'' by advocating ''madhāyastha'', meaning "standing in the middle" or "equidistance". This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non-Jain and belonged to other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji, as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. C. (2001) p. 1487&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept of Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient [[Indian philosophy]], in the areas of skepticism and relativity.&lt;ref name = "McEvilley-p335"&gt;McEvilley, Thomas (2002) p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemology of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.

While employing ''anekāntavāda'', the 17th century Jain scholar [[Yasovijaya]] stated that it is not ''anābhigrahika'' (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; In Jain belief, ''anekāntavāda'' transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Wright  | first =J.

===Role in Jain history===

''Anekāntavāda'' played a role in the history of Jainism in India, during intellectual debates from [[Saiva|Śaiva]]s, [[Vaishnava|Vaiṣṇavas]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Muslim]]s, and [[Christian]]s at various times. According to John Koller, professor of [[Asian studies]], ''anekāntavāda'' allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of [[Haribhadra]] justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=335-336, 338-339}}

There is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non-Jains, Jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like Buddhists and Hindus.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Their texts have never presented a theory for holy war.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved the classic manuscripts of Buddhism and Hinduism, a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} The combination of historic facts, states Cort, suggest that Jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non-Jain views, and that it is inappropriate to rewrite the Jainism past as a history of "benevolence and tolerance" towards others.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=340-341}}

===Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi===
Mahatma Gandhi mentioned Anekantavada and Syadvada in the journal ''[[Young India]] – 21 Jan 1926''. According to Jeffery D. Long – a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, the Jain Syadvada doctrine helped Gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to the "reality of both the personal and impersonal aspects of [[Brahman]]", and his view of "Hindu religious pluralism":{{sfn|Long|2013|p=169}}&lt;ref name = "hay"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hay | first =Stephen N. | editor = Sibnarayan Ray | title =Gandhi India and the World | publisher =Nachiketa Publishers | year =1970 | location =Bombay | pages =14–23 | chapter =Jain Influences on Gandhi's Early Thought }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been my experience that I am always true from my point of view, and am often wrong from the point of view of my honest critics. I know that we are both right from our respective points of view. And this knowledge saves me from attributing motives to my opponents or critics. (...) My ''Anekāntavāda'' is the result of the twin doctrine of [[Satyagraha]] and {{IAST|''[[Ahimsa|ahiṃsā]]''}}.}}

===Against religious intolerance and contemporary terrorism===
Referring to the [[September 11 attacks]], John Koller states that the threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of other human beings and other life forms, states Koller, is "rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives". Koller states that ''anekāntavāda'' is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.&lt;ref name="Johnkoller"&gt;Koller, John (2004) pp. 85–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Scott R.|date=2014-07-03|title=Anekāntavāda and Engaged Rhetorical Pluralism: Explicating Jaina Views on Perspectivism, Violence, and Rhetoric | journal= Advances in the History of Rhetoric |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15362426.2014.933721 | volume=17|issue =2|pages=131–156|doi= 10.1080/15362426.2014.933721| issn= 1536-2426}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|James William Jones|2008}}

According to Sabine Scholz, the application of the ''Anekantavada'' as a religious basis for "intellectual Ahimsa" is a modern era reinterpretation, one attributed to the writings of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view states that ''Anekantavada'' is an expression of "religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony". In the 21st century, some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against "intolerance, fundamentalism and terrorism".&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabine Scholz|editor=Julia A. B. Hegewald and Subrata K. Mitra|title=Re-Use-The Art and Politics of Integration and Anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZqHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282 |year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0981-5|pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as [[John E. Cort]] and [[Paul Dundas]] state that, while Jainism indeed teaches non-violence as the highest ethical value, the reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as "religious tolerance of other opinions" is a "misreading of the original doctrine". In Jain history, it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation. Jain history shows, to the contrary, that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of Buddhist and Hindu spiritual theories, beliefs and ideologies.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}}&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt; John Cort states that the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine in pre-20th century Jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or "intellectual Ahimsa". Jain intellectual and social history toward non-Jains, according to Cort, has been contrary to the modern revisionist attempts, particularly by diaspora Jains, to present "Jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non-Jains", or that Jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in Indian intellectual history.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-331}} According to Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, indiscriminate open mindedness and the approach of "accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not" is an erroneous view in Jainism and not supported by the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=333-334}}

According to Paul Dundas, in and after the 12th century, the persecution and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote during a time of widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody" in self-defense would not lose any merit.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}} N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and ''Anekantavada'' doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that "to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.L. Jain|editor=Colette Caillat and Nalini Balbir|title=Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecKCrO6nLiAC |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3247-3|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel, popular but not unusual for contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;

==Comparison with non-Jain doctrines==
According to Bhagchandra Jain, one of the difference between the Buddhist and Jain views is that "Jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative (''anekāntika'') truth" while for Buddhism this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagchandra Jain; ''The Rudiments Of Anekāntavāda In Early Pali Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, states Jayatilleke, "no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false, irrespective of the standpoint from which it was made, in Buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in the case of some propositions."&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, pp. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jainism, there are propositions that are categorically true in Buddhism, and there are others that are ''anekamsika'' (uncertain, indefinite). Examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are the [[Four Noble Truths]], while examples of the latter in Buddhism are the [[The unanswered questions|avyakata-theses]].&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"/&gt; Further, unlike Jainism, Buddhism does not have a Nayavāda doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter and other scholars, Hinduism developed various theory of relations such as ''satkaryavada'', ''asatkaryavada'', ''avirodhavada'' and others.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard King|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of the Gaudapadiya-Karika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0904-7|pages=194–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''anekantavada'' overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is ''satkaryavada'' in explaining causes, and the ''asatkaryavada'' in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=133, see Causal Models}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] further elaborated and refined the theory of ''[[pramana]]s'' and the theory of relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Julius Lipner]]|title=The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Ramanuja|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjR2xuu4L8EC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-038-0|pages=82–89, 133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Indologists]] such as professor [[John E. Cort]] state that ''anekāntavāda'' is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint. Jain monks used ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend the Jain doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}} According to [[Paul Dundas]], in Jain hands, this method of analysis became "a fearsome weapon of philosophical [[polemic]] with which the doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence, respectively, and thus could be shown to be one-pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be".&lt;ref Name="Dundas192"&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain scholars, however, considered their own theory of ''Anekantavada'' self-evident, immune from criticism, needing neither limitations nor conditions.&lt;ref Name="Dundas192" /&gt;

The doctrines of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādavāda'' are often criticised to denying any certainty, or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines. Another argument against it, posited by medieval era Buddhists and Hindus applied the principle on itself, that is if nothing is definitely true or false, is ''anekāntavāda'' true or false?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Webb | first =Mark Owen | title =The Jain Philosophy | work =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm#H4 | accessdate = 2008-03-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080302171025/http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm| archivedate= 2 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pandya, V. (2001) p. 5210&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine accepts the norm in Indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual, that object and subject are interdependent. However, as a theory of relations, it does not solve the deficiencies in other progress philosophies, just "compounds the felony by merely duplicating the already troublesome notion of a dependence relation".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

===Hindu philosophies===
====Nyaya====
The [[Nyaya]] school criticized the Jain doctrine of ''anekantavada'', states Karl Potter, as "wanting to say one thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The Naiyayikas states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say, "jiva and ajiva are not related" and "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that ''jiva'' attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of ''anekantavada'' makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya texts.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year= 1991|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn= 978-81-208-0779-2|pages=145–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vaisheshika====
The [[Vaisheshika]] and [[Shaivism]] school scholar Vyomashiva criticized the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for [[moksha]] meaningless. Any spiritually liberated person must be considered under ''Anekantavada'' doctrine to be [a] both liberated and not liberated from one point of view, and [b] simply not liberated from another point of view, since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it. In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

====Vedanta====
''Anekāntavāda'' was analyzed and critiqued by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Śankarācārya]] (~800 CE) in his ''bhasya'' on ''[[Brahmasutra]]'' (2:2:33–36):&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Hajime (1992) pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that ''anekantavada'' doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems: ''virodha'' (contradictions) and ''samsaya'' (dubiety), neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

{{Quote|
It is impossible that contradictory attributes such as being and non-being should at the same time belong to one and the same thing; just as observation teaches us that a thing cannot be hot and cold at the same moment. The third alternative expressed in the words — they either are such or not such — results in cognition of indefinite nature, which is no more a source of true knowledge than doubt is. Thus the means of knowledge, the object of knowledge, the knowing subject, and the act of knowledge become all alike indefinite. How can his followers act on a doctrine, the matter of which is altogether indeterminate? The result of your efforts is perfect knowledge and is not perfect knowledge. Observation shows that, only when a course of action is known to have a definite result, people set about it without hesitation. Hence a man who proclaims a doctrine of altogether indefinite contents does not deserve to be listened any more than a drunken or a mad man.
|Adi Shankara, ''Brahmasutra'', 2.2:33–36}}

Shankara's criticism of ''anekantavada'' extended beyond the arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters. According to Shankara, the goal of philosophy is to identify one's doubts and remove them through reason and understanding, not get more confused.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The problem with ''anekantavada'' doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion. Further, states Shankara, Jains use this doctrine to be "certain that everything is uncertain". According to Karl Potter, Shankara does not take Jains seriously and admits that he doesn't understand Jainism's theory of relations.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

Contemporary scholars, states Piotr Balcerowicz, concur that the Jain doctrine of ''Anekantavada'' does reject some versions of the "law of non-contradiction", but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=42–43 with footnotes 15 and 16}}, '''Quote:''' "This is the sense in which it is correct to say that the Jainas reject the "law of non-contradiction".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
The Buddhist scholar [[Shantarakshita|Śāntarakṣita]], and his student Kamalasila, criticized ''anekantavada'' by presenting his arguments that it leads to the Buddhist premise "jivas (souls) do not exist". That is, the two of the most important doctrines of Jainism are mutually contradictory premises.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=57}} According to Santaraksita, Jains state that "jiva is one considered collectively, and many considered distributively", but if so debates Santaraksita, "jiva cannot change". He then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment, which is equivalent to "jiva don't exist".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; According to Karl Potter, the argument posited by Śāntarakṣita is flawed, because it commits what is called in the Western logic as the "fallacy of division".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

The Buddhist logician [[Dharmakirti]] critiqued ''anekāntavāda'' as follows:{{sfn|Pandya|2001}}
{{Quote|With the differentiation removed, all things have dual nature. Then, if somebody is implored to eat curd, then why he does not eat camel?" The insinuation is obvious; if curd exists from the nature of curd and does not exist from the nature of a camel, then one is justified in eating camel, as by eating camel, he is merely eating the negation of curd.|Dharmakirti, ''Pramānavarttikakārika''}}

===Self-criticism in Jain scholarship===
The medieval era Jain logicians [[Akalanka]] and [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyananda]], who were likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his ''Pramanasamgraha'' acknowledges seven problems when ''anekantavada'' is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (''vaiyadhi karanya''), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}} Vidyananda acknowledged six of those in the Akalanka list, adding the problem of ''vyatikara'' (cross breeding in ideas) and ''apratipatti'' (incomprehensibility). [[Prabhācandra]], who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in ''anekantavada'' application.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

The '''Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan''' began during the [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|policy of oppression]] of religion in the former [[Soviet Union]]. Before that time, [[Kazakhstan]], as part of the [[Russian Empire]], had indirect contact with the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as far back as 1847.&lt;ref name="russia"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan| authorlink = Moojan Momen  | title = Russia | work = Draft for "A Short Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith" | publisher = Bahá'í Academics Resource Library | date = | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_russia | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the arrival of [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] the community grew to be the largest religious community after Islam and Christianity, although only a minor percent of the national whole.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 6,400 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web|title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in the region ==

=== A part of the Russian Empire ===

The earliest relationship between the Bahá'í Faith and Kazakhstan came under the sphere of the country's [[History of Kazakhstan#In the Russian Empire (1731–1917)|history with Russia]]. In 1847 the Russian ambassador to [[Tehran]], Prince Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov, requested that the [[Báb]], the herald to the Bahá'í Faith who was imprisoned at [[Maku, Iran|Maku]], be moved elsewhere. He also condemned the massacres of Iranian religionists and asked for the release of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; By the 1880s an organized community of Bahá'ís was established in [[Ashgabat]] and later built the first [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in 1913-1918.

=== Soviet period ===

By the time of the [[October Revolution]] Bahá'ís had spread through [[Central Asia]] and [[Caucasus]] with the community in [[Ashgabat]] numbering about two thousand people. The community of Ashgabat had developed a library, hospital, hotel and [[Bahá'í school]]s &amp;mdash; including a school for girls &amp;mdash; all open to all people regardless of religion. After the October Revolution and the ban on religion, the Bahá'ís (strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government) abandoned their administration and allowed their properties to be nationalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh | publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition | date = 1936-03-11 | location = Haifa, Palestine | pages = 64–67 | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-34.html#pg64| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, after numerous arrests and a [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|policy of oppression]] of religion, most Bahá'ís were sent to prisons and camps or sent abroad. There were at this time some 1,400 families of Bahá'ís resident in Ashgabat. The authorities arrested every adult male Bahá'í. The women and children were deported to [[Iran]], while the men were either deported or sentenced to long terms of imprisonment or exile. Many were sent to [[Pavlodar]] in northern Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Momen |first=Moojan |authorlink=Moojan Momen |title=Turkmenistan |booktitle=draft of "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" |publisher=Bahá'í Library Online |year=1994 |url=http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/turkmnst.htm |accessdate=2008-05-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509200356/http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/turkmnst.htm |archivedate=9 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í communities in 38 cities ceased to exist.

Bahá'ís had managed to re-enter various countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] throughout the 1950s,&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt; following a plan of the head of the religion at the time, [[Shoghi Effendi]]. By 1953 the first [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] arrived in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = Citadel of Faith | publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1980 third printing | orig-year = collected letters from 1947–57 | location = Haifa, Palestine | pages = 107 | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/CF/cf-9.html#pg107 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of small communities are listed in 1963.&lt;ref name="Hands"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963], Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the community ==

There is evidence that the Bahá'í Faith started to grow across the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt; In 1991 a Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Soviet Union was elected but was quickly split among its former members.&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt; In 1992, a regional National Spiritual Assembly for the whole of Central Asia ([[Turkmenistan]], Kazakhstan, [[Kirgizia]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]) was formed with its seat in Ashkhabad.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; In 1994 the National Spiritual Assembly of Kazakhstan was elected.&lt;ref name="Hands" /&gt;

As of 2001, 25&lt;ref name="census" /&gt; Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] or smaller groups had registered with the government - and these communities totaled 25 of 55 of the organized communities of "nontraditional" religions ("traditional" being defined by the Kazakh government as [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Buddhism]].) Local Spiritual Assemblies had been registered in many Kazakh cities.&lt;ref name="newspaper"&gt;{{cite news

In 1999 - the closest national census - 7% of the religious national population of 14,896,000 (or just over 1 million) were not Muslim or Christian.

=== Hostile atmosphere in 2000-2002 ===

* The government of Kazakhstan voted against a [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution on the "Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran" (UN document no.

* In 2002 a draft law more oppressive to religious minorities increased social pressure against them but by 2004 these draft laws and policies had ended and members of many religious minorities like the Bahá'í Faith considered the situation no longer repressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A Kazakhstan citizen worked at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in [[Haifa]] and volunteered participation with the Inspirit troupe which toured [[Vilnius]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A "Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace," which was held on 22 June 2005 had Bahá'í speakers rising in support of the advancement of women and the conference was co-sponsored by several governments including Kazakhstan's, and at which the Kazakh Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs also spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2005 Kazakhstan government statistics reported to the United States indicated 44 registered "nontraditional" religious groups during the reporting period, (recall from above that 25 had been Bahá'í as late as 2001).&lt;ref name="newspaper"/&gt; The U.S. State Department says: &lt;blockquote&gt;Kazakh laws were amended in 2005 to reinforce registration requirements and clarify that religious groups must register with both the central government and the local governments of individual regions ([[oblasts]]) in which they have congregations. Prior to these amendments, the government required religious organizations to register only if they wished to be accorded legal status in order to buy or rent property, hire employees, or engage in other legal transactions. Although the amended national religion laws explicitly require religious organizations to register with the government, it continues to provide that all persons are free to practice their religion "alone or together with others." To register, a religious organization must have at least ten members and submit an application to the Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

The first Bahá'ís who came to present day [[Lebanon]] were [[Iran]]ians who came in the 1870s. The founder of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Bahá'u'lláh]], was exiled to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which was at the time was part of the same [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province, or [[vilayet]], of [[Beirut Vilayet|Beirut]].

In 1880, Bahá'u'lláh's son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], visited Beirut at the invitation of [[Midhat Pasha]], the Ottoman governor of the [[Syria Vilayet]].&lt;ref name=BSR&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/218954/Midhat_Pasha_and_Abdul-Baha_in_Akka Midhat Pasha and `Abdu'l-Bahá in ‘Akka: The Historical Background of the Tablet of the Land of Ba], ''Necati Alkan'', ''Baha’i Studies Review'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A Beirut newspaper described his visit by saying "''His Excellency, the learned, erudite, intelligent and illustrious ‘Abbas Effendi, resident of the city of ‘Akka, has arrived in our city''".&lt;ref name=BSR/&gt; Following the visit Baha'u'llah wrote the "[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-17.html Tablet of the Land of Ba (Beirut)]", later described as a "glowing tribute" to `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name=BSR/&gt;

During his visits to Beirut, `Abdu'l-Bahá also met [[Muhammad Abduh]], one of the key figures of [[Islamic Modernism]] and the [[Salafi movement]], at a time when the two men were both opposed to the Ottoman ''[[ulama]]'' and shared similar goals of religious reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Scharbrodt |first= Oliver  |date= 2008 |title= Islam and the Bahá'í Faith: A Comparative Study of Muhammad 'Abduh and 'Abdul-Baha 'Abbas |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn= 9780203928578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 1894 a Lebanese Christian, [[Ibrahim George Kheiralla]], converted to the Bahá'í Faith whilst traveling in Cairo. After Bahá'u'llúh wrote a specific tablet to him, he moved to [[Chicago]] in the United States and was instrumental in converted many of the early Bahá'í followers there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-17.html#pg256 God Passes By], [[Shoghi Effendi]], 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Beirut universities - the [[American University of Beirut]] and the [[Saint Joseph University]] - had significant Baha'i student populations in the early twentieth century. The first Baha'i student was recorded in the 1890s, the “Society of the Bahá’í Students of Beirut" was formed in 1906 and by 1929 there were over 60 Baha'i students from Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Palestine. The university promoted "internationalism" as a core value and acknowledged the Baha'i students as a significant contribution to this vision. The Baha'i leader, [[Shoghi Effendi]], studied at the AUB, graduating in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/breneman_bahai_university_beirut Bahá’í Students and American University of Beirut in the Early 20th Century], ''Reed M. Breneman'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A Shi'ite Imam in the southern village of [[Machgara]], Sheikh Ja’afar Al-Tahhan, converted to the Bahá'í Faith in 1923, and that village is now the centre of the community, with the only Lebanese local [[Spiritual Assembly]].&lt;ref name=Seif/&gt;

[[File:Ottoman levant.png|left|thumb|Ottoman subdivisions when the first Bahá'ís came to Lebanon]]

The ''Encyclopedia of the Orient'' reported that there were 4,000 Bahá'ís living in Lebanon, or around 0.13% of the population.&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,QUERYRESPONSE,,LBN,41501c2b1c,0.html Lebanon: Situation of Baha'is], [[Government of Canada]], 2004-04-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, a prominent Bahá'í academic, [[Suheil Bushrui]] became a visiting professor at the [[American University of Beirut]]. In the 1980s he was appointed an advisor by President [[Amine Gemayel]], indicating how Bahá'ís are accepted.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; Bushrui is noted scholar on [[Khalil Gibran]],&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; having published more than one volume about him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibran |first=Khalil |year= 1983|title=Blue Flame: The Love Letters of Khalil Gibran to May Ziadah |others=edited and translated by [[Suheil Bushrui]] and Salma Kuzbari |location=Harlow, England|publisher=Longman|isbn=0-582-78078-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bushrui 55"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kahlil Gibran, Man and Poet: a New Biography|year=1998|publisher=Oneworld Publications|author=Bushrui, Suheil B.|author2=Jenkins, Joe|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves as the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=BBC12May12&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17997163 Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet: Why is it so loved?], BBC News, 12 May 2012, accessed 12 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.umd.edu/chrsweb/Gibran/Gibran_Chair_Report.htm The Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the Center for Heritage Resource Studies The University of Maryland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730115042/http://www.heritage.umd.edu/CHRSWeb/Gibran/Gibran_Chair_Report.htm |date=2012-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

The Baha'i Faith is not one of the 18 [[Religion in Lebanon|recognised sects]] in Lebanon, so many Bahá'ís are officially listed according to the religion of their ancestors, mostly Shiite.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; [[Bahá'í marriage]]s are therefore not recognised, so Bahá'ís tend to travel to [[Cyprus]] to have a civil wedding, which is recognised when they return. Other than that, Bahá'ís are allowed to practice their religion in public without any problems.&lt;ref name=Seif/&gt;

The '''Bahá'í Faith in the Philippines''' is a community of Filipinos, who like their fellow Bahá'ís living in other parts of the world, view the world's major religions as a part of a single, progressive process through which God reveals His will to humanity. They recognize [[Baha'u'llah]], the founder of the Baha'i Faith, as the most recent in a line of Divine Messengers that includes [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Buddha]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Christ]] and [[Muhammad]]. It is composed of Filipinos from various ethnic and religious background. The religion first reached the country in 1921 with a [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] first visiting the [[Philippines]] that year.&lt;ref name="mirza"&gt;{{cite web | last =Hassall | first = Graham | last2 = Austria | first2 = Orwin | title = Mirza Hossein R.

In 1964 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Philippines was elected and by 1980 there were 64000 Bahá'ís and 45 local assemblies.&lt;ref name="bw18a"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = Table of Contents and pp.513, 652–9 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/636-665.html | ISBN = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'ís have been active in multi/inter-faith developments. The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimates the Bahá'í population of the Philippines at about 272600.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists - Compare Nations - Religions | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp  | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The first mention of the Philippines in [[Bahá'í literature]], is in a letter from 1911 by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion.&lt;ref name="Abdul"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = `Abdu'l-Bahá | author-link = `Abdu'l-Bahá | editor=Albert R. Windust |editor2=Gertrude Buikema | title = BAHAI NEWS - To Dr. Ameen U. Fareed | journal = Star of the West | volume = 01 | issue = 19 | year = 1911 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_star_west_1&amp;chapter=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917 asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several island nations in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]].  The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great island groups of the Pacific Ocean—[[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]], and the islands attached to these groups, such as [[New Guinea]], [[Borneo]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Philippine Islands]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], [[New Hebrides]], [[Loyalty Islands]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Seram Island|Ceram]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Friendly Islands]], [[Samoa Islands]], [[Society Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]], [[Low Archipelago]], [[Marquesas]], [[Hawaiian Islands]], [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Moluccas]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Timor]] and the other islands. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with tongues commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of God, they must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts to all the people."&lt;ref name="tablets"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |ISBN = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-7.html.iso8859-1?#gr5 | pages = 40 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mirza Hossein R. Touty (perhaps a transliteration of "Tiati"), a [[Persian people|Persian]] Bahá'í and subscriber to ''Star of the West'', travelled to the Philippine Islands in 1921 before the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá,&lt;ref name="mirza"/&gt; during [[History of the Philippines (1898-1946)|American territorial period]]. Touty arrived via [[Shanghai]], then [[Vladivostok]] and came to [[Mindanao]] in the Philippines, ending up in [[Surigao City|Surigao]], in January 1921 for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on the Babi and Baha'i Religions in Russia and its territories | journal = The Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 05 | issue = 3 | year = 1993 | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 both [[Siegfried Schopflocher]] and [[Martha Root]], both later entitled as [[Hands of the Cause]], were able to give talks in [[Manila]]. Touty left the Philippines in 1926.

In 1938 Felix Maddela became the first Filipino Bahá'í. His first encounter with the Bahá'í Faith was in 1924 when a purchase he made was wrapped in a piece of old newspaper which contained an article by Martha Root about the religion. As the author's address did not appear in the article, it was another 14 years before he encountered more about the religion.&lt;ref name="blazing"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Muhajir | first = Iran Furutan | title = The Babi and Baha'i Religions: An Annotated Bibliography | journal = The Blazing Years: 50th Anniversary of the Bahá'í Faith in the Philippines | year = 1989 | url =http://www.bahai-library.com/books/biblio/area.studies.html | accessdate = 2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early spring of 1937, Loulie Albee Mathews arrived in Manila on board the "Franconia." As the boat was to dock for only a few hours, she managed to place in a college library a few pamphlets for the shelf of comparative religions. A few months later, on a visit to Manila from Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, Mr. Maddela came across the literature. This started a series of correspondence with the Bahá'í Publishing Committee of the United States.  With Madella so fired up, he immediately taught his family and friends. Shortly before World War II, the Bahá'í's of Solano numbered around fifty. When war broke out all communications ceased. Immediately after the war, contact was re-established through Alvin Blum, who was attached to the medical unit of the United States Army. Hitch-hiking to Solano, which was in ruins, he located the Maddelas living in impoverished conditions. Of the fifty enrolled Bahá'í's, twenty-five had been killed or missing. The others had survived by hiding in rice fields for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Not every sea hath pearls | work = books written by Loulie Albee Mathews | publisher = Naturegraph Publishers | year = 1986 | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL2715381M/Not_every_sea_hath_pearls | accessdate = 2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1946, the Local Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'í's of Solano was incorporated. The members and incorporators were Felix Maddela, Angustia Maddela, Zacarias Tottoc, Mariano Tagubat, Nicanora Lorenzo, Dionisia Vadel, Maurelio Bueza, Jacinta Piggangay and Azucena Cruz. In 1947, Mr. Dominador Anunsacion and his brother Angelo traveled to Solano, heard and accepted the Faith. Upon their return to Santiago,Isabela another community was established.&lt;ref name="blazing"/&gt;

Hazel Mori, an American, became a Bahá'í in the USA in 1941, and later moved to the Philippines as a Baha'i pioneer. For more than ten years she served as treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Philippines when it was formed later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = White | first = Roger | author-link = Roger White (Bahá'í) | title = Review of "Prickles and Plums" | journal = Bahá'í Association for the Arts | volume = 1991 | issue = January | date = January 1991 | url = http://bahai-library.com/bafa/m/mori.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Slice of the Loaf | author = Hazel Mori| year = 2008|isbn=9789715270045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, heeding the call of Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Bahá'í Faith, also visited Philippines. These were Nina Nadler, William Allison, Miss Virginia Breaks, and Michael Jamir. [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Agnes Baldwin Alexander]] also visited the Philippines six or seven times from 1958 to 1964. In 1956, the Local Spiritual Assemblies of Rosario and Diffun were established. The first Bahá'í Summer School was held in Solano in 1958. The Local Spiritual Assembly of Manila was also established in 1959.&lt;ref name="blazing"/&gt;

Luisa Mapa Gomez was the first Bahá'í of Manila. Born in Talisay, Negros Occidental, she was the daughter of a prominent doctor, and graduated from the University of the Philippines College of Education. She sponsored countless students to attend elementary, high schools and colleges. After the visit of Mrs. Mori to the Philippines in 1953, and after attending firesides in the home of Mrs. Nina Adler, who was then working in the American Embassy, "Momsu", as she was fondly called, accepted the Faith.&lt;ref name="blazing"/&gt;

[[File:Phtribal11.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Areas with tribal groups]]
In 1960 the Bahá'í community of the Philippines consisted of four local spiritual assemblies and a population of about 200. In 1961, Hand of the Cause, Dr. [[Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir]] arrived in Manila for the first of his numerous visits.  The handful of believers in Solano, Santiago and Manila were empowered to overcome natural shyness and to reach out to masses in these provinces. Bill Allison, Jack Davis, Vivian Bayona, Grace Maddela, Philip Flores, Baltazar Mariano, Len Scott, Vic Samaniego and Freddie Santiago were among those who assisted others in the process of entry to the Faith. Gradually, Dr. Muhajir encouraged everyone to expand beyond Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya into other provinces.&lt;ref name="blazing"/&gt; By 1962 there were reports of mass conversions with 24 Local Spiritual Assemblies and 1000 converts. By 1963 there were 2000 Bahá'ís and there were several specific tribes known to have converts - [[Ifugao]], [[Igorot]], [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Ilongot people|Ilongot]], [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]], [[Negritoes]], [[Pangasinan]], and [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]].&lt;ref name="bpg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#19 | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963| others = Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | pages = 19–20, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were villages where the inhabitants were all Bahá'ís. Dr. Muhájir, accompanied by Ms. Vivian Bayona, introduced the religion to the Bilaan tribe in Mindanao. Datu Eloy Epa, the tribal chief, accepted the Faith.&lt;ref name="muhajir"&gt;{{cite book |first=Iran Furutan |last=Muhajir |year=1992 |title=Dr. Muhajir, Hand of the Cause of God, Knight of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn= 1-870989-26-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, National Spiritual Assembly was elected for the first time. The members were Vicente Samaniego, Pablo Mercado, Jack Davis, Neva Dulay, Luisa Mapa Gomez, Dominador Anunsacion, Ruth Walbridge, Theo Boehnert and Orpha Daugherty.&lt;ref name="blazing"/&gt;  That year,  Dr. Muhájir visited the island of Mindoro and walked for eight hours across mountainous terrain to reach the [[Mangyan]] tribes. The religion was received with immediate acceptance. One new declarant, Rogelio Onella, began using a room in his house to teach literacy classes to fellow tribesmen. This small class developed further into the 'Rogelio Onella Memorial School' and served as nucleus of four tutorial schools among the tribes.&lt;ref name="muhajir"/&gt; By 1980 there were 45 Local Spiritual Assemblies and 64,000 adherents. During this period the only Hand of the Cause to visit the interior of the country was Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir though Agnes Baldwin Alexander and [[Collis Featherstone]] also visited the country.&lt;ref name="bw18a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="custodians"&gt;{{cite book |editor = Rabbani, R. |authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum |year = 1992 |title = The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 294, 327, 361, 366, 372, 377  |url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians |ISBN = 0-85398-350-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large scale growth was generally true across [[Southeast Asia]] in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="momem1"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/bahai/intro9.htm | title = A Short Introduction to the Bahá'í Faith | chapter = The Bahá'í Today | first = Moojan | last = Momen | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 1972 three Iranian Bahá'í students of [[Mindanao State University]] were murdered: Parvíz Sadeghi, Farámarz Vujdání and Parvíz Furúghí were killed while traveling in rural Muslim areas of Mindanao. After recovering their mutilated bodies from a shallow grave a convocation was held and funeral procession attended by thousands of people including fellow students, faculty members and university officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Bahá'í community in the Philippines has been active in the country on several different areas. A curriculum on [[Values education]] for public secondary schools in the Philippines was initially developed by a team of Bahá'í educators and was then completed as a doctoral dissertation.

{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=6}}
{{Fertile Crescent myth (Arabian)}}
'''Bel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|l}}; from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''bēlu''), signifying "lord" or "master", is a [[title]] rather than a genuine name, applied to various gods in the [[Mesopotamian religion]] of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]. The feminine form is ''[[Bêlit|Belit]]'' 'Lady, Mistress'. ''Bel'' is represented in [[Greek language|Greek]] as '''Belos''' and in [[Latin]] as '''Belus'''. Linguistically ''Bel'' is an [[East Semitic]] form cognate with [[Northwest Semitic]] [[Baal]] with the same meaning.

Early translators of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] believed that the ideogram for the god called in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''[[Enlil]]'' was to be read as ''Bel'' in Akkadian. Current scholarship holds this as incorrect, but one finds ''Bel'' used in referring to Enlil in older translations and discussions.&lt;ref name="Orr1915"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Orr|title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ows9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA349|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=1915|publisher=Howard-Severance Company|pages=349–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bel'' became especially used for the Babylonian god [[Marduk]] and when found in Assyrian and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|neo-Babylonian]] personal names or mentioned in inscriptions in a Mesopotamian context it can usually be taken as referring to Marduk and no other god. Similarly ''Belit'' without some disambiguation mostly refers to Bel Marduk's spouse [[Sarpanit]]. However, Marduk's mother, the Sumerian goddess called [[Ninhursag]], [[Damgalnuna|Damkina]], Ninmah and other names in Sumerian, was often known as ''Belit-ili'' 'Lady of the Gods' in Akkadian.

Other gods called "Lord" could be and sometimes were identified totally or in part with Bel Marduk. The god [[Malak-bel]] of [[Palmyra]] is an example, though in the later period from which most of our information comes he seems to have become very much a sun god.

Similarly, Zeus Belus mentioned by [[Sanchuniathon]] as born to [[Cronus]]/[[El (god)|El]] in [[Perea (Holy Land)|Peraea]] is certainly most unlikely to be Marduk.

== Bel of Palmyra ==
A god named Bel was the chief-god of [[Palmyra]] in pre-[[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] times, being worshipped alongside the gods [[Aglibol]] and [[Yarhibol]]. Originally, he was known as Bol,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TccUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1|title=The Pantheon of Palmyra|last=Teixidor|first=Javier|date=1979|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=9004059873|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Northwestern Semitic word [[Baal|Ba'al]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69YUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46|title=Cults and Beliefs at Edessa|last=Drijvers|first=H. J. W.|date=1980|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=9004060502|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (usually used to refer to the god [[Hadad]]), until the cult of Bel-[[Marduk]] spread to [[Palmyra]] and by 213 BC, Bol was renamed to Bel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[temple of Bel]] was dedicated to this god.{{Gallery

'''Bengali Hindu wedding''' refers to Bengali wedding with Hindu rites and rituals native to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arranging the wedding==
A traditional wedding is [[Arranged marriage|arranged]] by Ghotoks (matchmakers), who are generally friends or relatives of the couple. The matchmakers facilitate the introduction among the family and the prospective bride and groom.

Bengali weddings are traditionally in four parts: the bride's ''Gaye Holud'', the groom's ''Gaye Holud'', the ''Beeye'' and the ''Bou Bhaat''. These often take place on separate days. The first event in a wedding is an informal one: the groom presents the bride with a ring marking the "engagement", a system which is gaining popularity. This can sometimes be considered as Ashirwaad.

There can be subtle differences in Bengali Hindu marriages in West Bengal and Bangladesh. The rituals sometimes differ. In Paaka Katha (final talk), the parents of the bride/groom, along with one or two very close relatives/friends go to the other party's house to formally settle the marriage. It may be followed by a lunch / dinner.

A Bengali Hindu Marriage can be divided into the following parts:

* '''Pre-wedding rituals''': ''Adan Pradan, Patri Patra, Ashirvad, Aai Budo Bhaat, Vridhi, Dodhi Mangal, Holud Kota, Adhibas Tatva, Kubi Patta, Snan, Sankha Porano''
* '''Wedding rituals''': ''Bor Boron, Potto Bastra, Saat Paak, Mala Badal, Subho Drishti, Sampradan, Yagna, Saat Pak (couple), Anjali, Sindur Daan and Ghomta''
* '''Post-wedding rituals''': ''Bashar Ghar, Bashi Biye, Bidaye, Bou Boron, Kaal Ratri, Bou Bhaat, Phool Sajja, Dira Gaman''

==Pre-wedding rituals==

'''[[Ashirbaad]]''' – On an auspicious day the elders of the groom's side go to bless the bride and vice versa, by sprinkling husked rice and trefoil on their heads and giving them gold ornaments. It is a kind of acceptance of the boy and the girl on both sides.

'''[[Gaye Holud]]''' – A ceremony in which five or seven married women of the household grind turmeric with mortar and pestle and anoint the bride with turmeric paste, first it is been applied on groom then the same paste will sent to bride's home for applying it on her along with a new Saree and [[gamchha]] (bengalee cotton towel) and other treassaud set from the boy's party. This brightens up the bride's complexion and makes her skin glow.

'''[[Dodhi Mongol]]''' – At dawn on the day of marriage seven married ladies adorn the bride's hands with the traditional bangles Shakha and Paula – one pair of red and one pair of white Conch-shell bangles, and feed her a meal of curd and rice, nowadays other dishes as well, the only meal after which the bride and her parents fast the whole day. This ritual is celebrated on groom's side also.

==Main wedding rituals ==
[[File:Pair_of_Topor.jpg|thumb|[[Topor_(headgear)|Topor]].]]
[[File:Mala Badal - Bengali Hindu Wedding - Howrah 2015-12-06 7716.JPG|thumb|Mala Badal- the ceremony when bride and the groom exchange garlands with each other.]]
'''[[Bor Jatri]]''' – The members of the groom's house as well as his friends dress in their best attire and journey to the bride's house where the wedding takes place.

'''[[Bor Boron]]''' – When the bor jatri reaches the bride's place, usually the mother of the bride along with other members come out to welcome the groom and his family by showing the holy earthen lamp, sprinkling trefoil, and husked rice placed on a bamboo winnow (kula). Then they are served sweets and drinks.

'''[[Potto Bastra]]''' – After the groom is seated at the chadnatolla (wedding altar and canopy) – the sanctum sanctorum where only the groom, bride and the priest takes their place, the groom is offered new clothes by the person who is to do the sampradaan – the elderly male member of the family who does sampradan offers the responsibility of the bride to the groom.

'''[[Saat Paak]]''' – The bride, usually seated on a low wooden stool called pidi is lifted by her brothers and is taken round the groom in seven complete circles. The significance is they are winded up securely to each other.

'''[[Subho Dristi]]''' – After saat paak the bride and the groom are made to look at each other in front of all the assembled invitees. The bride is told to remove the paan leaves. This exchange of loving glance is to initiate them to be together officially by the society.

'''[[Mala Badal]]''' – After the circles are completed, still sitting high on the piri, the bride and the groom exchange garlands of fragrant flowers thrice. This is the first step in which they accept each other.

'''[[Sampradan]]''' – The bride then takes her place at the chadnatolla where an elderly male member of the bride's family hands her over to the groom and the couple's hands are bound by the sacred thread amidst recital of Vedic chants and are placed on the mangal ghot – a brass pitcher filled with water that is covered with mango leaves attached to one twig and a green coconut placed on it.

'''[[Yagna]]''' – The bride and groom sit in front of the sacred fire and chant mantras after the priest. Agni, the fire god is made the divine witness to the marriage. See [[Vedic marriage]].

'''[[Saptapadi]]''' – Seven circular rounds are taken by the couple around the fire thereby solemnising the occasion.

'''Anjali''' – An offering to the fire is made. The bride's brother puts puffed rice (khoi) in the hands of the bride, and the groom standing close to her holds her hands from the back and extends their arms forward. They then pour the offering into the fire together.

'''[[Sindoor Daan]]''' and '''[[Ghomta]]''' – Once again seated at their respective places in chadnatolla the groom applies sindoor or vermilion (a symbol of marriage worn by Hindu women thereafter) on the bride's hair-parting. The bride then covers her head with a new sari offered by the groom as ghomta or veil.
[[File:Fish as a gift in bengali wedding.jpg|thumb|Fish as a gift in bengali wedding: In Bengali weddings, the gifts are specially wrapped before sending them to the household of the bride and groom. However, such gifts have special motifs and fish is one of them.]]

==Post-wedding rituals==
[[File:Feet-in-alta.jpg|thumb|A ceremony welcoming the newly wed bride to her new home, with the feet dipped in a mixture of milk and [[Alta (dye)|alta]].]]
'''[[Bidaay]]''' – This is a farewell – mixed moment of joy and sorrow as the bride is bid adieu with blessings of her parents and relatives to start a new life with her beau. The bride has to throw rice in the sari of her mother to fill the responsibility of her mother to her (as it is considered that the bride is the Groom's responsibility).

'''[[Bodhu Boron]]''' - This is done when the bride reaches the groom's house. One dish is made full with alta and milk. The bride stands on it, then enters the room with groom after being welcomed by the mother-in-law.

'''[[Kaal Ratri]]''' – After the couple reaches the groom's house and the initial welcome ceremony is over they are separated for the night, probably to get a refreshing sleep and prepare for the next day's final wedding ceremony.

'''[[Bou Bhaat]]''' – The bride cooks and serves all the members of her husband's family. The husband has to gift a sari to new bride and has to take a vow of taking the responsibility of the bride's basic needs ("Bhaat Kapor" - literally meaning food &amp; dress). A banquet is held to treat the guests who lavish gifts on the new bride.

'''[[Phool Shojja]]''' – The couple and their bed are adorned with flowers and are left together in their room to enjoy conjugal bliss.
There are friends who actually stay under the bed or by the corner of the door, the groom needs to check for these devils before he begins to talk to the bride.

==Arranging a wedding==

Arranging a wedding is a relatively complex affair with many moving parts. Even a simple wedding requires 5–8 vendors and 300–500 guests. To simplify the process, there are event management companies that help in executing the process.

'''Candraprabha''' (literally "Moonlight", {{cjkv|r=Gakkō bosatsu|p=Yuèguāng púsà|c=月光菩薩}}) is a [[bodhisattva]] often seen with [[Suryaprabha]], as the two siblings serve [[Bhaisajyaguru]]. Statues of Nikkō and Gakko closely resemble each other and are commonly found together, sometimes flanking temple doors. They are also known in mainland Asia as [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] rather than bodhisattvas.

The '''Cumaean Sibyl''' was the priestess presiding over the [[Apollo]]nian [[oracle]] at [[Cumae]], a [[Greek colony]] located near [[Naples]], Italy. The word ''[[Sibyl (oracle)|sibyl]]'' comes (via [[Latin]]) from the [[ancient Greek]] word ''sibylla'', meaning [[prophet]]ess. There were many sibyls in different locations throughout the ancient world. Because of the importance of the Cumaean Sibyl in the legends of [[Ancient Rome|early Rome]] as codified in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' VI, and because of her proximity to Rome, the Cumaean Sibyl became the most famous among the Romans. The [[Erythraean Sibyl]] from modern-day Turkey was famed among Greeks, as was the oldest Hellenic oracle, the Sibyl of [[Dodona]], possibly dating to the second millennium BC according to Herodotus, favored in the east.

The Cumaean Sibyl is one of the four sibyls painted by [[Raphael]] at [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (see gallery below.) She was also painted by [[Andrea del Castagno]] (''[[Uffizi Gallery]], illustration right''), and in the Sistine Ceiling of [[Michelangelo]] her powerful presence overshadows every other sibyl, even her younger and more beautiful sisters, such as the [[Delphic Sibyl]].

There are various names for the Cumaean Sibyl besides the "Herophile" of Pausanias and Lactantius&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], 10.12.8; [[Lactantius]], 1.6.10.&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Aeneid'''s "Deiphobe, daughter of [[Glaucus]]": "Amaltheia", "Demophile" or "Taraxandra" are all offered in various references.

==Ancient Roman prophecies==
[[File:Cumæan Sibyl.gif|thumb|Cumæan Sibyl, a 1896 illustration]]

The story of the acquisition of the [[Sibylline Books]] by [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], the semi-legendary last king of the [[Roman Kingdom]], or [[Tarquinius Priscus]], is one of the famous mythic elements of Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' IV.62 (repeated by [[Aulus Gellius]] I.19); Varro, according to a remark in [[Lactantius]] I.6; Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XIII.27.&lt;!--Dio Cassius?--&gt; Of these sources, only Lactantius' Varro claims specifically that the old woman selling the books was the Cumaean Sibyl.&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries ago, concurrent with the 50th [[Olympiad]], not long before the expulsion of Rome's kings, an old woman "who was not a native of the country" (Dionysius) arrived [[wiktionary:incognito|incognita]] in Rome. She offered nine books of prophecies to King Tarquin; and as the king declined to purchase them, owing to the exorbitant price she demanded, she burned three and offered the remaining six to Tarquin at the same stiff price, which he again refused, whereupon she burned three more and repeated her offer. Tarquin then relented and purchased the last three at the full original price, whereupon she "disappeared from among men" (Dionysius). &lt;!--what version?:Another version has the price doubling each time.--&gt;

The books were thereafter kept in the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], Rome, to be consulted only in emergencies. The temple burned down in the 80s BC, and the books with it, necessitating a re-collection of Sibylline prophecies from all parts of the empire (Tacitus 6.12). These were carefully sorted and those determined to be legitimate were saved in the rebuilt temple. The Emperor Augustus had them moved to the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine Hill, where they remained for most of the remaining Imperial Period.

The Cumaean Sibyl is featured in the works of various Roman authors, including Virgil (''The Eclogues'', ''The Æneid''), [[Ovid]] (''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|The Metamorphoses]]'') and [[Petronius]] (''The [[Satyricon]]'').

===Stories recounted in Virgil's ''Æneid''===
The Cumaean Sibyl prophesied by “singing the fates” and writing on [[oak]] leaves. These would be arranged inside the entrance of her cave, but if the wind blew and scattered them, she would not help to reassemble the leaves and recreate the original prophecy.

The Sibyl was a guide to the underworld ([[Hades]]), whose entrance lay at the nearby [[volcanic crater|crater]] of [[Avernus]]. [[Aeneas]] employed her services before his descent to the [[lower world]] to visit his dead father [[Anchises]], but she warned him that it was no light undertaking:
{{poemquote|Trojan, Anchises' son, the descent of Avernus is easy.
All night long, all day, the doors of Hades stand open.
But to retrace the path, to come up to the sweet air of heaven,
That is labour indeed.|''Aeneid'' 6.126-129.}}
The Sibyl acts as a bridge between the worlds of the living and the dead (cf. concept of [[liminality]]). She shows Aeneas the way to Avernus and teaches him what he needs to know about the dangers of their journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Le silence dans l'Énéide|last = NURTANTIO|first = Yoneko|publisher = EME &amp; Intercommunications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-2-8066-2928-9|location = Bruxelles|pages = 50sqq|language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stories recounted in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''===
Although she was a mortal, the Sibyl lived about a thousand years. She attained this longevity when [[Apollo]] offered to grant her a wish in exchange for her virginity; she took a handful of sand and asked to live for as many years as the grains of sand she held. Later, after she refused the god's love, he allowed her body to wither away because she failed to ask for [[eternal youth]]. Her body grew smaller with age and eventually was kept in a jar (''ampulla''). Eventually only her voice was left (''Metamorphoses'' 14; compare the myth of [[Tithonus]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maicar.com/GML/Sibyl6Cumaean.html Article on the Cumean Sibyl] – cf. section on The Sibyl and Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
Virgil may have been influenced by Hebrew texts, according to [[Tacitus]], amongst others. [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], the Christian emperor, in his first address to the assembly, interpreted the whole of ''The Eclogues'' as a reference to the coming of Christ, and quoted a long passage of the [[Sibylline Oracles]] (''Book 8'') containing an [[wiktionary:acrostic|acrostic]] in which the initials from a series of verses read: Jesus Christ Son of God Saviour Cross.&lt;ref&gt;[https://carleton.ca/gallery/sibyls/sibyls.html Sibyls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920015233/http://www.carleton.ca/gallery/sibyls/sibyls.html |date=2008-09-20 }} accessed December 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], both the Cumaean Sibyl and Virgil were considered prophets of the birth of [[Christ]], because the fourth of Virgil's ''[[Eclogues]]'' appears to contain a [[Messianic prophecy]] by the Sibyl. In it, she foretells the coming of a saviour, whom Christians identified as Jesus.&lt;ref name="Eliot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan, Jaroslav Jan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lFKhtOt1qK0C ''The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine''], University of Chicago Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-226-65371-4}}. Cf. p.64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiefer, Frederick, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wekDP160ZKIC ''Writing on the Renaissance Stage: Written Words, Printed Pages, Metaphoric Books''], University of Delaware Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-87413-595-8}}. Cf. p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; This was identified by early Christians as such—one reason why [[Dante Alighieri]] later chose Virgil as his guide through the underworld in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Similarly, Michelangelo prominently featured the Cumaean Sibyl in the [[Sistine Chapel]] among the [[Old Testament]] prophets, as had earlier works such as the [[Tree of Jesse]] miniature in the Ingeberg [[Psalter]] (c. 1210).

==Later literature==
* The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) is a quote from the ''Satyricon'' of [[Petronius]] (48.8) wherein [[Trimalchio]] states, "''Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent: ''Σίβυλλα τί θέλεις;'' respondebat illa: ''ἀποθανεῖν θέλω''.''" ("For I indeed once saw with my own eyes the Sibyl at Cumae hanging in her jar, and when the boys asked her, 'Sibyl, what do you want?' she answered 'I want to die'.")&lt;ref name="Eliot"&gt;Eliot, T. S.; Rainey, Lawrence S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=jUihM4kZ4fEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 ''The Annotated Waste Land with Eliot's Contemporary Prose: Second Edition''], Yale University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-300-11994-1}}. Cf. p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The title of [[Sylvia Plath]]'s semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' has been said to be a reference to the ''ampulla'' in which the Sibyl lived.
* [[Robert Graves]] fashioned a poetic prophesy by the Sibyl to bind the story together in his work of historical fiction, ''[[I, Claudius]]'' (1934).
* [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s poem "After Cumae" in ''For the Unfallen'' (1958) also refers to the Sibyl's 'mouthy cave'.
* [[Mary Shelley]] claimed in the introduction to her novel, ''[[The Last Man]]'', that in 1818 she discovered, in the Sibyl's cave near Naples, a collection of prophetic writings painted on leaves by the Cumaean Sibyl. She edited these writings into the current first-person narrative of a man living at the end of the 21st century, which proves to be the end of humanity.
* Science fiction writer [[David Drake]], in his story "To Bring The Light" &lt;ref&gt;Published in the 1996 [[Baen Books|Baen]] double ''Lest Darkness Fall and To Bring The Light'' and the 2011 anthology ''[[Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories]]''&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the Cumaean Sibyl was actually a [[time travel]]er - Flavia Herosilla, a well-educated woman from Imperial Rome of the 3rd century, who was sent back in time by a lightning strike, arriving at the moment of Rome's beginnings around 751 BC. She came to Cumae after ensuring that [[Remus]] and [[Romulus]] would indeed find Rome. Having arrived from a thousand years in the future, she was in a position to make some accurate prophesies.

==The caves at Cumae and Baiae==
[[Image:Antre de la Sybille.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the Cave of the Sibyl]]

The famous cave known as the "Antro della Sibilla" was discovered by [[Amedeo Maiuri]] in 1932, the identification of which he based on the description by Virgil in the 6th book of the Aeneid, and also from the description by an anonymous author known as pseudo-Justin. (Virg. Aen. 6. 45–99; Ps-Justin, 37). The cave is a [[trapezoidal]] passage over 131 m long, running parallel to the side of the hill and cut out of the  volcanic [[tuff]] stone and leads to an innermost chamber, where the Sibyl was thought to have prophesied.

A nearby tunnel through the [[acropolis]] now known as the "Crypta Romana" (part of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s defenses in the war against [[Sextus Pompey]]) was previously identified as the Grotto of the Sibyl. The inner chamber was later used as a burial chamber during the 4th or 5th century AD (M. Napoli 1965, 105) by people living at the site.

Some archaeologists have proposed an alternative cave site as the home of the Sibyl. A tunnel complex near [[Baiae]] leads to an underground geothermally-heated stream that could be presented to visitors as the river [[Styx]]. The layout of the tunnels conforms to the description in the [[Aeneid]] of [[Aeneas]]' journey to the underworld and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unsolved Mystery of the Tunnels at Baiae|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2012/10/the-unsolved-mystery-of-the-tunnels-at-baiae/|work=Past Imperfect Blog|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
A '''devotional song''' is a [[hymn]] which accompanies religious observances and rituals. Traditionally devotional music has been a part of [[Christian music]], [[Hindu music]], [[Sufi music]], [[Buddhist music]], [[Islamic music]]  and [[Jewish music]]

Each major religion has its own tradition with devotional hymns. In the West, the devotional has been a part of the [[liturgy]] in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and others, since their earliest days. A devotional is a part of the prayer service proper and is not, in these contexts, ornamentation.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], church music in general was hotly debated. Some [[Puritan]]s objected to all ornament and sought to abolish choirs, hymns, and, inasmuch as liturgy itself was rejected, devotionals.

In Eastern and Near-Eastern religions, devotionals can function as communion prayer and meditation. These are sung in particular [[rhythms]] which are sustained over a prolonged period to give practitioners a [[mysticism|mystical]] experience. In [[Hindu music]], the genre arising out of the [[Bhakti movement]] (devotion), it takes forms like [[Bhajan]], [[Kirtan]] and [[Aarti]].&lt;ref name="GoswamiThielemann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Saurabh Goswami|author2=[[Selina Sharma|Selina Thielemann]]|title=Music and Fine Arts in the Devotional Traditions of India: Worship Through Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEnT57bbZG8C|year= 2005|pages=2–10|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-811-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nijenhuis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie Te Nijenhuis|title=Kīrtana: Traditional South Indian Devotional Songs: Compositions of Tyāgarāja, Muttusvāmi Dīkṣitar and Śyāma Śāstri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI8sygAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-90-04-20933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Epistles of Manushchihr''''' (Minocher) are a response to comments made by the author's brother on the subject of purification in [[Zoroastrianism]].

When [[Zadsparam]], who was the [[dastur|high priest]] of [[Sirjan]] which is located near [[Kerman]], proposed certain new precepts, the public were not ready for change and were very unsatisfied. Therefore, they decided to complain to the high priest's older brother [[Manuschchihr]], who was the high priest of Kerman.

In response, Manushchihr issued three [[epistle]]s in the issue:
#A reply to the complaining people
#an expostulation with his brother
#a public decree condemning the new precepts of his younger brother as unlawful innovations.

The first epistle is dated March 15, 881; the third is dated June–July 881. This book contains almost 9000 words. Manushchihar is the author of another major [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] book named the '[[Dadestan-i Denig]]'.

The '''Hindu Shahi''' held sway over the [[Kabul Valley]] and [[Gandhara]] (modern-day Pakistan and [[Afghanistan]]) from as far back as the fourth century CE. During the Early [[Medieval India]]n history (700-1000 CE) there were two dynasties in [[Kabul Valley]] and [[Gandhara]]: the [[Kshatriya]]-[[Hindu]] dynasty and the [[Brahmin|Brahmana]]-Hindu dynasty which replaced it.&lt;ref name="Samad2011"/&gt; Both used the title of ''Shahi''.

==The ''varna'' of Shahis of Kabul==
Efforts were made, earlier also, to apportion the Kshatriya ''varna''&lt;ref&gt;In this discussion, views of E. Thomas, H. M. Elliot, Alexander Cunningham and C. V. Vaidya are noteworthy. (The omnibus word ‘caste’ cannot adequately denote different divisions in Hindu society. ''Varna'' system was the traditional four tiered classification of Hindus into Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. People were advised that it was best to marry within one's own varna.)&lt;/ref&gt;  to Kallar's Brahamana successors on the basis of their name-endings, marriage alliances and even their ''‘terrible valour’'' at the battlefield. All these arguments were deemed untenable. However, in 1973, [[Yogendra Misra]] projected the view&lt;ref&gt;Yogendra Mishara, ''The Hindu Shahis of Afghanistan and the Punjab AD 865-1026'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that according to Rajatarangini Hindu Shahis (meaning here post-Lagaturman kings) were also Kshatriyas.

==Ethnicity of the Brahmana Shahis==
C. V. Vaidya says that the Hindu Shahis were [[Brahmana]]s. He has further highlighted that "the Mohyals who are a sub-sect of Sarasvata Brahmnas ... claim ''with justice and propriety'' that Jaipal and Anandapal were Mohyal Brahmanas."&lt;ref name="vaidya 21"&gt;C. V. Vaidya, ''History of Mediaeval Hindu India'', Vol. III, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;  D. B. Pandey has expressed the view that, in the present state of our knowledge, the Hindu Shahis were Brahma-Kshatras, who discarded the priestly profession for martial pursuits."&lt;ref&gt;D.B. Pandey, ''The Shahis of Afghanistan and the Punjab'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Accounts suggest Punjabi Kshatriya origins for the Hindu Shahi dynasty. &lt;ref&gt;Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya ''History of Mediaeval Hindu India'', 1979, p 200.&lt;/ref&gt;The Palas are ruling clans originating in Punjab and belonged to either [[Mohyal]] Clan&lt;ref name="vaidya 21"/&gt; or [[Janjua]] Rajputs.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Hussain Khan, Chronicles of Early Janjuas, NY, USA, 2003, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence of Zabul by Kshatriya Shahis==

At some stage the Hindu kingdom of Kapisha had split up. Its western part formed a separate state called the kingdom of Zabul. It can be surmised that it was a family division because there were consanguineous and political relationships between the states of Kabul and Zabul.&lt;ref&gt;Abdur Rahman, ''Last Two Dynasties of the Shahis:'' "In about AD 680, the [[Rutbil]] was a brother of the Kabul Shah. In AD 726, the ruler of Zabulistan (Rutbil) was the nephew of Kabul Shah. Obviously the Kabul Shahs and the Rutbils belonged to the same family" – pp. 46 and 79, quoting Tabri, I, 2705-6 and Fuch, von W.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 700-701, [[Abdur Rehman bin Mohammed bin Ashta]] was dispatched with forty thousand men and was able to collect considerable booty but failed to have any territorial gains – thus incurring the displeasure of [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf|Hajjaj]]. Exasperated by the threats of super session he determined to carry arms against his master and, in order to strengthen his power, conducted a treaty with the enemies of faith (Rutbil) that the latter would afford him asylum in the event of the failure of his campaign against the [[caliph]]. After some initial successes, Abdur Rehman was at the end compelled to seek the protection of his Hindu ally. Sustained political intervention of the Rutbil brought the Islamic expansion to a halt and he had made Sistan an ‘ill-omened frontier’ for the Arabs. In [[folklore]] Rutbil became the hero of many Arab stories of holy wars on the frontier of [[Al-Hind|Hind]]. Gradually, the Arabs - the ruling caliphs - ceased to be a powerful political force and Rutbils ruled in comparative peace for another one hundred and fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;See: H. M. Elliot and John Dowson, ''[[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]'', Vol. I, p. 429 and Vol. II, p. 416-417; André Wink, ''Al Hind, pp.'' 121-123; K. A. Nizami, ed. ''Politics and Society during the Early Medieval Period'', Vol. II, p.37 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic kingdoms in the Shahi neighbourhood==

===The Samanids and the Saffarids===

In theory, the caliph as the successor of the Prophet was the fountainhead of all political authority. Kings and all tribal chiefs were subordinate to him and his sanction alone could provide the legal basis for their authority. With the waning of political might of the caliphate, its governors in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] set up their own strong kingdom – the [[Samanid dynasty]] (c. 819-1005 CE) – controlling regions west and north of [[Koh Hindu Kush]] up to [[Balkh]]. Under the loosely centralized feudal government of the Samanids, [[Transoxiana]] and Khurasan prospered with a notable expansion of industry and commerce.  Samanids were great art patrons and they turned [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]] into famous cultural centres, rivaling [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;C. V. Vaidya, ''History of Mediaeval Hindu India'', Vol. III, pp. 8-13; and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Brahmana Hindu Shahi Dynasty of Kabul===
According to ''The Mazare Sharif Inscription of the Time of the Shahi Ruler Veka'', recently discovered from northern Afghanistan and reported by the Taxila Institute of Asian Civilisations, [[Islamabad]], [[Veka]] (sic.) conquered northern region of Afghanistan ‘with eightfold forces’ and ruled there. He established a [[Shiva]] temple there which was inaugurated by ''[[Parimaha Maitya]]'' (the Great Minister).&lt;ref&gt;See R. T. Mohan, ''AFGHANISTAN REVISITED'' … Appendix – A, pp. 162-163. &lt;/ref&gt; He also issued copper coins of the Elephant and Lion type with the legend Shri Vakkadeva.

Nine principal issues of Bull and Horseman silver coins and only one issue of corresponding copper coins of Spalapatideva have become available. As many as five Elephant and Lion type of copper coins of Shri Vakkadeva are available and curiously the copper issues of Vakka are ''contemporaneous'' with the silver issues of Spalapati.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Macdowall, "The Shahis of Kabul and Gandhara" ''Numismatic Chronicle'', Seventh Series, Vol. III, 1968, pp. 189-224, see extracts in R. T. Mohan, ''AFGHANISTAN REVISITED'' …  Appendix –B, pp. 164-68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabul Town not attacked===
On his way back from Balkh, Yaqub is stated to have attacked Kabul. "Whether the word Kabul stands here for the city in particular or Kabul valley in general, is not clearly stated. The sequence of events, however, suggests that latter was probably the case" (Abdur Rahman).&lt;ref&gt;Abdur Rahman, ''The Last Two Dynasties of the Shahis'', pp. 101-103&lt;/ref&gt; As we know, Shahis had a governor in Northern Afghanistan. Invasion of this province was an attack on (the state of) Kabul and the [[Cult image|idols]], say from the Shiva temple established by Vakkadeva would verily be ‘idols from Kabul’. There is no indication of a direct battle between Yaqub and the king of Kabul, which event could not go unreported.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Two Dynasties of the Shahis'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was some time during this period that the Hindu Shahis shifted their capital from Kabul to Udabhandapura.

===Kamalavarman attacks Ghazni===

Reliable evidence has now become available indicating that this oft-quoted narration by ‘Ufi was short of the ‘whole truth’. Kamlu did not stop in his tracks by Fardaghan's ingenious [[propaganda]]. ''[[Tarikh-i-Sistan]]'' illuminates the history of this period differently. Amr-i-Lais's pre-occupation with affairs in Khurasan and the provocative action of his newly appointed governor of Ghazni, prompted two Indian Kings (Rai of Hindustan), whose names reported in very corrupt form have been restored as ''[[Ashta (king)|Ashta]]'' and ''[[Tormana]]'', to take firm retaliatory measures.  They combined their forces and launched a united invasion of Ghazni. Fardaghan is said to have opposed the Hindu army.  The ''Tarikh'' does not tell us whether the city of Ghazni was actually occupied by the victors at this stage or the name Ghazni stands for the province of Zabulistan, and not the city of Ghazni. The news of this invasion reached Amr when he was in [[Gurgan]] on his way to his last encounter with [[Ismael, Sar-e Pol|Ismail]]. In April 900 Amr was decisively defeated and sent as a prisoner to Baghdad where he breathed his last. He must have passed through Gurgan only a couple of months before his defeat. Thus Kamlu's invasion of Zabulistan can safely be placed in the beginning of 900 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;Abdur Rahman, ''The Last Two Dynasties of the Shahis'', pp. 110-116 quoting ''Tarikh-i-Sistan'', pp. 255-56. Also, André Wink, ''Al Hind'', I, p. 125: "Muslim control of [[Zamindwar]] remained imperfect until the end of ninth century, and in Ghazni the Saffarid governor was again expelled by two Indian princes in 890-900 CE"&lt;/ref&gt;

Having successfully dealt with the Saffarids, Ashta (the governor of Kabul) appears to have stayed back and maneuvered a ‘palace coup’. He seized the Shahi throne at Udabhandapura, dislodging his brother Kamalavarman but the state of Kashmir intervened. ''Rajatarangini'' records that [[Prabhakaradeva]] the ''[[Koshadhyaksha]]'' (Superintendent of Treasury) led a victorious expedition against the Shahi power at the town of Udabhandapura and bestowed the kingdom of the rebellious Shahi (''ajna atikrami Shahi'' – a Shahi violator of order) upon Tormana, Lalliya's son and gave him the new name ''Kamaluka''.  This may have happened in 903 during the reign of child king [[Gopalavarman]] (r. 902-904) ruling under the guardianship of his mother [[Sugandha]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Kamaluka has been identified as Kamalavarman, son of Lalliya (Samantadeva). He was succeeded by his son, Bhimadeva.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Bhimadeva==

===Hindu rule at Ghazni===
During the reign of Kamalavarman, the Saffarid rule weakened precipitately and ultimately Sistan became a part of the [[Samanid Empire]]. The disorder generally prevailed and the control of Zabulistan changed hands frequently. Taking advantage of the situation, the Shahis stepped up activities on their western frontier. The result was the emergence of a small Hindu power at Ghazni, supported by the Shahis. "The authorities either themselves of early date or enshrining early information mention [[Lawik]]" who was a Hindu as the ruler at Ghazni, before this place was taken over by the Turkish slave governor of the Samanids.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Bosworth, ‘Notes on Pre-Ghaznavid History of Eastern Afghanistan, ''Islamic Quarterly'', Vol. XI, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the tenth century, Turkish slaves began to acquire power in the Samanid realm, as they were holding principal offices in the court and kingdom. One of these, [[Alaptagin]], a former Hajib or Door Keeper, defeated the superior royal army near [[Khulm Pass]] and decided to carve out an independent kingdom for himself. He first took over [[Bamian]] ‘the country of the infidel (Hindu) [[Shir Barak]]’. He next turned to Ghazni where Lawik, its ruler, submitted after a prolonged siege of four months. Alaptagin thus became the undisputed master of Ghazni but he died soon thereafter and his son [[Abu Ishaq]] succeeded him in 963.{{Cn|date=February 2018}}

Substitution of Hindu [[potentate]]s of Bamian and Ghazni by an emerging Turkish power posed a serious threat to the Shahi kingdom which acted with ‘remarkable alacrity’ at this stage. The Lawik was sent back to Ghazni with a huge army which ousted the Turks and sent Abu Ishaq flying to Bukhara. The Shahis had secured their western frontier – for the time being. But the gathering storm had not blown away.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Bhimadeva and Kashmir===
Bhimadeva had only one daughter and no son. This daughter was married to [[Simhraja]] of the [[Lohara dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===End of Bhimadeva===
The Shahi state had successfully managed to ward off danger from the strong neighbouring kingdom of the Samanids for more than a century. That Muslim kingdom was gradually decaying but its ambitious Turk officers were acquiring power and setting up personal [[fiefdom]]s, menacing the Hindu states south of Koh Hindu Kush. Though ruling with grandeur, unmolested by any neighbouring kingdom, Bhimadeva was getting old and must have been weighing his options in the matter of succession, because he did not have a male heir. The Shahi kingdom was strong and prosperous but not easy to govern - and protect. He could not count either on the Lawiks or his granddaughter Didda of Kashmir for this onerous responsibility.  He selected the allied kingdom of Punjab for this honour and probably installed a successor in his own life for the succession seems to have been without ‘contest or convulsion’.&lt;ref&gt;Raizada Harichand Vaid, ''Gulshane Mohyali'', II,  pp. 83 and 183-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jayapaladeva==
With [[Jayapala]], a new dynasty started ruling over the former Shahi kingdom of south- eastern Afghanistan and the change over was smooth and consensual. On his coronation, Jayapala used the additional name-suffix ''deva'' from his predecessor's dynasty in addition to the ''pala'' name-ending of his own family. (With Kabul lost during the lifetime of Jayapaladeva, his successors – Anandapala, Trilochanapala and Bhimapala - reverted to their own family ''pala''-ending names.) Jayapala did not issue any coins in his own name. Bull and Horseman coins with the legend Samantadeva, in billon, seem to have been struck during Jayapala's reign. As the successor of Bhima, Jayapala was a Shahi monarch of the state of Kabul, which now included the Punjab. Minhaj-ud-din describes Jayapala as "the greatest of the Rais of Hindustan."&lt;ref&gt;[[H. G. Raverty]], Tr. ''Tabaqat-i-Nasiri'' of Maulana Minhaj-ud-din, Vol. I, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning Jayapala followed an aggressive and pro-active policy towards the Turks. As stated earlier, Abu Ishaq had been evicted from Ghazni and the Lawiks were installed there with Shahi help. In 965, Abu Ishaq regained Ghazni with assistance from the Samanid ruler [[Abu Mansur]] and the Lawik fled to ‘[[Al-Hind|Hind]]’ once again to seek help from the Shahis. Ultimately, [[Sabuktagin]] descended the throne of Ghazni in 977. He soon added [[Bust (kingdom)|Bust]], [[Dawar]], [[Qusdar]], [[Tukhristan]] and [[Ghur]] to his dominions. Conflict with ‘Hind’ could not have been postponed for too long.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Jayapaladeva attacks Sabuktagin===

Jayapaladeva attacked the growing power [[Sabuktagin]] and was a fierce battle in which Jayapala was defeated. He lost more territory but continued to rule from [[Waihind]] and [[Peshawar]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Sabuktagin then became more involved in the affairs of the Samanid state and left the Shahis in peace. He became very powerful in the Samanid Kingdom by virtue of his strong and disciplined army. Sabuktagin died at [[Balkh]] in 997 at the age of fifty six. After a struggle for succession with brothers, his son [[Mahmud]] ascended the throne of Ghazni in 998. Mahmud first consolidated his position on his western front, even if he had to challenge the authority of his Samani over-lord. Soon he had control over [[Herat]], Balkh, Bust and Khurasan. Recognising his power, the Caliph of Baghdad acknowledged him as a sovereign in his own right and conferred high sounding titles on him.  The Ghaznavids had thus acquired a status equal to their former masters – the Samanids. The balance of power had been gradually tilting in favour of Ghazni.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

'''Unitarianism''', as a Christian denominational family of churches, was first defined in Poland-Lithuania and Transylvania in the late 16th century. It was then further developed in England and America until the early 19th century, although theological ancestors are to be found as far back as the early days of Christianity. It matured and reached its classical form in the middle 19th century. Later historical development has been diverse in different countries.

==Historical antecedents==

===Early origins===
Unitarians trace their history back to the [[Apostolic Age]], i.e. the life of Jesus and the decades immediately after his death, and claim this doctrine was widespread during the [[Ante-Nicene Period|pre-Nicene period]], that is, before the [[First Council of Nicaea]] met in 325. Many believe their [[Christology]] (understanding of [[Jesus Christ]]) most closely reflects that of the "original Christians." (For a discussion of the [[New Testament]] evidence, see [[Nontrinitarianism]].)

While it is evident that other Christologies existed in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, at least some Jewish-Christian congregations tended to hold the view that Jesus was a great man and prophet, even the Son of God, but not God himself. (See [[Ebionites]].)

One of the earliest controversies over the nature of Christ that involved the propagation of "unitarian" ideas broke out at Rome during the episcopate of [[Pope Victor I|Victor I]] (189–199). This was the so-called "Monarchian controversy", which originated in a revolt against the influential [[Logos]] theology of [[Justin Martyr]] and the apologists, who had spoken of Jesus as a second god. Such language was disturbing to some. Justin's language appeared to promote ditheism (two gods). The view, however, was defended by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], for whom it was essential to say that the Father and the Logos are two distinct "persons" (''prosopa'').

Some critics of Justin's theology tried to preserve the unity of God by saying that there is no difference to be discerned between the ‘Son’ and the ‘Father’ (unless ‘Son’ is a name for the physical body or humanity of Christ and ‘Father’ a name for the divine Spirit within). This sort of thinking, known as Modal Monarchianism or [[Sabellianism]], would one day lead to a compromise doctrine that the Father and the Son are consubstantial (of the same being).

Other critics preserved the unity of God by saying that Jesus was a man, but differentiated in being indwelt by the Spirit of God to an absolute and unique degree. They thus denied that Jesus was God or a god. They became known as "[[adoptionism|adoptionists]]", because they suggested that Jesus was adopted by the Father to be his Son. This view was associated with [[Theodotus of Byzantium]] (the Shoemaker) and [[Artemon]].

So even at this early stage we find evidence of proto-[[Arianism]] (Justin's view) and proto-[[Socinianism]] (the Adoptionist view), though they were, as yet, not fully formed. Both of these theologies have similarities to latter day Unitarianism.

The Monarchian controversy came to a head again in the mid-3rd century. In 259 the help of [[Dionysius of Alexandria]], was invoked in a dispute among the churches in Libya between adherents of Justin's Logos-theology and some [[modalist]] Monarchians. Dionysius vehemently attacked the modalist standpoint. He affirmed that the Son and the Father were as different as a boat and a boatman and denied that they were "of one substance" (''homoousios''). The Libyans appealed to [[Pope Dionysius|Dionysius of Rome]], whose rebuke to his Alexandrian namesake stressed the unity of God and condemned "those who divide the divine monarchy into three separate hypostases and three deities".

Another crisis occurred over [[Paul of Samosata]], who became [[bishop of Antioch]] in Syria in 260. Paul's doctrine is akin to the primitive Jewish-Christian idea of the person of Christ and to the Christology of Theodotus of Byzantium (adoptionism). To many his doctrine seemed plain heresy, and a council of local bishops was held to consider his case in 268. The bishops found it easier to condemn Paul than to expel him, and he remained in full possession of the church with his enthusiastic supporters. However, the bishops appealed to the [[Roman emperor]], who decided that the legal right to the church building should be assigned "to those to whom the bishops of Italy and Rome should communicate in writing". It was the first time that an ecclesiastical dispute had to be settled by the secular power. So Paul was put out of his church.

[[Arius]], son of Ammonius, was a popular priest appointed [[presbyter]] for the district of [[Baucalis]] in [[Alexandria]] in 313. His views of the nature of Jesus, although not original, conflicted with the views held by Bishop [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]]. Both Arius and Alexander held that Jesus was the Word (Logos) made perfect Flesh;  however, Arius held that the Word was the first Son and Creation of God, who had a beginning of existence, coming after God the Father in time and substance,&lt;ref&gt;"‘If,’ said he, ‘the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he had his substance from nothing.’" (Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical History'' I:5). Arius later toned down his statements in order to be restored to communion and said that Christ was begotten simply "before the ages" (Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical History'' I:26).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Alexander held that the Word was co-eternal and consubstantial with God. When disagreement arose between the two men, forces were set in motion that resulted in the formation of the doctrine of the Trinity.

In the [[Nicene Creed]] adopted at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, wherein the Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] got involved, the issue was considered settled and the adoption of Alexander's view became the orthodox doctrine and all other views were considered heresy and officially suppressed. During the reign of the emperor [[Constantius II]], however, the anti-Nicene party rose to prominence and exercised considerable control over the church for about a generation. New creeds were drawn up to counter the [[homoousian]] doctrine of the Nicene Creed. When [[Theodosius I]] took the imperial throne, however, the tables were turned, and at the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] in 381, the position that the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost were all the same being was agreed upon, and the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity was complete. Theodosius outlawed all Nontrinitarian forms of Christianity.

===The Protestant Reformation===
The [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century saw in many European countries an outbreak, more or less serious, of anti-Trinitarian opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Pocket Dictionary of Church History Nathan P. Feldmeth p135 "Unitarianism. Unitarians emerged from Protestant Christian beginnings in the sixteenth century with a central focus on the unity of God and subsequent denial of the doctrine of the Trinity"&lt;/ref&gt; Some doubt has been raised about the Reformers' commitment to previous beliefs, including previous [[Christology]]:  [[John Henry Newman]] wrote, "Luther himself at one time rejected the Apocalypse, called the Epistle of St. James ''straminea'' ['straw'], condemned the word 'Trinity,' fell into a kind of [[Eutychianism]] in his view of the Holy [[Eucharist]], and in a particular case sanctioned [[bigamy]].  Calvinism, again, in various distinct countries, has become [[Socinianism]], and Calvin himself seems to have denied our [[Jesus|Lord's]] [[Eternity|Eternal]] Sonship and ridiculed the [[Nicene Creed]]. 
 
"Another evidence, then, of the faithfulness of an ultimate development is its ''definite anticipation'' at an early period in the history of the idea to which it belongs."&lt;ref&gt;John Henry Newman (1878), ''[[Development of doctrine|An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine]]'', 1960 reprint, Garden City, NY:  Image Books, Part II, "Doctrinal Developments Viewed Relatively to Doctrinal Corruption", Ch. V, "Genuine Development Contrasted with Corruptions", § 6, "Sixth Note:  Conservative Action upon Its Past", p. 200.  [Newman's emphases.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppressed as a rule in individual cases, this type of doctrine ultimately became the badge of separate religious communities, in Poland, Hungary and, at a much later date, in England. By contrast, [[Sabellianism]] (also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism) is the nontrinitarian belief that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son and Holy Spirit are different modes or aspects of one God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons in God Himself.

Along with the fundamental doctrine, certain characteristics have always marked those who profess unitarianism: a large degree of [[Toleration|tolerance]], a historical study of [[scripture]], a minimizing of essentials, and a repugnance to formulated [[creed]].

[[Martin Cellarius]] (1499–1564), a friend of [[Martin Luther|Luther]], and [[Hans Denck]] (1500–1527) usually are considered the first literary pioneers of the movement; the anti-Trinitarian position of [[Ludwig Haetzer]] did not become public until after his execution (1529) for [[Anabaptist|Anabaptism]]. Luther himself was opposed to the Unitarian movement, and viewed the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]], as an adherent to the teachings of Arius.&lt;ref name=Susan&gt;{{citation|first=Susan|last=Ritchie|year=2004|title=The Islamic Ottoman Influence on the Development of Religious Toleration in Reformation Transylvania|volume=3|pages=59–70|url=http://www.zaytuna.org/seasonsjournal/seasons3/59-70%20Transylvania.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Servetus]] (1511?–1553) stimulated thought in this direction and heavily influenced other reformers both by his writings and by his death at the stake. In 1531  he had published his theological treatise ''De Trinitatis Erroribus'' (On the Errors About the Trinity), in which he rejected the Nicene dogma of the [[Trinity]] and proposed that the Son was the union of the divine [[Logos]] with the man [[Jesus]], miraculously born from the Virgin Mary through the intervention of God's spirit. This was generally interpreted as a denial of the Trinitarian dogma (actually Servetus had described the Trinity as a "three-headed Cerberus" and "three ghosts" which only led believers to confusion and error). Servetus expanded his ideas on the nature of God and Christ 20 years later in his major work, ''Christianismi Restitutio'' (The Restoration of Christianity), which caused his burning at the stake in [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s [[Geneva]] (and also in effigy by the Catholic [[Inquisition]] in France) in 1553 . Nowadays most Unitarians see [[Michael Servetus|Servetus]] as their pioneer and first martyr, and his thought was a remarkable influence in the beginnings of Polish and Transylvanian Anti-trinitarian churches,&lt;ref name="kot"&gt;See Stanislas Kot, "L'influence de Servet sur le mouvement atitrinitarien en Pologne et en Transylvanie", in B. Becker (Ed.), ''Autour de Michel Servet et de Sebastien Castellion'', Haarlem, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; even though his [[Arianism|Arian]] views on Jesus Christ (e.g. retaining belief in the [[pre-existence of Christ]]) were different from those of the Polish Socinians (rejecting belief in Jesus' pre-existence), and again from the generation of [[Thomas Belsham]] (rejecting also the virgin birth), and very different from what the Unitarian Church generally believes today.

The [[Anabaptist]] [[Council of Venice]] 1550, marks the start of a formal but underground [[antitrinitarian]] movement in Italy, led by men such as [[Matteo Gribaldi]]. The Italian exiles spread antitrinitarian views to Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Transylvania and Holland.

The ''Dialogues'' (1563) of [[Bernardino Ochino]], while defending the Trinity, stated objections and difficulties with a force which captivated many. In his 27th Dialogue Ochino points to Hungary as a possible home of religious liberty. And in Poland and Hungary definitely anti-Trinitarian religious communities first formed and were tolerated.

==Classical period of Unitarianism==

===Poland===
Scattered expressions of anti-Trinitarian opinion appeared in Poland early. At the age of 80, Catherine, wife of Melchior Vogel or Weygel, was burned at [[Kraków|Cracow]] (1539) for [[apostasy]]; whether her views embraced more than [[deism]] is not clear. The first synod of the (Calvinist) Reformed Church took place in 1555; the second Synod (1556) faced the theological challenges of [[Grzegorz Paweł z Brzezin]] (Gregory Pauli) and Peter [[Gonesius]] (Piotr z Goniądza), who were aware of the works of Servetus and of Italian [[Nontrinitarianism|antitrinitarians]] such as [[Matteo Gribaldi]]. The arrival of [[Giorgio Biandrata]] in 1558 furnished the party with a temporary leader.

The term "Unitarian" first appeared as ''unitaria religio'' in a document of the Diet of [[Leț|Lécfalva]], [[Transylvania]] on 25 October 1600, though it was not widely used in Transylvania until 1638, when the formal ''recepta Unitaria Religio'' was published. The [[Polish Brethren]] began as a grouping of [[Arians]] and Unitarians who split from the [[Polish Calvinist Church]] in 1565,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Encyclopedia of Protestantism: Hans Joachim Hillerbrand - 2003 "The religious doctrines of the Polish Unitarians after the Rakow episode retained many Calvinist elements"&lt;/ref&gt; though by 1580 the Unitarian views of [[Fausto Sozzini]] (hence the adjective [[Socinianism|Socinian]]) had become the majority. Sozzini's grandson [[Andrzej Wiszowaty Sr.]] in 1665-1668 published ''Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos '''Unitarios''' vocant'' (''Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians'' 4 vols. 1665–69). The name was introduced into English by the Socinian [[Henry Hedworth]] in 1673. Thereafter the term became common currency in English, though their detractors continued to label both Arian and Unitarian views as "Socinian".

In 1565, the Diet ([[Sejm]]) of [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]] excluded anti-Trinitarians from the existing synod of the [[Polish Reformed Church]] (henceforth the ''Ecclesia maior'') and Unitarians began to hold their own synods as the ''Ecclesia minor''. Known by various other names (of which [[Polish brethren]] and Arian were the most common), at no time in its history did this body adopt for itself any designation save "Christian".  Originally Arian (but excluding any worship of Christ), and [[Anabaptist]], the ''Minor Church'' was (by 1588) brought round to the views of [[Fausto Paolo Sozzini|Fausto Sozzini]], who had settled in Poland in 1579, and who denied the [[pre-existence of Christ]], while accepting the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] (see [[Socinianism]]).

In 1602 the nobleman [[Jakub Sienieński]] established among the non-Trinitarian community founded by his father at [[Raków, Kielce County]] the [[Racovian Academy]] and a printing-press, from which the [[Racovian Catechism]] was issued in 1605. In 1610 a Catholic reaction began, led by Jesuits. The establishment at Raków was suppressed in 1638, after two boys allegedly pelted a crucifix outside the town.

For twenty years 1639-1659 the Arians were tolerated, but public opinion widely considered them as collaborators with Sweden during [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]], and in 1660 the [[Polish Diet]] gave anti-Trinitarians the option of conformity or exile. The ''Ecclesia minor'' or Minor Church included many Polish magnates, but their adoption of the views of Sozzini, which precluded Christians from magisterial office, rendered them politically powerless.

The execution of the decree, hastened by a year, took place in 1660. Some conformed; a large number made their way to the Netherlands, where the [[Remonstrants]] admitted them to membership on the basis of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. Others, like [[Christopher Crell]], went to the German frontier, Prussia and Lithuania. A contingent settled in [[Transylvania]], not joining the Unitarian Church, but maintaining a distinct organization at [[Kolozsvár|Cluj]] until 1793.

The refugees who reached [[Amsterdam]] published the ''Bibliotheca fratrum polonorum'' (1665–1669), with the assistance of the Prussian emigre [[Christopher Sandius]], embracing the works of [[Johannes Crellius]], their leading theologian, [[Jonasz Szlichtyng]], their chief Biblical commentator, [[Fausto Sozzini]] and [[Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen]]. The title page of this collection, bearing the words ''quos Unitarios vocant'', introduced the term ''Unitarian'' to Western Europe.

The term Unitarian (in Latin) was first used by Polish and Dutch [[Socinians]] from the 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant (Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians 1665)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:derzs1.jpg|thumb|[[Dârjiu fortified church|The Unitarian Church]] in [[Dârjiu]], [[Romania]]]]
No distinct trace of anti-Trinitarian opinion precedes the appearance of [[Giorgio Biandrata]] at the Transylvanian court in 1563.  His influence was exerted on [[Ferenc Dávid]] (1510–1579), who was successively [[Roman Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinist]] and finally [[anti-Trinitarian]]. Some argue that the growth of anti-Trinitarian opinion in Transylvania and Hungary may have partly been due to the growing [[Islam]]ic influence of the expanding [[Ottoman Empire]] at the time.&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt;

In 1564 Dávid was elected by the Calvinists as "bishop of the Hungarian churches in Transylvania", and appointed court preacher to [[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John Sigismund]], prince of Transylvania.  His discussion of the Trinity began (1565) with doubts of the personality of the Holy Ghost{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

His antagonist in public disputations was the Calvinist leader, [[Peter Melius]] (Bishop of Debrecen 1558-1572); his supporter was Biandrata. John Sigismund, adopting his court-preacher's views, issued (1568) an edict of religious liberty at the [[Edict of Torda|Diet of Torda]], which allowed Dávid (retaining his existing title) to transfer his episcopate from the Calvinists to the anti-Trinitarians, [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár]] being evacuated by all but his followers.

In 1571 John Sigismund was succeeded by [[Stefan I of Poland|Stephen Báthory]], a Catholic.  Under the influence of [[Johann Sommer]], rector of the [[John Sigismund Unitarian Academy|Kolozsvár gymnasium]], David (about 1572) abandoned the worship of Christ.  The attempted accommodation by Fausto Sozzini only precipitated matters; tried as an innovator, Dávid died in prison at the [[Fortress of Deva|Fortress of Déva]] (1579).  The ''cultus'' of Christ became an established usage of the Church; it is recognized in the 1837 edition of the official hymnal, but removed in later editions.

[[Image:derzsx.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Interior of the Gothic church in Dârjiu]]
The term ''unitarius'' made its first documentary appearance, ''unitaria religio'', in a decree of the Diet of [[Leț|Lécfalva]] (1600); though it was not officially adopted by the Church until 1638.

In 1618 the Unitarian Church condemned and withdrew from Simon Péchi and the [[Szekler Sabbatarians|Sabbatarians]], a group with Judaic tendencies. The group continued to exist till the 1840s by which time many had converted to Judaism. In 1626 the ''Disciplina ecclesiastica'' was published by Bishop [[Bálint Radeczki]] (Latin: Valentinus Radecius, bishop 1616—1632). 1638 saw the [[Accord of Dés]] and suppression of the Unitarians.

Of the line of twenty-three bishops the most distinguished were [[György Enyedi (Unitarian)|George Enyedi]] (1592–1597), whose ''Explicationes'' obtained European vogue, and [[Mihály Lombard de Szentábrahám]] (1737–1758), who rallied the forces of his Church, broken by persecution and deprivation of property, and gave them their traditional statement of faith.  His ''[[Summa Universae Theologiae Christianae secundum Unitarios]]'' (published 1787), Socinian with Arminian modifications, was accepted by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] as the official manifesto of doctrine, and so remains, though subscription to it has not been required since the 19th century.

[[Image:Enlaka4.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Atid|Inlăceni]] [[Hungarian Runes]]. Inscription (1668) reads "&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;Egy az Isten Georgyius Musnai diakon&lt;/span&gt;", or "God is One Georgius Musnai deacon."]]

The first secondary school in Transylvania was established in the late 18th century in Székelykeresztúr ([[Cristuru Secuiesc]]); this functions to this day, although as a state school.

The official title in Hungary is the Hungarian Unitarian Church, with a membership of about 25,000 members, whereas in Romania there is a separate church with the name of [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]] and about 65,000 members, especially among the ''[[Székely]]'' population. In the past, the Unitarian bishop had a seat in the Hungarian parliament. The principal college of both churches is located at [[Cluj-Napoca]] (''Kolozsvár''), which is also the seat of the Transylvanian [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]]; there were others at [[Turda]] (''Torda'') and at [[Cristuru Secuiesc]].

Until 1818 the continued existence of this body was largely unknown to English Unitarians {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}; relations subsequently became intimate.  After 1860 a succession of students finished their theological education at [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College]], [[Oxford]]; others at the [[Unitarian College, Manchester|Unitarian Home Missionary College]].

===England===

[[Image:unitarian chapel newington green.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Newington Green Unitarian Church]], London, England. Built in 1708, this is the oldest non-conformist church in London still in use as a church. (October 2005)]]
In England Unitarianism was a protestant sect that had its roots in the [[Anabaptist]] radicals of the English Civil War.  They adopted adult baptism, and Godly republicanism; and they were egalitarians who sought to promote extreme revolutionary ideals.  The movement gained popularity among dissenting nonconformists in the early 18th century.  [[English Presbyterians]] were attracted to the second city at Norwich, by its emerging scientific community, which in the wake of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was particularly strong in Scotland.  They began to become a formal denomination in 1774 when [[Theophilus Lindsey]] organized meetings with [[Joseph Priestley]], founding the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in the country, at [[Essex Street Church]] in London.  In 1791 Lindsey and his colleague [[John Disney (Unitarian)|John Disney]] were behind the "first organized denominational Unitarian society", formally The Unitarian Society for promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue by the Distribution of Books&lt;ref name="harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 3"&gt;{{harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more simply known as the Unitarian Book Society. This was followed by The Unitarian Fund (1806), which sent out missionaries and financially supported poorer congregations. Unitarianism was not fully legal in the United Kingdom until the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]], a bill largely pushed forward in Parliament by [[William Smith (abolitionist)|William Smith]], and thus known sometimes under his name, or as the ''Unitarian Relief Act (Trinity Act)'' or ''The Unitarian Toleration Bill''.&lt;ref&gt;Maclear J.F. ''Church and state in the modern age: a documentary history'' 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This did not grant them full [[civil rights]] while the oppressive [[Corporation Act]] and [[Test Act]] remained, and thus in 1819 the third significant Unitarian society was created, The Association for the Protection of the Civil Rights of Unitarians.&lt;ref name="harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 3"/&gt; In 1825 these three groups amalgamated into the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]]. A century later, this joined with the Sunday School Association to become the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]], which remains today the [[umbrella organisation]] for British Unitarianism.

====Early beginnings====
Between 1548 ([[John Assheton]]) and 1612 we find few anti-Trinitarians, most of whom were either executed or forced to recant. Those burned included the Flemish surgeon [[George van Parris]] (1551); [[Patrick Pakingham]] (1555), a fellmonger; [[Matthew Hamont]] (1579), a ploughwright; John Lewes (1583); Peter Cole (1587), a tanner; [[Francis Kett]] (1589), physician and author; [[Bartholomew Legate]] (1612), a cloth-dealer and last of [[Smithfield, London#Civil history|the Smithfield victims]]; and the twice-burned [[Edward Wightman]] (1612). In all these cases the anti-Trinitarian sentiments seem to have come from Holland; the last two executions followed the dedication to [[James I of England|James I]] of the Latin version of the [[Racovian Catechism]] (1609).

====Socinian influence====
[[Fausto Sozzini]] had died on the road, after expulsion from Kraków, Poland on 4 March 1604, but the [[Racovian Academy]] and printing press continued till 1639, exerting influence in England via the Netherlands.

The vogue of [[Socinian]] views, typified by men like [[Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland]] and [[William Chillingworth|Chillingworth]], led to the abortive fourth canon of 1640 against Socinian books. The ordinance of 1648 made denial of the Trinity a capital offence, but it remained a dead letter, [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] intervening in the cases of [[Paul Best]] (1590–1657) and [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]] (1616–1662).

In 1652–1654 and 1658–1662 Biddle held a [[Socinian]] [[conventicle]] in London; in addition to his own writings he reprinted (1651) and translated (1652) the [[Racovian Catechism]], and the ''Life of Socinus'' (1653). His disciple [[Thomas Firmin]] (1632–1697), [[mercer (occupation)|mercer]] and philanthropist, and friend of [[John Tillotson]], adopted the more [[Sabellianism|Sabellian]] views of [[Stephen Nye]] (1648–1719), a clergyman. Firmin promoted a remarkable series of controversial tracts (1690–1699).

In England the [[Socinian controversy]], initiated by [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|Biddle]], preceded the [[Arian controversy]] initiated by [[Samuel Clarke]]'s ''Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity'' (1712), although [[John Knowles (antitrinitarian)|John Knowles]] was an Arian lay preacher at [[Chester]] in 1650. Arian or semi-Arian views had much vogue during the 18th century, both in the Church and among dissenters.

===="Unitarian" 1673====
The word ''Unitarian'' had been circulating in private letters in England, in reference to imported copies of such publications as the ''[[Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum|Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians]]'' (1665), [[Henry Hedworth]] was the first to use the word "Unitarian" in print in English (1673), and the word first appears in a title in [[Stephen Nye]]'s ''A brief history of the Unitarians, called also Socinians'' (1687). It was construed in a broad sense to cover all who, with whatever differences, held to the unipersonality of the Divine Being. Firmin later had a project of Unitarian societies "within the Church".

====Act of Toleration 1689====
The first preacher to describe himself as Unitarian was [[Thomas Emlyn]] (1663–1741) who gathered a London congregation in 1705. This was contrary to the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which excluded all who should preach or write against the Trinity.

In 1689 [[Presbyterians]] and Independents had coalesced, agreeing to drop both names and to support a common fund. The [[union in the London fund]] was ruptured in 1693; in course of time differences in the administration of the two funds led to the attaching of the Presbyterian name to theological liberals, though many of the older Unitarian chapels were Independent foundations, and at least half of the Presbyterian chapels (of 1690–1710) came into the hands of [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]]s.

====Salters' Hall conference 1719====
{{details|Salter's Hall controversy}}
The free atmosphere of [[dissenting academies]] (colleges) favoured new ideas. The effect of the [[Salters' Hall conference]] (1719), called for by the views of [[James Peirce]] (1673–1726) of [[Exeter]], was to leave dissenting congregations to determine their own orthodoxy; the General Baptists had already (1700) condoned defections from the common doctrine. Leaders in the advocacy of a purely humanitarian [[christology]] came largely from the Independents, such as [[Nathaniel Lardner]] (1684–1768), [[Caleb Fleming]] (1698–1779), [[Joseph Priestley]] (1733–1804) and [[Thomas Belsham]] (1750–1829).

[[Isaac Newton]] was an anti-Trinitarian, and possibly a Unitarian (though he may have been Sabellian).&lt;ref&gt;See James Glick's biography ''Isaac Newton''.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his last visitors before his death in 1727 was [[Samuel Crellius]] from Lithuania.

====The Unitarian Church 1774====
{{Main article|Essex Street Chapel}}
The formation of a distinct Unitarian denomination dates from the secession (1773) of [[Theophilus Lindsey]] (1723–1808) from the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]], on the failure of the Feathers petition to parliament (1772) for relief from subscription. Lindsey's secession had been preceded in Ireland by that of [[William Robertson (1705–1783)|William Robertson]] D.D. (1705–1783), who has been called "the father of Unitarian nonconformity". It was followed by other clerical secessions, mostly of men who left the ministry, and Lindsey's hope of a Unitarian movement from the Anglican Church was disappointed. The congregation he established at [[Essex Street Chapel]], with the assistance of prominent ministers such as [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Richard Price]], was a pivot for change. Legal difficulties with the authorities were overcome with the help of barrister [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]], who later became Attorney-General. By degrees Lindsey's type of theology superseded [[Arianism]] in a considerable number of dissenting congregations.

The [[Act of Toleration 1689]] was amended (1779) by substituting belief in Scripture for belief in the Anglican (doctrinal) articles. In 1813 the penal acts against deniers of the Trinity were repealed by the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]], largely pushed through Parliament by [[William Smith (abolitionist)|William Smith]], M.P., [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]], and grandfather of [[Florence Nightingale]]. In 1825 the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]] was formed as an amalgamation of three older societies, for literature (1791), mission work (1806) and civil rights (1818).

Attacks were made on properties held by Unitarians, but created prior to 1813. The Wolverhampton Chapel case began in 1817, the more important [[Hewley Fund]] case in 1830; both were decided against the Unitarians in 1842. Appeal to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] resulted in the [[Dissenters' Chapels Act]] (1844), which secured that, so far as trusts did not specify doctrines, twenty-five years tenure legitimated existing usage.

====The waning of the miraculous====
The period 1800-1850 is characterized by a shift in the British Unitarian movement's position from questioning the [[doctrine of the Trinity]] or the [[pre-existence of Christ]] to questioning the [[miraculous]], [[inspiration of Scripture]], and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], though not yet at this point questioning the [[resurrection of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Webb "Miracles in English Unitarian Thought" Essay, chapter 6 in Mark S. Micale, Robert L. Dietle, Peter Gay ''Enlightenment, passion, modernity: historical essays in European thought and culture'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence from America====
During the 19th century, the drier Priestley-Belsham type of Unitarianism, bound up with a [[determinist]] philosophy, was gradually modified by the influence of [[William Ellery Channing|Channing]] (see below), whose works were reprinted in numerous editions and owed a wide circulation to the efforts of [[Robert Spears (minister)|Robert Spears]] (1825–1899). Another American influence, potent in reducing the rigid though limited supernaturalism of Belsham and his successors, was that of [[Theodore Parker]] (1810–1860). At home the teaching of [[James Martineau]] (1805–1900), resisted at first, was at length powerfully felt, seconded as it was by the influence of [[John James Tayler]] (1797–1869) and of [[John Hamilton Thom]] (1808–1894).

====Notable people and institutions====
English Unitarianism produced some well-known scholars, e.g. [[John Kenrick (historian)|John Kenrick]] (1788–1877), [[James Yates (unitarian)|James Yates]] (1789–1871), [[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]] (1799–1881), but few popular preachers, though [[George Harris (Unitarian)|George Harris]] (1794–1859) is an exception. For the education of its ministry it supported [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College]] at [[Oxford]] (which deduced its ancestry from the academy of [[Richard Frankland (tutor)|Richard Frankland]], begun 1670), the [[Unitarian College, Manchester|Unitarian Home Missionary College]] (founded in Manchester in 1854 by [[John Relly Beard]], D.D., and [[William Gaskell]]), and the [[Presbyterian College, Carmarthen]].  It also produced the notable [[Chamberlain family]] of politicians: [[Joseph Chamberlain]], [[Austen Chamberlain]], and [[Neville Chamberlain]], and the [[Samuel Courtauld (industrialist)|Courtauld]] and Tate industrialist dynasties.

====Notable publications====
English Unitarian periodical literature begins with Priestley's ''[[Theological Repository]]'' (1769–1788), and includes the ''[[Monthly Repository]]'' (1806–1838), ''The Christian Reformer'' (1834–1863), ''The Christian Teacher'' (1835–1844), ''The Prospective Review'' (1845–1854), ''[[National Review (1855)|The National Review]]'' (1855–1864), the ''Theological Review''  (1864–1879), and ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'', one of the enterprises of the [[Hibbert Trust]], founded by [[Robert Hibbert (Anti-Trinitarian)|Robert Hibbert]] (1770–1849) and originally designated the Anti-Trinitarian Fund. This came into operation in 1853, awarded scholarships and fellowships, supported an annual lectureship (1878–1894), and maintained (from 1894) a chair of ecclesiastical history at Manchester College.

===Scotland===
Much has been made of the execution (1697) at [[Edinburgh]] of the student [[Thomas Aikenhead]], convicted of blaspheming the Trinity. The works of [[John Taylor (1694-1761)|John Taylor]], D.D. (1694–1761) on original sin and atonement had much influence in the east of [[Scotland]], as we learn from [[Robert Burns]]; and such men as William Dalrymple, D.D. (1723–1814) and William M'Gill, D.D. (1732–1807), along with other "moderates", were under suspicion of similar heresies. Overt Unitarianism has never had much vogue in Scotland. The only congregation of old foundation is at Edinburgh, founded in 1776 by a [[secession]] from one of the "fellowship societies" formed by James Fraser, of Brea (1639–1699). The mission enterprises of Richard Wright (1764–1836) and George Harris (1794–1859) produced results of no great permanence.

The [[Scottish Unitarian Association]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sua.org.uk/ Scottish Unitarian Association]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1813, mainly by [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], M.D., the sanitary reformer. The [[McQuaker Trust]] was founded (1889) for propagandist purposes.

Paradoxically, one of the reasons for the relative weakness of Unitarian movement in Scotland in the early 19th century may be the continuing presence of conservative, and therefore Bible-fundamentalist, non-Trinitarian, Arian, and Socinian views in dissenting chapels and among the Scottish followers of the [[Restoration Movement]] and [[Millerite]] movement. The Non-Trinitarian believers in Scotland were often more sympathetic to the Unitarians of a century earlier than to the more liberal views of Wright, Harris and Southwood Smith. A notable Bible-fundamentalist Scottish Unitarian was J. S. Hyndman, author of ''[http://www.biblicalunitarian.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=92 Lectures on The Principles of Unitarianism]'' ([[Alnwick]], 1824)&lt;ref&gt;JS Hyndman was formerly a student in Dr. Wardlaw's Theological Academy, [[Glasgow]] and in 1822 ministering at Call Lane Chapel, Leeds ''The Monthly repository of theology and general literature'' 1822 p520. For biographical details refer to [http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/ Scotland 1841 Census], shortly after "Rev. JS Hyndman, of Glasgow" was appointed minister of Ebenezer Chapel. W. Davison ''Alnwick - A descriptive and historical view of Alnwick''. 1822 p334. ''Five lectures'' was in response to Rev W. Proctor ''Five discourses on the personal office of Christ and of the Holy Ghost'' 1824 which "purports to be an answer to some Lectures on the principles of Unitarianism by JS Hyndman, the [[Socinian]] preacher at Alnwick" ''The Christian remembrancer, Volume 12'' 1830 p422 - the book was republished by Christian Educational Services in 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This conservative non-Trinitarian presence can be demonstrated by the response in Scotland, relative both to America and to his home town London, of the call of the first [[Christadelphian]] [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]]. The first congregations following Thomas' [[Socinian]] and [[Adventism|Adventist]] teachings in 1848-1849 were predominantly Scottish.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson, History of the Christadelphians 1864-1885: the emergence of a denomination 1997&lt;/ref&gt; And while the Christadelphians initially made more of their [[Millennialist]] teachings, the christological legacy of 17th century unitarians such as [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]] is evident and acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Botten John, The captive conscience: an historical perspective of the Christadelphian Stand  2002 p21 (citing Biddle)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently four Unitarian churches in Scotland:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sua.org.uk/ SUA listing]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.aberdeen-unitarians.org.uk/ Aberdeen],&lt;ref&gt;"The Aberdeen Unitarian Church belongs to a group of Churches which maintains freedom of thought in religion. The Church building is held in Trust for the conduct of public worship. The Services are open and do not necessarily, conform to any fixed format. The Congregation is described in the Trust Deed as "a non-subscribing Congregation" which means it is a Congregation which deliberately abstains from formulating or insisting upon any creed or statement of belief."&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.dundee-unitarians.org.uk/ Dundee], [http://www.edinburgh-unitarians.org.uk/ Edinburgh] and [http://www.glasgow-unitarians.org.uk/ Glasgow].

===Ireland===
Controversy respecting the Trinity was excited in Ireland by the prosecution at Dublin (1703) of [[Thomas Emlyn]] (see above), resulting in fine and imprisonment, for rejecting the deity of Christ. In 1705 the [[Belfast Society]] was founded for theological discussion by Presbyterian ministers in the north, with the result of creating a body of opinion adverse to subscription to the Westminster standards. Toleration of dissent, withheld in Ireland till [[Toleration Act 1719|1719]], was then granted without the requirement of any doctrinal subscription. Next year a movement against subscription was begun in the [[Synod of Ulster|General Synod of Ulster]], culminating (1725) in the placing of the advocates of non-subscription, headed by [[John Abernethy (minister)|John Abernethy]], D.D., of Antrim into a presbytery by themselves. This [[Presbytery of Antrim]] was excluded (1726) from jurisdiction, though not from communion.  During the next hundred years its members exercised great influence on their brethren of the synod; but the counter-influence of the mission of the [[Secession Synod|Scottish Seceders]] (from 1742) produced a reaction.  The Antrim Presbytery gradually became Arian; the same type of theology affected more or less the Southern Association, known since 1806 as the Synod of Munster.  From 1783 ten of the fourteen presbyteries in the Synod of Ulster had made subscription optional; the synod's code of 1824 left "soundness in the faith" to be ascertained by subscription or by examination.  Against this compromise [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]], D.D. (1788–1868), directed all his powers, and was ultimately (1829) successful in defeating his Arian opponent, [[Henry Montgomery (Remonstrant Synod)|Henry Montgomery]], LL.D. (1788–1865).  Montgomery led a secession which formed (1830) the [[Remonstrant Synod of Ulster]], comprising three presbyteries.

In 1910 the Antrim Presbytery, Remonstrant Synod and [[Synod of Munster]] united as the General Synod of the [[Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland]], with  38 congregations and some mission stations.  Till 1889 they maintained two theological chairs in Belfast, where [[John Scott Porter]] (1801–1880) pioneered biblical criticism; they afterwards sent their students to England for their theological education, though in certain respects their views and practices remained more conservative than those of their English brethren.  Irish Unitarian periodical literature began in 1832 with the ''[[Bible Christian]]'', followed by the ''Irish Unitarian Magazine'', the ''Christian Unitarian'', the ''Disciple'' and the ''Non-subscribing Presbyterian''.&lt;ref&gt; [[Robert Wallace (Unitarian)|Robert Wallace]], ''Antitrinitarian Biography''(1850); [[Amy Gaston Bonet-Maury|G. Bonet Maury]], ''Early Sources of Eng. Unit. Christianity'', trans. E. P. Hall (1884); A. Gordon, ''Heads of Eng. Unit. Hist''. (1895).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The history of Unitarian thought in the United States can be roughly divided into four periods:

* a period of precursor movements (early 18th century to c. 1800)
* the formative period (c. 1800-1835)
* a Transcendentalist period (c. 1835-1885)
* the modern period (since 1885)

====Precursor movements and early Unitarianism====
{{Further|Congregationalism in the United States}}
Unitarianism in the United States followed essentially the same development as in England, and passed through the stages of [[Arminianism]], [[Arianism]], to [[rationalism]] and a [[modernism]] based on an acceptance of the results of the [[Comparative religion|comparative study of all religions]]. In the early 18th century Arminianism presented itself in [[New England]], and sporadically elsewhere. This tendency was largely accelerated by a backlash against the "[[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]" under [[Jonathan Edwards (theology)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[George Whitefield]]. Before the [[American War of Independence|War of Independence]] Arianism showed itself in individual instances, and French influences were widespread in the direction of deism, though they were not organized into any definite utterance by religious bodies.

As early as the middle of the 18th century [[Harvard College]] represented the most advanced thought of the time,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and a score or more of clergymen in New England preached what was essentially Unitarianism. The most prominent of these men was [[Jonathan Mayhew]] (1720–1766), pastor of the West Church in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], from 1747 to 1766. He preached the strict unity of God, the subordinate nature of Christ, and salvation by character. [[Charles Chauncy (1705-1787)|Charles Chauncy]] (1705–1787), pastor of the First Church from 1727 until his death, the chief opponent of Edwards in the great revival, was both a Unitarian and a [[Universalist]]. Other Unitarians included [[Ebenezer Gay]] (1698–1787) of [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Samuel West]] (1730–1807) of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], [[Thomas Barnard]] (1748–1814) of [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], [[John Prince (Unitarian)|John Prince]] (1751–1836) and [[William Bentley]] (1758–1819) of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Aaron Bancroft]] (1755–1836) of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and several others.

The first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation was by [[King's Chapel]] in Boston, which settled [[James Freeman (clergyman)|James Freeman]] (1759–1835) in 1782, and revised the Prayer Book into a mild Unitarian liturgy in 1785.  The [[Rev. William Hazlitt]] (father of the essayist and critic), visiting the United States in 1783–1785, published the fact that there were Unitarians in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], Boston, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Hallowell, Maine|Hallowell]], on [[Cape Cod]], and elsewhere. Unitarian congregations were organized at [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and [[Saco, Maine|Saco]] in 1792 by [[Thomas Oxnard]]; in 1800 the [[First Church in Plymouth]]—the congregation founded by the Pilgrims in 1620—accepted the more liberal faith. [[Joseph Priestley]] emigrated to the United States in 1794, and organized a Unitarian Church at [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania]], the same year and one at [[First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] in 1796. His writings had a considerable influence.

Thus from 1725 to 1825, Unitarianism was gaining ground in New England, and to some extent elsewhere. The first distinctive manifestation of the change was the inauguration of [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] (1764–1845) as professor of divinity at Harvard College, in 1805.

In the same year appeared Unitarian books by [[John Sherman (clergyman)|John Sherman]] (1772–1828) and another in 1810 by [[Noah Worcester]] (1758–1837). At the opening of the 19th century, with one exception, all the churches of Boston were occupied by Unitarian preachers, and various periodicals and organizations expressed their opinions.  Churches were established in [[New York City]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Charleston, and elsewhere during this period.

====Formative period====

The next period of American Unitarianism, from about 1800 to about 1835, can be thought of as formative, mainly influenced by English philosophy, semi-supernatural, imperfectly rationalistic, devoted to philanthropy and practical Christianity.  Dr. Channing was its distinguished exponent.

The first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation in America was by [[King's Chapel]] in Boston, which settled [[James Freeman (clergyman)|James Freeman]] (1759–1853) in 1782, and revised the Prayer Book into a mild Unitarian liturgy in 1785. In 1800, [[Joseph Stevens Buckminster]] became minister of the [[Brattle Street Church]] in Boston, where his brilliant sermons, literary activities, and academic attention to the German "New Criticism" helped shape the subsequent growth of Unitarianism in New England. Unitarian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] (1764–1845) was appointed as the Hollis professor of divinity at Harvard College, in 1805. Harvard Divinity school then shifted from its conservative roots to teach Unitarian theology.&lt;ref name=Dorrien&gt;Gary J. Dorrien.

At first mystical rather than rationalistic in his theology, he took part with the "Catholic Christians", as they called themselves, who aimed at bringing Christianity into harmony with the progressive spirit of the time. His essays on ''The System of Exclusion and Denunciation in Religion'' (1815), and ''Objections to Unitarian Christianity Considered'' (1819), made him a defender of Unitarianism. His sermon on "Unitarian Christianity", preached at First Unitarian Church of Baltimore in 1819, at the ordination of [[Jared Sparks]], and that at New York in 1821, made him its interpreter.

The result of the "Unitarian Controversy" (1815)&lt;ref&gt;George Ellis ''A Half-century of the Unitarian Controversy'' Boston 1857&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/Heralds/George-Edward-Ellis.php George Edward Ellis (1814-1894). By Samuel J. Barrows. George Edward Ellis Courtesy of Andover-Harvard Theological Library, Harvard Divinity School]&lt;/ref&gt; was a growing division in the Congregational churches, which was emphasized in 1825 by the formation of the [[American Unitarian Association]] at Boston.  It was organized "to diffuse the knowledge and promote the interests of pure Christianity" and it published tracts and books, supported poor churches, sent out missionaries into every part of the country, and established new churches in nearly all the states. Essentially non-sectarian, with little missionary zeal, the Unitarian movement has grown slowly; and its influence has chiefly operated through general culture and the literature of the country.  Many of its clergymen have been trained in other denominations; but the [[Harvard Divinity School]] was distinctly Unitarian from its formation, in 1816, to 1870, when it became a non-sectarian department of the university.  The [[Meadville Lombard Theological School]] was founded at [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]] in 1844, and the [[Starr King School for the Ministry]] at [[Berkeley, California]] in 1904.

''The History of Essex Hall'', written in 1959 by Mortimer Rowe, the Secretary (i.e. chief executive) of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]] for its first twenty years, claims that the BFUA and AUA were founded entirely coincidentally on the same day, 26 May 1825.&lt;ref name="harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"By a happy coincidence, in those days of slow posts, no transatlantic telegraph, telephone or wireless, our American cousins, in complete ignorance as to the details of what was afoot, though moving towards a similar goal, founded the American Unitarian Association on precisely the same day - May 26, 1825."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence of Transcendentalism; reaction====

A third period (''see'' [[Transcendentalism]]), from about 1835 to about 1885, profoundly influenced by German [[idealism]], was increasingly rationalistic, though its theology was largely flavoured by [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany K. Wayne ''Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism'' 2006 p179&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction against this, the [[National Conference of Unitarian Churches|National Unitarian Conference]] was organized in 1865, and adopted a distinctly Christian platform, affirming that its members were "disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ".

The more rationalistic minority thereupon formed the [[Free Religious Association]], "to encourage the scientific study of theology and to increase fellowship in the spirit."  The Western Unitarian Conference later accepted the same position, and based its "fellowship on no dogmatic tests, but affirmed a desire "to establish truth, righteousness and love in the world." In addition, the WUC claimed belief in God was not a necessary component of Unitarian belief.

This period of controversy and of vigorous theological development practically came to an end soon after 1885. Its cessation was assured by the action of the national conference at [[Saratoga, New York]] in 1894, when it was affirmed by a nearly unanimous vote that: "These churches accept the religion of Jesus, holding, in accordance with his teaching, that practical religion is summed up in love to God and love to man.  The conference recognizes the fact that its constituency is Congregational in tradition and polity.  Therefore it declares that nothing in this constitution is to be construed as an authoritative test; and we cordially invite to our working fellowship any who, while differing from us in belief, are in general sympathy with our spirit and our practical aims."  The leaders of this period were [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] with his idealism and [[Theodore Parker]] with his acceptance of Christianity as absolute religion.

====Modern period====
{{main article|List of Unitarians, Universalists, and Unitarian Universalists}}

The fourth period, beginning about 1885, has been one of [[rationalism]], recognition of universal religion, large acceptance of the scientific method and ideas and an ethical attempt to realize what was perceived as to be the higher affirmations of Christianity. It has been marked by a general harmony and unity, by steady growth in the number of churches and by a widening fellowship with all other similarly minded movements.

This phase was shown in the organization of [[The International Council of Unitarian and other Liberal Religious Thinkers and Workers]] at Boston on 25 May 1900, "to open communication with those in all lands who are striving to unite pure religion and perfect liberty, and to increase fellowship and co-operation among them."  This council has held biennial sessions in London, Amsterdam, Geneva and Boston.  During the period after 1885 the influence of Emerson became predominant, modified by the more scientific preaching of [[Minot Judson Savage]], who found his guides in [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]].

Beyond its own borders the body obtained recognition through the public work of such men as [[Henry Whitney Bellows]] and [[Edward Everett Hale]], the remarkable influence of [[James Freeman Clarke]] and [[Thomas Lamb Eliot]], and the popular power of [[Robert Collyer]].  The number of Unitarian churches in the United States in 1909 was 461, with 541 ministers. The church membership then, really nominal, may be estimated at 100,000. The periodicals were ''The Christian Register'', weekly, Boston; ''Unity'', weekly, Chicago; ''The Unitarian'', monthly, New York; ''Old and New'', monthly, Des Moines; ''Pacific Unitarian'', San Francisco.

In 1961, the [[American Unitarian Association]] merged with the [[Universalist Church of America]], forming the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA).

Strictly speaking, modern-day [[Unitarian Universalism]] is not Unitarian in theology. Despite its name, this denomination does not necessarily promote either belief in One God or universal salvation. It is merely the inheritor of the Unitarian and Universalist church system in America. Though there are Unitarians within the UUA, there is no creed or doctrine that one must affirm to join a Unitarian Universalist congregation. This makes it very different from many other faith groups. Today, the majority of Unitarian Universalists do not identify themselves as Christians.&lt;ref name="eotd"&gt;See the results of a recent poll on theological self-identity among UUs in the [http://www.uua.org/documents/coa/engagingourtheodiversity.pdf Engaging Our Theological Diversity] report, pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus and the Bible are generally treated as exceptional sources of inspiration, along with the holy people and traditions around the world. Unitarian Universalists base their community on a set of [[Unitarian Universalism#Seven Principles and Purposes|Principles and Purposes]] rather than on a prophet or creed. Notable Unitarian Universalists include [[Tim Berners-Lee]] (founder of the World Wide Web), [[Pete Seeger]],  U. S. Congressman [[Pete Stark]], former U. S. Senator [[Mike Gravel]] and [[Christopher Reeve]].

The decline of specifically Christian theology in the Unitarian churches in the United States has prompted several revival movements. Unitarian Christians within the UUA formed, the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] (UUCF) in 1945, a fellowship within UUA just for Christians, who were gradually becoming a minority. Similarly, the [[American Unitarian Conference]] (AUC) was founded in 2000 with 4 congregations, but unlike the UUCF, the AUC remains outside the UUA. The AUC's mission is "renewal of the historic Unitarian faith", and promotes a set of God-centered religious principles, but like Unitarian Universalism, it does not impose a creed on its members.

Unitarians in America, because of the developments with the Unitarian churches, have generally taken one of three courses of action to find communities in which to worship God. Some have stayed within the Unitarian churches, accepting the non-Christian nature of their congregation, but have found their needs met in the UUCF. Some Unitarians, because they felt that the mainstream UUA churches are not accepting of Christians, or that the larger Unitarian Universalist organizations are becoming too political and [[Liberalism|liberal]] to be considered a religious movement or faith, have decided to affiliate with the [[American Unitarian Conference]]. Most Christian Unitarians have sought out liberal Christian churches in other denominations and have made homes there.&lt;ref&gt;According to a 2002 survey published by the Barna Group (http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=122), only 79% of Christians in the United States believe God is one being in three separate and equal persons—God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son and the Holy Spirit. According to the 2001 US Census, section 79 (https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/03statab/pop.pdf), 159,506,000 adults identify themselves as Christians. This would mean that, circa 2001-2002, 33,496,000 American Christians (21% of 159,506,000) were nontrinitarian, a number some ten times greater than the number of Christians in the UUA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Unitarianism arrived in Canada from Iceland and Britain. Some Canadian congregations had services in Icelandic into living memory. The first Unitarian service in Canada was held in 1832 by a minister from England, Rev, David Hughes, in a school owned by the Workman family, who were Unitarians from Belfast. The Montreal congregation, founded in 1842, called their first permanent minister, the Rev. John Cordner, of the [[Remonstrant Synod of Ulster]]; he arrived in 1843 and served as their minister for thirty-six years. Then in 1845, a [[First Unitarian Congregation of Toronto|congregation]] in Toronto was founded whose first minister, William Adam, was a Scottish Baptist missionary who had served in India. Then other congregations formed, Hamilton in 1889, Ottawa in 1898, the First Icelandic Unitarian Church in Winnipeg in 1891, a congregation in Vancouver in 1909 and a congregation in Victoria in 1910. Individual Canadian congregations had ties to the British association until they were disrupted by World War II, when relations to Unitarians in the United States became stronger.

[[Christian Universalism|Universalism]] found its way to Canada during the 19th century, for the most part, though not entirely, brought by settlers from the United States. The Universalist concepts of [[universal reconciliation]], a loving and forgiving God, and the brother/sisterhood of all people, were welcomed by those for whom the partialist view or predestination were no longer acceptable. Universalist congregations formed, with the exception of the congregation in Halifax in 1837, mostly in rural towns and villages in lower Quebec and the Maritimes, and in southern Ontario. Universalism in Canada followed a corresponding decline as in the United States, and today the three remaining congregations at Olinda, Ontario founded in 1880, North Hatley, Quebec founded in 1886, and Halifax, Nova Scotia have since the 1960s been part of the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] (CUC).

The CUC was formed on May 14, 1961, one day before the UUA in the United States, but the two functioned in close association until money exchange and other complications led to greater independence, with the CUC in 2002 assuming the direct delivery of services to Canadian congregations which was formerly delivered by the UUA. The UUA continues to provide ministerial settlement services to CUC member congregations.

The Unitarian Service Committee, established during World War II as an overseas emergency relief agency, began under the capable direction of [[Lotta Hitschmanova|Dr. Lotta Hitschmanova]] and initially supported largely by Unitarians, now continues as a separate agency called [[USC Canada]] which draws support throughout Canada for its humanitarian work in many parts of the world.

The first ordination of a Canadian Unitarian minister after the organizational separation of the CUC and the UUA was held at the First Unitarian Church of Victoria, British Columbia, in 2002. Rev. Brian Kiely, who was to give the ordination sermon, was told (partly in jest) he must define Canadian Unitarianism, as Rev. Channing had at that New England ordination sermon of 1819. The simile Rev. Kiely chose was that Canadian Unitarianism is like a doughnut, the richness is in the circle of fellowship, not a creedal centre.

==Modern period==

===20th century===
In 1928 the British and Foreign Unitarian Association merged with the Sunday School Association, with which it had been sharing offices for decades, as the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]]. The General Assembly is still the [[umbrella organisation]] for British Unitarianism, which has its headquarters, [[Essex Hall]], in the same place in [[central London]].

===21st century===
In May 2004 Rev. Peter Hughes, vice-chairman of the East Lancashire Unitarian Mission, and a minister at [[Chowbent Chapel]] founded in 1645 in [[Atherton, Greater Manchester]], published an article in the movement's journal, ''The Inquirer'', and gave an interview to ''[[The Times]]'' where he warned of the extinction of the Unitarian Church. According to ''The Times'', "the church has fewer than 6,000 members in Britain; half of whom are aged over 65." He added, referring to [[Toxteth Unitarian Chapel|Toxteth Chapel in Liverpool]], the movement's oldest building, where he was brought up, "they have had no minister since 1976 and the Unitarian cause there is effectively dead."  The denomination's president, Dawn Buckle, a retired lecturer in education, denied that the movement was in a terminal phase and described it as a "thriving community capable of sustaining growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Ruth | last = Gledhill | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article430872.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 | title = The end is nigh for Unitarians, minister warns | publisher = The Times | place = UK | date = 24 May 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 180 Unitarian congregations in Britain as part of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitarian.org.uk/index.shtml unitarian.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127173335/http://www.unitarian.org.uk/index.shtml |date=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entirely separate from the General Assembly, and generally with no historical descent from the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]] (1825–1928), there are a number of other denominations and small groups which look to earlier periods of Unitarianism as influences. This includes both groups looking back to the early [[Socinianism|Polish, Dutch and English "Socinians"]] of the 17th century such as the [[Church of God General Conference|Restoration Fellowship]] of [[Sir Anthony Buzzard, 3rd Baronet]], and those looking to the later "[[Biblical Unitarianism|biblical unitarianism]]" of [[Robert Spears (minister)|Robert Spears]]. Many of these groups are [[nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] in theology, liberal in some political areas - such as [[conscientious objection]], but fundamentalist in regard to the Bible, and conservative in areas such as homosexuality or women priests. Some of these groups however do have women ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitarianministries.com/unitarian_ministries_international Unitarian Ministries International]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently some religious groups have adopted the term "[[Biblical Unitarianism]]" to distinguish their theology from modern liberal Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggy, Dale, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/unitarianism.html'Unitarianism' (2009). ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitarianism's spread to other countries===

====Germany====
There are currently four separate groups of Unitarians in Germany:

:* The ''Unitarische Freie Religionsgemeinde'' (Unitarian Free Religious Community, then called German Catholics) was founded in 1845  in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitarier.net/ Willkommen bei www.unitarier.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The ''Religionsgemeinschaft Freier Protestanten'' ("Religious Community of Free Protestants") was formed in 1876  in Germany's [[Rheinhessen]] region. in 1911  their newspaper took on the subtitle "deutsch-unitarische Blätter" ("German Unitarian Gazette") as leader Rudolf Walbaum wanted to connect to [[American Unitarian Association|American Unitarians]]. After the Second World War, several groups with close ties to the Nazi Party and to the Nazi ideology started migrating to this group and occupying its decision-making organs.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kratz, ''Die Götter des New Age'' Berlin, 1994, chapter five&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitarier.at/Dur02.pdf Ali Gronner. ''Der lange Weg vom Unitas - Arier zum Unitarier - Bemerkungen zu den Deutschen Unitariern], pub Austrian Unitarian Universalist Forum website, 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the original "Free Protestants" then left the movement, which in 1950 changed itarias name to ''[[Deutsche Unitarier Religionsgemeinschaft]]'' ("German Unitarian Religious Community").{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The organization´s leaders and most of its members came from those Nazi groups and it was firmly anchored in the extreme far-right German scene well into the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} It is the only Unitarian group in Germany to belong to the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists|ICUU]]

:*The ''Unitarische Kirche in Berlin'' (Unitarian Church in Berlin) was founded by Hansgeorg Remus in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitarische-kirche-berlin.de Unitarische Kirche&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

:*The [http://www.uufrankfurt.de Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Frankfurt] is an international, English-speaking liberal religious community serving the Rhein-Main area. It is part of the [[European Unitarian Universalists]].

====Denmark====
In 1900 ''[[Unitarisk Kirkesamfund|Det fri Kirkesamfund]]'' (literally, The Free Congregation) was founded by a group of liberal Christians in [[Copenhagen]]. Since 1908, the church is outside the [[Church of Denmark|Folkekirke]] (the Danish Lutheran state church). In [[Aarhus]], another Unitarian congregation was founded at this time by the Norwegian Unitarian pastor and writer [[Kristofer Janson]] (1841–1917); it has since closed.
Often labeled and considered as a "pioneer" or "precursor" &lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ágúst H. Bjarnason, "Magnus Eiriksson, the first Icelandic Unitarian" (Lecture at Harvard Divinity School, 21 May 1923), handwritten manuscript, transcribed and edited by St. M. Jonasson, see: http://members.shaw.ca/icelandic-unitarians/My_Homepage_Files/Download/; Stephen H. Fritchman, ''Men of Liberty. Ten Unitarian Pioneers'', Boston 1944 [reprint: Whitefish, Montana: Kessinger Publishing (2007)], pp. 163-180; Thorvald Kierkegaard, ''Magnus Eiriksson og Mary B. Westenholz. To Forkæmpere for Unitarismen i Danmark'', Copenhagen 1958, pp. 3-9. See also Eiríkssons articles in the Swedish periodical ''Sanningssökaren'', which was published by the Unitarian association ''Sanningenssökarna'', e.g."Förnuftstro och kyrkolära. Bref från a gammal sanningsökare", in ''Sanningssökaren'' (1877), pp. 41-47.&lt;/ref&gt; (in a spiritual manner) to the Unitarian movement in Denmark was the Icelandic theologian [[Magnús Eiríksson]] (1806–1881), who lived in Copenhagen from 1831 until his death in 1881.

====Sweden====
Inspired by the writings of [[Theodore Parker]] the Swedish writer [[Klas Pontus Arnoldson]] founded in [[Gothenburg]] in 1871  the Unitarian association ''Sanningssökarna'' ("The Truth Seekers") – later also found in [[Stockholm]]. This association also published the periodical ''Sanningssökaren'' ("The Truth Seeker"). Two other Unitarian associations were founded in 1882 (one of them in [[Stockholm]]). In 1888  Unitarians asked the Swedish King for permission to establish yet another Unitarian association in Gothenburg but was turned down because Unitarianism was not regarded as a Christian religion. Later many Unitarians turned to theosophy. In 1974 members of The Religion and Culture Association in [[Malmö]] founded The Free Church of Sweden and Rev. Ragnar Emilsen would be its pastor (ordained 1987 to Unitarian minister for Sweden and Finland and later the first to become Unitarian bishop of Scandinavia, he died February 2008). In 1999 the church changed its name to [http://sverige.unitarforbundet.org The Unitarian Church in Sweden].

====Norway====
In 1892  and 1893  the Norwegian Unitarian ministers [[Hans Tambs Lyche]] and [[Kristofer Janson]] returned from America and at once started independently of each other to introduce Unitarianism. In 1894  Tambs Lyche failed to organize a Unitarian Church in [[Oslo]] (then Kristiania) but managed to publish Norway's first Unitarian periodical (Free Words). In January 1895  Kristofer Janson founded The Church of Brotherhood in Oslo which was to be the first Unitarian church – where he stayed as the congregation's pastor only for 3 years. In 1904 [[Herman Haugerud]] was to return to Norway from America and to become the last Unitarian pastor to The Unitarian Society (which The Church of Brotherhood now was renamed). Pastor Haugerud died in 1937  and the Unitarian church ceased to exist shortly thereafter. Between 1986  and 2003  different Unitarian groups were active in Oslo. In 2004  these merged into The Unitarian Association which registered as religious society according to Norwegian law on 20 April 2005  under the name The Unitarian Association (The Norwegian Unitarian Church). Later "Bét Dávid" has been added to the name: The Bét Dávid Unitarian Association (The Norwegian Unitarian Church).&lt;ref&gt;http://unitarforbundet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The church is akin to both [[Transylvanian]] Unitarianism and [[Judaism]], hence the name ''bét'' referring to the Hebrew word for "house" and ''Dávid'' which is the name of the first Transylvanian Unitarian bishop [[Dávid Ferenc]] (1510–1579). In 2006  this church was associated with the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]] (ICUU). Since 2007 there is also a Unitarian Universalist Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;http://unitar.no {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223021848/http://unitar.no/ |date=23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; independent of The Norwegian Unitarian Church. This fellowship is located in the Oslo area.

====Spain====
Although the pioneer and first martyr of European Unitarianism was a Spaniard,
[[Michael Servetus]], the Spanish [[Inquisition]] and the religious hegemony of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] over both the State and the Spanish society, blocked for centuries any possibility of developing a Unitarian Church in Spain.

This situation began to change in the 19th century. A liberal Spanish writer and former priest, [[Joseph Blanco White|José María Blanco-White]], became a Unitarian during his exile in England and remained so until the end of his life (1841). At the end of the century, a group of liberal Spanish intellectuals and reformers, the Krausistas (who received this name for being followers of German idealist philosopher [[Karl Krause]]), were admirers of American Unitarian leaders [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Theodore Parker]], and wished that natural religion and religious rationalism were more present in Spain, although they did not create any liberal church to push that process forward.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) put an end to any expectations of change and liberal developments in Spain for several decades. After the death of dictator Francisco Franco and the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, religious freedom was finally established in Spain (although still with many restrictions in actual practice). In 2000, the [[Sociedad Unitaria Universalista de España]] (SUUE) was founded in Barcelona, and in 2001 it became a member of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU). In ''2005'' it changed its name to the Unitarian Universalist ''Religious'' Society of Spain in order to achieve legal status as a religious organization under the Spanish law on Religious Freedom, but the application was also rejected.

==Plot==
A naive monk, Brother Ambrose (Feldman), is sent by the abbot on a mission to raise $5000 in order to save their [[monastery]] from closing. He goes to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] where he encounters a number of eccentric characters. He is at first robbed and later befriended by con artist Dr. Sebastian Melmoth (Boyle), and meets a prostitute named Mary (Lasser) who lets him stay at her apartment. Mary grows to care for Ambrose and seduces him while he is taking a cold shower to try to alleviate his lustful thoughts about her. While he is in Hollywood, he visits several churches including a service at the Church of Divine Profit, performed by the [[televangelist]] Armageddon T. Thunderbird (Kaufman) in which he sees the focus of the sermon being a request for money in exchange for salvation. Ambrose is angered by this message and tries to meet a number of times with Thunderbird, being ejected each time. 

Dr. Melmoth and Ambrose travel the city in a modified school bus, in which they hold church services for donations. During one service, the brakes of the bus release and the bus rolls downhill into a river. The passengers escape safely in the river and are shown on the local news being [[Baptism|baptized]] by the pair, which catches Thunderbird's attention. He prays to G. O. D. for guidance and it tells him to work with Ambrose to make more money because Ambrose is an innocent and has a clean image. 

Thunderbird has his minions kidnap Ambrose and bring him to his office where he outlines a plan for his own brand of church on wheels. He says he will pay Ambrose the $5000 the monastery needs if he assists him. While they are talking, Thunderbird mentions that G. O. D. ([[Richard Pryor]]) audibly talks to him when he prays to him and Ambrose is surprised because he himself has never heard from God in this way. Ambrose agrees to work with Thunderbird and they go across the country from town to town holding services in their own bus. 

One day at Thunderbird's headquarters, Ambrose overhears Thunderbird praying to G. O. D. in his private chamber and when he hears G. O. D. speak back to him, he is intrigued. When Thunderbird leaves, he sneaks into the chamber and discovers that G. O. D. (General Organizational Directivatator) is a sophisticated master computer, linked to all of Thunderbird's finances and operations. He talks with G. O. D. and reads the Bible to it, giving it morality and a conscience. G. O. D. decides to give all of Thunderbird's money away and tells Ambrose what to do to accomplish this, which results in bags of money being poured out of the office's window. Thunderbird discovers someone has been interfering with the computer and rushes back to headquarters where he tries to capture Ambrose and destroys the computer. Ambrose grabs the paid monastery mortgage certificate from Thunderbird's office and escapes in a chase through the city. 

While Mary and Dr. Melmoth look for Ambrose during his escape, she learns that Melmoth is her father that left her family when she was a child, due to a distinctive tattoo she sees on his leg. They eventually find Ambrose and rescue him from the people chasing him.

Ambrose goes back to the monastery and gives the abbot the mortgage certificate, then leaves and marries Mary, who is pregnant from their single night together. The end titles show Melmoth's bus traveling down the road, saying they "all lived happily hereafter".

'''Intercession''' or '''intercessory prayer''' is the act of [[Prayer|praying]] to a deity on behalf of others. In [[Western Christianity]], intercession forms a distinct form of prayer, alongside [[Adoration]], [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] and [[Thanksgiving]].

The [[Apostle Paul]]'s exhortation to [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] specified that intercession prayers can be made for those in authority.
{{quote|I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.|{{bibleref2|1 Timothy|2:1–2|NIV}}}}

==Christianity==

===In the early Church===
The early Christians continued to practice intercessory prayer on behalf of others after Jesus' death. St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] was one man who exhorted Christians to continue to pray for others, and especially for those who became [[Docetism|Docetists]] or held other [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Jr. Massey Hamilton. "Smyrna in the Ignatian Letters: A Study in Church Order". ''The Journal of Religion'' 20.2 (1940): 151. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Letter to the Smyrnaeans|letter to the churches of Smyrna]], St. Ignatius exhorts the Christians there to pray for other people: "only you must pray to God for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power of [effecting] this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Epistle to the Smyrnaeans (St. Ignatius)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout all of Ignatius's letters, the word for prayers of intercession appear nineteen times, and Ignatius asks for prayer "for himself (eight times), for the Christian church in [[Syria]] (seven times), for persecutors, heretics, and all people generally (once each)".&lt;ref&gt;"Smyrna in the Ignatian Letters: A Study in Church Order". ''The Journal of Religion'' 20.2 (1940): 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Ignatius and the other church fathers, such as [[Paul the Apostle]], who were keen on intercessory prayer based this practice on Jesus' own teachings which required that one pray for others, especially one's enemies:

{{quote|But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.|{{bibleref2|Luke|6:27–28}}}}

According to Lionel Swain, of [[St. Edmund's College, Ware]], St. Paul believed intercession to be one of the most important aspects of faith and praying life, as praying for others as a recurring theme in his works.&lt;ref&gt;John Greehy, John Quinlan, Lionel Swain and S. Purcell. "Homiletic Notes", 17 ''The Furrow'' Vol. 19, No. 11, Supplement: The Bible, No. 6 (Autumn, 1968), pp. 14–19&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer acts as a way for St. Paul to acknowledge God's power. Intercessory prayer also acts as a way for the Apostle to "share in&amp;nbsp;... the Father's redemptive love".&lt;ref name="Homiletic Notes 17"&gt;"Homiletic Notes" 17&lt;/ref&gt; Paul believed that prayer transformed the person doing the praying, as much as the one being prayed for, which creates a stronger bond between him and God.&lt;ref name="Homiletic Notes 17"/&gt;

Prof. Dr Johannes van Oort, Professor Extraordinarius in the Department of Church History and Church Polity of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Pretoria, South Africa adds that, in addition to praying for wisdom, the early church was very much involved with different [[charisma]]s, one of which being healing. Praying for other people's illnesses was another way that intercessory prayer was important in the early church, as healing was a sign of "the power of God's Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;van Oort, Johannes. "The Holy Spirit and the Early Church: The Experience of the Spirit". ''Hervormde Teologiese Studies'' 68.1 (2012): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; This gift of healing is specifically mentioned, among the other charismata, as a sign of being a true Christian by [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] in his text, ''Against Heresies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103232.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Against Heresies, II.32 (St. Irenaeus)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saints===
[[Intercession of saints|Intercession of the saints]] is a [[doctrine]] held by the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Churches that [[saints]] may be asked to intercede (or [[Christian prayer|pray]]) for others. The doctrine of requesting intercession from saints can be found in Christian writings from the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/invocationofsaints.aspx|title=On the Intercession and Invocation of the Saints|work=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 4th-century [[Apostles' Creed]] states belief in the [[communion of saints]] which certain Christian churches interpret as supporting the intercession of saints. Following the stream of Judaic-Christian tradition, [[Judaism]] allows for the petition of the saints.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In Lutheran teachings all believers are saints, but prayer to saints who have been transferred to the [[Church Triumphant]] is forbidden.

===The dead===
{{main article|Prayer for the dead}}
In addition to praying for each other in life, early Christians would pray for those who had died.&lt;ref&gt;G. F. Hamilton. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30067646 Prayers of the Ancient Church for the Faithful Departed]".
''The Irish Church Quarterly'' 
Vol. 9, No. 35 (July 1916) , pp. 201&lt;/ref&gt; There is no unequivocal evidence that Christians began to pray for the dead before the third century AD.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 203"&gt;Hamilton 203&lt;/ref&gt; G. F. Hamilton argues that the earliest example of Church prayer on behalf of dead Christians are found in the [[Sacramentary of Serapion of Thmuis]] (350 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 209&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than pray for the departed in regular church services on Sunday, these early Christians would hold special commemorative occasions during the week. There was a sharp distinction drawn between remembering and praying on behalf of the dead, and those who were the {{"'}}faithfully' departed",&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 202&lt;/ref&gt; where Christians would only pray for those who had died as believers. The [[First Epistle of Clement]] (95 AD) contains a prayer, while mainly for protection for the living, also includes the dead.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 203"/&gt; Even quite early, a distinction was drawn between those who had died as Christians, and those who had died as unbelievers. In the ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' (155 AD), Polycarp is killed and his bones are taken by fellow Christians and a [[shrine]] is set up to him, where they may remember his [[martyrdom]].&lt;ref name="Hamilton 203"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/martyrdompolycarp-hoole.html|title=The Martyrdom of Polycarp (Hoole translation)|author=|date=|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the "[[Apology of Aristides]]" shows how those who were not Christians were grieved for, while the dead faithful were rejoiced over.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/aristides-kay.html|title=The Apology of Aristides the Philosopher|author=|date=|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article| Shafa'ah|Tawassul}}

Although the idea of intercession or mediation (Arabic: ''s̲h̲afāʿa'') has historically played a very prominent role in Islamic thought,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wensinck, A.J., Gimaret, D. and Schimmel, Annemarie, “S̲h̲afāʿa”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not universally accepted by all Muslims in the present day.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Quran]] says that the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arab]] [[pagan]] [[god]]s will not be able to intercede with God on behalf of humankind,&lt;ref&gt;See Quran 19:87, 36:23&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the guilty" (''al-mujrimīn'', 74:41) will not benefit from any intercession on the [[Day of Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;See 74:48&lt;/ref&gt; However, "intercession is mentioned in the Qurʾān with respect to angels praying for the believers and the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] praying for erring but repentant Muslims."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Hoffman, Valerie J., “Intercession”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān'', General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it became an orthodox Islamic doctrine or "cardinal belief"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; that "Muḥammad will intercede for all Muslims on the [[Day of Resurrection]]."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; While this particular tenet practically remained unchallenged throughout Islamic history, the widespread [[Shia]] practice of asking deceased [[saints#Islam|saints]] for intercession by praying at their tombs have become contentious issues in the modern Islamic world, with all these different types of intercession often being labelled by Sunni, [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] Muslims as a type of polytheism,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; in a manner akin to the attitude of many [[Protestant]]s towards the [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] practice of saint-intercession.
In prophetic sayings there is intercession of martyrs for "seventy relatives" in the Hereafter. http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1318

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">'''Juan de Celaya''' (Valencia, c.1490 - 6 December 1558) was a Spanish mathematician, physicist, cosmologist, philosopher and theologian. He was a member of the so-called Calculators, using ideas from [[Merton College]]. He is known for his work on motion (in [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] and [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) and in [[logic]].

==Life==
The son of a minor gentleman who participated in the Reconquest of [[Granada]], he probably studied at the [[University of Valencia]], ending his studies in 1509 at the [[Collège de Montaigu]] , Paris. During his studies he was a student of the [[Nominalism|Nominalist]] [[Jean Gaspar Lax]] and of [[Dullaert of Ghent]], who exerted considerable influence on the ideas and works Celaya would write.

He taught [[Physics]] and [[Logic]] in the [[College of Coqueret]] from 1510 to 1515, along with [[Alvaro Thomaz]] (who was interested in physics, in particular in the study of dynamics) and the Scot [[Robert Caubraith]]. From 1515 to 1524 he taught at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]]. Among his students were Francisco de Vitoria, [[Francisco de Soto]] (who later changed its name to Domingo de Soto) and [[Juan Ribeyro]].

He continued his theological studies, graduating on March 24, 1522 and achieving his doctorate on 21 June 1522. In 1524 he returned to his native city, and a year later became Principal and Professor of Theology at the [[University of Valencia]], where he played an important role in the reforming the structure of studies.

==Works==
During his time in France, Celaya was a prolific writer, dealing mainly with the physics of [[Aristotle]], in particular the study of [[Motion (physics)|motion]]. He also published numerous works on philosophy and logic. He was one of the main promoters of [[Nominalism|nominalist logic]] and the [[Oxford Calculators]] ideas about [[Dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]] and [[Kinematics]].

Some of his most important works are:
* ''Expositio in primum tractatum Summularum magistri Petri Hispani'', (1515).
* ''Expositio in octo libros phisicorum Aristotelis'', (1517).
* ''Libros Physicorum Aristotelis cum quaestionibus eiusdem, secundum, triplicem viam Thomae, Realium et nominalium''. This is a reprint in one volume of four previous works, published between 1525 and 1531.
* ''In libros Aristotelis de generationes et corruptiones''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7762">'''Khutu''' was the name given to a material used by [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval]] [[Islam]]ic [[Bladesmith|cutlers]] for knife handles. The ultimate source of the material has been a matter of conjecture for more than a thousand years; Islamic [[polymath]] [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] was among the first to investigate it and debate about the material—especially its source—continues to this day. The hypothesized sources for the material have included [[narwhal]], [[Walrus ivory|walrus]], and [[mammoth]] ivory, the [[frontal bone]]s of bulls, goats, and birds, the teeth of snakes, fish, and [[hippopotamus]]es, and the root of a tree.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; The most recent investigation, by [[natural history|natural historian]] Chris Lavers, has pointed to the frontal [[wikt:boss#Noun|boss]] of the horns of the [[muskox]].

Khutu has been ascribed properties other than those of a work material.  It was, for example, described as an [[wikt:alexipharmic|alexipharmic]]—a property that eventually was attached to [[Unicorn#Alicorn|alicorn]], the supposed horn of the [[unicorn]].

==Medieval scholarship==

===Abu Rayhan Biruni===
Islamic polymath [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] (973–1048) was among the first to investigate khutu, which he referred to as ''al-chutww''. He described it as being from the land of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgiz]] in the northern part of the Turkish territory and mentioned that it was in great demand in Egypt. He noted that the material came in a variety of colours, with yellowish-green being best, followed by those coloured [[camphor]], [[white]], "like the sun", and dark grey.&lt;ref name="Laufer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laufer |first1=Berthold |last2=Pelliot |first2=Paul |year=1913 |title=Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory |journal=T'oung Pao (second series) |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=315–370 |doi=10.1163/156853213x00213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned the beliefs that the material came from the forehead of the [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] (an enormous bird from Arabic and Persian myths which was said to carry off and eat elephants) or the forehead of a hippopotamus, but did not seem to attach much weight to these ideas, noting that it was much more similar to the frontal bone of a bull or goat.&lt;ref name="Lavers"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Natural History of Unicorns |last=Lavers |first=Chris |year=2009 |publisher=William Morris |location=USA |isbn=978-0-06-087414-8 |pages=112–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "It originates from an animal; it is much in demand, and preserved in the treasuries among the Chinese who assert that it is a desirable article because the approach of poison causes it to exude."&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

In another work he described it as "bigger than the hand in size"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and "thicker than two fingers"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and mentioned that "Amir Abu Ja'far bin Banu has a large box-like case made of long and broad khutu planks."&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; Because the material gave off a fishy smell when burned, he felt that it was probably a marine creature of some kind, but he specifically noted an instance where someone was able to pass off walrus ivory for proper khutu, strongly implying that the two materials were distinct – at least to him.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Lavers: "A Khwarazmian happened to find a tooth which was very white on the sides... the natural patterns described upon it were very thin, white and pale. It resembled the down of a cucumber if peeled in such a manner that the seed grains are also cut off. This Khwarazmain carried it to [Mecca], passed it off as the khutu and sold it at a high price to the Egyptians." As Lavers points out, this description could only refer to the osteodentine portion of walrus ivory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn al-Husayn Kashgari===
Writing shortly after al-Biruni, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Kashgari]] mentioned khutu in his work ''Diwan Lughat at-Turk'' (c. 1075): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Horn of a sea fish imported from China. It is (also) said that it is the root of a tree. It is used for knife handles. The presence of poison in food is put to the test by it because when broth or other dishes in the bowl are stirred with it the food cooks without fire (if poison is present in it), or if the horn is placed on a bowl it (the horn) sweats without steam."&lt;ref name="Dankoff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dankoff |first1=Robert |year=1973 |title=A Note on khutu and chatuq |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=542–543 |url= |doi=10.2307/600173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ibn al-Akfani===
The next investigation of khutu was by [[Ibn al-Akfani]] (1286–ca. 1348-49&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4274/ |title = The Selection of Treasures Regarding Precious Stones |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1700–1800 |accessdate = 2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who called the material ''chartut''. Although he cited al-Biruni's earlier work, he disagreed with a number of Al-Biruni's conclusions. For example, he favoured the theory that khutu came from the forehead of a large bird. He also offered a slightly different spectrum of possible colours for khutu (yellow, red, [[apricot (color)|apricot]], dust, black), though he did agree that the quality of the material varied with the colour.&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

==Modern scholarship==

===Berthold Laufer===
The era of modern scholarship on the identity of khutu began with the work of the [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Berthold Laufer]]. The first paper was titled "Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" and published in the journal ''T'oung Pao'' in 1913. Laufer provided a brief overview of the medieval scholarship and provided detailed information regarding the trade of narwhal and walrus ivory on the basis that khutu referred to one or both of those items. A second paper, titled "Supplementary Notes on Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" was published in 1916 in the same journal and provided some corrections and clarifications of his earlier work.

===Richard Ettinghausen===
While Laufer had detailed the Chinese end of the narwhal and walrus [[ivory trade]], Richard Ettinghausen focused on the Arabic side. Like Laufer, he felt that khutu was probably walrus ivory, with perhaps some samples being narwhal ivory.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt;

===Chris Lavers===
The most recent work on khutu has been done by [[Chris Lavers]]. In contrast to the early 20th century scholars, Lavers does not believe khutu to have been either walrus or narwhal ivory, but rather the frontal bone and associated horn material of the [[muskox]], with some specimens perhaps coming from mammoth ivory. His primary evidence for this was the work of al-Biruni, particularly where he mentions that knowledgeable people could differentiate walrus ivory from proper khutu (a fact that Laufer could not have known in his earlier work, as the al-Biruni text mentioning it had not yet been translated).&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; In ''The Natural History of Unicorns'' he acknowledges that Asian muskoxen were supposed to have become extinct about a thousand years before al-Biruni's investigations (see [[Muskox#Habitat and range|muskox]] for information regarding their extinction and reintroduction), but points out that there could well have been an isolated [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] of muskoxen existing in Asia until more modern times, that it was possible that there was trade in material goods between Asian arctic and North American arctic peoples, and also that frozen or fossilized muskoxen material could have been harvested in the same way that mammoth ivory was.

{{Kehuna and Kohanim}}
{{Judaism}}

'''Kohen''' or '''cohen''' (or ''kohein''; {{lang-he-n|כֹּהֵן}} ''kohén'', "priest", pl. {{Hebrew|כֹּהֲנִים}} ''kohaním'', "priests") is the Hebrew word for "[[priest]]", used in reference to the [[Aaron]]ic [[Priest#Judaism|priesthood]]. [[Levite|Levitical]] priests or ''kohanim'' are traditionally believed and [[halakha|halakhically]] required to be of direct [[Patrilineality|patrilineal descent]] from the [[Bible|biblical]] [[Aaron]] (also ''Aharon''), brother of Moses.

During the existence of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], ''kohanim'' performed the daily and holiday ([[Jewish holidays|Yom Tov]]) duties of [[korban|sacrificial offerings]]. Today, ''kohanim'' retain a lesser though distinct status within [[Rabbinic]] and [[Karaite Judaism]], and are bound by additional restrictions according to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Judaism.

In the [[Samaritan]] community, the kohanim have remained the primary religious leaders. [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jewish]] religious leaders are sometimes called [[kahen]], a form of the same word, but the position is not hereditary and their duties are more like those of rabbis than kohanim in most Jewish communities.

== Meaning and etymology ==
The [[noun]] ''kohen'' is used in the [[Torah]] to refer to [[priest]]s, whether Jewish or pagan, such as the ''kohanim'' ("priests") of [[Baal]] ([[2 Kings]] 10:19) or [[Dagon]], though Christian priests are referred to in Hebrew by the term ''komer'' ({{Hebrew|כומר}}). ''Kohanim'' can also refer to the Jewish nation as a whole, as in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:6, part of the [[Yitro (parsha)|Parshath Yithro]], where the whole of Israel is addressed as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation". The word derives from a [[Semitic root]] common at least to the [[Central Semitic languages]]; the [[cognate]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|كاهن|rtl=yes}} ''kāhin'' means "[[soothsayer (disambiguation)|soothsayer]], [[augur]]", or "[[priest]]".

Translations in the paraphrase of the Aramaic [[Targum]]ic interpretations include "friend" in [[Targum Yonathan]] to [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 10:11, "master" in Targum to [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 7:10, and "minister" in [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mechilta]] to [[Yitro (parsha)|Parshah Jethro]] (Exodus 18:1–20:23). As a starkly different translation the title "worker" (Rashi on Exodus 29:30) and "servant" (Targum to [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 48:7), have been offered as a translation as well.

== Biblical origins ==
{{main|Priesthood (Ancient Israel)}}
The status of priest ''kohen'' was conferred on [[Aaron]], the brother of Moses, and his sons as an everlasting [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]]&lt;ref&gt;In Hebrew: "ברית כהונת עולם"{{bibleverse||Exodus|28:1–4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[covenant of salt]]. During the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and until the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]] was built in [[Jerusalem]], the priests performed their priestly service in the portable [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]]. ({{bibleverse||Numbers|1:47–54|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|3:5–13|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|3:44–51|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|8:5–26|HE}}) Their duties involved offering the daily and [[Jewish holiday]] [[Korban|sacrifices]], and blessing the people in a [[Priestly Blessing]], later also known as ''Nesiat Kapayim'' ("Raising of the hands").

In a broader sense, since Aaron was a descendant of the [[Tribe of Levi]], priests are sometimes included in the term ''[[Levite]]s'', by direct patrilineal descent. However, not all Levites are priests.

When the Temple existed, most sacrifices and offerings could only be conducted by priests. Non-priest Levites (i.e. all those who descended from [[Levi]], the son of Jacob, but not from Aaron) performed a variety of other Temple roles, including [[Shechita|ritual slaughter of animals]], song service by use of voice and musical instruments, and various tasks in assisting the priests in performing their service.

=== Torah law ===
{{main|Torah Laws}}
The Torah mentions [[Melchizedek]] king of Salem, identified by [[Rashi]] as being [[Shem]] the son of [[Noah]], as a "priest" ''kohen'' to El Elyon (the supreme God) {{bibleverse||Genesis|14:18|HE}}. The second is Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, then Jethro, priest of Midian both [[pagan]] priests of their era.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. prior to Jethro's conversion to judaism -Rashi, [[Parshath Yithro]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Esau]] sold the birthright of the first born to [[Jacob]], Rashi explains that the priesthood was sold along with it, because by right the priesthood belongs to the first-born. Only when the first-born (along with the rest of Israel) sinned in the incident of the [[golden calf]], the priesthood was given to the Tribe of Levi, which had not been tainted by this incident.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Moses was supposed to receive the priesthood along with the leadership of the Jewish people, but when he argued with God that he should not be the leader, God then chose Aaron as the recipient of the priesthood.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Aaron received the priesthood along with his children and any descendants that would be born subsequently. However, his grandson [[Phinehas]] had already been born, and did not receive the priesthood until he killed the prince of the [[Tribe of Simeon]] and the princess of the [[Midianite]]s ({{bibleverse||Numbers|25:7–13|HE}}). Thereafter, the priesthood has remained with the descendants of Aaron.

===Vestments===
{{See also|Biblical clothing}}
&lt;!--[[Image:LEV 8- High priest in robes and breastplate.jpg|thumb|The high priest in his golden garments (the chain [[censer]] depicted is anachronistic).]]
[[Image:Kohenbreastplate.jpg|thumb|The [[priestly breastplate]] of the high priest.]]--&gt;

The [[Torah]] provides for specific vestments to be worn by the priests when they are ministering in the [[Tabernacle]]: "And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for dignity and for beauty" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:2|HE}}).  These garments are described in detail in {{bibleverse||Exodus|28|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|39|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|8|HE}}. The high priest wore eight holy garments (''bigdei kodesh''). Of these, four were of the same type worn by all priests, and four were unique to the Kohen Gadol.

Those vestments which were common to all priests, were:
* [[Priestly undergarments]] (Hebrew ''michnasayim'') (breeches): [[linen]] pants reaching from the waist to the knees "to cover their nakedness" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:42|HE}})
* [[Priestly tunic]] (Hebrew ''ketonet'') ([[tunic]]): made of pure linen, covering the entire body from the neck to the feet, with sleeves reaching to the wrists. That of the high priest was embroidered ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:39|HE}}); those of the priests were plain ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:40|HE}}).
* [[Priestly sash]] (Hebrew ''avnet'') (sash): that of the high priest was of fine linen with "[[embroidery|embroidered work]]" in blue and purple and scarlet ({{bibleverse||Exodus|28:39|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|39:29|HE}}); those worn by the priests were of white, twined linen.
* [[Priestly turban]] (Hebrew ''mitznefet''): that of the high priest was much larger than that of the priests and wound so that it formed a broad, flat-topped turban; that for priests was wound so that it formed a cone-shaped turban, called a ''migbahat''.

The vestments that were unique to the high priest were:
* [[Priestly robe (Judaism)|Priestly robe]] (''me'il'') ("robe of the ephod"): a sleeveless, blue robe, the lower hem of which was fringed with small golden bells alternating with [[pomegranate]]-shaped tassels in blue, purple, and scarlet—[[tekhelet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekhelet.com|title=Ptil Tekhelet Foundation|work=Ptil Tekhelet Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; argaman, tolaat shani.
* [[Ephod]]: a richly embroidered vest or apron with two [[onyx]] [[engraved gem]]stones on the shoulders, on which were engraved the names of the tribes of Israel
* [[Priestly breastplate]] (Hebrew ''hoshen''): with twelve gems, each engraved with the name of one of the tribes; a pouch in which he probably carried the [[Urim and Thummim]]. It was fastened to the Ephod
* On the front of the turban was a [[tzitz|golden plate]] inscribed with the words: "Holiness unto [[YHWH]]" attached to the mitznefet.

The high priest, like all priests, would minister barefoot when he was serving in the Temple. Like all of the priests, he had to immerse himself in the [[mikvah|ritual bath]] before vesting and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The [[Talmud]] teaches that neither the kohanim nor the Kohen Gadol were fit to minister unless they wore their priestly vestments: "While they are clothed in the priestly garments, they are clothed in the priesthood; but when they are not wearing the garments, the priesthood is not upon them" (B.Zevachim 17:B). It is further taught that just as the [[korbanot|sacrifices]] facilitate an [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] for [[sin]], so do the priestly garments (B.Zevachim 88b). The high priest had two sets of holy garments: the "golden garments" detailed above, and a set of white "linen garments" (''bigdei ha-bad'') which he wore only on [[Yom Kippur|the Day of Atonement]] (Yom Kippur) ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:4|HE}}).  On that day, he would change his holy garments four times, beginning in the golden garments but changing into the Linen Garments for the two moments when he would enter the [[Holy of Holies]] (the first time to offer the blood of atonement and the incense, and the second time to retrieve the censer), and then change back again into the golden garments{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} after each time.  He would immerse in the ritual bath before each change of garments, washing his hands and his feet after removing the garments and again before putting the other set on. The linen garments were only four in number, those corresponding to the garments worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year.

=== High Priest ===
{{Main|High Priest of Israel}}
In every generation when the Temple was standing, one kohen would be singled out to perform the functions of the High Priest (Hebrew ''kohen gadol''). His primary task was the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] service. Another unique task of the high priest was the offering of a daily meal sacrifice; he also held the prerogative to supersede any priest and offer any offering he chose. Although the [[Torah]] retains a procedure to select a High Priest when needed, in the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, there is no High Priest in Judaism today.

=== Twenty-four kohanic divisions ===
{{Main|Priestly divisions}}
[[David|King David]] assigned each of the 24 priestly clans to a weekly watch (Heb. משמרת, ''mishmeret'') during which its members were responsible for maintaining the schedule of offerings at the Temple in Jerusalem, in accordance with {{bibleverse||1Chronicles|24:3–5|HE}}. Prior to that time, the priestly courses numbered a mere eight. This newly instated a cycle of priestly courses, or [[priestly divisions]], which repeated itself roughly twice each year.

&lt;!--The first 4 sentences of this paragraph have been slightly modified to reflect wording, links and 'Citation needed' comments from the almost identical paragraph that I removed from earlier in the article under 'Biblical origins'--&gt;When the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple|Second]] Temples were built, the priests of Aaron’s lineage assumed these roles in the Temple in Jerusalem. Each of the 24 groups consisted of six priestly families, with each of the six serving one day of the week. On the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] day, all six worked in tandem. According to later rabbinical interpretation, these 24 groups changed every Sabbath at the completion of the [[Mussaf]] service.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. However, on the biblical festivals all 24 were present in the Temple for duty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

According to the Jerusalem Talmud (Ta‘anith 4:2 / 20a): “Four wards came up out of exile: Yedaiah, Harim, Pašḥūr and Immer. The prophets among them had made a stipulation with them, namely, that even if Jehoiariv should come up out of exile, the officiating ward that serves in the Temple at that time should not be rejected on his account, but rather, he is to become secondary unto them.”

== Destruction of the Second Temple ==
Following the Temple's destruction at the end of the [[First Jewish Revolt]] and the displacement to the [[Galilee]] of the bulk of the remaining Jewish population in [[Judea]] at the end of the [[Bar Kochva]] Revolt, Jewish tradition in the [[Talmud]] and poems from the period record that the descendants of each priestly watch established a separate residential seat in towns and villages of the Galilee, and maintained this residential pattern for at least several centuries in anticipation of the reconstruction of the Temple and reinstitution of the cycle of priestly courses. Specifically, this kohanic settlement region stretched from the [[Beit Netofa Valley]], through the [[Nazareth]] region to [[Arbel]] and the vicinity of [[Tiberias]]. In subsequent years, there was a custom of publicly recalling every Sabbath in the synagogues the courses of the priests, a practice that reinforced the prestige of the priests' lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bonfil, ''Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures'', Brill: Leiden 2012, p. 42 {{ISBN|9789004203556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Yosef Tobi, describing a stone inscription found in Yemen and which contains a partial list of the names (in Hebrew) of the twenty-four priestly courses and their places of residence, writes:&lt;ref&gt;"Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies," 43 (2013): British Museum, London; Article, "The Jews of Yemen in light of the excavation of the Jewish synagogue in Qanī’," p. 351, by Yosef Tobi.&lt;/ref&gt; "As for the probable strong spiritual attachment held by the Jews of Ḥimyar for the Land of Israel, this is also attested to by an inscription bearing the names of the ''miśmarōṯ'' (priestly wards), which was initially discovered in September 1970 by [[Walter W. Müller|W. Müller]] and then, independently, by P. Grjaznevitch within a mosque in Bayt al-Ḥāḍir, a village situated near Tan‘im, east of Ṣanʻā’. This inscription has been published by several European scholars, but the seminal study was carried out by [[Ephraim Urbach|E.E. Urbach]] (1973), one of the most important scholars of rabbinic literature in the previous generation.&lt;ref&gt;Ephraim E. Urbach, ''Mishmarot u-maʻamadot'', Tarbiz (A Quarterly for Jewish Studies) 42, Jerusalem 1973, pp. 304 – 327 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the priestly wards were seen as one of the most distinctive elements in the collective memory of the Jewish people as a nation during the period of Roman and Byzantine rule in the Land of Israel following the destruction of the Second Temple, insofar as they came to symbolize Jewish worship within the Land.”

It is now uncertain when this stone inscription was first engraved, but certainly it dates back to a time near the Second Temple’s destruction. The complete list of sacerdotal names would normally have included twenty-four priestly wards. However, today, the stone inscription contains only a partial list of their names, with their former places of residence – beginning from the fourth ward, and ending with the fourteenth ward. This was because the stone had been partially broken away, as also part of which was hidden underground. This is the longest roster of names of this kind ever discovered unto this day:&lt;ref&gt;Several reconstructions of the stone inscription have since been made. Compare also the reconstruction as was published by Shalom Medina in the journal, "Afikim," 92, Tel-Aviv, 1988/9, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mishnah and Talmud ==

=== Qualifications and disqualifications ===
{{Main|Kohanic disqualifications}}
Although kohanim may assume their duties once they reached physical maturity, the fraternity of kohanim generally would not allow young kohanim to begin service until they reached the age of twenty,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli Hullin 24b, [[Maimonides]]' [[Mishneh Torah|Yad]], Hilchoth Klei HaMiqdash 5:15&lt;/ref&gt; and some opinions state that this age was thirty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chizkuni]] to Devarim chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; There was no mandatory retirement age. Only when a kohen became physically infirm could he no longer serve.&lt;ref&gt;T.B. ibid., and [[Maimonides]]' [[Mishneh Torah|Yad]], Hilchoth Biath HaMiqdash 7:12, and Hilchoth Klei HaMiqdash 3:8&lt;/ref&gt;
A kohen may become disqualified from performing his service for a host of reasons, including, but not limited to, [[Tumah]], marital defilements, and physical blemishes. Of importance is that the kohen is never permanently disqualified from service but is permitted to return to his normal duties once the disqualification ceases.

== Twenty-four kohanic gifts ==
{{Main|Twenty-four kohanic gifts}}
The kohanim were compensated for their service to the nation and in the Temple through the [[twenty-four kohanic gifts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cohen-levi.org/temple_studies/order_of_the_temple_service.htm |title=Introduction to the concept of The Temple-Mikdash, its sources, its structure and function, and its importance for mankind |publisher=Cohen-levi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 24 gifts, 10 are listed as to be given even outside the land of Israel. An example of the gifts given to the kohen in the Diaspora are most notably the five [[shekel]]s of the [[Pidyon haben]] ceremony, and the [[giving of the foreleg, cheeks and abomasum]] from each Kosher-slaughtered animal.&lt;ref&gt;Although due to the high cost of these parts of beef, halakhic leniency are often sought to avoid their actual giving – see linked page for history detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kohen and Torah instruction ==
{{Main|The Torah instruction of the Kohanim}}
[[File:צוות כהנים עוסקים בלימוד הלכות טומאה וטהרה.jpg|thumb|200px|A group of kohanim studying the [[Mishna]]yot laws of [[Keilim]] in anticipation of the rebuilding of the [[Beit Hamikdash]].]]

Torah verses and rabbinical commentary to the [[Tanakh]] imply that the kohen has a unique leadership role amongst the nation of Israel. In addition to the well-known role of the kohen to officiate in the sacrificial activity in the Temple (the Korbanot), the kohen is presumed to have the responsibility of being knowledgeable in the laws and nuances of the Torah and to be able to give accurate instruction in those laws to the Jewish people.

[[Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch]] explains this responsibility as not being the exclusive Torah instructors, but working in tandem with the rabbinic leaders of the era,&lt;ref&gt;rabbi s.r. hirsch to chumash&lt;/ref&gt; while other rabbinic greats – notably the [[Chasam Sofer]] and [[Maharitz Chayes]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} – acknowledged a unique assignment of torah instruction to the descendents of Aaron.

== Modern application ==
After the destruction of the Second Temple and the suspension of sacrificial offerings, the formal role of priests in sacrificial services came to an end temporarily (until the rebuilding of the temple once more). Kohanim, however, retain a formal and public ceremonial role in synagogue prayer services. Kohanim also have a limited number of other special duties and privileges in Jewish religious practice. These special roles have been maintained in [[Orthodox Judaism]], and sometimes in [[Conservative Judaism]]. [[Reform Judaism]] does not afford any special status or recognition to kohanim.

=== Synagogue ''aliyah'' ===
Every Monday, Thursday and [[Shabbat]] in Orthodox [[synagogue]]s (and many Conservative ones as well), a portion from the Torah is read aloud in the original [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in front of the congregation. On weekdays, this reading is divided into three; it is customary to call a kohen for the first reading (''aliyah''), a Levite for the second reading, and a member of any other Tribe of Israel to the third reading. On Shabbat, the reading is divided into seven portions; a kohen is called for the first ''aliyah'' and a levite to the second, and a member of another tribe for the rest.

If a kohen is not present, it is customary in many communities for a levite to take the first ''aliyah'' "''bimkom kohen''" (in the place of a kohen) and an Israelite the second and succeeding ones. This custom is not required by [[halakha]] (Jewish law), however, and Israelites may be called up for all aliyot.

In the late 12th and early 13th century, Rabbi [[Meir of Rothenburg]] ruled that, in a community consisting entirely of kohanim, the prohibition on calling kohanim for anything but the first two and ''maftir'' ''aliyot'' creates a deadlock situation which should be resolved by calling women to the Torah for all the intermediate ''aliyot''.

The [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Rabbinical Assembly]]'s [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS), consistent with the Conservative movement's general view of the role of kohanim, has ruled that the practice of calling a kohen to the first aliyah represents a custom rather than a law, and that accordingly, a Conservative rabbi is not obligated to follow it. As such, in some Conservative synagogues, this practice is not followed.

=== Priestly blessing ===
{{Main|Priestly blessing}}
[[File:Birkhat cohanim 1.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Large crowds congregate on [[Passover]] at the [[Western Wall]] to receive the priestly blessing.]]
[[File:Grave Rabbi Meschullam Kohn.jpg|thumb|Blessing gesture depicted on the gravestone of rabbi Meschullam Kohn (1739–1819), who was a kohen.]]
The kohanim participating in an Orthodox and some other styles of traditional Jewish prayer service also deliver the '''priestly blessing''',&lt;ref&gt;in Hebrew called ''nesiat kapayim''&lt;/ref&gt; during the repetition of the ''[[Shemoneh Esrei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The text of this blessing is found in {{bibleverse||Numbers|6:23–27|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; They perform this service by standing and facing the crowd in the front of the congregation, with their arms held outwards and their hands and fingers in a specific formation, with a Jewish prayer shawl or [[Talit]] covering their heads and outstretched hands so that their fingers cannot be seen.&lt;ref&gt;In those congregation where the [[Minhag]] is to give the blessing during the week; with "five openings", traditionally linked to the verse in [[Song of Songs]] (2.8–9), where it is said that God "peeks through" the latticework, or the cracks in the wall. However, on Shabbot and Yom Tov it is customary to spread all fingers apart.&lt;/ref&gt; Kohanim living in Israel and many Sephardic Jews living in areas outside Israel deliver the priestly blessing daily; Ashkenazi Jews living outside Israel deliver it only on Jewish holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Of biblical origin. Customs vary as to whether the blessing is delivered outside Israel on a holy day when it falls on Shabbat.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pidyon Haben (Redemption of the firstborn) ===
{{Main|Pidyon haben}}
Outside the synagogue, the kohen leads the ''Pidyon Haben'' ceremony. This symbolic Redemption of the first-born son is based on the Torah commandment, "and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|13:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on marital status ===
[[Orthodox Judaism]] recognizes the rules as being in full force.
{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Areas where Orthodox approaches may create different results include situations where a woman has been raped, kidnapped or held hostage, descendants of converts whose Judaism status turned out to be subject to doubt, ambiguous prior dating histories, and other potentially ambiguous or difficult situations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

A priest of Aaron's lineage (i.e. Kohen) is forbidden by the Mosaic Law (Torah) to marry a divorced woman even if she were a native Israelite. Likewise, a male descendant from Aaron's line is prohibited to marry a Jewish woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew, whether she had been raped or she had willfully done so. So, too, he cannot marry a Jewish woman whose birth was by a father who is a Kohen but who violated one of these prohibitions. If he went ahead and did one of these three things, his male issue born from such union is no longer a priest (i.e. Kohen), but rather becomes a ''Ḥallal'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 21:7, 14)&lt;/small&gt; - a term designating one who is no longer a priest, but profaned. A priest must maintain an untainted lineage, and his mother must be of Jewish birth. If he married a non-Jewish woman from the gentile nations, his children are no longer priests, but gentiles. Had a priest of Aaron's lineage transgressed this prohibition and married a divorced woman, and they had children together, all of his female issue - whether his, or his sons, or his grandchildren - would be prohibited from marrying into the priestly stock for all generations.&lt;ref&gt;Yishma'el Tanuji Ha-Kohen, ''Sefer Ha-zikaron'', London 1974 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape poses an especially poignant problem. The pain experienced by the families of kohanim who were required to divorce their wives as the result of the rapes accompanying the capture of Jerusalem is alluded to in this Mishnah:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a woman were imprisoned by non-Jews concerning money affairs, she is permitted to her husband, but if for some capital offense, she is forbidden to her husband. If a town were overcome by besieging troops, all women of priestly stock found in it are ineligible [to be married to priests or to remain married to priests], but if they had witnesses, even a slave, or even a bondswoman, these may be believed. But no man may be believed for himself. Rabbi Zechariah ben Hakatsab said, "By this Temple, her hand did not stir from my hand from the time the non-Jews entered Jerusalem until they went out." They said to him: No man may give evidence of himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]] [[Ketubot]] 2:9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Israel====
The Israeli rabbinate will not perform a marriage halakhically forbidden to a kohen. For example, a kohen cannot legally marry a divorced or converted woman in the [[State of Israel]], although a foreign marriage would be recognized.

==== Conservative Jewish view ====
[[Conservative Judaism]] has issued an emergency ''takanah'' (rabbinical edict) temporarily suspending the application of the rules in their entirety, on the grounds that the high intermarriage rate threatens the survival of Judaism, and hence that any marriage between Jews is welcomed. The ''takanah'' declares that the offspring of such marriages are to be regarded as kohanim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The movement allows a kohen to marry a convert or divorcee for these reasons:
* Since the Temple in Jerusalem is no longer extant and ''korbanot'' should not be restored, kohanim are no longer able to perform Temple services in a state of ritual purity.
* Because the intermarriage crisis among American Jewry is an extreme situation, the Conservative movement feels it must support the decision of two Jews to marry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/goodman_marriageconvert.pdf Arnold Goodman, "Solemnizing the Marriage between a Kohen and a Convert"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127130257/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/goodman_marriageconvert.pdf |date=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/goodman_marriagedivorcee.pdf Goodman, "Solemnizing the Marriage between a Kohen and a Divorcee"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127130736/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/goodman_marriagedivorcee.pdf |date=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bat kohen ==
{{main|Bat-Kohen}}
''Kohen'' was a status that traditionally referred to men, passed from father to son, although there were situations where a ''bat kohen,'' daughter of a kohen, enjoyed some special status. For example, the first-born son of a bat ''kohen'', or the first-born son of a ''bat levi'' (the daughter of any [[levite]]) did not require the ritual of ''[[Pidyon HaBen]].'' {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In addition, females, although they did not serve in the Tabernacle or the Temple, were permitted to eat or benefit from some of the 24 kohanic gifts. However, if a ''kohen'''s daughter married a man from outside the kohanic line, she was no longer permitted to benefit from the kohanic gifts. Conversely, the daughter of a non-''kohen'' who married a ''kohen'' took on the same rights as an unmarried daughter of a ''kohen''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== Modern times ===
Today, Orthodox and many Conservative rabbis maintain the position that only a man can act as a ''kohen'', and that a daughter of a ''kohen'' is recognized as a ''bat kohen'' only in those very limited ways that have been identified in the past. Other Conservative rabbis, along with some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] rabbis, are prepared to give equal ''kohen'' status to the daughter of a ''kohen''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Orthodox Judaism maintains that the privileges and status of ''kohanim'' stem primarily from their offerings and activities in the Temple. Accordingly, in Orthodox Judaism only men can perform the [[Priestly Blessing]] and receive the first ''aliyah'' during the public Torah reading, and women are generally not permitted to officiate in a ''Pidyon HaBen'' ceremony. However, the question of what acts (if any) a ''bat kohen'' can perform in an Orthodox context is a subject of current discussion and debate in some Orthodox circles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lind.org.il/features/bnotKohanim_v24.htm ''Bnot Kohanim: Our Holy Daughters.'' Midreshet Lindembaum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118061402/http://www.lind.org.il/features/bnotkohanim_v24.htm |date=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women's prayer groups that practice under the halakhic guidance of non-Orthodox rabbis, and which conduct Torah readings for women only, have adapted a custom of calling a ''bat kohen'' for the first ''aliyah'' and a ''[[Levite#Bat Levi|bat levi]]'' for the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hir.org/women.html |title=Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, Women's Tefillah |publisher=Hir.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831114327/http://www.hir.org/women.html |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative Judaism]], consistent with its view that sacrifices in the Temple will not be restored and in light of many congregations' commitment to gender (but not caste) egalitarianism, interprets the Talmudic relevant passages to permit elimination of most distinctions between male and female ''kohanim'' in congregations that retain traditional tribal roles while modifying traditional gender roles. The Conservative movement bases this leniency on the view that the privileges of the ''kohen'' come not from offering Temple offerings but solely from lineal sanctity, and that ceremonies like the Priestly Blessing should evolve from their Temple-based origins. (The argument for women's involvement in the Priestly Blessing acknowledges that only male ''kohanim'' could perform this ritual in the days of the Temple, but that the ceremony is no longer rooted in Temple practice; its association with the Temple was by rabbinic decree; and rabbis therefore have the authority to permit the practice to evolve from its Temple-based roots).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/rabinowitz_women.pdf Rabbi Meyer Rabbinowitz, "Women Raise Your Hands"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320162257/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/rabinowitz_women.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some Conservative synagogues permit a ''bat kohen'' to perform the Priestly Blessing and the Pidyon HaBen ceremony, and to receive the first ''aliyah'' during the Torah reading.

The Conservative [[halakha]] committee in Israel has ruled that women do not receive such ''aliyot'' and cannot validly perform such functions (rabbi Robert Harris, 5748). Therefore, not all Conservative congregations or rabbis permit these roles for ''bnot kohanim'' (daughters of priests). Moreover, many egalitarian-oriented Conservative synagogues have abolished traditional tribal roles and do not perform ceremonies involving ''kohanim'' (such as the Priestly Blessing or calling a ''kohen'' to the first ''aliyah''), and many traditionalist Conservative synagogues have retained traditional gender roles and do not permit women to perform these roles at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/roth_daughtersaliyot.pdf Rabbi Joel Roth. ''The Status of Daughters of Kohanim and Leviyim for Aliyot''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127135930/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/roth_daughtersaliyot.pdf |date=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] temples have abolished traditional tribal distinctions, roles, and identities on grounds of egalitarianism, a special status for a ''bat kohen'' has very little significance in these movements.

== Kohen genetic testing ==

{{summarize|from|Y-chromosomal Aaron|date=May 2015}}
{{one source|section|date=May 2015}}
{{Original research|section|date=May 2015}}
}}
Since the Y chromosome is inherited only from one's father (women have no Y chromosome), all direct male lineages share a common [[haplotype]]. Therefore, testing was done across sectors of the Jewish and non-Jewish population to see if there was any commonality among their Y [[chromosome]]s. The initial research by Hammer, Skorecki, et al. was based on a limited study of 188 subjects, which identified a narrow set of genetic markers{{which|date=May 2015}} found in slightly more than 50% of Jews with a tradition of priestly descent and approximately 5% of Jews who did not believe themselves to be kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammer |first=Michael F. |last2=Skorecki |first2=Karl |title=Y Chromosomes of Jewish Priests |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |year=1997 |volume=385 |issue=6611 |page=32 |doi=10.1038/385032a0 |pmid=8985243|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the succeeding decade, Hammer, Skorecki, and other researchers continued to collect genetic material from Jewish and non-Jewish populations around the world. The most recent results suggest that 46% of those who have a family tradition of Priestly descent{{vague|date=May 2015}} belong to the [[Y-DNA haplogroup]] identified as [[Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA)|J]]-P58, and that at least two-thirds of that 46% have very similar Y-DNA sequences indicating comparatively recent common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Hammer2009" /&gt; A further 14% of kohanim were found to belong to another lineage, in haplogroup [[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2a]]-M410.&lt;ref name="Hammer2009" /&gt; In contrast, the so-called Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH), a characteristic Y chromosome haplotype earlier identified in a majority of men self-reporting as kohanim, is found in as much as 5% to 8% of Jews who have no family tradition of being kohanim, and only 1.5% were found to have the closest match to the most detailed sequence.&lt;ref name="Hammer2009" /&gt; Amongst non-Jews, the CMH can be found among non-Jewish Yemenites (&gt;67.7%) and Jordanians (~7%), but none were found to most closely match the most detailed sequence.&lt;ref name="Hammer2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammer |last2=Behar |title=Extended Y Chromosome haplotypes resolve multiple and unique lineages of the Jewish Priesthood |journal=Human Genetics |year=2009 |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=707–717 |doi=10.1007/s00439-009-0727-5 |pmid=19669163 |pmc=2771134|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, studies{{which|date=May 2015}} document certain distinctions among the Y chromosomes of kohanim, implying that a substantial proportion of kohanim share some common male ancestry.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Since the religious status of a kohen is contingent upon being the male biological descendant of Aaron in conjunction with numerous other variables that are not subject to genetic testing (the wife of a kohen cannot have had relations with a non-Jew, be a divorcee etc.) the possession of a common haplotype does not provide sufficient evidence to confer or maintain the religious status of a kohen, which depends on more than simple heredity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This loss of priestly status over time may account for the 1.5% of non-kohen Jews who very closely match the Y chromosome sequence that is most common amongst kohanim.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Cohen (and its variations) as a surname ==
{{Main|Cohen (surname)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The status of kohen in Judaism has no necessary relationship to a person's surname. Though it is true that descendants of kohanim often bear surnames that reflect their genealogy, there are many families with the surname Cohen (or any number of variations) who are not kohanim nor even Jewish. Conversely, there are many kohanim who do not have Cohen as a surname.

There are numerous variations to the spelling of the surname Cohen. These are often corrupted by translation or [[transliteration]] into or from other languages, as exemplified below (not a complete list).

== Seder ==
{{Main|Passover Seder Plate}}
One common interpretation of the practice of having three pieces of [[matzah]] on a Seder plate is that they represent "Kohen, Levi and Yisrael" (i.e., the priests, the tribe of Levi, and all other Jewish people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/pass_prep.html |title="Preparing for Passover and the Seder," the Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outside Judaism ==
According to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], either "literal descendants of Aaron", or worthy [[Priesthood of Melchizedek|Melchizedek priesthood]] holders have the legal right to constitute the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]] under the authority of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] ({{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 68|verse=16|range=-20}}). To date, all men who have served on the Presiding Bishopric have been Melchizedek priesthood holders, and none have been publicly identified as descendants of Aaron. See also [[Mormonism and Judaism]].

== References in popular culture ==
The positioning of the kohen's hands during the [[Priestly Blessing]] was [[Leonard Nimoy]]'s inspiration for [[Spock|Mr. Spock's]] [[Vulcan salute]] in the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original Star Trek television series]]. Nimoy, raised an Orthodox Jew (but not a kohen), used the salute when saying "Live long and prosper".

The Priestly Blessing was used by [[Leonard Cohen]] in his farewell blessing during "Whither Thou Goest", the closing song on his concerts. Leonard Cohen himself was from a kohen family. He also used the drawing of the Priestly Blessing as one of his logos.

== Kohen and the Holocaust ==
{{Main|Holocaust theology}}

In 1938, with the outbreak of violence that would come to be known as [[Kristallnacht]], American Orthodox rabbi [[Mnachem Risikoff|Mnachem HaKohen Risikoff]] wrote about the central role he saw for Priests and Levites in terms of Jewish and world responses, in worship, liturgy, and ''[[Repentance in Judaism|teshuva]]'', repentance. In הכהנים והלוים HaKohanim vHaLeviim (1940)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hebrewbooks.org/36377&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Priests and the Levites'', he stressed that members of these groups exist in the realm between history (below) and redemption (above), and must act in a unique way to help move others to prayer and action, and help bring an end to suffering. He wrote, "Today, we also are living through a time of flood, Not of water, but of blood, which burns and turns Jewish life into ruin. We are now drowning in a flood of blood...Through the Kohanim and Levi'im help will come to all Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Gershon Greenberg, ''Kristallnacht: The American Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Theology of Response,'' in Maria Mazzenga (editor), ''American Religious Responses to Kristallnacht,'' Palgrave MacMillan:2009, pp158-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Jigme Phuntsok|Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok]] founded the '''Larung Ngarig Buddhist Academy''' ({{bo|t=བླ་རུང་ལྔ་རིག་ནང་བསྟན་སློབ་གླིང་།|z=Larung Ngarig nangdän lobling}}, {{zh|s=喇荣五明佛学院|p=Larong Wuming foxueyuan}}), in the [[Larung Gar|Larung Valley]] (喇荣沟) near the township of Larung in [[Sêrtar County]], [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Garzê Prefecture]], [[Sichuan]] Province. The purpose of the Institute has been to provide an ecumenical training in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and to meet the need for renewal of meditation and scholarship all over Tibet in the wake of China’s [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966-76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Faison|first=Seth|title=A 'Living Buddha' Plants an Academy|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/072899china-buddhist-temple.html |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=18 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106092656/http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/072899china-buddhist-temple.html|archivedate=6 January 2014|date=28 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its remote location, it grew from a handful of disciples gathering in Jigme Phuntsok's home to be one of the largest and most influential centers for the study of Tibetan Buddhism in the world, numbering to nearly 10,000 monks, nuns, and [[Laity#Buddhist lay persons|lay disciples]] by the year 2000. As of 2015, the number of residents has grown to about 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;Becky Pemberton. "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3043400/Inside-largest-Buddhist-settlement-world.html#ixzz3Xljir4ND The largest Buddhist settlement in the world: Inside the village where 40,000 monks and nuns are segregated and televisions are banned... but iPhones are allowed]". ''Daily Mail'', 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Overall, the student body of Larung Five Sciences Buddhist Academy is made up of monks, nuns, lay "vow-holders" of both Tibetan and Chinese origins, and tantric practitioners. They study under four major religious divisions in the Academy: Ngarig Nangten Lobling, International Religious Committee, Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery, and Lektso Charbeb Ling. Ngarig Nangten Lobling consists of 2,500 Tibetan monks. Lektso Charbeb Ling is the section that trained over 1,000 lay Tibetan "vow-holders" and tantric practitioners from Sêrtar and other regions of Tibet.

Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery is the home for study to approximately 3,500-4,000 nuns from all regions of Tibet. More than half of those who came to Sertar are women and the curriculum allows nuns to achieve a coveted Khenpo degree for the first time in Tibetan history. Entry into the relatively small number of nunneries that exist in other areas of Tibet is limited, but Sertar is open to virtually anyone who genuinely seeks to become a student of Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok’s ecumenical vision. Khenpo’s niece, Jetsunma Mumso, is recognized as a [[tulku]] and heads the order of nuns. The term is descriptive of certain teachers in Tibet who are thought to reincarnate over a number of generations.

Roughly ten percent of the nearly 10,000 students attending Sertar are ethnic [[Han Chinese|Han people]]. They attend separate classes taught in [[Standard Chinese]] while larger classes are taught in [[Amdo Tibetan]]. The International Religious Committee oversees 1,000 disciples from regions of the People’s Republic of China and students from other Asian countries.

==History==
The Sertar Institute operated with a standing executive committee of seven learned lamas, but major decisions were confirmed and implemented only after consultation with Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok.

The Sertar Institute has been home to over 500 [[khenpo]]s — holders of Doctoral degrees in divinity — and is widely renowned for the high quality of both its religious and secular education. English, Chinese, and Tibetan languages and modern computer studies have been taught alongside a traditional non-sectarian Buddhist curriculum.

In August 2017, it emerged that a deputy police chief of Garze would be acting as the institute’s party secretary and director with a committee of cadres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2108308/tibetan-buddhist-heartland-communist-party-takeover-threatens South China Morning Post, 25 August 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism and media==
Larung Gar is outside the main tourist routes and few foreigners find their way there. Occasionally officials have prevented foreigners from visiting the institute, but in recent years it has been mostly accessible. There is one hotel on the Northern ridgeline, which is most easily reached via the new construction access road from the north, avoiding the congestion on the narrow streets of the institute. There are also a simple guesthouse and a few restaurants on the main square next to the main Gompa. A new "Temple of Death" has been built at the sky burial site about one kilometer north of the institute.

In February 2016, a photograph of Larung Gar by Hungarian photographer Attila Balogh was shortlisted for that year’s [[World Photography Organisation|Sony World Photography Awards]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 23 February 2016"&gt;{{cite news | author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Sony World Photography Awards 2016: the final shortlist |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/feb/23/sony-world-photography-awards-2016-the-final-shortlist| date= 23 February 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate= 22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demolition and safety-rebuilding project==

The Chinese demolished about 2,000 homes in 2001, "because of concerns about social stability" at the site, simultaneously limiting the population to 1,400 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eckholm|first=Erik|title=Monitors Say China Pushes Tibet Monks From Study Site|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/22/world/monitors-say-china-pushes-tibet-monks-from-study-site.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=22 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 new homes are constructed every year by both professional crews and monks and nuns themselves with the help of their families and friends. However, in January 2014, a massive blaze destroyed around 100 wood houses in Larung Gar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=46,11739,0,0,1,0 The Buddhist Channel, 9 January 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2016, the BBC reported evidence from the campaign group [[Free Tibet]] that a government work team, accompanied by Chinese police and plainclothes members of the armed forces, had begun to demolish more buildings at Larung Gar in response to an order made the previous month by local authorities.&lt;ref name="BBC News Online 22 July 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-36863888|title= Larung Gar: China 'destroys buildings' at Tibetan Buddhist academy |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 22 July 2016|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= | accessdate= 22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some reports, authorities ordered to cut the number of Larung Gar residents by half to 5,000 and offered rewards to ethnic Tibetan dwellers if they moved away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/departures-10112016163154.html Radio Free Asia, 11 October 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36863888 BBC, 22 July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2016, Tibetan government-in-exile urged the United Nations to intervene on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetibetpost.com/en/news/exile/5304-tibetan-govt-calls-on-un-for-immediate-action-to-save-larung-gar The Tibet Post International, 6 December 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 2016, European Parliament passed a resolution against the People's Republic of China and condemned the partial dismantling of Larung Gar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpo.org/article/19731 Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, 15 December 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20161208IPR55163/human-rights-buddhism-in-tibet-rohingya-in-myanmar-mass-graves-in-iraq European Parliament News, 15 December 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that the demolition was being carried out after "two major government meetings during which President Xi Jinping stressed “national unity” and the necessity for religious groups to support the Communist Party and “merge their religious doctrines with Chinese culture.”" L[Robert] [[Robert Barnett (scholar)|Barnett]] [a Tibet scholar at [[Columbia University]]] said this was indicative of the social unrest in Tibet, quoted in the LA Times as saying "We’ve had — what is it? —  five years of self-immolations, massive protests in 2008 and so on. The language of resistance is rife throughout China and Tibet."&lt;ref name="LA Times 22 July 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Makinen |first= Julie |title= For 2nd time in 15 years, Tibetan Buddhist academy faces demolition order |url= http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-buddhistacademy-20160722-snap-story.html | date= 22 July 2016|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |location= Los Angeles | accessdate=22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 it was revealed that the dismantling is part of a rebuilding project that the local government is carrying out in order to make the academy fire- and earthquake-safe.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bodeen.

'''Laura Naomi Janner-Klausner''' ({{lang-he-n|לוֹרָה ג׳אָנֶר-קלְוֹזנֶר}}, born 1 August 1963{{cn|date=July 2018}}) is a British rabbi who serves as the senior rabbi to [[Movement for Reform Judaism|Reform Judaism]].&lt;ref name = "Senior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt; Janner-Klausner grew up in London before studying [[theology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and moving to Israel in 1985, living in Jerusalem for 15 years.&lt;ref name= "Not"/&gt; She returned to Britain in 1999 and was ordained at [[Leo Baeck College]], serving as rabbi at Alyth Synagogue ([[North Western Reform Synagogue]]) until 2011, when she became inaugural holder of her current position.&lt;ref name = "Senior"&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|title=Senior Rabbi to the Movement for Reform Judaism|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/leadership/rabbi-laura-janner-klausner.html|publisher =[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her position, Janner-Klausner represents a progressive Jewish voice to British Jewry and the wider public, speaking on affairs including Israel-Palestine, social justice, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[interfaith]] relations. Janner-Klausner is a regular broadcaster on programmes such as [[BBC Radio 4]]’s ''[[Thought for the Day]]'', [[BBC Radio 2]]’s ''[[Pause for Thought]]'' and [[BBC One]]’s ''[[The Big Questions]]'' and [[Sunday Morning Live (BBC TV programme)|''Sunday Morning Live'']]. In November 2014, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported that Janner-Klausner was "fast becoming the most high-profile Jewish leader in the country" and described her as "wildly likeable, emphatic, intense, and outspoken".&lt;ref name="Elgot" /&gt; In 2018 she featured in The Progress 1000 list of London's most influential people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Progress 1000: London's most influential people 2018 - Social pillars: Faith |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/the1000/the-progress-1000-londons-most-influential-people-2018-social-pillars-faith-a3953761.html |website=Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She is currently writing a book on the theme of [[psychological resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref name= "Twitter"&gt;[https://twitter.com/LauraJanklaus/ Janner-Klausner's Twitter account]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===

Janner-Klausner was raised in north London and attended [[South Hampstead High School]]. As a young girl, Janner-Klausner regularly travelled to constituency surgeries at the weekends with her father, [[Greville Janner]], a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and then a Labour Member of Parliament. Janner-Klausner’s [[great-uncle]], Emeritus Chief Rabbi of Great Britain, Sir [[Israel Brodie]], had a profound influence on her growing up.&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Not"/&gt; Her siblings are Marion Janner [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], a mental health campaigner, and Daniel Janner QC, a barrister.&lt;ref name="OBE"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/27156/marion-janner-and-buddy-collect-obe |title=Marion Janner (and Buddy) collect OBE |last=Rosen |first=Robyn |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |publication-date=12 February 2010|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibb, Frances [https://blogs.thetimes.co.uk/section/law-central/31226/tax-barrister-stands-for-bnp/ "Tax barrister stands for BNP"], ''The Times'' (Laaw Central blog), 23 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Janner QC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Janner QC|url=http://www.23es.com/people/daniel-janner/|publisher=23 Essex Street|accessdate=14 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092158/http://www.23es.com/people/daniel-janner/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially a member of [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] Synagogue, a congregation affiliated to the [[United Synagogue]] of Orthodox British Jews, Janner-Klausner has frequently cited her [[bat mitzvah]] as a pivotal moment. Janner-Klausner was so disaffected by the experience&lt;ref name = "Not"&gt;{{cite news|last1= Rocker|first1=Simon|title=Laura Janner-Klausner: Why I'm not the Reform rival to the Chief Rabbi|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]| url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/laura-janner-klausner-why-i-m-not-the-reform-rival-to-the-chief-rabbi-1.25699|date= 28 July 2011|accessdate= 20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; she left Hampstead Garden Suburb Synagogue the very next day. Janner-Klausner subsequently became involved in youth activities at Alyth Gardens Reform Synagogue near [[Golders Green]], developing a passion for Reform Judaism’s values of egalitarianism and social justice and expressing interest in becoming a Rabbi as young as 13.&lt;ref name = "Not"/&gt;

Janner-Klausner spent her gap year in Israel and was a representative of British Reform Judaism at [[Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz]] (The Institute for Youth Leaders from Abroad).&lt;ref name = "Not"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Wachmann"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wachmann|first1=Doreen|title=Reform greeting for the new chief Rabbi|url= http://www.jewishtelegraph.com/prof_184.html|work=[[Jewish Telegraph]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to London in 1982 and became a founding member of [[RSY-Netzer]], which is now the largest Jewish youth movement in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SDRS and 'The Reform Movement'|url=http://old.reformsynagogueinsouthend.co.uk/sdrshistory.htm|publisher=[[Southend and District Reform Synagogue]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[RSY-Netzer]]|title=What is RSY-Netzer?|url=http://rsy-netzer.org.uk/about/|publisher= [[RSY-Netzer]]|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janner-Klausner studied divinity at the [[University of Cambridge]], where she was taught by [[Rowan Williams]], later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. She studied with Professor [[Linda Woodhead]], now Professor in the sociology of religion at [[Lancaster University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Taylor, Matthew]]|title=RSA Podcasts|url=http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/file/0008/999305/20121206JohnLloyd.mp3|publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]]|accessdate=2 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605053107/http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/file/0008/999305/20121206JohnLloyd.mp3|archivedate=5 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janner-Klausner was on the [[Union of Jewish Students]] executive and ran her university's Israel Society and Progressive Jewish Society.&lt;ref name ="Wachmann"/&gt;

===Career in Israel===

Following her graduation in 1985, aged 22, Janner-Klausner moved to Israel and began teaching Jewish history, Judaism and youth leadership at the [[Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz]].&lt;ref name = "Senior"/&gt; She worked there continuously until 1998 and later became the Director of its English-speaking department.&lt;ref name = "Not"/&gt;

Janner-Klausner began working in 1992 at Melitz, an educational centre specialising in Jewish peoplehood based in Jerusalem, and later served as Director of the Centre for Christian Encounters with Israel, where she helped train Palestinian tour guides in [[Bethlehem]] and Jerusalem.&lt;ref name = "Senior"/&gt; Janner-Klausner also led Israeli-Palestinian dialogue facilitation for the [[European Union]]’s "The People's Peace" programme, following the [[Oslo I Accord]] of 1993.&lt;ref name = "Senior"/&gt;

Before returning to live in London, Janner-Klausner had studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Jerusalem and acquired postgraduate degrees in Community Centre Management at the [[Hebrew University]] and Jewish Communal Service with a focus on Jewish education at [[Brandeis University]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = "Senior"/&gt;

===Return to London===

Janner-Klausner returned to London in 1999 with her husband David and their three children, citing the ideological intensity of living in Jerusalem as a primary reason.&lt;ref name="Not"/&gt; She soon began training to become a rabbi at [[Leo Baeck College]], serving many congregations as a trainee rabbi&amp;nbsp;– including Alyth Synagogue ([[North Western Reform Synagogue]]), the synagogue where she had developed a passion for Reform Judaism and its [[egalitarian]] values as a teenager.&lt;ref name= "Wachmann"/&gt; Following her ordination, Janner-Klausner became Rabbi at Alyth.

Janner-Klausner featured in a BBC radio series  presented by [[Jonathan Freedland]] in 2008 entitled ''British Jews and the Dream of Zion'', discussing the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Jews and the Dream of Zion|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b2n55|publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then began to broadcast regularly on programmes such as BBC Radio 4’s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme (in the ''[[Thought for the Day]]'' slot) and BBC One’s ''[[The Big Questions]]''.

Whilst Rabbi at Alyth, Janner-Klausner began chairing British Friends of [[Rabbis for Human Rights]], an Israeli human rights organisation. By 2011, she had served for eight years as Rabbi at Alyth, a community with 3000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[North Western Reform Synagogue]]|title=Past Rabbis|url=http://www.alyth.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=98&amp;Itemid=56| publisher=[[North Western Reform Synagogue]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior Rabbi to Reform Judaism===

In July 2011, Janner-Klausner became first Senior Rabbi to Reform Judaism, a position initially entitled "Movement Rabbi".&lt;ref name= "New Voice"&gt;{{cite press release|last1=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|title=New Voice for British Jews|url=http://news.reformjudaism.org.uk/press-releases/new-voice-for-british-jews.html|publisher=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chair-elect of Reform Judaism, Jenny Pizer, said Janner-Klausner was "an influential broadcaster and writer, a great teacher and a popular rabbi of one of our flourishing communities".&lt;ref name= "New Voice"/&gt;

The Assembly of Reform Rabbis created the position to increase the voice of Reform Judaism and represent its constituent communities on a national level, both within the British Jewish community and general public.&lt;ref name= "New Voice"/&gt;

Shortly after being appointed, Janner-Klausner set improving periodically fraught relations between the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and Reform Judaism as part of her agenda. On the selection of [[Ephraim Mirvis]] as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations in December 2012, Janner-Klausner said: "I welcome the appointment of Rabbi Mirvis as another powerful voice for British Jewry. I look forward to working closely with him as a partner on areas of common interests to the Jewish and wider community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaviv|first1=Miriam|title=UK Jewry names its next Chief Rabbi|url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-jewry-names-its-next-chief-rabbi/|work=[[Times of Israel]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janner-Klausner has since said of Rabbi Mirvis: "he made some very positive noises about inclusivity and working together and it was really well received. It’s not playing out in reality, unfortunately."&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt;

In November 2014, Janner-Klausner featured in "Beyond Belief" by ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', a series of interviews with Britons who use faith "to create a force for positive change".&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt; The article, entitled "How Britain's Only Female Head Of Faith Took On The Religious Establishment, And Won", explored Janner-Klausner's early life and professional career. It reported that Janner-Klausner had dramatically improved the status of Reform Judaism in Britain and was "fast becoming the most high-profile Jewish leader in the country".&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt;

==Advocacy and views==

===Interfaith relations===

Janner-Klausner is a prominent voice on British interfaith relations and regularly meets representatives of Christian and Muslim communities.&lt;ref name = "Williams"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Andrew|title=Quaker Committee for Christian and Interfaith Relations e-network mailing Summer 2013|url= http://www.quaker.org.uk/quaker-committee-christian-and-interfaith-relations-e-network-mailing-summer-2013|publisher= Quakers in Britain| accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a President of the [[Council of Christians and Jews]] and has worked with organisations including the Three Faiths Forum and the Interfaith Network for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patron, Presidents, and Vice Presidents|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/5231/council-of-christians-and-jews-meets-at-lambeth-palace|publisher=[[Council of Christians and Jews]]|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having studied Christian theology at university, Janner-Klausner has worked with the Methodist Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gee|first1=Ruth|title=Glimpses in Israel and Palestine|url=http://methodist-presandvp.blogspot.co.uk/2013_12_01_archive.html|publisher= The President and Vice-President of the Methodist Conference |date = 1 December 2013|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|title=Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner in dialogue with Church of Scotland|url=http://news.reformjudaism.org.uk/press-releases/rabbi-laura-janner-klausner-in-dialogue-with-church-of-scotland.html|publisher= [[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Quakers to deepen interfaith ties.&lt;ref name = "Williams"/&gt;

In May 2013, following the [[murder of Lee Rigby]], Janner-Klausner joined faith leaders in solidarity with [[Woolwich]] residents and its Muslim community at the Greenwich Islamic Centre. With far-right groups including the [[English Defence League]] and [[British National Party]] organising protests in response to the murder by a Muslim extremist, she stated that "a single extreme act... does not reflect on the wider British Muslim community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|title=Showing solidarity in Woolwich|url=http://news.reformjudaism.org.uk/press-releases/showing-solidarity-in-woolwich.html|publisher=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay marriage===

Janner-Klausner strongly supports same-sex marriage, which she calls "equal marriage".&lt;ref name= "Moral Maze"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janner-Klausner|first1= Laura|title=The Moral Maze: Gay Marriage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01d2h6s|publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]]|date= 17 March 2012|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the legalisation of gay marriage, Janner-Klausner said "our starting point, middle point and finishing point is about equality".&lt;ref name= "Moral Maze"/&gt; In March 2014, same-sex marriage was legalised in Britain. Janner-Klausner signed an open letter from Christian and Jewish faith leaders including [[Danny Rich (rabbi)|Danny Rich]], chief executive of [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]], and [[Alan Wilson (bishop)|Alan Wilson]], the [[Bishop of Buckingham]], voicing support for gay marriage. The leaders said they would "rejoice" in the introduction of gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[The Huffington Post]] UK| title=Gay Marriage: Bishops And Rabbis Sign Letter Saying They 'Rejoice' In New Law|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/03/28/gay-marriage-bishop_n_5048169.html|work= [[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refugees===

Janner-Klausner has emerged as one of the leading British religious voices on the issue of refugee rights. She was involved in bringing the issue to public prominence, writing in August 2015 that "when Jewish people look at Calais migrants, we see ourselves"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When Jewish people look at Calais migrants, we see ourselves|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/13/jewish-people-calais-migrants-kindertransport-children-nazis#img-1|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being one of the leading voices in a letter signed by over 200 Jewish representatives labelling the government's response "appalling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Response to migrant crisis is appalling, British Jews tell Cameron|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/your-response-to-migrant-crisis-is-appalling-british-jews-tell-cameron-a2487361.html|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|author= Maguire, Liam|date=12 August 2015|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janner-Klausner was especially vocal on the topic of the [[Calais Jungle]], visiting on multiple occasions. In September 2015, a short film was made documenting Janner-Klausner visiting the Jungle alongside Imam Qari Muhammad Asim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner and Imam Qari Muhammad Asim MBE in Calais|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlcZaTVmlw|website=YouTube|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Jungle was threatened with demolition in early 2016, she was a key signatory on a [[Citizens UK]] letter signed by over 90,000 people to halt demolition until vulnerable children had been granted safe arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Letter to David Cameron|url=https://www.refugees-welcome.org.uk/the-letter-to-david-cameron/|website=Refugees Welcome}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, she led further efforts to prevent the demolition, including a letter to the government signed by Christian and Jewish faith leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Over 50 rabbis urge delay on Calais Jungle demolition|url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/over-50-rabbis-sign-letter-urging-delay-on-calais-jungle-demolition/|work=[[Jewish News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the demolition of the camp, Janner-Klausner continued to speak out, stating that "it is beyond comprehension that people can be mistreated like this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senior rabbi’s concern over plight of refugees in ‘jungle’ demolition|url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/rabbi-criticises-plight-of-child-refugees-in-jungle-demolition/|work=[[Jewish News]]|author= Mendel, Jack|date= 26 October 2016|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During debate over the Dubs Amendment to the Immigration Bill to grant 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees entry to the UK, Janner-Klausner spoke extensively in its favour. She was at the forefront of a letter signed by many Rabbinic leaders calling for the Dubs Amendment to be adopted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letters: The EU doesn’t work as a political union because one size simply cannot fit all|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/04/23/letters-the-eu-doesnt-work-as-a-political-union-because-one-size/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= 23 April 2016|access-date= 16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke out alongside Jewish leaders from a range of denominations after the amendment was initially rejected, saying "I believe Britain has the capacity and the will to do more during this crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish groups disappointed after Lord Dubs’s plan on child refugees is voted down by MPs|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jewish-groups-disappointed-after-lord-dubs-s-plan-on-child-refugees-is-voted-down-by-mps-1.64400|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|author= Docherty, Rosa|access-date= 16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the amendment, Janner-Klausner continued to pressure the government to accept the children identified in Calais who she said had "a clear legal right to be here", speaking at a vigil outside the Home Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calais 'Jungle' camp: UK urged to take in 400 refugee children|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37249847|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2 September 2016|access-date= 16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janner-Klausner has continued to call on the British government to change its treatment of refugees. She has spoken at the [[Houses of Parliament]] to call for an end to the indefinite detention of asylum seekers, alongside other prominent religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faith and Community leaders demand Immigration Detention Reform|author= Cassin, Rene|url=https://storify.com/Rene_Cassin/faith-and-community-leaders-demand-detention-refor|website=Storify|date= April 2016|accessdate= 16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, she addressed a crowd of 10,000 people at a Solidarity with Refugees rally in [[Trafalgar Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner at Solidarity with Refugees rally|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/rabbi-laura-janner-klausner-solidarity-refugees-rally/|publisher=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]]|date=23 September 2016|access-date= 16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, Rabbi Janner-Klausner has spoken out against the treatment of refugees crossing the US-Mexico border by the Trump administration, saying "the numbing of empathy, the dehumanisation of other people through the encouragement of disdain are documented stages in history that have led to atrocities and even genocides"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Helm |first1=Toby |last2=Tapper |first2=James |title=UK rabbi warns of genocide risk in Trump policies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/23/british-rabbi-trump-immigration-policy-like-genocide-theresa-may-visit |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Israel===

Janner-Klausner is a progressive [[Zionist]] and considers Israel the spiritual and intellectual centre of Judaism and the Jewish people.&lt;ref name = "Trips"&gt;{{cite web|last1=British Friends of [[Rabbis for Human Rights]]|title=Trips|url=http://rhruk.co.uk/what-we-do/trips/|publisher=British Friends of [[Rabbis for Human Rights]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She supports two states for Israel and Palestine as the sustainable and just solution to the present conflict, having facilitated Israeli-Palestinian dialogue for the [[European Union]] whilst living in Jerusalem and led tours to the West Bank with British Friends of [[Rabbis for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name = "Trips"/&gt; She is a past chair of British Friends of Rabbis for Human Rights.&lt;ref name = "Not"/&gt;

===Religious power===

Janner-Klausner is especially interested in the relationship between religion and power. She has criticised religious fundamentalists, proposing that literalist interpretations of religious text "worship words instead of God". At the [[Bath Literature Festival]] in March 2013, she spoke about the importance of challenging religious belief and suggested "we need to lock faith and doubt together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maude|first1=David|title=Bath Literature Festival: Believers lose faith in the role of religion in the classroom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/bath-literature-festival-believers-losefaith-in-the-role-of-religion-in-the-classroom-8525308.html|work = [[The Independent]]|date= 7 March 2013|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Limmud]] Conference in December 2013, Janner-Klausner delivered a JDOV speech about "Power and its Discontents", addressing themes of power and powerlessness in Judaism.&lt;ref name = "Power"&gt;{{cite web|last1=JDOV|title=Laura Janner-Klausner; Power and its Discontents|url= http://www.jhub.org.uk/jdov/portfolio/laura-janner-klausner/|publisher= JHub|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the speech at JDOV or "Jewish Dreams, Observations and Visions", a British Jewish organisation inspired by [[TED (conference)|TED]] talks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Shkolnikov|first1= Alina|title=Five Inspiring JDOV Talks from Limmud UK|url=http://presentense.org/blog/five-inspiring-jdov-talks-from-limmud-uk|publisher= Presentense Group|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote: "I strongly believe in inverting the power pyramid so that everyone claims their opportunity to play their part in decisions that affect themselves and their communities".&lt;ref name = "Power"/&gt;

Janner-Klausner believes enabling colleagues to receive opportunities in the public sphere is as an important responsibility and does not believe the Senior Rabbi role makes her a chief rabbi or holder of special religious authority.&lt;ref name= "Not"/&gt; In April 2013, Rabbi Mark Goldsmith, Chairman of the Assembly of Reform Rabbis, remarked that Janner-Klausner was "not our only public face to the world. Part of her role is to enable all of us to be more outward-facing rabbis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Rocker|first1=Simon|title=Janner-Klausner 'wrong' over Thatcher funeral|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/106407/janner-klausner-wrong-over-thatcher-funeral|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janner-Klausner is currently writing a book on resilience.&lt;ref name= "Twitter"/&gt;

==Personal life==

The '''[[Catholic Church in Norway|Catholic Church]] in [[Norway]]''' (where the state church is Lutheran) '''and its overseas territories''' has no [[ecclesiastical province]] nor belongs to any (all sees being exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See) nor has a national [[episcopal conference]], but the Norwegian Catholic episcopate partakes in the [[Episcopal conference of Scandinavia]].

The three proper sees are all [[Latin rite]] :
* one full bishopric in the national capital 
* two missionary pre-diocesan [[territorial prelature]]s.

The Eastern Catholics are pastorally served by a transnational [[apostolic exarchate]] from Germany.

There formally is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Norway, as papal embassy-level diplomatic representation, albeit vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to Sweden (in [[Djursholm]]), as are the nunciatures to [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]], covering the [[Nordic countries]].

== Current jurisdictions ==

=== Latin jurisdictions ===
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo]], which also covers [[Bouvet island]]
* [[Territorial Prelature of Tromsø]], which also covers [[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]] (Spitzbergen)
* [[Territorial Prelature of Trondheim]]

=== Eastern Catholic jurisdiction ===
:[[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]] ([[Byzantine rite]] in [[Ukrainian language]])

* [[Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate in Germany and Scandinavia]], also covering [[Germany]] (with the see in Münich), [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]

== Defunct Latin jurisdictions ==
Early in the 11th century, Norway became christianed. In the [[Middle Ages]], Norway's territory was different, greater than the present. Below is a list of dioceses within the then boundaries, before the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Protestant Reformation]].

===Dioceses subordinate the Archdiocese of Nidaros ===
The Ancient Nidaros Diocese (1015 - 1152) covered North-Western and Northern Norway before the [[Archdiocese]] was established.

&lt;big&gt;'''Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] (at [[Trondheim]])'''&lt;/big&gt;

{{anchor|bishops}}
The Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros (1152 - 1537) headed an [[ecclesiastical province]] which included the following [[suffragan diocese]]s.

The '''Madhurāṣṭakam''' ({{lang-sa|मधुराष्टकम्}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] composition in devotion of [[Krishna]], composed by the [[Hindu]] [[Bhakti]] philosopher-poet Sripad [[Vallabha Acharya]]. Sripad Vallabhacharya flourished under the patronage of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] King Sri Krishnadevarya in the late fifteenth century Andhra State and created many other literary pieces including the Vyasa Sutra Bhashya, Jaimini Sutra Bhasya, Bhagavata Tika Subodhini, Pushti Pravala Maryada and Siddhanta Rahasya in Sanskrit.

The devotional hymn "Madhurāṣṭakam" of Sri Vallabhacarya was created to lead the devotee in [[Pustimarga]], the Path of Grace, which involves a constant love-filled devotion to Krishna by various acts of homage, such as singing (kirtana), remembering (smarana), conceptualising and beholding (darshana) a beatific image of the deity upon singing of the Madhurāṣṭakam, and offering of services (seva). These acts enable the devotee to enter into the divine presence of Sri Krishna and to experience the Lord's real essence (svarupa) which are in fact, succinctly laid down by the Madhurāṣṭakam. Hence, Madhurāṣṭakam plays an instrumental role in the realisation of the Lord.

== Aṣṭakam as a Form and a Genre==
''{{see also|Aṣṭakam}}''
The term ''[[aṣṭakam]]'' is derived from the Sanskrit word {{IAST|aṣṭan}}, meaning "eight". An ''aṣṭakam'' is made up of eight stanzas.

''Aṣṭakam'' belong to the genre of lyric poetry, which tends to be short, extremely melodic, and contemplative. It reflects and portrays the poet's own feelings, states of mind, and perceptions about the theme or character in the ''aṣṭakam''.

==Context==
The thought behind the composition in 'Bhakti mixed with Love', being a typical frame of devotion and dedication in the [[Bhakti movement]]. In the loved bhakti frame, the devotee falls in love with the almighty and to the devotee, all the attributes and actions of the Lord God appears sweet, as those appear to a lover.

The Madhurāṣṭakam deals with the qualities and deeds of Lord Krishna, all of which have been conceptualized as been dipped in [[madhu]], meaning honey or nectar. In the eyes of the devotee, everything that pertains to Lord is sweet and graceful, he being the adhipati (Lord and Godhead) of all sweetness.

The body of the Madhurāṣṭakam includes many qualities, attributes and motifs associated with Krishna, including the [[Venu|venu flute]], cows, the [[Yamuna|Yamuna river]], [[gopi]]s, and [[lilas of Krishna|Krishna's lila]]. These symbols and motifs related to the life and deeds of Lord Sri Krishna have been labelled as 'sweet' in the astakam.

==In popular culture==
Madhurāṣṭakam has been a very popular devotional song. Renowned singers, including the classical legend [[M. S. Subbulakshmi]] and semi-classical singer [[K. J. Yesudas]] have given classical and semi-classical renditions of the song. In the [[Odissi]] dance tradition, the Madhurāṣṭakam comprises an elegant and intoxicating theme for dance drama.

[[File:Nat oun.JPG|thumb|''Nat oun'' (Suxorimus) hung on a post in a house.]]
The '''nats''' ({{lang|my|နတ်‌}}; [[MLC Transcription System|MLCTS]]: ''nat''; {{IPA-my|naʔ|IPA}}) are spirits worshipped in [[Myanmar]] in conjunction with [[Buddhism]]. They are divided between the 37 Great Nats and all the rest (i.e., spirits of trees, water, etc.). Almost all of the 37 Great Nats were human beings who met violent deaths ({{lang|my|စိမ်းသေ}}, lit. "green death"). They may thus also be called ''nat sein'' ({{lang|my|နတ်စိမ်း}}; lit. green spirits). The word 'sein', while meaning 'green', is being used to mean 'raw' in this context. There are however two types of nats in Burmese Buddhist belief.

Nat spirits are termed lower nats or ''auk nat''s ({{lang|my|အောက်နတ်}}), whether named or unnamed, whereas ''ahtet nat''s ({{lang|my|အထက်နတ်}}) or higher nat [[Deva (Buddhism)|dewas]] inhabit the six heavens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/axismundi/2000/syncretism_in_burma.php|title=Syncretism in Burma and Thailand|first=Kelly|last=Braun|date=January 15, 2001|publisher=''Axis Mundi'', [[University of Alberta]]|accessdate=2008-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808004219/http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/axismundi/2000/syncretism_in_burma.php|archive-date=2007-08-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like [[sainthood]], nats can be designated for a variety of reasons, including those only known in certain regions in Burma. Nat worship is less common in urban areas than in rural areas, and is practised among [[List of ethnic groups in Myanmar|ethnic minorities of Myanmar]] as well as in the mainstream [[Bamar people|Bamar]] society. It is however among the [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] Bamar that the most highly developed form of ceremony and ritual is seen.&lt;ref name="BBP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhammaweb.net/books/Cult_in_Burmese_Religion.pdf|title=The Spirit-possession Cult in the Burmese Religion|last=Brac de la Perriere|first=Benedicte|publisher=dhammaweb.net|accessdate=2008-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304070725/http://www.dhammaweb.net/books/Cult_in_Burmese_Religion.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Burmese village has a ''nat sin'' ({{lang|my|နတ်စင်}}) which essentially serves as a shrine to the village guardian nat called the ''ywa saung nat'' ({{lang|my|ရွာစောင့်နတ်}}). An offertory coconut ({{lang|my|နတ်အုန်းသီး}}) is often hung on the main southeast post ({{lang|my|ဥရူတိုင်}}) in the house, wearing a ''[[gaung baung]]'' (headdress) and surrounded by perfume, as an offering to the Min Mahagiri (Lord of the Great Mountain), also known as the ''ein dwin'' ({{lang|my|အိမ်တွင်းနတ်}}) or ''ein saung'' ({{lang|my|အိမ်စောင့်နတ်}}) (house guardian) nat. One may inherit a certain member or in some instances two of the 37 Nats as ''mi hsaing hpa hsaing'' ({{lang|my|မိဆိုင်ဖဆိုင်}}; lit. mother's side, father's side) from one or both parents' side to worship depending on where their families originally come from. One also has a personal guardian spirit called ''ko saung nat'' ({{lang|my|ကိုယ်စောင့်နတ်}}).&lt;ref name="MES"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spiro|first=Melford|authorlink=Melford Spiro|title=Burmese Supernaturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yF69_7jFbisC&amp;pg=PA114|year=1996|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-1901-5|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nat worship and Buddhism==
[[File:Nat Pwe.JPG|thumb| A ''nat kadaw'' dressed as U Min Gyaw at a ''nat pwè'' in [[Mingun]], August 1989]]

Academic opinions vary as to whether Burmese Buddhism and Burmese spirit worship are two separate entities, or merged into a single religion. Some Burmese might say spirit worship is superstition and downplay its role in society. The formalizing of the official 37 Nats by King [[Anawrahta]] (1044–1077) of [[Bagan]], has been interpreted as Burmanisation and establishment of Bamar supremacy in the [[Ayeyarwady Region|Irrawaddy]] valley after the unification of the country and founding of the First Burmese Empire.&lt;ref name="BBP"/&gt;
Worship of nats predates Buddhism in Burma. With the arrival of Buddhism, however, the nats were merged, syncretistically, with Buddhism.

==Nat worship and ecology==
[[File:Distant Popa.JPG|thumb|[[Mount Popa]] from [[Kyaukpadaung]] road, the smaller precipice ''Taung Kalat'' with its nat shrines atop to left of picture ]]
The widespread traditional belief among rural folks that there are forest guardian spirits called ''taw saung nat''s ({{lang|my|တောစောင့်နတ်}}) and mountain guardian spirits called ''taung saung nat''s ({{lang|my|တောင်စောင့်နတ်}}) appears to act as a deterrent against environmental destruction up to a point. Indiscriminate felling particularly of large trees is generally eschewed owing to the belief that they are dwellings of tree spirits called ''yokkazo'' ({{lang|my|ရုက္ခစိုး}}) and that such an act would bring the wrath of the nat upon the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp1999/1-99/tra.htm|title=Traditional Myanmar Folk Beliefs and Forest and Wildlife Conservation|author=Dr Sein Tu|publisher=''Perspective'' (January 1999)|accessdate=2008-09-13}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular nat festivals==
[[File:Mount Popa.JPG|thumb|Mount Popa and ''Taung Kalat'' to left of picture seen from a distance across a dry riverbed]]
[[File:Offerings of alcohol to Burmese nat.jpg|thumb|Offerings of alcohol and liquor to [[Min Kyawzwa]] at a ''nat pwe'' in Amarapura]]
The most important nat pilgrimage site in Burma is [[Mount Popa]], an extinct volcano with numerous temples and relic sites atop a mountain 1300 metres tall located near [[Bagan]] in central Burma. The annual festival is held on the full moon of the month of ''Natdaw'' (December) of the [[Burmese calendar]].&lt;ref name="mha"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/195802/burma-folk-religion|title=Folk-Elements in Burmese Buddhism|author=Maung Htin Aung|date=February 1958|publisher=''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''|accessdate=2008-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906170440/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/195802/burma-folk-religion|archive-date=2008-09-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taungbyone, north of [[Mandalay]] in [[Madaya Township]], is another major site with the festival held each year starting on the eleventh waxing day and including the full moon in the month ''Wagaung'' (August).&lt;ref name="smm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp1997/8-97/nat8-97.htm|title=The Taung Byone Nat Festival|author=Shwe Mann Maung|publisher=''Perspective'' (August 1997)|accessdate=2008-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717075934/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp1997/8-97/nat8-97.htm|archive-date=2004-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yadanagu at [[Amarapura]], held a week later in honour of Popa Medaw ("Mother of Popa"), who was the mother of the Taungbyone Min Nyinaung ("Brother Lords"), is also a popular nat festival.&lt;ref name="MES"/&gt;

Nats have human characteristics, wants, and needs. They are flawed, having desires considered derogatory and immoral in mainstream Buddhism. During a ''nat pwè'', which is a festival during which nats are propitiated, ''nat kadaw''s ({{lang|my|နတ်ကတော်}} "lord-consort",&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ho|first=Tamara C.|author2=Discourse|date=Fall 2009|title=Transgender, Transgression, and Translation: A Cartography of Nat Kadaws|volume=31|issue=3|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/discourse/v031/31.3.ho.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. "[[mediumship|medium]], [[shamanism|shaman]]") dance and embody the nat's spirit in a trance. Historically, the ''nat kadaw'' profession was hereditary and passed from mother to daughter. Until the 1980s, few ''nat gadaw''s were male. Since the 1980s, persons identified by outsiders as [[trans woman|trans women]] or [[transvestism|gay male transvestites]] have increasingly performed these roles.&lt;ref name="Ho" /&gt;

Music, often accompanied by a [[hsaing waing]] ("orchestra"), adds much to the mood of the ''nat pwè'', and many are entranced. People come from far to take part in the festivities in various nat shrines called ''nat kun'' or ''nat naan'', get drunk on [[palm wine]] and dance wildly in fits of ecstasy to the wild beat of the Hsaing waing music, possessed by the nats.&lt;ref name="mha"/&gt;

Whereas ''nat pwè''s are annual events celebrating a particular member of the 37 Nats regarded as the tutelary spirit in a local region within a local community, with familial custodians of the place and tradition and with royal sponsorship in ancient times, hence evocative of royal rituals, there are also ''nat kannah pwè''s where individuals would have a pavilion set up in a neighbourhood and the ritual is generally linked to the entire pantheon of nats. The ''nat kadaw''s as an independent profession made their appearance in the latter half of the 19th century as spirit mediums, and ''nat kannah''s are more of an urban phenomenon which evolved to satisfy the need of people who had migrated from the countryside to towns and cities but who wished to carry on their traditions or ''yo-ya'' of supplicating the ''mi hsaing hpa hsaing'' tutelary spirit of their native place.&lt;ref name="BBP"/&gt;

==List of official nats==
[[File:IMG banana-offering.JPG|thumb|Traditional offerings of bananas and coconut at a nat shrine]]
[[File:Brother Nats.JPG|thumb|Me Wunna with her sons [[Shwe Hpyin Naungdaw|Min Gyi]] and [[Shwe Hpyin Nyidaw|Min Lay]] at Mount Popa]]
King [[Anawrahta]] of Bagan (1044–1077) designated an official pantheon of 37 nats after he had failed to enforce a ban on nat worship. His stratagem of incorporation eventually succeeded by bringing nats to [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] portrayed worshipping [[Gautama Buddha]] and by enlisting [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] , a [[dharmapala|Buddhist protective deity]], to head the pantheon above the Mahagiri nats as [[Thagyamin]].&lt;ref name="mha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RDeC"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qs2SB4XanBUC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=nat+spirits&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4T1_i7nCyX&amp;sig=xtDhIDMENUn3bxxoZRYXjJDYKzI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA158,M1|title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism|last=DeCaroli|first=Robert|year=2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], US|accessdate=2008-09-13 | isbn=978-0-19-516838-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven out of the 37 Nats appear to be directly associated with the life and times of Anawrahta.&lt;ref name="RDeC"/&gt;

The official pantheon is made up predominantly of those from the royal houses of [[History of Burma|Burmese history]], but also contains nats of [[Thai people|Thai]] (Yun Bayin) and [[Shan people|Shan]] (Maung Po Tu) descent; illustrations of them show them in Burmese royal dress.

'''Our Lady of Good Health''' ({{lang-ta|'''ஆரோக்கிய அன்னை'''}} ''Ārōkkiya annai''), also known as '''Our Lady of Valankanni''', is the title given to the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Blessed Virgin Mary]] by those who believe that she twice appeared in [[Velankanni Town]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] in the 16th to 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velankannichurch.in/shrine-miracles.php Description of the miracles at the Velankanni Shrine]&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, the first Marian apparition is said to have occurred to a young boy delivering butter-milk to a man who lived far away. During his travels, the boy stopped to rest beside a lake that was shaded by a [[Banyan tree]]. A beautiful woman, carrying a child, is said to have appeared, and asked the boy for some milk to feed her child, which he gave. When he reached the home for his milk delivery, he apologised for the delay and that there would be less milk in his pot. But when they opened the lid of the milk pot, the container was brimming with milk. 

The second apparition occurred a few years later. A lame boy would sell buttermilk to passing travellers, who would pause in the shade of a large Bayan tree, to escape the heat of the day. However, he had no customers. Suddenly, an ethereal woman, holding a child appeared before him, and asked for a cup of buttermilk. He gave her a cup, which she fed to her child. The woman asked the boy to go to Nagapattinam, and find a certain Catholic man in the town, and tell him to build a chapel at Vailankanni in her honour. Apparently cured, the boy ran to Nagapattinam, where he found the man and told him his story.

These apparitions have not been approved by the Holy See.

The [[Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health]] erected by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and the [[Demographics of India|Indians]] stands at the site where the buttermilk seller saw Mary and Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=JJwYBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Nadu+Thittu+shrine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LzEIDgq6il&amp;sig=glnu4E8ZI6AcN8gl1NlSP6adnIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfzv_mocvaAhULObwKHULwAFYQ6AEIaTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Nadu%20Thittu%20shrine&amp;f=false Mukherjee, Rila. 2009.

'''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]], Queen of [[Poland]]''', '''Our Lady of Licheń''', or '''Virgin of [[Licheń Stary|Licheń]]''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[icon]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated by its Polish faithful dating from 1772 and is permanently enshrined within the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Licheń]], in central Poland, which was built to honor it, and receives about 1.5 million pilgrims per year.&lt;ref&gt;''Moved by Mary: The Power of Pilgrimage in the Modern World'' by Anna-Karina Hermkens, Willy Jansen, Catrien Notermans 2009 {{ISBN|0-7546-6789-8}} page 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Poland'' by Neal Bedford 2008 {{ISBN|1-74104-479-0}} page 401&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matka Boska lichenska.jpg |thumb|200px|Close-up of the image.]]
[[File:Licheń - bazylika 08.JPG|thumb|200px|The framed icon (lower image in red) on the altar of the basilica.]]

Along with the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]], located in [[Częstochowa]], southern Poland, the image is one of the two most venerated Marian images in Poland. The image was canonically crowned by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 15 August 1967.

==Description==
In the central image, the Virgin Mary has a gold dress&lt;ref&gt;A new golden dress (named 'sapphire') was made in 2017 for the gratitude of the jubilee of 50 years from coronation of the icon in 1967. See the [http://www.lichen.pl/pl/579/szafirowa_sukienka_matki_bozej_lichenskiej official website of the shrine] (Polish).&lt;/ref&gt;, is being crowned by two angels and is surrounded by a ring of stars. Below the image a ribbon carries the inscription: "Queen of Poland, give us days of peace." The image measures 9.5 × 15.5&amp;nbsp;cm and is on larger panel of 16 × 25&amp;nbsp;cm. There is a second crown above the image, on the larger panel.

==Legend and history==

The icon was painted in 1772 as a replica of the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary enshrined in [[Rokitno, Międzyrzecz County]] in Western Poland. According to legend, a Polish soldier (called Thomas Kłossowski) was wounded in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in 1813 and had a vision of the Virgin Mary who saved him from death and instructed him to look for the image upon his return to Poland. Kłossowski is then said to have looked for and found the image in the woods in [[Grąblin]] as instructed.

According to oral tradition, in 1850 Kłossowski and shepherd Nicholas Sikatka witnessed several apparitions of the Virgin Mary who called for repentance and prayer. In the apparitions, the Virgin reportedly predicted war and a cholera epidemic, but also gave hope. During the cholera plague of 1852, the image became famous for performing miracles.

On 29 September  1852 the image was moved to the parish church in [[Licheń]] and remained there until 2006.  Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]], the Primate of the Millennium gave its [[Canonical Coronation]] towards the image with the approval of Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967.

==The basilica==
In 1994 the construction of the new basilica of [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen]] was started to house the image and accommodate the large number of pilgrims. Pope [[John Paul II]] blessed the basilica in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061999_lichen_en.html Vatican web site: John Paul II at Lichen]&lt;/ref&gt; The basilica is Poland's largest church, the seventh largest in Europe and eleventh in the world. The basilica's organ manufactured by the Zych company (157 stops, 6 manuals and pedalboard) is the largest instrument in Poland, the fourth largest in Europe and thirteenth largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Licheńskie organy na tle największych instrumentów Polski, Europy i świata |last=Szostak |first=Michał |date=2017 |publisher=Zakład Gospodarczy "Dom Pielgrzyma" |isbn=9788364126147 |location=Licheń Stary |pages=154-155 |oclc=1005163172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 2, 2006 the image was placed in the main altar of the basilica.

'''Pharnabazus II''' was a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]n soldier and statesman.  He was the son of [[Pharnaces II of Phrygia]] and grandson of [[Pharnabazus I of Phrygia|Pharnabazus I]], and great-grandson of [[Artabazos I of Phrygia|Artabazus I]]. He and his male ancestors had governed the [[satrapy]] of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] from its headquarters at [[Dascylium]] since 478 BC. He married Apama, daughter of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]], and their son [[Artabazus of Phrygia|Artabazus]] was likewise a satrap of Phrygia.

According to research by [[Theodor Nöldeke]], he was descended from [[Otanes]], one of the associates of [[Darius the Great|Darius]] in the murder of [[Smerdis]].

Pharnabazus II is first recorded as satrap of this province in 413 BC, when, having received orders from [[Darius II of Persia]] to send in the outstanding tribute of the Greek cities on the [[Ionia]]n coast, he, like [[Tissaphernes]] of [[Caria]], entered into negotiations with [[Sparta]] and began a war with [[Classical Athens|Athens]].  The conduct of the war was much hindered by the rivalry between the two satraps, of whom Pharnabazus was by far the more energetic and upright.  Although Pharnabazus initially fought with the Spartans against the Athenians during the [[Peloponnesian war]], even, in one instance, coming to the rescue of the retreating Spartan forces, riding his horse into the sea to fend off the Athenians while encouraging his regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon Hellenica, 1.1.6&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he eventually came into conflict with the Spartan king, Agesilaus &lt;ref&gt;Xenophon Hellenica, 4.1&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to aid the Athenians against the Spartans in the [[Corinthian War]] (395–387 BC). During this period, Pharnabazus is notable for his command of the Achaemenid fleet at the [[Battle of Cnidus]] in which the Persians, allied with the former Athenian admiral and then commissioned into Persian service, [[Conon]], annihilated the Spartan fleet, ending their brief status as the dominant Greek naval power.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon Hellenica, 4.3&lt;/ref&gt; Pharnabazus followed up this victory by capturing several Spartan-allied cities in Ionia. [[Abydus (Hellespont)|Abydus]] and [[Sestus]] were the only cities to refuse to expel the Lacedaemonians despite threats from Pharnabazus to make war on them.  He attempted to force these into submission by ravaging the surrounding territory, but this proved fruitless, leading him to leave Conon in charge of winning over the cities in the Hellespont.  From there, Pharnabazus sailed with his fleet to the Aegean island of [[Melos]] and established a base there.  He proceeded to take revenge on the Spartans by invading Lacedaemonian territory, where he laid waste to [[Pherae]] and raided along the coast. Eventually he left due to scarce resources and few harbors for his fleet in the area, as well as the looming possibility of Lacedaemonian relief forces being dispatched.  He then besieged and captured [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], proceeding to install an Athenian governor and a garrison to cripple Sparta's offensive military capabilities.  He also gave Sparta's rivals funds to further threaten the Lacedaemonians.  After being convinced by Conon that allowing him to rebuild the [[Long Walls]] around [[Piraeus]], the main port of Athens, would be a major blow to the Lacedaemonians, Pharnabazus eagerly gave Conon a fleet and additional funds to accomplish this task.  As a reward for his success, Pharnabazus was allowed to marry the king's daughter.  He was then reassigned to help command a military expedition into Egypt, having proven his ability against the Spartans.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon Hellenica, 4.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trouble in the West: Egypt and the Persian Empire, 525-332 BC|last=Ruzicka|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-19-976662-8|location=New York, NY|pages=55–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rees David''' was an 18th-century Welsh schoolmaster, and early Arminian Baptist. Very ittle is really known about him. One of his schools was in or near [[Newcastle Emlyn]] (he was one of the signatories of a letter sent to Rhydwilym church from [[Llandysul]] in 1725), but when, in 1729 he adopted Arminian views, he moved his school to Hengoed, [[Glamorganshire]]. Later(about 1730), however he unfortunately became upset with doctrinal disputes at Hengoed, David refused to compromise, and turning his back both on Hengoed and on the Baptist denomination, instead made his living as an inn-keeper in [[Brecknock]].

According to his good friend Joshua Thomas, He died in Brecon ‘several years after 1746’.

'''Rehal''' ([[Arabic]]: رِحال) is an X-shaped foldable book rest used for placing holy books during [[recitation]]. This book rest, which is usually made of wood, is common in [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Islam]].

The book rest, often called "Quran stand" by Muslims, is also spelled as Rihal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/od/quran/f/mushaf.htm |title=Proper Handling of the Quran |publisher=[[About.com]] |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used historically for many generations in [[South Asia]]n and [[Arab world|Arab]] countries, it is used for paying respect to the holy books such as [[Ramayana]] in Hinduism, [[Japji Sahib]] in Sikhism and the [[Quran]] in Islam while reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicbookstore.com/a5938.html |title=Extra Large Wooden Quran Stand |publisher=Islamicbookstore.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{nihongo|'''''sandō'''''|参道||visiting path}} in Japanese architecture is the road approaching either a [[Shinto shrine]] or a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]].&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version.&lt;/ref&gt; Its point of origin is usually straddled in the first case by a Shinto ''[[torii]]'', in the second by a Buddhist ''[[sanmon]]'', gates which mark the beginning of the shrine's or temple territory. The word {{Nihongo4||道|dō}} can refer both to a path or road, and to the path of one's life's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;See, Karatedo.  c.f. Taoism 道&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be [[Traditional_lighting_equipment_of_Japan#T.C5.8Dr.C5.8D|stone lanterns]] and other decorations at any point along its course.

A ''sandō'' can be called a {{nihongo4|front sandō|表参道|omote-sandō}}, if it is the main entrance, or a {{nihongo4|rear sandō|裏参道|ura-sandō}} if it is a secondary point of entrance, especially to the rear; {{nihongo4|side sandō|脇参道|waki-sandō}} are also sometimes found. The famous [[Omotesandō]] district in Tokyo, for example, takes its name from the nearby main access path to [[Meiji Shrine]] where an ''ura-sandō'' also used to exist. &lt;ref name="ameba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ameba.jp/special/2008/10/18907.html |title=Omotesandō ga aru nara, Urasandō mo aru no de wa |publisher=Ameba News |language=Japanese |accessdate=4 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719173749/http://news.ameba.jp/special/2008/10/18907.html |archivedate=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Separation of Light from Darkness''''' is, from the perspective of the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] chronology, the first of nine central panels that run along the center of [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and which depict scenes from the Book of Genesis. Michelangelo probably completed this panel in the summer of 1512, the last year of the Sistine ceiling project. It is one of five smaller scenes that alternate with four larger scenes that run along the center of the Sistine ceiling. The ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' is based on verses 3–5 from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
 
Although in terms of the Genesis chronology it is the first of nine central panels along the Sistine ceiling, the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' was the last of the nine panels painted by Michelangelo. Michelangelo painted the Sistine ceiling in two stages. Between May 1508 and the summer of 1511, he completed the "entrance half" of the Sistine chapel and ended this stage by painting the ''Creation of Eve'' and the scenes flanking this central panel. After an idle period of about 6 months, he painted the "altar half," starting with the ''Creation of Adam'', between the winter of 1511 and October 1512.

==Composition==

[[File:First Day of Creation.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Four ''ignudi'' and two shields or medallions surround the image of God in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness''&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', the image of God is framed by four ''ignudi'' and by two shields or medallions. The ''ignudi'' are young, nude males that Michelangelo painted as supporting figures at each corner of the five smaller narrative scenes along the center of the ceiling. There are a total of 20 ''ignudi''. These figures are all different and appear less constrained within their space than the Ancestors of Christ or the Bronze Nudes. In the earliest frescoes painted by Michelangelo toward the entrance of the Sistine chapel, the ''ignudi'' are paired, and their poses are similar but with minor variations. The variations in the poses increase with each set until the poses of the final set of four ''ignudi'' in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' bear no relation to each other.

Although the meaning of these figures has never been completely clear, the Sistine scholar Heinrich Pfeiffer has proposed that the four ''ignudi'' associated with the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' represent day and night, which echo the theme of light and darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Heinrich W. The Sistine Chapel: A New Vision. New York/London, Abbeville Press Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he points out that the ''ignudo'' next to God's right hand (on the side of darkness) is stretching as if awakening from sleep in the morning, that the diagonally opposed ''ignudo'' below God's knee (on the side of light) is carrying a heavy bundle of oak garlands on his shoulders, representing a daytime activity, and that the ''ignudo'' next to God's left arm is falling asleep and signifies nighttime.
Pfeiffer and other scholars have also suggested that in Michelangelo's Sistine iconography the ''ignudi'' represent angels and that the Bronze Nudes below the ''ignudi'' are fallen angels.

[[Image:Michelangelos David.jpg|thumb|right|''Contrapposto'' pose in Michelangelo's ''David''. The shoulders of the figure are seen to angle in one direction, the pelvis in another.]]

Two shields or medallions accompany each set of four ''ignudi'' in the five smaller Genesis panels along the center of the Sistine ceiling. They are often described as painted to resemble bronze. Each is decorated with a picture from either the Old Testament or the Book of Maccabees from the Apocrypha. The subjects of the shields are often violent. In the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' the shield above God shows Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac (Genesis 22:9–12), and the one below God shows the prophet Elijah as he is carried up to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11).

At the center of the composition, God is shown in ''[[contrapposto]]'' rising into the sky, with arms outstretched separating the light from the darkness. Michelangelo employed in this fresco the challenging ceiling fresco technique of ''[[sotto in su]]'' ("from below, upward"), which makes a figure appear as if it is rising above the viewer by using foreshortening. The contrapposto pose was also used by Michelangelo in the ''David''. It is reported that Michelangelo painted this fresco in a single ''giornata'', that is, a single working day of approximately eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Dixon, Andrew. Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel. London, England: The Orion Publishing Group Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During Michelangelo's lifetime, this fresco was considered evidence of the painter's technical prowess at its peak. For instance, Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574), Michelangelo's student and biographer, wrote in 1550:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Furthermore, to demonstrate the perfection of his art and the greatness of God, Michelangelo depicted God dividing the light from darkness in these scenes, where He is seen in all His majesty as He sustains himself alone with open arms with the demonstration of love and creative energy.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. The Lives of the Artists. 1550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Art historians have noted several unusual features of this fresco. Andrew Graham-Dixon has pointed out that God has exaggerated pectoral muscles suggestive of female breasts, which he interprets as Michelangelo's attempt to illustrate "male strength but also the fecundity of the female principle."&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Dixon 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it has been noted that the anatomy of God's neck is too complex and does not resemble the normal contour of the neck. The lighting scheme of the image has been noted to be inconsistent; whereas the entire scene is illuminated from the bottom left, God's neck appears to have a different light source from the right.

==Anatomical interpretations==

[[Image:Michelangelo neuroanatomy.jpg|thumb|left| Suk and Tamargo proposed that there are three concealed neuroanatomical images in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', the first panel in the Genesis series.]]
[[Image:Michelangelo Sistine Chapel - Ignudo above Libyan Sibyl - restored.jpg|thumb|upright|right| Ignudo facing God in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness''.]]

Several authors have proposed that Michelangelo concealed anatomical images in this fresco and that these anatomical images account for its unusual features. In an article published in the journal ''[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]]'' in May 2010, Ian Suk, a medical illustrator, and Rafael Tamargo, a neurosurgeon, both from the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], suggested that Michelangelo concealed three neuroanatomical images in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Suk | first1=Ian |last2=Tamargo|first2=Rafael J.| date=May 2010 |title=Concealed Neuroanatomy in Michelangelo's Separation of Light From Darkness in the Sistine Chapel (abstract) | journal=[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]] |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=851–861 |publisher= |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000368101.34523.E1 |url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/2010/05000/Concealed_Neuroanatomy_in_Michelangelo_s.1.aspx |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/michelangelos-secret-message-in-the-sistine-chapel-a-juxtaposition-of-god-and-the-human-brain/ | title=Michelangelo's secret message in the Sistine Chapel: A juxtaposition of God and the human brain | first=R. Douglas |last=Fields | date=27 May 2010 | work=[[Scientific American]] | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suk and Tamargo explained that Michelangelo started to dissect cadavers at the age of 17–19 years and continued his anatomical studies throughout his life. As a result of his dissections, Michelangelo probably developed a detailed understanding of gross anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. They showed that the anatomical details in God's neck are unlike those of either other necks painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel or of other necks painted by Michelangelo's contemporaries, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaello Sanzio (Raphael). The unusual anatomy of God's neck is particularly evident when it is contrasted with the anatomy of the neck of the ignudo facing God in the upper left corner of the panel. The position of the neck of this ignudo is almost identical to that of God's neck, yet the ignudo's neck does not have any of the unusual lines found in God's neck. It is possible that Michelangelo placed these two analogous neck perspectives side by side to emphasize and contrast the hidden image in God's neck.

Suk and Tamargo suggested that Michelangelo concealed a sophisticated image of the undersurface of the brainstem in God's neck and that by following Michelangelo's lines in God's neck, one can outline an anatomically correct image of the brainstem, cerebellum, temporal lobes, and optic chiasm. In addition, they suggested that Michelangelo also included an anterior view of the spinal cord in God's chest and an image of the optic nerves and globes in God's abdomen. They showed how a "shadow analysis" of the unusual lines in God's neck correspond to specific spaces around the brainstem known as the "arachnoid cisterns," which were described in detail much later in 1875 but which Michelangelo inadvertently depicted in God's neck since he was able to render images with almost photographic accuracy. They concluded that "being a painter of genius, a master anatomist, and a deeply religious man, Michelangelo cleverly enhanced his depiction of God in the iconographically critical panels on the Sistine Chapel vault with concealed images of the brain and in this way celebrated not only the glory of God, but also that of His most magnificent creation."

[[File:Michelangelo, Creation of Adam 04.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Meshberger wrote that Michelangelo concealed an image of the brain in the shroud surrounding God in the ''[[Creation of Adam]]''.]]

Of note is that in an article published in the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in October 1990, Frank Meshberger, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Indiana, explained that Michelangelo similarly concealed an image of the brain in the shroud surrounding God in the ''[[Creation of Adam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meshberger |first1=Frank Lynn |date=10 October 1990 |title=An Interpretation of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam Based on Neuroanatomy |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume=264 |issue=14 |pages=1837–41 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |location=[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] | doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03450140059034 |pmid=2205727 }} [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1229086804171881877 Pdf]. [http://www.mentalhealthandillness.com/creation_fr.html Excerpt] on Mental Health &amp; Illness.com. Retrieved 21 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Since Michelangelo painted the ''Creation of Adam'' and the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', along with two other Genesis panels, as a single thematic unit between the winter of 1511 and October 1512, it is possible that these four central panels have an underlying anatomical motif. Indeed, Garabed Eknoyan, a nephrologist from [[Baylor College of Medicine]], proposed in an article published in ''[[Kidney International]]'' in March 2000 that Michelangelo concealed an image of a kidney in the ''Separation of Land and Water'', the third panel in the Genesis series.&lt;ref name="Kidney"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Eknoyan | first1=Garabed |date=March 2000 |title=Michelangelo: Art, anatomy, and the kidney |url=http://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538%2815%2946851-6/fulltext |journal=[[Kidney International]] | volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=1190–1201 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Amsterdam]] | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2000.00947.x |accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo was particularly interested in kidney function because he suffered from kidney stones throughout his adult life and documented this interest in his letters and poems, according to Eknoyan.

[[File:Dividing water from Heaven.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eknoyan suggested&lt;ref name="Kidney"/&gt; that Michelangelo concealed an image of a kidney in the ''Separation of Land and Water'', the third panel in the Genesis series.]]

Alternatively, the concealed anatomical image in God's neck in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' has been interpreted as a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland). In an article published in the ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' in December 2003, Lennart Bondeson and Anne-Greath Bondeson from Malmo University Hospital in Sweden, argued that the abnormality in God's neck is a goiter.&lt;ref&gt;Bondeson, L., and Bondeson, A. G.. Michelangelo's divine goitre. J. R. Soc. Med. 96: 609–611, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation has been challenged on the basis that goiters typically occur lower in the neck and, as stated by Suk and Tamargo, that "it is unlikely that Michelangelo, a deeply religious individual, would have defiled the image of God in this important panel by giving God a goiter."

Along these lines, Gilson Barreto and Marcelo G. de Oliveira, in a book published in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Barreto, G., and de Oliveira, M. G.. A Arte Secreta de Michelangelo. Uma Licao de Anatomia na Capela Sistina. Editoria Arx, Sao Paulo, Brasil, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' and noted that God's upper chest and outstretched arms define a "U" shape, which they suggested is reminiscent of the hyoid bone, although they do not offer a thematic explanation for this structure in the fresco.

The '''Sikligar''' is a community found in the states of [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] in [[India]]. They are also known as the ''Moyal and Panchal''. They are [[Hindu]] in Gujarat and [[Sikh]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], and both Hindu and Sikh in Haryana.&lt;ref name=Gujarat2003pp1287-1291&gt;{{cite book |title=People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part Three |editor1-first=R.

== Origin ==
The [[Arabic]] word ''saiqal'' means a ''polisher'', and the Sikligar are those people who had the hereditary duty of polishing [[weapon]]s.&lt;ref name=Gujarat2003pp1287-1291 /&gt; Many administrators of the [[British Raj]], such as [[H. A. Rose]], [[Denzil Ibbetson]] and [[William Crooke]] wrote books that referred to the blacksmith communities as ''Lohars'', although in fact that term refers to a specific group of people and is not interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strategies of social change in India |first1=Paramjit S. |last1=Judge |first2=Gurpreet |last2=Bal |publisher=M.D. Publications |year=1996 |isbn=978-81-7533-006-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lKM4aWhIH0C |page=54 |accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are a nomadic community, often with encampments at the edge of towns and cities. The Sikligar claim to have been [[Rajput]]s who fled from Islamic invading armies and subsequently became weapon polishers to disguise themselves from their foes. Their ancestral home is said to be the city of [[Kannauj]], but they speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. The community is strictly [[Endogamy|endogamous]] and is divided into twelve clans with equal status. These are the Kanthiwala Bhand, Mole Bhand, Gandhiwala Bhand, Jumarwala, Jilpatia, Pathlerde, Juni, Mat and Bardika clans.&lt;ref name=Gujarat2003pp1287-1291 /&gt;

According to their traditions, during the period of the Hindu deity [[Rama]] known as Haryana, there was a clan called the Chakreli. The Chakreli were the traditional manufacturers of swords and shields. The Chakreli lived in [[Chitor]], in [[Rajasthan]]. Their ancestors fled their hometown in the face of invaders, and the ancestors of the Haryana Sikligar moved into the region in ancient times. Other traditions relate that the community is of Rajput origin. According to those stories, they were Rajput soldiers in the army of [[Prithvi Raj Chauhan]], and became blacksmiths after his defeat at the hands of [[Mohammed Ghori]].&lt;ref name=Haryana1998pp453-459 /&gt;

In Punjab, the Sikligar claim to have immigrated from Rajasthan, where they manufactured swords. The community converted to Sikhism after they settled in Punjab, and are now found throughout the area, especially in the districts of [[Bhatinda]], and [[Ludhiana]]. The Sikligar are now divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Moyal, Tank, Junni, Dangi, Bhond, Bhori, Khichi, Tilvithya, Ghor-chare Tank, Kalyani and Churi te Biori.&lt;ref name=Punjab2003pp410-414 /&gt;

== Present circumstances ==
The Hindu Sikligar of Gujarat continue their traditional occupation of sharpening [[Knife|knives]], [[scissors]], household articles and agricultural implements. Economically, they are extremely marginalised, with cases of child labor existing.&lt;ref name=Gujarat2003pp1287-1291 /&gt;

The Sikligar in Haryana are now divided into two groups, the Hindu Sikligar and Sikh Sikligar. The difference in religions mean that both groups are distinct communities, with no intermarriage. Both speak the [[Haryanvi]] dialect. They are found mainly in the districts of [[Hisar (district)|Hissar]], [[Jind]], [[Rohtak]], [[Sirsa district|Sirsa]] and Mohendargarh. Settled in hamlets on the outskirts of towns and villages, living often in thatched huts, they are further divided into 84 clans, known as [[gotra]]s. The main ones being the [[Chauhan]], [[Nirban]], [[Taunk]], Kalilot, [[Mohil]], Joone, Dugoli Ke, Moyal, Padyar, Khankhara, [[Bhati]], Dhare, Khichi, Ghelot, Badke, [[Dangi (people)|Dangi]], Jaspal, Patwa, [[Solanki (clan)|Solanki]], Matlana, Dagar, and Banwari.

The temple is thought to be dedicated to the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological figures]] [[Heracles]] and [[Alcmene]].

[[Archaeologists]] have discovered many [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] on the site of the [[sanctuary]], which is thought to date to the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic period]]. Items recovered include [[bronze]] [[vase]]s, objects of [[lead]] and [[clay]], [[weapon]]s, [[iron]] [[tool]]s, and [[figurine]]s. Some specific artifacts named are clay [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] with yellow [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]], [[spear]]heads, and part of the arm of a [[Marble sculpture|marble]] [[Ancient Greek sculpture|statue]].

One important artifact is a bronze flask (described as "navel-shaped") in excellent condition with the inscription "Tilephilos dedicated me to Herakles" in the [[History of the Greek alphabet|archaic Greek alphabet]]. This indicates the presence of a Herakles [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]], which is linked to [[Pherae]] and is documented in the region through [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic-era]] inscriptions.

The flask had been found several years before its value was recognized when a [[natural gas]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] was built near the hill of Spartia by the Volos-Velestinos-Larissa highway (on the site of the ancient Pherae-Pagasses road). Put in storage by the XII Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of the [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Ministry for Culture]], the object was rediscovered when it was cleaned during conservation work.

{{Spirituality sidebar|western}}

'''Spiritualism''' is a [[religious movement]] based on the belief that the [[spirit]]s of the dead exist and have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living. The [[afterlife]], or the "[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]]", is seen by spiritualists, not as a static place, but as one in which spirits continue to evolve. These two beliefs — that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits are more advanced than humans — lead spiritualists to a third belief, that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about [[morality|moral]] and [[ethical issues]], as well as about the nature of [[God]]. Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as "[[spirit guide]]s"—specific spirits, often contacted, who are relied upon for spiritual guidance.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Braude /&gt; [[Spiritism]], a branch of spiritualism developed by [[Allan Kardec]] and today practiced mostly in [[Continental Europe]] and [[Latin America]], especially in [[Brazil]], emphasizes [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allankardec.com/Allan_Kardec/Le_livre_des_esprits/lesp_us.pdf]  [[Allan Kardec]], ''The Spirits' Book, Containing the Principles of Spiritist Doctrine... according to the Teachings of Spirits of High Degree, Transmitted through Various Mediums, Collected and Set in Order by Allan Kardec'', translated by [[Henry Browne Blackwell#Blackwell siblings|Anna Blackwell]], [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil|Brasil]], Federação Espírita Brasileira, 1996, {{ISBN|85-7328-022-0}}, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in [[English-speaking countries]].&lt;ref name=Braude&gt;{{cite book | last = Braude | first = Ann Braude | year = 2001 | title = Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America, Second Edition | publisher = Indiana University Press | isbn = 0-253-21502-1 | page = 296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britten"&gt;{{cite book | last = Britten| first = Emma Hardinge| authorlink = Emma Hardinge Britten| title = Nineteenth Century Miracles: Spirits and Their Work in Every Country of the Earth | publisher = New York: William Britten | year = 1884 | isbn = 0-7661-6290-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1897, spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe,&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Times | first = New York | date = 29 November 1897 | title = THREE FORMS OF THOUGHT; M.M.

Spiritualism flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining  cohesion through periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums.  Many prominent spiritualists were women, and like most spiritualists, supported causes such as the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] and [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt; By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums, and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear.&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt; Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational [[spiritualist church]]es in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

==Beliefs==

===Mediumship and spirits===
Spiritualists believe in the possibility of communication with the spirits of dead people, whom they regard as "discarnate humans".  They believe that [[mediumship|spirit mediums]] are gifted to carry on such communication, but that anyone may become a medium through study and practice. They believe that spirits are capable of growth and perfection, progressing through higher spheres or planes, and that the [[afterlife]] is not a static state, but one in which spirits evolve. The two beliefs—that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits may dwell on a higher plane—lead to a third belief, that spirits can provide knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about [[God]] and the afterlife.  Many believers therefore speak of "[[spirit guides]]"—specific spirits, often contacted, and relied upon for worldly and spiritual guidance.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;

According to spiritualists, anyone may receive spirit messages, but formal communication sessions (séances) are held by mediums, who claim thereby to receive information about the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Bret E. |year=1997 |title=Spiritualism in Antebellum America.

===Religious views===

====Declaration of Principles====

As an informal movement, spiritualism does not have a defined set of rules, but various spiritualist organizations have adopted variations on some or all of a "Declaration of Principles" developed between 1899 and 1944 and revised as recently as 2004.&lt;ref name="Leonard2005"/&gt; In October 1899, a six article "Declaration of Principles" was adopted by the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches|National Spiritualist Association]] (NSA) at a convention in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Geo. |last2=Hardy |first2=Thomas |last3=Milmokre |first3=Jas. |title=Baer-Spiritualistic Challenge |date=June 6, 1900 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/325876259/ |newspaper=Nanaimo Free Press |publisher=Geo.

==Origins==
Spiritualism first appeared in the 1840s in the "[[Burned-over District]]" of [[upstate New York]], where earlier religious movements such as [[Millerism]] and [[Mormonism]] had emerged during the [[Second Great Awakening]].

This region of New York State was an environment in which many thought direct communication with God or angels was possible, and that God would not behave harshly—for example, that God would not condemn [[baptism|unbaptised]] infants to an eternity in Hell.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;

===Swedenborg and Mesmer===
[[File:Hypnotisk seans av Richard Bergh 1887.jpg|thumb|''Hypnotic Séance''. Painting by Swedish artist [[Richard Bergh]], 1887.]]
In this environment, the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) and the teachings of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815) provided an example for those seeking direct personal knowledge of the afterlife. Swedenborg, who claimed to communicate with spirits while awake, described the structure of the spirit world. Two features of his view particularly resonated with the early spiritualists: first, that there is not a single Hell and a single Heaven, but rather a series of higher and lower heavens and hells; second, that spirits are intermediates between God and humans, so that the divine sometimes uses them as a means of communication.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;  Although Swedenborg warned against seeking out spirit contact, his works seem to have inspired in others the desire to do so.

Swedenborg was formerly a highly regarded inventor and scientist, achieving several engineering innovations and studying physiology and anatomy. According to New Age, Neopagan and Religious Movements, “in 1741, he also began to have  series of intense mystical experiences, dreams, and visions, claiming that he had been called by God to reform Christianity and introduce a new church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=New Age, Neopagan and New Religious Movements |location=Oakland, California |publisher=University of California Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0520281189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesmer did not contribute religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as [[hypnotism]], that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings. There was a great deal of professional showmanship inherent to demonstrations of [[Animal magnetism|Mesmerism]], and the practitioners who lectured in mid-19th-century North America sought to entertain their audiences as well as to demonstrate methods for personal contact with the divine.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;

Perhaps the best known of those who combined Swedenborg and Mesmer in a peculiarly North American synthesis was [[Andrew Jackson Davis]], who called his system the "harmonial philosophy". Davis was a practicing [[Mesmerist]], [[faith healing|faith healer]] and [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] from [[Blooming Grove, New York]]. He was also strongly influenced by the socialist theories of [[Fourierism]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Albanese. (2007). ''A Republic of Mind and Spirit. A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion''. Yale University Press. pp. 171-176, 208-218.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1847 book, ''The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa&amp;idno=ACA6166.0001.001&amp;view=toc ''The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind''], Andrew Jackson Davis, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt; dictated to a friend while in a trance state, eventually became the nearest thing to a canonical work in a spiritualist movement whose extreme [[individualism]] precluded the development of a single coherent worldview.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;

===Reform-movement links===
[[File:Fox sisters.jpeg|upright|thumb|The [[Fox sisters]]]]
Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848, as the beginning of their movement. On that date, [[Fox sisters|Kate and Margaret Fox]], of [[Arcadia, New York|Hydesville, New York]], reported that they had made contact with a spirit that was later claimed to be the spirit of a murdered peddler whose body was found in the house, though no record of such a person was ever found. The spirit was said to have communicated through rapping noises, audible to onlookers. The evidence of the senses appealed to practically-minded Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. As the first celebrity mediums, the sisters quickly became famous for their public séances in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54939577|title=Talking to the dead : Kate and Maggie Fox and the rise of spiritualism|last=Barbara.|first=Weisberg,|date=2004|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=9780060566678|edition=1st|location=[San Francisco]|oclc=54939577}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1888 the Fox sisters admitted that this "contact" with the spirit was a hoax, though shortly afterward they recanted that admission.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;

[[Amy and Isaac Post]], [[Elias Hicks|Hicksite Quakers]] from [[Rochester, New York]], had long been acquainted with the Fox family, and took the two girls into their home in the late spring of 1848. Immediately convinced of the veracity of the sisters' communications, they became early converts and introduced the young mediums to their circle of radical [[Quaker]] friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47785582|title=Radical spirits : spiritualism and women's rights in nineteenth-century America|last=Ann.|first=Braude,|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253215021|edition=2nd|location=Bloomington|oclc=47785582}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CoraLVHatch.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Cora L. V. Scott]]]]
[[File:Randolph-1.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Paschal Beverly Randolph]]]]
Consequently, many early participants in spiritualism were radical Quakers and others involved in the mid-nineteenth-century [[Reform movement|reforming movement]]. These reformers were uncomfortable with more prominent churches because those churches did little to fight [[slavery]] and even less to advance the cause of [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;

Such links with reform movements, often radically socialist, had already been prepared in the 1840s, as the example of [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] shows. After 1848, many socialists became ardent spiritualists or occultists.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Strube. (2016). "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926 Socialist Religion and the Emergence of Occultism: A Genealogical Approach to Socialism and Secularization in 19th-Century France]." In: ''Religion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist ideas, especially in the [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] vein, exerted a decisive influence on [[Allan Kardec|Kardec]] and other Spiritists.

The most popular trance lecturer prior to the [[American Civil War]] was [[Cora L. V. Scott]] (1840–1923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were speaking through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;

Another famous woman spiritualist was [[Achsa W. Sprague]], who was born November 17, 1827, in [[Plymouth Notch|Plymouth Notch, Vermont]]. At the age of 20, she became ill with [[rheumatic fever]] and credited her eventual recovery to intercession by spirits. An extremely popular trance lecturer, she traveled about the United States until her death in 1861. Sprague was an [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and an advocate of [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;

Yet another prominent spiritualist and trance medium prior to the [[Civil War (U.S.)|Civil War]] was [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] (1825–1875), of mixed race, who also played a part in the [[abolitionist]] movement.&lt;ref name="Deveney"&gt;{{cite book

Another social reform movement with significant Spiritualist involvement was the effort to improve conditions of Native Americans. As Kathryn Troy notes in a study of Indian ghosts in seances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Undoubtedly, on some level Spiritualists recognized the Indian spectres that appeared at seances as a symbol of the sins and subsequent guilt of the United States in its dealings with Native Americans. Spiritualists were literally haunted by the presence of Indians. But for many that guilt was not assuaged: rather, in order to confront the haunting and rectify it, they were galvanized into action. The political activism of Spiritualists on behalf of Indians was thus the result of combining white guilt and fear of divine judgment with a new sense of purpose and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Troy, ''The Specter of the Indian. SUNY 2017. p.151. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Believers and skeptics===
In the years following the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (séances and [[automatic writing]], for example) proved to be a profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Fox sisters were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt; Showmanship became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the [[Seybert Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11950 ''Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania''], The Seybert Commission, 1887. 2004-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montagu Williams|Williams, Montagu Stephen]]. 1891. ''Later Leaves: Being the Further Reminiscences of Montagu Williams.'' Macmillan.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=xTILAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA91,M1 See chapter 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite numerous instances of chicanery, the appeal of spiritualism was strong. Prominent in the ranks of its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families during the time of the American Civil War had seen their men go off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of photography, demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well. One well known case is that of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] who, grieving the loss of her son, organized séances in the [[White House]] which were attended by her husband, President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; The surge of spiritualism during this time, and later during [[World War I]], was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.&lt;ref name="DoyleVol1"&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle, [http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ ''The History of Spiritualism Vol I''], Arthur Conan Doyle, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the movement appealed to reformers, who fortuitously found that the spirits favored such causes ''du jour'' as abolition of slavery, and equal rights for women.&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt; It also appealed to some who had a [[materialism|materialist]] orientation and rejected organized religion.  In 1854 the [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] was converted to spiritualism after "sittings" with the American medium Maria B. Hayden (credited with introducing spiritualism to England); Owen made a public profession of his new faith in his publication ''The Rational quarterly review'' and later wrote a pamphlet, ''The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]], ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', Kessinger Publishing Company, 2003, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scientists who investigated the phenomenon also became converts.{{Citation needed|reason=Two examples does not establish "many scientists." here|date=January 2017}} They included chemist and physicist [[William Crookes#Spiritualism|William Crookes]] (1832–1919) and evolutionary biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace#Spiritualism|Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823–1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S118A.htm|title=The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural, by Alfred Russel Wallace|work=wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Pierre Curie]] was impressed by the mediumistic performances of [[Eusapia Palladino]] and advocated their scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Hurwic, ''Pierre Curie'', translated by Lilananda Dasa and Joseph Cudnik, Paris, Flammarion, 1995, pp. 65, 66, 68, 247-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent adherents included journalist and pacifist [[William T.

Stead Resource Site|work=attackingthedevil.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physician and author [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] (1859–1930).&lt;ref name="DoyleVol1" /&gt;

Doyle, who lost his son Kingsley in [[World War I]], was also a member of [[the Ghost Club]]. Founded in London in 1862, its focus was the scientific study of alleged paranormal activities in order to prove (or refute) the existence of paranormal phenomena.

The claims of spiritualists and others as to the reality of ghosts were investigated by the [[Society for Psychical Research]], founded in London in 1882. The society set up a Committee on Haunted Houses.&lt;ref name="Fairley &amp; Welfare"&gt;{{cite book

Prominent investigators who exposed cases of fraud came from a variety of backgrounds, including professional researchers such as [[Frank Podmore]] of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] and [[Harry Price]] of the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]], and professional [[magic (illusion)|conjurers]] such as [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. Maskelyne exposed the [[Davenport brothers]] by appearing in the audience during their shows and explaining how the trick was done. 
[[File:Houdini as ghostbuster (performance poster).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Houdini]] exposed the tricks of "mediums".]]
The psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] exposed fraudulent mediums' tricks, such as those used in slate-writing, [[table-turning]], trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading, and [[spirit photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington]]. (1907). ''The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism''. Herbert B. Turner &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The skeptic [[Joseph McCabe]], in his book ''Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?''

Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London: Watts &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magic (illusion)|Magicians]] and writers on magic have a long history of exposing the fraudulent methods of mediumship.  During the 1920s, professional magician [[Harry Houdini]] undertook a well-publicised campaign to expose fraudulent mediums; he was adamant that "Up to the present time everything that I have investigated has been the result of deluded brains."&lt;ref name="houdini"&gt;''A Magician Among the Spirits'', [[Harry Houdini]], Arno Press (June 1987), {{ISBN|0-405-02801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other magician or magic-author debunkers of spiritualist mediumship have included [[Chung Ling Soo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Chung Ling Soo]].

In February 1921 [[Thomas Lynn Bradford]], in an experiment designed to ascertain the existence of an afterlife, committed suicide in his apartment by blowing out the pilot light on his heater and turning on the gas.  After that date, no further communication from him was received by an associate whom he had recruited for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A1EFD395810738DDDA10894DA405B818EF1D3 |title = DEAD SPIRITUALIST SILENT.; Detroit Woman Awaits Message, but Denies Any Compact. | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = February 8, 1921 |page =3 | location = Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unorganized movement===
The movement quickly spread throughout the world; though only in the United Kingdom did it become as widespread as in the United States.&lt;ref name="Britten" /&gt;
Spiritualist organizations were formed in America and Europe, such as the London Spiritualist Alliance, which published a newspaper called ''The Light'', featuring articles such as "Evenings at Home in Spiritual Séance", "Ghosts in Africa" and "Chronicles of Spirit Photography", advertisements for [[mesmerism|"Mesmerists"]] and [[patent medicine]]s, and letters from readers about personal contact with ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Light: A Journal Devoted to the Highest Interests of Humanity, both Here and Hereafter, Vol I, January to December 1881'', London Spiritualist Alliance, Eclectic Publishing Company: London, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Britain, by 1853, invitations to tea among the prosperous and fashionable often included table-turning, a type of séance in which spirits were said to communicate with people seated around a table by tilting and rotating the table. One prominent convert was the French pedagogist [[Allan Kardec]] (1804–1869), who made the first attempt to systematise the movement's practices and ideas into a consistent philosophical system. Kardec's books, written in the last 15 years of his life, became the textual basis of spiritism, which became widespread in Latin countries. In Brazil, Kardec's ideas are embraced by many followers today.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hess, David |title=Spiritism and Science in Brazil |version= |publisher=Ph.D thesis, Dept. of Anthropology, Cornell University |year=1987 |url= |format= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico, Kardec's books were widely read by the upper classes, and eventually gave birth to a movement known as ''[[Espiritismo|mesa blanca]]'' (white table).
[[File:Seven spiritualists 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Middle-class]] Chicago women discuss spiritualism (1906)]]
Spiritualism was mainly a middle- and upper-class movement, and especially popular with women. American spiritualists would meet in private homes for séances, at lecture halls for trance lectures, at state or national conventions, and at summer camps attended by thousands. Among the most significant of the camp meetings were Camp Etna, in [[Etna, Maine]]; Onset Bay Grove, in [[Onset, Massachusetts]]; [[Lily Dale]], in western New York State; [[Camp Chesterfield]], in Indiana; the [[Wonewoc Spiritualist Camp]], in [[Wonewoc, Wisconsin]]; and [[Lake Pleasant, Massachusetts|Lake Pleasant]], in [[Montague, Massachusetts]]. In founding [[camp meeting]]s, the spiritualists appropriated a form developed by U.S. Protestant denominations in the early nineteenth century. Spiritualist camp meetings were located most densely in New England, but were also established across the upper Midwest. [[Cassadaga, Florida]], is the most notable spiritualist camp meeting in the southern states.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassadaga"&gt;{{cite book | last = Guthrie| first = John J. Jr.|author2=Phillip Charles Lucas |author3=Gary Monroe | authorlink = | title = Cassadaga: the South's Oldest Spiritualist Community |location=Gainesville, FL |publisher =[[University Press of Florida]]| year = 2000 | isbn =0-8130-1743-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of spiritualist periodicals appeared in the nineteenth century, and these did much to hold the movement together. Among the most important were the weeklies the ''[[Banner of Light]]'' (Boston), the ''Religio-Philosophical Journal'' (Chicago), ''Mind and Matter'' (Philadelphia), the ''Spiritualist'' (London), and the ''Medium'' (London). Other influential periodicals were the ''Revue Spirite'' (France), ''Le Messager'' (Belgium), ''Annali dello Spiritismo'' (Italy), ''El Criterio Espiritista'' (Spain), and the 
''Harbinger of Light'' (Australia). By 1880, there were about three dozen monthly spiritualist periodicals published around the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Harrison 1880: 6)&lt;/ref&gt; These periodicals differed a great deal from each other, reflecting the great differences among spiritualists. Some, such as the British ''Spiritual Magazine'' were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within spiritualism. Others, such as ''Human Nature'', were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as the ''Spiritualist'', attempted to view spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.&lt;ref&gt;(Alvarado, Biondi, and Kramer 2006: 61–63)&lt;/ref&gt;

Books on the supernatural were published for the growing middle class, such as 1852's  ''Mysteries'', by Charles Elliott, which contains "sketches of spirits and spiritual things", including accounts of the [[Salem witch trials]], the [[Cock Lane ghost|Cock Lane Ghost]], and the [[Fox sisters|Rochester rappings]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wyllys Elliott, ''Mysteries, or Glimpses of the Supernatural'', Harper &amp; Bros: New York, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Night Side of Nature'', by Catherine Crowe, published in 1853, provided definitions and accounts of wraiths, doppelgangers, apparitions and haunted houses.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Crowe, ''The Night Side of Nature, or Ghosts and Ghost-seers'', Redfield: New York, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream newspapers treated stories of ghosts and haunting as they would any other news story. An account in the [[Chicago Tribune|''Chicago Daily Tribune'']] in 1891, "sufficiently bloody to suit the most fastidious taste", tells of a house believed to be haunted by the ghosts of three murder victims seeking revenge against their killer's son, who was eventually driven insane.
Many families, "having no faith in ghosts", thereafter moved into the house, but all soon moved out again.&lt;ref&gt;"Dreadful Tale of a Haunted Man in Newton County, Missouri", ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'', January 4, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1920s many "psychic" books were published of varied quality. Such books were often based on excursions initiated by the use of [[Ouija|Ouija boards]]. A few of these popular books displayed unorganized spiritualism, though most were less insightful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The movement was extremely individualistic, with each person relying on his or her own experiences and reading to discern the nature of the afterlife. Organisation was therefore slow to appear, and when it did it was resisted by mediums and trance lecturers. Most members were content to attend Christian churches, and particularly [[Universalist Church of America|universalist]] churches harbored many spiritualists.

As the spiritualism movement began to fade, partly through the publicity of fraud accusations and partly through the appeal of religious movements such as [[Christian science]], the [[Spiritualist Church]] was organised.  This church can claim to be the main vestige of the movement left today in the United States.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt;

===Other mediums===
[[File:Emma Hardinge Britten 1884.png|thumb|upright|[[Emma Hardinge Britten]]]]
London-born [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] (1823–99) moved to the United States in 1855 and was active in spiritualist circles as a trance lecturer and organiser. She is best known as a chronicler of the movement's spread, especially in her 1884 ''Nineteenth Century Miracles: Spirits and Their Work in Every Country of the Earth'', and her 1870 ''Modern American Spiritualism'', a detailed account of claims and investigations of mediumship beginning with the earliest days of the movement.

[[William Stainton Moses]] (1839–92) was an [[Anglican]] clergyman who, in the period from 1872 to 1883, filled 24 notebooks with automatic writing, much of which was said to describe conditions in the spirit world. However, [[Frank Podmore]] was skeptical of his alleged ability to communicate with spirits and [[Joseph McCabe]] described Moses as a "deliberate impostor", suggesting his [[Apport (paranormal)|apports]] and all of his feats were the result of trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore]]. (1902). ''Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism''. Volume 2. Methuen &amp; Company. pp. 283-287 "It seems reasonable to conclude that all the marvels reported at [Moses] seances were, in fact, produced by the medium's own hands: that it was he who tilted the table and produced the raps, that the scents, the seed pearls, and the Parian statuettes were brought into the room in his pockets: and that the spirit lights were, in fact, nothing more than bottles of phosphorised oil. Nor would the feats described have required any special skill on the medium's part."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History From 1847''. Dodd, Mead and Company. pp. 151-173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adelma Vay]] (1840–1925), Hungarian (by origin) spiritistic medium, [[homeopath]] and [[clairvoyant]], [[wikt:author#Verb|authored]] many books about spiritism, written in German and translated into English.

[[Eusapia Palladino]] (1854–1918) was an Italian spiritualist medium from the slums of Naples who made a career touring Italy, France, Germany, Britain, the United States, Russia and Poland. Palladino was said by believers to perform spiritualist phenomena in the dark: levitating tables, producing [[Apport (paranormal)|apports]], and materializing spirits.  On investigation, all these things were found to be products of trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow]]. (1918). [https://archive.org/stream/psychologyofconv00jast#page/101/mode/2up ''The Psychology of Conviction'']. Houghton Mifflin Company. pp. 101-127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Mann. (1919).

The British medium [[William Eglinton]] (1857–1933) claimed to perform spiritualist phenomena such as movement of objects and [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]]s. All of his feats were exposed as tricks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montague Summers]]. (2010). ''Physical Phenomena of Mysticism''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 114. {{ISBN|978-1161363654}}. Also see Barry Wiley. (2012). ''The Thought Reader Craze: Victorian Science at the Enchanted Boundary''. McFarland. p. 35. {{ISBN|978-0786464708}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simeon Edmunds. (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. Aquarian Press. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-0850300130}} "1876 also saw the first of several exposures of another physical medium, William Eglington, in whose trunk a false beard and a quantity of muslin were found by Archdeacon Colley. He was exposed again in 1880, after which he turned to slate-writing. In this he was exposed by Richard Hodgson and S. J. Davey of the SPR in 1885. Davey a clever conjuror, was able to duplicate all Eglington's phenomena so perfectly that some spiritualists, notably Alfred Russel Wallace, insisted that he too was really a genuine medium."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bangs Sisters]], Mary "May" E. Bangs (1862-1917) and Elizabeth "Lizzie" Snow Bangs (1859-1920), were two spiritualist mediums based in Chicago, who made a career out of painting the dead or "Spirit Portraits".

[[Mina Crandon]] (1888–1941), a spiritualist medium in the 1920s, was known for producing an [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] hand during her séances. The hand was later exposed as a trick when biologists found it to be made from a piece of carved animal liver.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Righi. (2008). ''Ghosts, Apparitions and Poltergeists: An Exploration of the Supernatural through History''. Llewellyn Publications. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-0738713632}} "One medium of the 1920s, Mina Crandon, became famous for producing ectoplasm during her sittings. At the height of the séance, she was even able to produce a tiny ectoplasmic hand from her navel, which waved about in the darkness. Her career ended when Harvard biologists were able to examine the tiny hand and found it to be nothing more than a carved piece of animal liver."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, the psychical researcher [[Walter Franklin Prince]] described the Crandon case as "the most ingenious, persistent, and fantastic complex of fraud in the history of psychic research."&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited''. Prometheus Books. p. 245. {{ISBN|978-0879755331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Helen Duncan fake ectoplasm.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helen Duncan]]]]
The American voice medium [[Etta Wriedt]] (1859-1942) was exposed as a fraud by the physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]] when he discovered that the noises produced by her trumpet were caused by chemical explosions induced by potassium and water and in other cases by lycopodium powder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism based on Fraud?: The Evidence Given by Sir A.C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London: Watts &amp; Co. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known medium was the Scottish materialization medium [[Helen Duncan]] (1897–1956). In 1928 photographer Harvey Metcalfe attended a series of séances at Duncan's house and took flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged "materialization" spirits, including her spirit guide "Peggy".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Gaskill. (2001). ''Hellish Nell: Last of Britain's Witches''. Fourth Estate. p. 100. {{ISBN|978-1841151090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs  revealed the "spirits" to have been fraudulently produced, using dolls made from painted papier-mâché masks, draped in old sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Karl. (2007). ''An Illustrated History of the Haunted World''. New Holland Publishers. p. 79. {{ISBN|978-1845376871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan was later tested by [[Harry Price]] at the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]]; photographs revealed Duncan's [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] to be made from [[cheesecloth]], rubber gloves, and cut-out heads from magazine covers.&lt;ref&gt;Simeon Edmunds. (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. Aquarian Press. pp. 137-144.{{ISBN|978-0850300130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p. 599. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

Spiritualists reacted with an uncertainty to the theories of [[evolution]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking the concept of evolution fitted the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time however, the belief in the animal origins of humanity threatened the foundation of the immortality of the [[spirit]], for if humans had not been created by God, it was scarcely plausible that they would be specially endowed with spirits. This led to spiritualists embracing [[spiritual evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritualists' view of evolution did not stop at death. Spiritualism taught that after death spirits progressed to spiritual states in new spheres of existence. According to spiritualists evolution occurred in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] "at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favourable to growth" than encountered on earth.&lt;ref name="Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270"&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

In a talk at the London Spiritualist Alliance, [[John Page Hopps]] (1834–1911) supported both evolution and spiritualism. Hopps claimed humanity had started off imperfect "out of the animal's darkness" but would rise into the "angel's marvellous light". Hopps claimed humans were not fallen but rising creatures and that after death they would evolve on a number of spheres of existence to perfection.&lt;ref name="Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270"/&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is in opposition to the spiritualist interpretation of evolution. Theosophy teaches a metaphysical theory of evolution mixed with [[human devolution]]. Spiritualists do not accept the devolution of the theosophists.  To theosophy humanity starts in a state of perfection (see [[Golden age]]) and falls into a process of progressive materialization (devolution), developing the mind and losing the spiritual consciousness. After the gathering of experience and growth through repeated [[reincarnations]] humanity will regain the original spiritual state, which is now one of self-conscious perfection.
Theosophy and spiritualism were both very popular metaphysical schools of thought especially in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. [[Madame Blavatsky]] was critical of spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from spiritualism as far as she could and allied herself with eastern occultism.&lt;ref&gt;G. Baseden Butt, Madame Blavatsky, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerald Massey 1856.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gerald Massey]]]]

The spiritualist [[Gerald Massey]] claimed that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution was incomplete:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory contains only one half the explanation of man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on—man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine as well as a human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours—we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey, ''Concerning Evolution'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spiritualists believed that without spiritualism "the doctrine of Darwin is a broken link". Gerald Massey said "Spiritualism will accept evolution, and carry it out and make both ends meet in the perfect circle".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey, Concerning evolution, pp.&amp;nbsp;60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous medium who rejected evolution was [[Cora L. V. Scott]], she dismissed evolution in her lectures and instead supported a type of [[pantheistic]] spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Podmore, Bob Gilbert, Modern spiritualism: a history and a criticism: Volume 2, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] believed qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a [[supernatural]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;Debora Hammond, The Science of Synthesis: Exploring the Social Implications of General Systems Theory, 2003, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an immaterial origin for the higher mental faculties of humans, he believed that evolution suggested that the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled "The World of Life", which he later expanded into a book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace argued in his 1911 book ''World of Life'' for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as "creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose". Wallace believed [[natural selection]] could not explain [[intelligence]] or [[morality]] in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of humanity could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate "in the unseen universe of spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace, 2004, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Clodd, Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Lodge]] also promoted a version of spiritual evolution in his books ''Man and the Universe'' (1908), ''Making of Man'' (1924) and ''Evolution and Creation'' (1926). The spiritualist element in the synthesis was most prominent in Lodge's 1916 book ''Raymond, or Life and Death'' which revived a large interest for public in the paranormal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler, Science for all: the popularization of science in early twentieth-century, 2009, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the 1920s==
{{Main article|Spiritualist Church|Spiritualists' National Union|Survivalism (life after death)|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain}}

After the 1920s, spiritualism evolved in three different directions, all of which exist today.

===Syncretism===
The first of these continued the tradition of individual practitioners, organised in circles centered on a medium and clients, without any hierarchy or dogma. Already by the late 19th century spiritualism had become increasingly [[syncretism|syncretic]], a natural development in a movement without central authority or dogma.&lt;ref name="Braude" /&gt; Today, among these unorganised circles, spiritualism is  similar to the new age movement. However, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] with its inclusion of Eastern religion, astrology, ritual magic and reincarnation is an example of a closer precursor of the 20th century new age movement.&lt;ref name="Hess_p20"&gt;{{cite book

  | date = June 15, 1993
  | page = 20
  | isbn = 0-299-13820-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Today's syncretic spiritualists are quite heterogeneous in their beliefs regarding issues such as reincarnation or the existence of God. Some appropriate new age and neo-pagan beliefs, while others call themselves "Christian spiritualists", continuing with the tradition of cautiously incorporating spiritualist experiences into their Christian faith.

===Spiritualist church===
{{Main article|Spiritualist church|Spiritualists' National Union|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain|Spiritual church movement}}
The second direction taken has been to adopt formal organization, patterned after Christian denominations, with established liturgies and a set of seven principles, and training requirements for mediums. In the United States the spiritualist churches are primarily affiliated either with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] or the loosely allied group of denominations known as the spiritual church movement; in the U.K. the predominant organization is the [[Spiritualists' National Union]], founded in 1890.
[[File:Conan doyle.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Arthur Conan Doyle]], creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]]]]
Formal education in spiritualist practice emerged in 1920s, with organizations like the William T. Stead Center in Chicago, Illinois, and continue today with the [[Arthur Findlay]] College at Stansted Hall in England, and the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches|Morris Pratt Institute]] in Wisconsin, United States.

Diversity of belief among organized spiritualists has led to a few schisms, the most notable occurring in the U.K. in 1957 between those who held the movement to be a religion ''sui generis'' (of its own with unique characteristics), and a minority who held it to be a denomination within Christianity. In the United States, this distinction can be seen between the less Christian organization, the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, and the more Christian spiritual church movement.

The practice of organized spiritualism today resembles that of any other religion, having discarded most showmanship, particularly those elements resembling the conjurer's art. There is thus a much greater emphasis on "mental" mediumship and an almost complete avoidance of the apparently miraculous "materializing" mediumship that so fascinated early believers such as Arthur Conan Doyle.&lt;ref name="Cassadaga" /&gt; The first spiritualist church in Australia was the United Stanmore &amp; Enmore Spiritualist Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enmorespiritualistchurch.org.au|title=Enmore Spiritualist Church=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1913. In 1921, Conan Doyle gave a farewell to Australia speech there.

===Psychical research===
{{Main article|Parapsychology}}

[[File:God delusion.JPG|thumb|In 2006, after his documentary ''The Root of All Evil?'', [[Richard Dawkins]] published his book ''[[The God Delusion]]''.]]

'''''The Root of All Evil?''''', later retitled '''''The God Delusion''''', is a television [[Documentary film|documentary]] written and presented by [[Richard Dawkins]] in which he argues that humanity would be better off without [[religion]] or belief in God.

The documentary was first broadcast in January 2006, in the form of two 45-minute episodes (excluding advertisement breaks), on [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom. Dawkins did not think ''The Root of All Evil?'' was an ideal title. His book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', published in September 2006, explores topics from the documentary in more detail.

==''The God Delusion''==
[[File:Lourdes Grotte.jpg|thumb|[[Pilgrimage|Pilgrim]]s at [[Lourdes]], a place Dawkins visits in the documentary.]]
''The God Delusion'' explored the unproven traditions that are given as fact by religious faiths, and the extremes that some followers take them.  Dawkins argues that faith is not a way of understanding the world (described as "non-thought"), and is opposed to modern science which tests hypotheses and builds theories to describe the world.  Dawkins visits the [[United States]] to interview pastor [[Ted Haggard]], president of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], and to [[Jerusalem]] to interview Yousef al-Khattab (Joseph Cohen), an American born Jew who settled in [[Israel]] before converting to [[Islam]].  Responding to charges that scientific understanding doesn't entitle one to reject religion, Dawkins describe's [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[celestial teapot]] thought experiment.

==''The Virus Of Faith''==
In ''The Virus Of Faith'' Dawkins made a more emotional appeal.  The programme examined the moral framework that religions are often cited as providing, and argued against the indoctrination of children.  The title of the programme comes from Dawkins' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' in which Dawkins introduced the idea of the [[meme]].  [[DNA]] travels from parents to offspring in [[gene]]s, but some DNA in the form of [[virus]]es can also pass between any individuals.

Dawkins compares religious faith to a virus, being passed from parents to offspring and teachers to pupils.  Dawkins visits a [[London]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] school, in which students are largely isolated from outside ideas.  Also in London, Dawkins visits Phoenix Academy, one of the semi-independent [[Academy (English school)|city academies]] introduced by [[Tony Blair]]'s government, which follows the American [[Accelerated Christian Learning]] curriculum.  Dawkins finds the pupils [[rote learning]] [[bible|biblical]] stories, which are integrated into various academic subjects.  Dawkins interviews the head teacher of the school, asking why the science curriculum includes [[Noah's Ark]] and describes [[AIDS]] as the "wages of sin".  When the teacher states that without God or a law-giver people will tend to do bad things, Dawkins takes this as a cue to explore the differences between secular [[ethics]] and morality based on religious law.

Returning to the United States Dawkins visits the Hell-House Outreach Programme, an organisation that uses [[hell]] for "moral policing", producing videos aimed at twelve-year-olds.  He also interviews Michael Bray, a friend of [[Paul Jennings Hill]] who was sentenced to death for murdering a doctor who performed abortions.  Dawkins takes Bray's belief that the bible sanctions [[capital punishment]] for [[adultery]] as a cue to discuss his views that the bible, especially the Old Testament, clashes with modern secular ethics.  Quoting from the [[Old Testament]], Dawkins describes its God as "the most unpleasant character in all fiction," and expresses similar disregard for the [[New Testament]]'s "sadomasochistic doctrine of atonement for original sin."

Dawkins interviews [[Richard Harries]], the [[Bishop of Oxford]], a liberal [[Anglican]], about why Harries accepts some of the Bible while rejecting others, including many of its moral teachings.  Harries states that it is possible to be intellectually fulfilled as both a rationalist and religious person.

Finally Dawkins discusses some of the ideas about morality from [[evolutionary biology]], such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[kin selection]].

==Production==
Dawkins has said that the title ''The Root of All Evil?'' was not his preferred choice, but that Channel 4 had insisted on it to create controversy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jeremy Vine Show'', BBC Radio 2. 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The sole concession from the producers on the title was the addition of the question mark. Dawkins has stated that the notion of anything being the root of ''all'' evil is ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointofinquiry.org/?p=36 ''Point of Inquiry'' Podcast]. 10 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins' book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', released in September 2006, goes on to examine the topics raised in the documentary in greater detail. The documentary was rebroadcast on the [[More4]] channel on 25 August 2010 under the title of ''The God Delusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/dawkins-season-on-more4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101151039/http://www.secularism.org.uk/dawkins-season-on-more4.html |archivedate=1 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writing in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Dawkins stated that Channel 4's correspondence in response to the documentary had been running at two to one in favour.&lt;ref name=diary&gt;Richard Dawkins, 2006. "[http://www.newstatesman.com/200601300002 Diary]". ''New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists including [[Howard Jacobson]] had accused Dawkins of giving voice to extremists,&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jacobson, 2006. "[http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/howard_jacobson/article340034.ece Nothing like an unimaginative scientist to get non-believers running back to God] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120140813/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/howard_jacobson/article340034.ece |date=20 November 2007 }}." ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt; a claim Dawkins responded to by noting that the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] has some 30 million members, and also that he had invited the main UK religious leaders to participate, but they all declined.&lt;ref name=diary/&gt;
However, [[Alister McGrath]], a Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford University, was interviewed for the program, but was not included in the  documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/47052/ AlterNet: MediaCulture: The Dawkins Delusion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath claimed to have made Dawkins "appear uncomfortable" with his explanations of religious belief and the implication, made by McGrath, was that Dawkins's program showed journalistic dishonesty. In a lecture at [[City Church of San Francisco]] McGrath said that his interview was cut because he said things that did not promote the message that Dawkins and the producers wanted to get across.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citychurchsf.org/openforum.htm Open Forum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117053337/http://www.citychurchsf.org/openforum.htm |date=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The McGrath interview, together with other interviews not shown in the program "The Root of All Evil?", was released in the DVD "Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews".&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.richarddawkins.net/products/root-of-all-evil-the-uncut-interviews Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004012957/http://store.richarddawkins.net/products/root-of-all-evil-the-uncut-interviews |date=4 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious journalist [[Madeleine Bunting]] produced a scathing review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', in which she described the documentary as "a piece of intellectually lazy [[polemic]] not worthy of a great scientist".&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Bunting, 2006. "[https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1681235,00.html No wonder atheists are angry: they seem ready to believe anything]." ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Tablet]]'', [[Keith Ward]] criticised Dawkins for what he considered to be an indiscriminate and simplistic approach to religion.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ward, 2006. "[http://www.thetablet.co.uk/articles/501 Faith, hype and a lack of clarity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331181544/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/articles/501 |date=31 March 2008 }}." ''The Tablet''.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Keith Ward]]'s book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'', responding to the Dawkins programme, analyzes the claim that religion does more harm than good and suggests that "such assertions ... ignore the available evidence... and substitute rhetoric for analysis".&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Ward|Ward, Keith]], ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlie Brooker]] writes for ''The Guardian'' that Dawkins' "central point [...] seems pretty valid from where I'm standing" but that Dawkins "quickly becomes far too angry to conduct a civil conversation" in interviews with religious people and this "doesn't exactly move the debate forward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/13/religion.comment|title=Supposing ... we could inoculate against religion|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Brooker|first=Charlie|author-link=Charlie Brooker|date=13 January 2006|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early years===
Ursula Maria Kuczynski was second of the six recorded children born to the distinguished economist and [[demographer]] [[Robert René Kuczynski]] and his wife Berta Gradenwitz/Kuczynski,&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; who was a painter. The children were academically gifted and the family was prosperous.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; Her elder brother, [[Jürgen Kuczynski|Jürgen]]&lt;ref name=GuardobitRW/&gt; would later become a distinguished historian-economist who had a controversial relationship of his own with the espionage community.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenJK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=1944|author1=[[Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk]]|author2=|title=Kuczynski, Jürgen * 17.9.1904, † 6.8.1997 Wirtschaftshistoriker |publisher= Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur: Biographische Datenbanken |accessdate= 1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ursula grew up in a small villa in the [[Schlachtensee]] quarter in the southwest of [[Berlin]]. When she was eleven she landed a screen role in ''[[The House of Three Girls (1918 film)|The House of Three Girls]]'' (1918), the cinema version of ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus]]''.&lt;ref name=imdbRW&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0921476/|title= Ruth Werner (I) (1907–2000) |publisher=IMDb |author=|date=|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the ''[[Lyzeum]]'' (secondary school) in [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Berlin-Zehlendorf]] and then, between 1924 and 1926, undertook an apprenticeship as a book dealer. She had already, in 1924, joined the left-leaning Free Employees league (''[[AfA-Bund]]''), and 1924 was also the year in which she joined the Young Communists ([[KJVD]]) and Germany's Red Aid (''[[Rote Hilfe]]''). In May 1926, the month of her nineteenth birthday, Ursula Kuczynski joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH(uRP)lautEK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-pub.uni-weimar.de/opus4/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/929/file/diss+koegel_pdfa.pdf|title=Zwei Poelzigschüler in der Emigration:  Rudolf Hamburger und Richard Paulick zwischen Shanghai und Ost-Berlin (1930–1955)|author1= Eduard Kögel (author)|author2= Dieter Hassenpflug (mentor)|work=Dissertation zur Erlangung des akademischen Grades Doktor-Ingenieur an der Fakultät Architektur der Bauhaus-Universität Weimar|date=2006|publisher=University Library Bauhaus-Universität Weimar|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Librarianship, marriage and politics===
In 1926/27 she attended a librarianship academy while working at a [[lending library]]. She then took a job at [[Ullstein Verlag]], a large Berlin publishing house. However, she lost this job in 1928 after participating in a [[International Workers' Day|May-Day Demonstration]] and/or on account of her Communist Party membership.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wienerzeitung.at/themen_channel/wz_reflexionen/kompendium/101753_Sonja-Stalins-beste-Spionin.html |title= "Sonja" – Stalins beste Spionin|publisher= [[Wiener Zeitung]] (online) | author=[[:de:Thomas Karny|Thomas Karny]]|date=11 May 2007 |accessdate= 3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between December 1928 and August 1929 she worked in a New York book shop before returning to Berlin where she married her first husband, Rudolf Hamburger, who was an architect and fellow member of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]]. It was also at this time that she set up the Marxist Workers' Library (MAB) in Berlin which she headed up between August 1929 and June 1930.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt;

===Espionage===

====China====
With her husband she relocated, in July 1930, to Shanghai&lt;ref name=GuardobitRW/&gt; where a frenetic construction boom afforded ample opportunities for Hamburger's architectural work.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; She would remain based in China till 1935. It was here that the couple's son, the Shakespeare scholar [[:de:Maik Hamburger|Maik Hamburger]], was born in February 1931. After they had been in Shanghai for a little more than four months she was introduced by the US journalist [[Agnes Smedley]]&lt;ref name=BerlZeitRW&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/wenn-die-sonja-russisch-tanzt-der-letzte-rapport-der-ruth-werner--orte-eines-geheimen-lebens-schanghai--das-hotel,10810590,9874188.html|title=Wenn die Sonja Russisch tanzt Der letzte Rapport der Ruth Werner.

Schlüsselentscheidungen im Zweiten Weltkrieg.'' DVA, München 2008, page 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources are vague as to whether the Hamburgers were already working for the GRU before they left Germany for China, but in any case it was after the meeting with Sorge that between 1930 and 1935 "Sonja" (the cover name by which Kuczynski was known in The Service - means dormouse in Russian) operated a Russian spy ring under Sorge's direction.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;&lt;ref name=SpartacusRW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Ursula_Beurton.htm Biography of Ursula Beurton|title=Ursula Kuczynski (also known as Ursula Beurton) |author= John Simkin|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 1934 she had to send her son Michael to live with her husband's parents (now relocated from Germany to Czechoslovakia) when she was sent to Moscow where she undertook a seven-month training session before returning to China.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; There had been a concern that if baby Michael had accompanied her to Moscow he might inadvertently have blown her cover later by blurting out words in Russian.&lt;ref name=GuardobitRW/&gt; It was also during this period that she mastered various practical aspects of spy-craft. This included radio operator skills that were much prized in the world of espionage:  she learned to build and operate a radio receiver,&lt;ref name=OxMailRW/&gt; becoming an exceptionally fluent and accurate user of [[Morse code]].&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; Between March and December 1934 she was based in [[Shenyang]] in [[Manchuria]] which had been under [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] military occupation since [[Mukden Incident|1931]]. Here she met the GRU's chief agent who was working under the name "Ernst". Sonja and Ernst had a romance which would result in the birth of her daughter Janina in April 1936. Her husband Rudolf Hamburger generously acknowledged "Nina" as though she were his own daughter.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; The GRU was nevertheless concerned that the affair with Ernst might lead to the unmasking of both agents, and she was recalled with Rudolf to Moscow in August 1935. In September 1935 they were both posted to Poland where, apart from at least one more lengthy visit to Moscow, they would remain till Autumn 1938.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt; In the meantime it would later transpire that in 1937 the Soviets awarded her the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for her espionage work in China. Without ever wearing a uniform, she now held the rank of colonel in the Soviet military.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;

====Switzerland====
Between Autumn 1938 and December 1940, as agent "Sonja Schultz", she was based, still with her husband [[Rudolf Hamburger]], in [[Switzerland]] where she was one of the so-called "[[Red Orchestra (espionage)|red three]]", together with [[Alexander Radó|Sándor Radó]]:  her duties included working as a specialist radio operator, applying technical skills acquired during her Moscow visits earlier in the decade. The codes she used to send information to [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|Moscow]] from her little house in [[Caux, Switzerland|Caux]], a three-hour walk up into the mountains above Montreux, have never been deciphered.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; In Switzerland, which was where her marriage with Rudolf Hamburger finally broke apart,&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; she collaborated with the [[Lucy spy ring]] and was involved in recruiting agents to be infiltrated into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].&lt;ref name= BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt; After the Nazi take-over of [[Invasion of Poland|Danzig]] in Autumn 1939 she also set up a [[German Resistance to Nazism|resistance group]] in the [[Free City of Danzig|formerly free city]].

====England====
She divorced later that same year, and early in 1940, while still in Switzerland, married her second husband. [[Len Beurton]], like her, was working for the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|Soviet GRU]], and like Kuczynski he came with an unusually wide range of names. He also came with a British passport, and by marrying him Agent Sonya automatically acquired a British [[Citizenship|passport]] too. Sent by the GRU she and her new husband now relocated from Switzerland to England where she would remain for the rest of the 1940s, and where her second son was born in the late summer of 1943.&lt;ref name=FreebmdPeter&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=51IGXwn0qo%2FAEeKxTTQYaA&amp;scan=1|title=Oxford birth registry index entry for Beurton Peter J.|accessdate=2 January 2015|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had settled in north [[Oxford]], but soon moved on to the first of a succession of nearby villages, settling initially in [[Glympton]], and then in [[Kidlington]].&lt;ref name=OxMailRW/&gt; In May 1945 the Beurtons relocated again, to a larger house in the north Oxfordshire village of [[Great Rollright]]&lt;ref name=GuardobitRW/&gt; where they remained till 1949 or 1950, becoming so integrated into the village community that both her parents, who were frequent visitors in Oxfordshire even after the war ended, and who both died in 1947,&lt;ref name=FreebmdBerta&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=jrtEZ%2B59RjBnnIX940F4gg&amp;scan=1|title=Oxfordshire death registry index entry for Kuczynski Bertha|accessdate=3 January 2015 |work=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; are buried in the Great Rollright churchyard.&lt;ref name=OxMailRW/&gt; In each Oxfordshire property in which she lived Agent Sonya installed a radio receiver and transmitter (which during the [[Second World War|war]] would have been considered illegal had it come to the attention of the authorities).&lt;ref name=OxMailRW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/8317761.RED_SONYA__The_spy_who_lived_in_Kidlington/ |title=RED SONYA: The spy who lived in Kidlington|author=Debbie Waite|publisher=[[Oxford Mail]] (online|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in Oxfordshire placed them conveniently close to Ursula's parents&lt;ref name=OxMailRW/&gt; who had emigrated to London after [[Machtergreifung|1933]], and were then living with friends in Oxford because of the air raids in London.&lt;ref name=SpartacusRW/&gt;

The Beurtons' Oxfordshire village homes were also close to the UK's [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment|Atomic Research Centre]] at [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]], and to [[Blenheim Palace]], where a large part of the [[MI5|British intelligence service]] had been relocated at the start of the [[Second World War|war]].&lt;ref name=SpartacusRW/&gt; In Oxfordshire, together with [[:de:Erich Henschke|Erich Henschke]], she worked on infiltrating [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist exiles]] into the [[Office of Strategic Services|US Intelligence Agency]]. By Autumn 1944 she and Henschke had succeeded in penetrating UK activities of the [[Office of Strategic Services|US Intelligence Service (OSS)]]. The Americans were at this time preparing an effort called "Operation Hammer" for parachuting UK-based German exiles into Germany. Ursula Beurton was able to ensure that a substantial number of the parachuted OSS agents would be reliable communists, able and willing to make inside intelligence from the "Third Reich" available not merely to the US military in [[United States Department of War|Washington]], but also to [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|Moscow]].

From 1943 she also worked as a courier for the USSR's "[[Atomic spies]]", [[Klaus Fuchs]]&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitrokhin Archive (Volume 7, Chapter 14)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Melita Norwood]].&lt;ref name=SpartacusRW/&gt;&lt;ref name= WhippleonRooney&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europaeditions.com/review-show.php?Id=1808|title=Mary Whipple Reviews: "A thoughtful and provocative novel." |publisher=Europa Editions|author=Mary Whipple|date=23 July 2014|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent Sonya thus hastened the development of the Soviet atomic bomb,&lt;ref name=OxMailRW/&gt; successfully tested in 1949. In addition to the (retrospectively) high-profile spies Fuchs and Norwood, Sonya was the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|GRU]] handler for (among others) an officer of the [[Royal Air Force|British Royal Air Force]] and a British specialist in [[submarine]] radar. She was also able to pass to her Soviet employers information from her brother, her father, and other exiled Germans in England. It was, indeed, her brother [[Jürgen Kuczynski]], an internationally respected economist, who originally recruited Klaus Fuchs to spy for the Soviets at the end of 1942.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;

Many years later Ruth Werner (as she would by that time have become known) recalled that she was twice visited by [[MI5]] representatives in 1947, and asked about her links with [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|Soviet intelligence]], which Werner refused to discuss.&lt;ref name=NigWesRW&gt;{{cite book |title=The Crown Jewels: The British Secrets at the Heart of the KGB's Archives|author=[[Rupert Allason|Rupert Allason under the pen name Nigel West]]|date=17 May 1999 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Werner's communist sympathies were no secret, but it seems that British suspicions were insufficiently supported by evidence to justify her arrest. Her visitors were unaware of or unconcerned by her periodic, and apparently casual, meetings with [[Klaus Fuchs|Fuchs]]&lt;ref name=SpartacusRW/&gt; in [[Banbury]] or on country cycle rides.&lt;ref name=OxMailRW/&gt; At that time the British intelligence services seem to have been disinclined to follow up their concerns.&lt;ref name=GuardobitRW/&gt; Two years later detonation of the first Soviet atomic bomb refocused priorities within MI5, however. [[Klaus Fuchs]] was arrested towards the end of 1949; in January 1950 he was put on trial and confessed that he was a spy. The day before his trial started, fearing that she was about to be unmasked, Agent Sonya left England.&lt;ref name=GuardobitRW/&gt; In March 1950, after two decades away from the city of her birth, she turned up back in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt; Meanwhile, Klaus Fuchs finally identified her as his Soviet contact in November 1950.&lt;ref name=OxMailRW/&gt; The espionage-related aspects of her friendship with Melita Norwood only began to emerge several decades later.

===Back in the GDR===
[[Weimar Germany|Germany]] had changed. Ursula Beurton returned to [[East Berlin]] in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of what remained of the country, although the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration]] had by now retreated into the background following the formal establishment of the [[German Democratic Republic]] in October 1949. A systematic nation building process had actually been underway for several years before 1949, starting with the arrival from Moscow of 30 well prepared [[Ulbricht Group|formerly exiled German communists]] in Berlin at the start of May 1945, led by a man called [[Walter Ulbricht]]. One change was the disappearance in the new country of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. In fact, the party had not exactly disappeared, but it had been replaced in April 1946 through the [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|contentious merger]] of the Communist party with the East German elements of the old German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (SPD)]], to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'')]]. On her arrival in East Berlin Beurton lost little time in resigning from the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|GRU]] and joining the SED.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt; Six years later she started to re-emerge with a new life as an author. In the meantime, she undertook some journalism and other writing work.  She was given a government job in 1950 as head of the Capitalist Countries Division in the Central Department of Foreign Information in the Government Information Office.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt; She was later fired from the Government Information office, reportedly because she forgot properly to lock the armour plated door of a large safe.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;&lt;ref name=WolfMehlRW/&gt; Between 1953 and 1956 she worked in the Chamber of Commerce for foreign trade.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt;

====The writer====
Her short (64 page) publication "Immer unterwegs. Reportage aus Prag über die Tätigkeit unserer Ingenieure im Ausland" was published under the name "Ursula Beurton" in Berlin in 1956.

Between 1958 and 1988, she produced a succession of books under the name by which she subsequently came to be known, Ruth Werner.  Most were story books for children or suitably expurgated memoirs of her time in espionage.  Her autobiography appeared in East Germany under the title "Sonjas Rapport" (''Sonya's Report'') and became a bestseller.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;&lt;ref name=BurgaKalinowskRW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luise-berlin.de/lesezei/blz00_08/text9.htm|title=Ruth Werner: Sonjas Rapport|author=Burga Kalinowski|work= Verlag Neues Leben, Verlag Neues Leben, Berlin 1977, 342 S.|date=|accessdate=3 January 2015|publisher=Berliner LeseZeichen Ed. Luisenstadt}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no mention of [[Klaus Fuchs]] who was still alive in 1976,&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; and, presumably for the same reason, no mention of Melita Norwood.

In 1982 Ruth Werner became a member of the [[:de:PEN-Zentrum Deutschland#Geschichte des PEN-Zentrums Deutschland|East German affiliate]] of [[PEN International]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRW/&gt;

===Die Wende===
As the stand-alone existence of the [[German Democratic Republic]] [[Peaceful Revolution|came to an end]], Ruth Werner was one of the few people energetically to defend it.  On 10 November 1989, directly after [[Die Wende|The Wall was breached]] she took to the political stage, addressing tens of thousands of people at a meeting in the Berlin [[Lustgarten|Lustgarten (pleasure park)]] on the subject of her faith in Socialism with a human face.&lt;ref&gt;''"Ich habe gesagt, wenn du in den Parteiapparat gehst, kriegst du entweder Magengeschwüre, oder du brichst dir den Hals, oder du verfällst dem Gift der Macht. Heute sage ich nach den Veränderungen, die sich anbahnen, nach dem Wandel, der vor sich gegangen ist: Geht in den Apparat! Ändert die Zukunft! Arbeitet als saubere Sozialisten! Ich hab Mut! Ich hab Optimismus!"''&lt;/ref&gt;   During the ensuing months of the run-up to [[German reunification]] she placed great faith in [[Egon Krenz]], who briefly served as the East German leader.

She lived another ten years and seems never to have regretted or seen the need to apologize for her espionage. Back in 1956, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|made public]] the darker face of Communist Russia under [[Stalin]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rettie]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4723942.stm "The day Khrushchev denounced Stalin"], BBC, 18 February 2006.  Accessed 3 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khrushchev, Nikita S. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1956khrushchev-secret1.html “The Secret Speech–On the Cult of Personality”], ''Fordham University Modern History Sourcebook''. Accessed 3 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; she was invited to comment. She was reluctant to join the criticism of the Soviet wartime leader:

{{quote|It was not always easy [for the Soviet authorities] to differentiate between the mistakes of honest comrades and the actions of imperialist opponents. With so many guilty people it could certainly happen that the innocent became caught up.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;

''(Es war nicht immer leicht, zwischen Fehlern ehrlicher Genossen und Taten des imperialistischen Gegners zu unterscheiden. Bei so vielen Schuldigen konnte es schon geschehen, dass auch Unschuldige mit betroffen waren.)''&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;}}

Interviewed in 2000, a few months before her death, she was asked about the consequences of "[[Die Wende]]", the changes which had led to German reunification (which many of her persuasion still saw as a peaceful annexation of East Germany by West Germany):

{{quote|The so-called "Wende" does not change my own view of how the world should be. But it does create in me a certain hopelessness, which I never had before.

''(Die sogenannte Wende wirkt sich nicht auf meine Weltanschauung aus. Aber es macht sich eine gewisse Hoffnungslosigkeit breit, wie ich sie vorher noch nie gehabt habe.)''&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;}}

==Evaluation==
Since 1989 more information has become available concerning at least some of her espionage achievements, and appreciation of Ruth Werner's exceptional abilities has grown. In the opinion of one historian who has studied her career, she was "one of the top spies ever produced by the Soviet Union and her penetration of Britain's secrets and MI5 possibly went far deeper than was thought at the time she was operational."&lt;ref name=OxMaiRWlautBS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/8317761.RED_SONYA__The_spy_who_lived_in_Kidlington/ |title=RED SONYA: The spy who lived in Kidlington|author=Brian Spurrin quoted by Debbie Waite|publisher=[[Oxford Mail]] (online|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unidentified [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|GRU]] chief is reported to have observed during the war, "If we had five Sonyas in England, the war would end sooner."&lt;ref name=CoOpRWlautDB&gt;{{cite book| title=The Spy Who Came in from the Co-Op |date=2009|publisher= Boydell Press|author=David Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OxMaiRWlautDB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/8317761.RED_SONYA__The_spy_who_lived_in_Kidlington/ |title=RED SONYA: The spy who lived in Kidlington|author=David Burke quoted by Debbie Waite|publisher=[[Oxford Mail]] (online|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Werner herself could be more reticent about her contribution: "I was simply working as a messenger" ''("Ich arbeitete ja bloß als Kurier.")''&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;

What is incontrovertible is that she engaged in an exceptionally high risk trade on behalf of Stalin's Intelligence machine without being shot by the enemy or sent to the Gulag by her own side. Her husband and the father of her first son, [[:de:Rudolf Hamburger|Rudolf Hamburger]], who also worked for Soviet intelligence, fell foul of the Soviet regime in 1943 and was deported to the [[Gulag]] in the east of the Soviet Union. He was released in 1952 but remained officially "banned" and was sent to Ukraine, only being permitted to return to Germany in 1955. This type of experience was far from unusual among Soviet spies. [[Alexander Radó|Sandór Radó]] with whom she had worked so closely in the hills above Geneva also spent long years as a guest of the Russian [[Gulag]]. [[Richard Sorge]], who probably recruited her to work for Moscow in the first place, was caught and hanged by the Japanese.&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt; Werner herself, as far as her story has come into the public domain, suffered nothing more harrowing than a couple of pointed but ultimately inconclusive meetings with [[MI5|British Intelligence]] agents in 1947, and was able to escape to the safe haven of [[East Germany]] before her espionage activities became the subject of any trial or other retributive process. Simple survival represented a considerable achievement under the circumstances of her two decades in espionage, and seem to justify the media epithets she attracted to the effect that she was "Stalin's best spy" ("''Stalins beste Spionin''").&lt;ref name=WienerZeRW/&gt;

'''Sergey Anatolyevitch Torop''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Анато́льевич То́роп}}, ''Sergej Anatolʹevič Torop''; born 14 January 1961 in [[Krasnodar]], [[Russian SFSR]]), known by his followers as '''Vissarion''' ({{lang-rus|Виссарио́н|p=vʲɪsərʲɪˈon}}, "He who gives new life"), is a Russian [[mysticism|mystic]] and cult leader. 

He founded and heads a religious or sect movement known as the '''Church of the Last Testament''' with its head church in the Siberian [[Taiga]] in the [[Minusinsk Depression]] east of [[Abakan]], in the southern Siberia Kuraginsk district of [[Krasnoyarsk]] territory, in the small settlement of [[Petropavlovka, Siberia, Russia|Petropavlovka]]. He has around 4,000 followers (called Vissarionites) living in the settlement and around 10,000 followers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Obscura|first=Atlas|title=Russian Cult May be The Largest Religious Reservation In The World|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2013/07/16/russian_cult_may_be_the_largest_religious_reservation_in_the_world.html|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vissarion claims to be a reincarnated [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. He teaches [[reincarnation]], [[vegetarianism]], and apocalypse.  On 18 August 1990, when he was 29, Vissarion claims that he had a revelation that he was the reincarnation of Christ.  He first spoke publicly in [[Minusinsk]] on 18 August 1991. He founded the "Church of the Last Testament" (Церковь Последнего Завета ''Tserkov Poslednego Zaveta''), also known as "Community of Unified Faith".

== Biography ==
Vissarion was born in [[Krasnodar]]; after service in the [[Red Army]], he settled in Minusinsk. He worked as a [[GAI|patrol officer]] before losing his job in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsland.ru/News/Detail/id/404942/cat/37/ Сибирский Иисус Христос - бывший гаишник]&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that in 1990 he was "reborn" as Vissarion, a returned Christ. In his system this does not make him God, but instead the [[Logos (Christianity)|word of God]]. His religion combines elements of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] with [[Buddhism]], apocalypticism, collectivism, and ecological values. His followers observe strict regulations, are vegetarians,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2002/11/9/146644.html The Argus, Brighton 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215020459/http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2002/11/9/146644.html |date=2009-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are allowed no vices such as smoking or drinking alcohol, and money is banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/russia/030414.htm The Vissarion Cult in Russia - Lermanet, November 6, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newser.com/story/68119/reborn-jesus-leads-vegans-in-russia.html 'Reborn' Jesus Leads Vegans in Russia - Newser, August 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the group is to unite all religions on Earth.  Vissarion formed his religion around the time of the [[fall of the USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Cv5hZfOmk|title=Cult Leader Thinks He's Jesus (Documentary Exclusive)|date=16 May 2012|work=VICE News|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberkul, the settlement in the Taiga, was established in 1994 on a territory of {{Convert|2.5|km2|acre}}, and today the community spans several nearby villages as well, including villages of Petropavlovka and Cheremshanka, at ca. {{Coord|53|53|N|93|45|E|}}, and counts some five thousand inhabitants, largely living [[indigenism|autochthonous]]&lt;!--did you mean off the land or indigenous? --&gt; and on [[sustainability|ecological principles]]. The central settlement, also called ''The Town'' and ''The Mountain'', has a three-tiered structure: the Town itself (''Abode of Dawn''), the ''Heavenly Abode'', and the ''Temple Peak''.

In October 1995, the religious association of Vissarion officially registered as the "Church of the Last Testament".

== Personal life ==
Vissarion has two wives, and six children from two marriages.  He rejected his first wife and married a nineteen-year-old who had lived with him since she was a girl of seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k-istine.ru/sects/vissarion/vissarion_maksimov.htm Семён Максимов."Позови меня в даль светлую" или сказки дядюшки Виссариона//Миссионерское обозрение, № 3,4,6, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vissarion has a younger half-sister, Irina.  Though his biological mother is a woman named Nadyezhda, Vissarion considers Mary, mother of Jesus, as his own mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://realityworld.narod.ru/library/Vissarion/Vstrechi.html Последний Завет. Т.1, СП-б, Фламинго, 1996, вопрос 24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
Vissarion's cult is estimated{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to have some ten thousand adherents, with claims of up to 50,000 adherents in eighty-three communities spread over 150 square kilometers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

Since 1992, biographer Vadim Redkin has published an annual volume detailing Vissarion's activities. Vissarion has attracted a number of followers from Germany's [[esoteric]] subculture, and seven volumes of Vadim's account have been translated into German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wissarion.info/ Vissarion]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, [[United Kingdom|UK]] TV channel, [[Channel 4]] showed an hour-long documentary about Vissarion and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/a-long-weekend-with-the-son-of-god A long weekend with the son of god - Channel 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "Cult Leader Thinks He's Jesus (Documentary Exclusive)".  This video follows the experiences of Rocco, a reporter for ''Vice'' in [[Petropavlovka, Siberia, Russia|Petropavlovka]] and his interview with Vissarion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Cv5hZfOmk Cult Leader Thinks He’s Jesus]&lt;/ref&gt; The video depicts the settlement and the people as a very nice place with good people, but the ideas of the "religion" as very cultish.  This was the first time Vissarion had granted an interview in three years. Rocco asked him about the stance of his religion and what it is based on, such as aliens, the downfall of the USSR, his favorite color and foods, and his experiences and memories of Jesus. Vissarion avoided direct answers.

In August 2012, the [[16x9]] YouTube channel uploaded an interview titled "Jesus of Siberia".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oKD66yXCg Jesus of Siberia]&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2013, the [[Dateline (Australian TV program)|SBS Dateline]] YouTube channel uploaded a video called "Jesus of Siberia"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8BOMqks-gQ Jesus of Siberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the [[RT (TV network)|RT]] YouTube Channel uploaded a documentary titled "Siberian 'Messiah' (RT Documentary)".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF_0y4HRbzU 'Messiah' (RT Documentary)]&lt;/ref&gt; The video shows that he predicts that a great flood is coming and that he promises salvation and spiritual perfection to his followers. His followers choose to abandon their homes and build settlements near the sacred Mountain, where “The Teacher” lives. One woman, a former member of the cult, in the video shares her experience and explains how her new faith has torn her family apart.

In 2017, he appeared on the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Simon Reeve (British TV presenter)#Russia with Simon Reeve (2017)|Russia with Simon Reeve]]''.

There is a community in Russia who are followers of Vissarion in [[Siberia]], the population of this community is 4000. There are Vissarion churches in Germany and in Bulgaria.

'''Yisroel Meir Gabbai''' is a [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslover]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]] who travels the world to locate, repair and maintain [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and ''[[Grave (burial)|kevarim]]'' (gravesites) of Torah notables. He is the founder of Agudas Ohalei Tzadikim.

==Early life==
Gabbai's father was a native of [[Morocco]] and his mother a descendant of [[German Jews]]; they married in [[France]], where Gabbai was born.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamodia.com/inthepaper.cfm?ArticleID=586 |title=Preserving Mezhibuz's History: An interview with Rabbi Yisrael Meir Gabay, the longtime askan who is involved in restoring kivrei tzaddikim'' |last=Stern |first=Shlomo |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-04 |publisher=[[Hamodia]] Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aliyah to Israel==
He along with his family later moved to [[Israel]]. In his youth, Gabbai attended Yeshivas [[Lucerne]] under Rav [[Yitzchok Dov Koppelman]] and went on to study in the [[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]] and the Breslov Yeshiva in [[Jerusalem]].

==Grave restoration==
In 1980, Gabbai traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] for the first time to visit the grave of Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]] in [[Uman]], [[Ukraine]]. Upon touring other cities, he was shocked by the degradation and ruin of Jewish holy sites in Russia. During the Soviet era, Jewish gravestones were often uprooted by vandals or by poor people who used the stones for heating and building.&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt; In large cities, the Soviets destroyed and paved over entire cemeteries to build sports complexes and other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-11-27-toleikis-en.html |title=Repress, reassess, remember |last=Toleikis |first=Vytautas |date=2008-11-27 |accessdate=2010-06-04 |publisher=[[Eurozine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, after the fall of Communism, Gabbai began his work of identifying and restoring Jewish holy sites in the Former Soviet Union.

In [[Medzhybizh]], Ukraine, burial place of the [[Baal Shem Tov]], Gabbai was instrumental in refurbishing the Baal Shem Tov's grave and ''[[Ohel (grave)|ohel]]'', which also covers the graves of the [[Moshe Chaim Ephraim of Sudilkov|Degel Machaneh Ephraim]], the [[Avraham Yehoshua Heshel|Apter Rav]], and Rabbi [[Boruch of Medzhybizh]]. Gabbai also built a large [[synagogue]] near the Baal Shem Tov's burial place, a guest house and a [[mikveh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5761/tezave/agravstn.htm | title= Renovation of Gravestones in Eastern Europe |date=2001-03-07 |accessdate=2010-06-04 |publisher=Dei'ah VeDibur}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently completing the reconstruction of the synagogue of the Apter Rav in Medzhybizh, which was destroyed by fire.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Shlomo. ''Preserving Mezhibuz's History: An interview with Rabbi Yisrael Meir Gabay, the longtime askan who is involved in restoring kivrei tzaddikim'' (full article). ''Hamodia'' Magazine, 18 May 2010, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his website, Gabbai is active in nearly every Jewish cemetery in Ukraine, renovating, fencing and marking cemeteries which have been paved over for buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.otzadikim.com/OurApproach.aspx |title=Our Approach |accessdate=2010-06-04 |publisher=otzadikim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also established a permanent ''[[Sanctuary lamp|ner tamid]]'' at the graves of the Baal Shem Tov and Rebbe Nachman of Breslov.&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt;

In recent years, Gabbai expanded his activities to include grave restoration work in [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Turkey]] and [[Israel]]. 

Gabbai calls on many resources in his work. For example, in the restorations in Mezhibuz, he consulted with an elderly Jew living in [[Ashdod]], Israel, who had hid in Mezhibuz as an 18-year-old refugee during World War II, and with a rabbi whose father, the former Rav of the town, had sketched a detailed map that identified important graves and Jewish landmarks.&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt; In his quest to identify the unmarked grave of [[Rashi]], he consulted with a French-Jewish philosopher who was able to access academic archives to unearth an ancient map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5764/VYC64features.htm |title=A Man with a Grave Mission (Part I) |last=Friedman |first=Yisroel |date=2004-01-07 |accessdate=2010-06-04 |publisher=Dei'ah VeDibur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
His accomplishments include:
* The identification of the grave of Rabbi [[Shalom Shabazi]] in Yemen
* The identification of the grave of Rabbi [[Refael Katzin]], nineteenth-century chief rabbi of [[Aleppo]], in Aleppo, Syria
* Renovation of the grave of Rabbi [[Naphtali Cohen|Naphtali Katz]] in [[Istanbul]]
* The purchase of part of the ancient cemetery in [[Shepetivka]], Ukraine, and the identification and restoration of the grave and ''ohel'' of Rabbi [[Pinchas of Koretz]], plus the construction of a nearby guest house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twotzaddiks.org/part3.html#fn424ref |title=Part 3: Deaths and Gravesites of the Two Tzaddiks |last=Steeble |first=Susan K. |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-04 |publisher=twotzaddiks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identification and restoration of the graves of [[Abba Hilkiah]] and [[Hanan ha-Nehba]], both grandchildren of [[Honi HaM'agel]], in northern Israel
* Placement of a plaque at the burial site of [[Rashi]] and other [[Rishonim]], alerting visitors that an unmarked square in the city of [[Troyes]], [[France]] is in fact part of an ancient Jewish cemetery

==Traveling abroad==
While Gabbai is a resident of Israel, he also has a French passport which allows him to enter countries hostile to Israel, such as Syria. When he travels, however, he makes no secret of his mission and dresses in full Hasidic regalia, including flat-topped, wide-brim hat, hand-knitted yarmulke, short pants and Hasidic [[rekel]] (long coat), in addition to his full beard and [[payot]].&lt;ref&gt;Growise, Avraham. ''Our Man in Damascus: Rabbi Yisrael Meir Gabbai is the first non-Syria chareidi to visit in half a century, according to the leader of Syria's dwindling Jewish community''. [[Hamodia]], Israel News, 7 May 2008, pp. A26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoh is a shaman with a lazy demeanor who is accompanied by a six-hundred-year-old samurai ghost, [[Amidamaru]]. When first introduced, Yoh appears as a young teenager who wishes to become the "Shaman King", the world's ruler, in an attempt to grant his own wish of living a peaceful life. However, as he befriends more people in the shaman fighting tournament to become the Shaman King, it is revealed Yoh has an twin brother named [[Hao Asakura]] who wishes to destroy humanity. As a result, Yoh's objective changes to stop his brother's hatred to mankind.

Yoh also in the prequel ''Shaman King Zero'' and in the sequel ''Shaman King Flowers''. He also appears in the [[anime]] adaptation of ''Shaman King'' where his Japanese voice actress is [[Yūko Satō (voice actress)|Yūko Satō]], and his English dub voice is provided by [[Sebastian Arcelus]]. He also appears as the protagonist in all the ''Shaman King'' [[video games]] and appears in multiple crossover [[fighting game]]s alongside other characters that appeared in the same magazine that ''Shaman King'' debuted. Critical reception to Yoh has been mostly positive, based on his interactions with other characters. Merchandising based on him has also been released.

==Creation==
For Takei, Yoh was the hardest character to make; Takei explained that it was difficult to develop Yoh's character because of the criteria set by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.manga-news.com/index.php/actus/2007/09/06/Interview-Hiroyuki-Takei  Interview with Manga-News.com (French)]''&lt;br&gt; '''MN – Quel est donc celui qui est le plus facile à dessiner, et au contraire le plus difficile?'''&lt;br&gt;''HT – Anna est la plus facile et Yoh le plus difficile. Par là je n'entends pas que le coté dessin pur mais plutôt l'aspect évolutif du personnage et son caractère. Pour Yoh, il a été pour moi plus difficile à faire évoluer dans les critères que demande le Jump magazine.''&lt;br&gt;(''Translation'': '''MN - Who is the easiest to draw and who is the most difficult?'''&lt;br&gt;''HT - Anna is the easiest and Yoh is the most difficult.  By that I don't mean drawing, but developing the characters.  For Yoh, it was hard for me to develop him because of the criteria required for ''Jump'' magazine.'')&lt;/ref&gt;  The engagement between Yoh and Anna being introduced at the beginning of the story has been regarded as unusual for a [[shonen]] manga for its maturity and partly reflects Takei's own personal experience, but it still an ideal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'' interview with Hiroyuki Takei, 2005.&lt;br&gt;'''Q: The fact that Yoh is engaged to Anna from the beginning of the story is unusual for a shonen manga. In many ways, their relationship is more mature than the relationships between male and female characters in usual shonen manga. Has your own marriage influenced your depiction of Yoh and Anna?'''&lt;br&gt;''Takei: I think it reflects quite a bit of my own personal experience. I wouldn't say it is a direct copy. But the relationship both characters have, is quite an ideal relationship, I would say.''&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==
Yoh is the protagonist of ''Shaman King'' who befriends a fellow student from school named [[List of Shaman King characters#Manta Oyamada|Manta Oyamada]] during his introduction. When Manta is badly beaten by local delinquents led by "Wooden Sword" Ryu, Yoh reveals himself to be a shaman and comes to Manta's defence with the help of a six-hundred-year-old samurai ghost, [[Amidamaru]].  Yoh and Manta soon become best friends and have numerous adventures involving local ghosts until Yoh reveals his actual purpose in coming to Tokyo: he has come to train for the Shaman Fight, an event that occurs once every 500 years, where shaman from all over the world will battle to become the Shaman King and gain the power to change the world.  In order to ensure he trains properly, Yoh is soon joined by his fiancée [[Anna Kyoyama]], an [[itako]] from Aomori, who drives Yoh relentlessly and brutally so that he may stand up to the powerful opponents he will have to contend with in order to become Shaman King. While Yoh possesses an overly laid-back personality and lazy demeanor, he is noted as being a perceptive individual who is generally able to remain cool under pressure.  His most distinctive trait is a pair of orange [[headphones]] and a necklace with three bear claws, both which he wears almost constantly; his usual attire consists of his school uniform with his shirt unbuttoned along with a pair of sandals.  He is the latest descendant and heir to the Asakura family, a prestigious family of shaman whose lineage dates back to the [[Heian era]].

Despite Yoh's claims that he wishes to become Shaman King merely to live an easy life, his primary motivation is the promise he made to Anna when they first met and he saved her life after her powers, fueled by her deep-seated hatred of humanity and the resulting loneliness she felt, nearly destroyed her. Because Yoh's own loneliness in childhood, resulting from being regarded as an outcast by his peers for being a shaman, he deeply treasures his friends and will not hesitate to do anything to protect them.

It is revealed in the series Yoh was born as the younger of a pair of identical twin brothers to Keiko Asakura and Mikihisa Maki. Before Yoh's birth, it had been predicted that the family's progenitor, [[Hao Asakura]], would reincarnate himself for the second time as one of Keiko's children and attempt to become Shaman King. The circumstances allowed the Asakuras to spare Yoh and Yohmei raised his grandson with the hope that he would be able to defeat Hao once and for all, thwarting Hao's plans to create a shaman only world.

In 1995, Yoh's grandmother Kino suggests that Yoh be engaged to her apprentice, Anna Kyoyama.  Accompanied by the spirit [[Matamune]], Yoh went to Aomori and fell in love with Anna at first sight.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaman King'', volume 19, chapter 164-166&lt;/ref&gt;  However, her unchecked ability to read minds resulted in Anna closing her heart off and developing a hatred of humanity, which manifested as powerful demons.  Matamune, who had once been the original Hao's greatest friend, used his power to help Yoh save Anna; Anna began to open her heart again out of the love she had developed for Yoh and Yoh resolved to become strong enough to summon Matamune again in material form.

Upon entering the Shaman Fight, he meets a number of shaman who would become his friends and allies.  Upon the second round of the Shaman Fight, Yoh becomes the leader of "Team Funbari Onsen", which includes "Wooden Sword" Ryu and Faust VIII as his teammates.  When Yoh learns of his connection to Hao and learns more about his past and personality, Yoh becomes determined not only to stop Hao from realizing his plan to create a shaman only world, but also the considerably more difficult task of saving Hao by defeating the darkness in Hao's heart.

===Other appearances===
In ''[[Funbari no Uta]]'', a series of short stories written by [[Hiroyuki Takei]] and set six or seven years after the conclusion of ''Shaman King'', it is revealed that Yoh and Anna have a son named [[Hana Asakura|Hana]].  The child wields Yoh's ''Futsunomitama Sword'' and travels around with Ryu Umemiya in search of the Five Elemental Warriors.  An older Yoh and Anna do not appear until the conclusion of the short series, apparently on their way to Funbari Hill, as they have been travelling around the world in order to resolve various conflicts.  In their absence, Hana was raised by [[Tamao Tamamura]] with no awareness of who his actual parents are, though Tamao intends to tell him when his parents return at last. Yoh and Anna also appear in flashbacks in ''Shaman King Flowers'', the sequel from ''Shaman King'' series set about six or seven years after ''Funbari no Uta'' with Hana.  ''Shaman King Flowers'' also revealed Yoh became a father when he was 16 years old.

Yoh appears as a playable character for the Nintendo DS titles, ''[[Jump Superstars]]'' and ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]''.  He also appears as a main character in the various [[List of Shaman King video games|video games]] based on the ''Shaman King'' series.

Critical reception to Yoh's character has been both positive and negative. Justin Freeman from [[Anime News Network]] qualified Yoh as "easy-going" person. He criticized the fact that "Yoh is a vessel for his ephemeral allies, but in reality they up end being a vessel for him, to the benefit of no one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Freeman, Justin|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/shaman-king-gn-1|title=Shaman King G.novel 1|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 5, 2004|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for Mania Entertainment, Eduardo Chavez commented that Yoh is "such a laid back casual character", and that "Yoh's attitude to not go beyond his own abilities might be a little lazy" but he thinks that is "a smart approach to conserve mental and physical strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chavez, Eduardo |url=http://www.mania.com/shaman-king-vol-07_article_82302.html|title=Shaman King Vol. #07|publisher=Mania|date=October 14, 2005|accessdate=December 9, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109183839/http://www.mania.com/shaman-king-vol-07_article_82302.html|archivedate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Beverdige also from Mania said Yoh is "very much a laid back slacker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/shaman-king-vol-02_article_76409.html|title=Shaman King Vol. #02|author=Beveridge, Chris|date=October 19, 2004|publisher=Mania|accessdate=December 9, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801130745/http://www.mania.com/shaman-king-vol-02_article_76409.html|archivedate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Hoffman of Comics Village declared "in this first novel, letting the relationships between Yoh, Amidamaru, and Manta flesh out is more important that developing every spiritual entity that shows up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comicsvillage.com/review.aspx?reviewID=552 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121074958/http://comicsvillage.com/review.aspx?reviewID=552 | archivedate=November 21, 2010 | title=Shaman King Volume 1 | author=Hoffman, Alexander | publisher=ComicsVillage | accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood praised the Yoh's "much more idealistic and noble [position] than that of his rivals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activeanime.com/html/2007/04/30/shaman-king-vol-12-advance-review/|title=Shaman King Vol. 12 (Advanced Review)|author=Ellingwood, Holly|date=March 10, 2007|publisher=Active Anime|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' noted that while it was predictable that Yoh will meet other Shamans to become the Shaman King he noted it would be entertaining how the character will develop more powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Story/?file=%2F2006%2F4%2F16%2Flifebookshelf%2F13667204&amp;sec=lifebookshelf | title=Good fight | date=April 16, 2006 | work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate=July 17, 2015 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6a6HbvEP6?url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Story/?file=%2F2006%2F4%2F16%2Flifebookshelf%2F13667204&amp;sec=lifebookshelf | archivedate=July 17, 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing the manga's  twenty-second volume, Margaret Veira from Active Anime remarked the scenes in which Yoh starts feeling rage to the point she said "you can feel the anger emanating from the page! It feels so real!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activeanime.com/html/2009/06/28/shaman-king-vol-22/|title=Shaman King Vol. 12 (Advanced Review)|author=Veira, Margaret|date=June 8, 2009|publisher=Active Anime|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book "Summoning the Spirits: Possession and Invocation in Contemporary Religion", author Andrew Dawson called Yoh the "Japanese Shaman" as he is not based on any religion unlike other characters appearing in the series despite noting some his relationship with the spirit of Amidamaru who is closed on Buddahood. Dawson also praised Yoh's character for being relatable with most of the readers of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Summoning the Spirits: Possession and Invocation in Contemporary Religion|author=Dawson, Andrew|year=2010|isbn=978-1848851627|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
