== Community principles ==
The following principles, also noted as the Ahwahnee Principles for Resource-Efficient Communities were made by the Local Government Commission in 1991: 
# All Planning should be in the form of complete and integrated communities containing housing, shops, work places, schools, parks and civic facilities essential to the daily life of the resident.
# Community size should be designed so that housing, jobs, daily needs and other activities are within easy walking distance of each other.
# As many activities as possible should be located within easy walking distance of transit stops.
# A community should contain a diversity of housing types to enable citizens from a wide range of [[Economy|economic]] levels and age groups to live within its [[Border|boundaries]].
#Businesses within the community should provide a range of job types for the community’s residents.
#The location and character of the community should be consistent with a larger transit network.
#The community should have a center focus that combines commercial, civic, cultural and recreational uses.
#The community should contain an ample supply of specialized open space in the form of squares, greens and parks whose frequent use is encouraged through placement and design.
#Public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence of people at all hours of the day and night.
#Each community or cluster of communities should have a well defined edge, such as agricultural greenbelts or wildlife corridors, permanently protected from development.
#Streets, pedestrian paths and bike paths should contribute to a system of fully connected and interesting routes to all destinations.  Their design should encourage pedestrian and bicycle use by being small and spatially defined by buildings, trees and lighting; and by discouraging high-speed traffic.
#Wherever possible, the natural terrain, drainage, and vegetation of the community should be preserved with superior examples contained within parks or greenbelts.
#The community design should help conserve resources and minimize waste.
#Communities should provide for the efficient use of water through the use of natural drainage, drought tolerant landscaping and recycling.
#The street orientation, the placement of buildings and the use of shading should contribute to the energy efficiency of the community.

'''Anton Günther''' (17 November 1783, Lindenau, [[Habsburg Bohemia|Bohemia]] (now part of [[Cvikov]], [[Czech Republic]]) &amp;ndash; 24 February 1863, [[Vienna]]) was an [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[philosopher]] whose work was condemned by the church as heretical [[tritheism]]. His work has been described as [[Liberal Catholicism]] and Vienna's first Catholic political movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Ellen Lovell |title=The Cross and the Ballot: Catholic Political Parties in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands, 1785-1985 |date=1999 |publisher=BRILL |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bunnell |first1=Adam |title=Before Infallibility: Liberal Catholicism in Biedermeier Vienna |date=1990 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born the son of devout Catholic parents at Lindenau (now part of [[Cvikov]]) in [[Bohemia]]. From 1796 to 1800 he attended the monastic school of the [[Piarists]] at [[Haide]] and from 1800 to 1803 the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] of Leitmeritz. Subsequently he studied philosophy and jurisprudence at [[Prague]]. After completing these studies he became a [[tutor]] in the household of Prince Bretzenheim.
 
The religious views of the young man had been sadly shaken during the years of his student life by his study of the modern systems of philosophy ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], Jacob and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]); but his removal in 1811 to [[Brno|Brünn (Brno)]] near Vienna with the princely family mentioned above brought him under the influence of the parish priest of this place, named Korn, and particularly of [[Saint Clement Mary Hofbauer]], and restored him to firm Catholic convictions. He then took up the study of theology, first at Vienna and afterwards at [[Győr|Raab (Győr)]] in Hungary, where in 1820 he was ordained to the priesthood. In 1822 he entered the [[Jesuit]] [[novitiate]] at [[Starawicz]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], but left it in 1824. For the rest of his life he resided at Vienna as a private ecclesiastic, and until 1848 occupied a position in that city as a member of the State Board of Book Censorship. He died in Vienna.

==Work==
From 1818 Günther was active in the world of letters as contributor to the "Viennese Literary Chronicle" (''Wiener Jahrbücher der Literatur'').
 
In 1828 began to appear the series of works in which he expounded his peculiar system of philosophy and speculative theology: 
*''Vorschule zur speculativen Theologie des positiven Christenthums'' (Introduction to the Speculative Theology of Positive Christianity), in letter form; part I: "Die Creationstheorie" (The Theory of Creation); part II "Die Incarnationstheorie" (The Theory of the Incarnation) (1st ed., Vienna, 1828-9; 2nd ed., 1846-8); 
*''Peregrins Gastmahl. Eine Idylle in elf Octaven aus dem deutschen wissenschaftlichen Volksleben, mit Beiträgen zur Charakteristik europäischer Philosophie in älterer und neuerer Zeit'' (Vienna, 1830; new ed., 1850); 
*''Süd- und Nordlichter am Horizont speculativer Theologie, Fragment eines evangelischen Briefwechsels'' (Vienna, 1832; new ed., 1850); 
*''Janusköpfe für Philosophie und Theologie'' (in collaboration with J. H. Pabst; Vienna, 1833); 
*''Der letzte Symboliker. Eine durch die symbolischen Werke Dr. J. A. Möhlers und Dr. F. C. Baurs veranlasste Schrift in Briefen'' (Vienna, 1834); 
*''Thomas a Scrupulis. Zur Transfiguration der Persönlichkeits-Pantheismen neuester Zeit'' (Vienna, 1835); 
*''Die Juste-Milieus in der deutschen Philosophie gegenwärtiger Zeit'' (Vienna, 1838); 
*''Eurystheus und Herakles. Metalogische Kritiken und Meditationen'' (Vienna, 1843). 

A new edition of these eight works, collected into nine volumes, appeared at Vienna in 1882 under the title of Günther's ''Gesammelte Schriften''. In addition to these, Günther produced in conjunction with [[J. E. Veith]]: "Lydia, Philosophisches Jahrbuch" (5 volumes, Vienna, 1849–54). His "Lentigos und Peregrins Briefwechsel" was printed in 1857, but was issued only for private circulation. Finally, long after Günther's death, [[Franz Peter Knoodt]] published from his posthumous papers "Anti-Savarese" (Vienna, 1883).

==Views ==
Abounding in polemic against widely divergent schools of philosophy, of a style aphoristic, often quaintly humorous, and sparkling with flashes of genius, but frequently such in form and tenor as to prove little palatable to the reader, Günther's writings contain only sporadic fragments of his thought. 

In all his scientific work, Günther aimed at the intellectual confutation of the [[Pantheism]] of modern philosophy, especially in its most seductive form, the [[Hegelian]], by originating such a system of Christian philosophy as would better serve this purpose than the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] system which he rejected, and would demonstrate clearly, even from the standpoint of natural reason, the truth of positive Christianity. As against this Pantheism, he seeks a speculative basis for Christian "Creationism" in the twofold dualism of God and the world, and within the world of spirit and nature; he furthermore strives to demonstrate scientifically that the fundamental teachings of the Christian Faith, and even the mysteries of the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]], at least in their ''raison d'être'' if not in their form, are [[logical truth|necessary truths]] in the mere light of reason. He would thus change faith into knowledge. A systematic and complete development of his ideas is not given in any of his works, not even in his "Introduction to Speculative Theology", in which one would most naturally look for it. 

The starting-point of Günther's speculation is his theory of knowledge. Man is endowed with a twofold faculty of thought, the one a logical or conceptual function, which deals with appearances, and the other [[ontological]], ideal, self-conscious, which penetrates through appearances to being; hence it is inferred that there are in man two essentially different thinking subjects. This "dualism of thought" establishes the dualism of spirit (''Geist'') and nature in man, who thus exhibits their synthesis. The subject of the conceptual function is the ''Seele'' 'soul', which belongs to the nature-principle (''Naturprincip''). From the "mind" must be distinguished the ''Geist'' 'spirit', which differs from the former essentially as the subject of ideal thought.
 
The first result of this ideal thought-process is self-consciousness, the knowledge which man acquires of himself as a real being. The immediate object of inner perception is the conditions or states of the Ego, which make their appearance as the expressions of the two primary functions, "receptivity" and "spontaneity", when these are called into activity by influences from without. Inasmuch as the soul refers the manifestations of these two forces to the one principle and contradistinguishes itself as a real being from whatever appears before it, it arrives at the idea of the Ego. By this speculative process, which Günther calls a "[[metalogic]]al" or ideal (''ideell'') inference, as distinct from a logical or conceptual conclusion, the idea of its own being becomes for the soul the most certain of all truths (the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] ''[[cogito ergo sum]]''). Then from the certainty of its own existence the thinking soul arrives at the knowledge of an existence outside itself, since it is confronted by phenomena which it cannot refer to itself as cause, and for which, in line with the ontological inference, it must assign a cause in some real being external to itself. 

Thus regarding man as a compound of two qualitatively different principles, spirit and nature, he arrives at the knowledge of the real existence of nature. The fact of self-consciousness leads him also to the knowledge of God; and Günther believes that the following [[proof of the existence of God]] is the only one that is possible and conclusive: when the soul, once self-conscious, has become certain of the reality of its own existence, it immediately recognizes that existence as afflicted with the negative characteristics of dependency and limitedness; it is therefore compelled to postulate another being as its own condition precedent or its own creator, which being it must recognize, in contradistinction to itself and its own inherent negative characteristics, as absolute and infinite. Wherefore this being cannot be the Absolute Being of Pantheism, which only arrives at a realization of itself with the development of the universe; it must be One Who dominates that universe and, differing substantially from it, is the personal Creator thereof. This is the point at which Günther's speculative theology takes up the thread. Proceeding along purely philosophical lines, and prescinding entirely from historical Divine Revelation, the absolute necessity of which Günther contests, it seeks to make evident the fundamental tenets of positive Christianity by the mere light of reason. Thus, to begin with, the threefold personality of God is, according to him, the consequence of that process which must be supposed to take place in God as well as in the created soul, whereby the differentiation or transition is made from indeterminateness to determinateness, with the difference that this process in God must be thought of as consummated from all eternity. God, according to this theory, first sets up for His own contemplation a complete substantial emanation (''Wesensemanation'') of His own Being (Thesis and Antithesis: Father and Son); a further total substantial emanation, which issues from both simultaneously, constitutes the third personal Subject (the [[Holy Ghost]]), or the Synthesis, in which the opposition of thesis and antithesis disappears and their perfect parity is made manifest. 

On his views concerning the Trinity, Günther builds up his theory of the Creation. Inseparably united with the self-consciousness of God in the three Divine Persons is His idea of the Non-Ego, that is, the idea of the Universe. This idea, in formal analogy to the threefold Divine Being and Life, has likewise a threefold scheme of Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis. God's love for this world-idea is His motive for realizing it as His own counterpart (Contraposition), and as necessarily entailing all three of its factors, two of which (spirit and nature) are in antithesis to each other, while the third (man) exists as the synthesis of both. This world-reality, which God, by the mere act of His will, has through creation called from nothingness into being, does indeed exist as really as God Himself; its reality, however, is not drawn from the essence of God, but endures as a thing essentially different from Him, since it is indeed the realized idea of non-Divine Being and Life (Dualism of God and Universe). Thus the two antithetical factors of spirit and nature in the created world differ substantially from each other and stand in mutual opposition. The antithetical relation of spirit and nature shows itself in this, that the realm of the purely spiritual is formed of a plurality of substances, of unitary and integral real principles, each of which must ever retain its unity and its integrity; while nature, which was created a single substance, a single real principle, has in its process of differentiation lost its unity for ever, and has brought forth, and still brings forth, a multiplicity of forms or individuals. For this very reason nature, in her organic individual manifestations, each of which is only a fragment of the universal nature-substance, can only attain to thought without self-consciousness. Self-conscious thought, on the other hand, is peculiar to the spirit, since self-consciousness, the thought of the Ego, presupposes the substantial unity and integrity of a free personality. The synthesis of spirit and nature is man. From man's character as a generic being, the result of his participation in the life of nature, Günther deduces the rational basis of the dogmas of the Incarnation and Redemption. And, as this explains why the guilt of the first parent extends to the entire race, so also does it show how God could with perfect consistency bring about the redemption of the race which had fallen in Adam through the God-Man's union with that race as its second Head, Whose free compliance with the Divine will lay the basis of the fund of hereditary merit which serves to cancel the inherited guilt. 

Günther was a faithful Catholic and a devout priest. His philosophical labours were at any rate a sincere and honest endeavour to promote the triumph of positive Christianity over those systems of philosophy which were inimical to it. But it is questionable whether he pursued the right course in disregarding the fruitful labours of Scholastic theology and philosophy–of which, like all who scorn them, he had but scanty knowledge–and permitting his thought, particularly in his natural philosophy, and his speculative method to be unduly influenced by those very systems (of [[Hegel]] and Schelling) which he combated. The fact is that the desired result was in no wise attained. The schools of philosophy which he thought he could compel, by turning their own weapons against them, to recognize the truth of Christianity, took practically no notice of his ardent contentions, while the Church not only was unable to accept his system as the true Christian philosophy and to supplant with it the Scholastic system, but was finally obliged to reject it as unsound.

==Reception and ecclesiastical condemnation==
Among Catholic scholars Günther's speculative system occasioned a far-reaching movement. Though he never held a position as professor, he gathered about him through his writings a school of enthusiastic and in some instances distinguished followers, who on the other hand were opposed by eminent philosophers and theologians. At its zenith the school was powerful enough to secure the appointment of some of its members to academic professorships in Catholic philosophy. Günther himself was offered professorships at [[Munich]], [[Bonn]], [[Breslau]] and [[Tübingen]]; he refused these because he hoped for a like offer from Vienna, but his expectation was never realized. In 1833 he received from Munich an honorary degree of Doctor of Theology, and a similar degree in philosophy and theology was conferred on him by the University of Prague in 1848.
 
His earliest friends and collaborators were: the physician, [[Johann Heinrich Pabst]] (died 1838, author of "Der Mensch und seine Geschichte", Vienna, 1830; 2nd ed., 1847; "Gibt es eine Philosophie des positiven Christenthums?" Cologne, 1832; "Adam und Christus. Zur Theorie der Ehe", Vienna, 1835; in collaboration with Günther, the "Janusköpfe"); the celebrated homilist [[Johann Emmanual Veith]], a convert (d. 1876, co-editor of the publication "Lydia") and [[Karl Franz von Hock]] (d. 1869; wrote "Cartesius und seine Gegner, ein Beitrag zur Charakteristik der philosophischen Bestrebungen unserer Zeit", Vienna, 1835, and other works; later took an active part in the discussion of political and economical questions).
 
Other prominent adherents of Günther were: [[Johann Heinrich Loewe|Johann Heinrich Löwe]] (professor of philosophy at [[Salzburg]], 1839–51; at Prague, 1851); [[Johann Nepomuk Ehrlich]] (d. 1864; from 1836 taught philosophy in [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]]; in 1850 became professor of moral theology at [[Graz]], in 1852 at Prague, where in 1856 he became professor of [[fundamental theology]]); [[Jakob Zukrigl]] (d. 1876; professor of apologetics and philosophy at Tübingen, 1848); [[Franz Xaver Schmid|Xaver Schmid]] (d. 1883; in 1856 he became a Protestant); [[Jakob Merten]] (d. 1872); professor of philosophy in the seminary of [[Trier]], 1845–68); [[Karl Werner]] (d. 1888; professor at [[St. Pölten]], 1847; at Vienna, 1870); [[Theodor Gangauf]], [[O.S.B.]] (d. 1875; professor of philosophy at the college of [[Augsburg]], 1841–75, and simultaneously, 1851–59, Abbot of the [[Benedictine]] convent of St. Stephen's at the same place); [[Johann Spörlein]] (d. 1873; from 1849 professor at the college of [[Bamberg]]); [[Georg Karl Mayer]] (d. 1868; from 1842 professor at the college of Bamberg); Peter Knoodt (d. 1889; from 1845 professor of philosophy at Bonn); [[Peter Joseph Elvenich]] (d. 1886; from 1829 professor of philosophy at Breslau, at first a [[Hermesian]] and later a disciple of Günther); [[Johann Baptista Baltzer]] (d. 1871; from 1830 professor of dogmatic theology at Breslau, originally a [[Hermesian]]); [[Joseph Hubert Reinkens]] (d. 1896; from 1853 professor of church history at Breslau; from 1873 Old Catholic bishop at Bonn). Finally, in a younger generation, the most distinguished advocates of the system were pupils of Knoodt, [[Theodor Weber]] (d. 1906; professor of philosophy at Breslau, 1872–90; from 1890 vicar-general under Reinkens at Bonn, and from 1896 [[Old Catholic]] bishop in that city), whose "Metaphysik" (2 volumes, Gotha, 1888–91), containing an independent reconstruction of Günther's speculation, is on the whole the most important work of the Güntherian School; and [[Ernst Melzer]] (d. 1899 at Bonn). 

Among the literary opponents of Günther's philosophy the following deserve mention: [[Johann Hast]], [[Wenzeslaus Mattes]], [[P. Volkmuth]], [[P. Ildephons Sorg]], [[O.S.B]]., [[Johann Nepomuk Oischinger]], [[Franz Xaver Dieringer]], [[Franz Jakob Clemens]], [[Friedrich Bernhard Ferdinand Michelis|Friedrich Michelis]], [[Johann Adam Hitzfelder]], [[Joseph Kleutgen]] and [[Johannes Katschthaler]].

==Branded heretical==
The [[Congregation of the Index]] in Rome began in 1852 an investigation of Günther's doctrines and writings, Günther being invited to appear personally or to send some of his disciples to represent him. This mission was entrusted to Baltzer and Gangauf who arrived at Rome in November, 1853. Gangauf was replaced by Knoodt, a professor of theology at Bonn, in the summer of 1854. The latter and Baltzer laboured together until the end of November in that year, when they submitted their written defence to the Congregation of the Index and returned to Germany. Yet their efforts and the favourable intervention of friends in high station failed to avert the final blow, though they served to defer it for a time.
 
[[Friedrich, Prince of Schwarzenberg (cardinal)|Cardinal Schwarzenberg]] and [[Melchior, Baron (Freiherr) von Diepenbrock|Cardinal von Diepenbrock]] and Bishop [[Arnoldi of Trier]] were friendly to Günther and assisted him at Rome. Even the head of the Congregation of the Index, Cardinal d'Andrea, was well-disposed towards him. On the other hand, Cardinals [[Johannes von Geissel]], [[Joseph Othmar Rauscher]] and [[Carl von Reisach]] urged his condemnation. By decree of 8 January 1857 the Congregation placed the works of Günther on the ''[[Index librorum prohibitorum]]''. The special grounds of this condemnation were set forth by [[Pius IX]] in the Brief addressed by him to Cardinal von Geissel, [[Archbishop of Cologne]], on 15 June 1857, which declares that Günther's teachings on the Trinity, the Person of Christ, the nature of man, the Creation and particularly his views on the relation of faith to knowledge, as well as fundamental rationalism, which is the controlling factor of his philosophy even in the handling of Christian dogmas, are not consistent with the doctrine of the Church. 

Before the publication of the Index decree, Günther had been summoned to submit thereto, and in fact had declared his acquiescence, but for him internal submission and rejection of his errors was out of the question. He felt keenly the blow, which he looked upon as an injustice and which embittered him; but subsequently he published nothing. Some of his followers, like Merten, now turned away from Güntherianism, but the greater number held to it obstinately, and for many years it found academic support at Bonn (through Knoodt) and at Breslau (through Elvenich and Weber). After the [[First Vatican Council]] most of the Güntherians named above who were still living at the time (with the exception of Veith) joined the [[Old Catholic]] movement, in which some of them assumed leading parts. Their hopes of thus imparting new vigour to Güntherianism were not realized, whereas, by their separation from the Church, they brought about the final elimination of Güntherian influence from Catholic thought.

'''''Arya: A Philosophical Review''''' was a 64-page monthly [[periodical]] written by [[Sri Aurobindo]] and published in [[India]] between 1914 and 1921. The majority of the material which initially appeared in the ''Arya'' was later edited and published in book-form as ''The Life Divine'', ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', ''The Secret of the Veda'', ''The Foundations of Indian Culture'' and ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' as well as a number of translations of [[Vedas|Vedic literature]].

==Conception==
The ''Arya'' was conceived as a joint venture of Sri Aurobindo and Paul Richard, a French national residing at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], in the spring of 1914. Sri Aurobindo remarked on more than one occasion that, though he was not adverse to the idea, it was Richard who initially proposed the project of publishing a journal. In a letter to Dilip Kumar Roy dated September 4, 1934, he wrote:

{{quote|I knew precious little about philosophy before I did the Yoga and came to Pondicherry — I was a poet and a politician, not a philosopher! How I managed to do it? First, because Richard proposed to me to co-operate in a philosophical review — and as my theory was that a Yogi ought to be able to turn his hand to anything, I could not very well refuse....&lt;ref name="harvp|Roy|1952|p=49"&gt;{{harvp|Roy|1952|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was clear to Sri Aurobindo that the proposed journal would represent a medium through which he could give voice to his still-emerging philosophy – both in India and abroad. In a letter to Motilal Roy from June 1914, he wrote:

{{quote|[This] attempt takes the form of a new philosophical review with Richard and myself as Editors — the ''Arya'', which is to be brought out in French and English, two separate editions, — one for France, one for India, England and America. In this Review my new theory of the Veda will appear as also translation and explanation of the [[Upanishads]], a series of essays giving my system of [[Yoga]] and a book of [[Vedanta|Vedantic philosophy]] (not [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s but Vedic Vedanta) giving the Upanishadic foundations of my theory of the ideal life towards which humanity must move. You will see so far as my share is concerned, it will be the intellectual side of my work for the world.&lt;ref name="documents"&gt;''Documents in the Life of Sri Aurobindo''. Retrieved from: [http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ Sri Aurobindo Ashram].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Title==
Although it is unknown who was responsible for the choice of ''Arya'' as the title of the journal, Sri Aurobindo explained what he understood the term to represent. In the second issue (September, 1914), he composed an article entitled ''Arya: Its Significance'' in which he set forth the meaning of the term as he intended it. He wrote:

{{quote|Intrinsically, in its most fundamental sense, ''[[arya]]'' means an effort or an uprising and overcoming. The Aryan is he who strives and overcomes all outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human advance. Self-conquest is the first law of his nature. He overcomes earth and the body and does not consent like ordinary men to their dullness, inertia, dead routine and [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamasic]] limitations. He overcomes life and its energies and refuses to be dominated by their hungers and cravings or enslaved by their [[rajas]]ic passions. He overcomes the mind and its habits, he does not live in a shell of ignorance, inherited prejudices, customary ideas, pleasant opinions, but knows how to seek and choose, to be large and flexible in intelligence even as he is firm and strong in his will. For in everything he seeks truth, in everything right, in everything height and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aurobindo|1989|pp=411–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Program and organization==
The ''Arya'' was advertised as "a review of pure philosophy"&lt;ref name="Our_Programme"&gt;From an English translation of the original French prospectus with the title ''Our Programme''; in ''Documents in the Life of Sri Aurobindo''. Retrieved from: [http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ Sri Aurobindo Ashram].&lt;/ref&gt; with a twofold object:

# A systematic study of the highest problems of existence.
# The formation of a synthesis of knowledge, harmonizing the diverse religious traditions of humanity, occidental as well as oriental.&lt;ref name="Our_Programme"/&gt;

The method of the review was described as one of "realism, at once rational and transcendental; a realism consisting in the unification of intellectual and scientific discipline with those of intuitive experimentation."&lt;ref name="Our_Programme"/&gt;

The material appearing in the ''Arya'' was organized under four main headings:

# Synthetic studies in speculative philosophy.
# Translations and commentaries of ancient texts.
# Studies in comparative Religion.
# Practical methods of inner culture and self-development.&lt;ref name="Our_Programme"/&gt;

==Early difficulties==
Although Sri Aurobindo and Richard had planned to share the work of writing and editing the material which was to appear in the journal, Richard was ordered by the French Government to leave Pondicherry and return to France in the middle of 1915.&lt;ref name="documents"/&gt; As a result, the French edition of the journal (''Revue de Grande Synthèse'') was discontinued after only seven issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Iyengar|1945|p=234}}; see also {{harvp|Heehs|2008|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subscriptions for ''Arya'' had been sold prior to publication, and Sri Aurobindo was left with the task of completing the outstanding issues. As he remarked in 1934:

{{quote|[...] And then he [Richard] had to go to the war and left me in the lurch with 64 pages a month of philosophy all to write by my lonely self...&lt;ref name="harvp|Roy|1952|p=49"/&gt;}}

Excepting the three contributions made by Richard to the journal (''The Wherefore of the Worlds'', ''The Eternal Wisdom'' and the short ''Sons of Heaven''; see below), the bulk of the remainder was composed by Sri Aurobindo himself.

==Discontinuation==
In 1921, after six and a half years of uninterrupted publication, Sri Aurobindo discontinued the ''Arya''. In a private discussion in 1926, he gave his reasons for this decision:

{{quote|I stopped the ''Arya'' when I found that I had to put myself out to much — so to say, externalized too much. The second reason was that I required to be drawn within myself in order to develop certain experiences, so that the energy might be used for inward work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Purani|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subsequent reprinting and distribution==
Although Sri Aurobindo had discontinued its publication, there was an increasing demand for back issues of the ''Arya'' after 1921. This led him to have the ''Arya'' reprinted in seven volumes, preserving the order in which the articles had originally appeared. The contents of these seven volumes are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;These titles, unless otherwise noted, were written by Sri Aurobindo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB)''' was founded in 1969 as the Biofeedback Research Society (BRS). The association aims to promote understanding of [[biofeedback]] and advance the methods used in this practice. AAPB is a non-profit organization as defined in Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Service Code.&lt;ref name = aapb&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aapb.org/ | title = What is Biofeedback?  | publisher = Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | accessdate = 2010-02-22 | date = 2008-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
AAPB aims to advance the development, dissemination and utilization of knowledge about applied [[psychophysiology]] and [[biofeedback]] to improve health and the quality of life through research, education and practice.&lt;ref name = aapb/&gt;

AAPB's aims include:
* the encouragement of scientific research and the expansion of clinical and educational applications of biofeedback and applied psychophysiology,
* the integration of biofeedback with other self-regulatory methods,
* the promotion of high standards of professional practice, ethics, and education,
* the increase of member knowledge through events, publications, educational programs, and special interest sections and divisions,
* making the public aware of biofeedback.&lt;ref name = aapb/&gt;

==Definition of biofeedback==
The [[American Psychological Association]] has named biofeedback as a clinical proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Neblett, R., Shaffer, F., &amp; Crawford, J. (2008). What is the value of Biofeedback Certification Institute of America certification? ''Biofeedback, 36''(3), 92-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB), the Biofeedback Certification Institution of America (BCIA), and the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) approved the following definition of [[biofeedback]] on May 18, 2008:
{{cquote|Biofeedback is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance. Precise instruments measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. These instruments rapidly and accurately "feed back" information to the user. The presentation of this information — often in conjunction with changes in thinking, emotions, and behavior — supports desired physiological changes. Over time, these changes can endure without continued use of an instrument.&lt;ref name = aapb/&gt;}}

==AAPB Foundation==
The AAPB Foundation was formed in 1985 at the urging of then AAPB president, [[Neal Miller]]. Miller believed that the organization should encourage the interest and application of work by students to demonstrate the efficacy of biofeedback techniques. Presently, the foundation annually supports travel scholarships to students whose papers have been accepted for presentation at the annual meeting.

The Foundation for Education and Research in Biofeedback and Related Sciences initiated a program aimed at stimulating biofeedback research at its 2009 Board meeting. The board established funding for three grants at $1,000 each. Eligibility is limited to graduate students doing research in biofeedback and related fields. The award is accompanied by a travel scholarship and a waiver of registration to attend the AAPB annual meeting where the results of the research are presented.&lt;ref name = foundation&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aapb.org | title = AAPB Foundation | publisher = Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | accessdate = 2010-02-22 | date = 2008-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13565">'''Behavioral plasticity''' refers to a change in an organism's behavior that results from exposure to stimuli, such as changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Behavioral plasticity definition"/&gt; Behavior can change more rapidly in response to changes in internal or external stimuli than is the case for most morphological traits and many physiological traits. As a result, when organisms are confronted by new conditions, behavioral changes often occur in advance of physiological or morphological changes. For instance, larval amphibians changed their antipredator behavior within an hour after a change in cues from predators, but morphological changes in body and tail shape in response to the same cues required a week to complete.&lt;ref name="OrizaolaDahl2012"/&gt;

==Background==

For many years, ethologists have studied the ways that behavior can change in response to changes in external stimuli or changes in the internal state of an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tinbergen|first1=Niko|title=The study of Instinct|date=1951|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-501371-9|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel literature, psychologists studying learning and cognition have spent years documenting the many ways that experiences in the past can affect the behavior an individual expresses at the current time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shettleworth|first1=Sarah|title=Cognition, Evolution and Behavior|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531984-2|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in behavioral plasticity gained prominence more recently as an example of a type of [[phenotypic plasticity]] with major consequences for evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=West-Ebberhard/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Snell-Rood"/&gt;

==Types==
Behavioral plasticity can be broadly organized into two types: exogenous and endogenous.&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt; Exogenous plasticity refers to the changes in [[behavioral phenotype]] (i.e., observable behaviors) caused by an external stimuli, experience, or environment. Endogenous plasticity encompasses plastic responses that result from changes in internal cues, such as [[genotype]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, and [[menstruation]].

These two broad categories can be further broken down into two other important classifications. When an external stimuli elicits or "activates" an immediate response (an immediate effect on behavior), then the organism is demonstrating contextual plasticity.&lt;ref name="Snell-Rood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt;  This form of plasticity highlights the concept that external stimuli in a given context activate [[Nervous system|neural]] and [[Hormone|hormonal]] mechanisms or pathways which already exist inside the organism.&lt;ref name="Snell-Rood" /&gt; In contrast, if an organism's current behavior is altered by past experiences, then the animal is said to be exhibiting developmental or "innate" behavioral plasticity.&lt;ref name=Mery/&gt; This form of plasticity is generally thought to require new neuronal pathways to form.

Developmental behavioral plasticity corresponds to the commonly used definition of plasticity: a single genotype can express more than one behavioral phenotype as a result of different developmental routes triggered by differences in past experiences. Developmental plasticity thus includes what is referred to as "[[learning]]". However, developmental plasticity also includes developmental changes in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]] relevant to a particular behavior, such as changes in muscles, limbs, or bones that influence foraging or locomotion throughout and organism's life.&lt;ref name=Snell-Rood/&gt;

A major difference between developmental and contextual plasticity is the inherent trade-off between the time of interpreting a stimuli and exhibiting a behavior. Contextual plasticity is a near immediate response to the environment. The underlying hormonal networks/neuronal pathways are already present, so it is only a matter of activating them. In contrast, developmental plasticity requires internal changes in hormonal networks and neuronal pathways. As a result, developmental plasticity is often, although not always, a slower process than contextual plasticity. For instance, [[habituation]] is a type of learning (developmental plasticity) that can occur within a short period of time. One of the advantages of developmental behavioral plasticity that occurs over extended periods of time is that such changes can occur in concert with changes in morphological and physiological traits. In such cases, the same set of external or internal stimuli can lead to coordinated changes in suites of behavioral, morphological and physiological traits.

==Examples==
Contextual plasticity is typically studied by presenting the same individual with different external stimuli, and then recording their responses to each stimulus. For instance, [[ant]]s can rapidly alter their running speed in response to changes in the external temperature.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt; Another example of contextual plasticity occurs when birds change their vocalizations in response to changes in the pitch or intensity of background noise. Contextual plasticity plays a major role in studies of [[mate preference]], in which each subject is exposed to cues from different mates, and its response to each cue is quantified. In this case, a stronger attractive response to a particular cue is assumed to reflect a preference for mates with that cue.

Developmental plasticity encompasses the many ways that experiences in an organism's past can affect its current behavior. Developmental plasticity thus includes learning, acclimation, and any situation in which environmental conditions early in life affects the behavior expressed later in life (also called ontogenetic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt;  Since a given individual can only be raised under one set of conditions, ontogenetic plasticity is studied by dividing matched individuals into two or more groups, and then rearing each group under a different set of conditions. For instance, this experimental design was used to demonstrate that the density at which moth larvae were raised affected the courtship signals that they produced as adults.&lt;ref name=Zhou/&gt; 
Endogenous plasticity includes [[circadian rhythm]]s, circannual rhythms, and age-dependent changes in behavior. A good example of endogenous plasticity occurs with [[zebrafish]] (''Danio rerio''). Larval zebrafish exhibit circadian rhythms in their responsiveness to light. Even when they are maintained under continuous darkness, the fish are much more responsive to changes in light (i.e. higher contextual plasticity) during subjective day than during subjective night.&lt;ref name=Emran/&gt; Another example involves the changes in an individual's behavior and hormonal profile around the time of [[sexual maturity]]; such changes are affected changes in physiology that occurred months to years earlier in life.&lt;ref name=Snell-Rood/&gt;

==Potential vs. realized plasticity==
A useful distinction to make when looking at behavioral plasticity is between potential and realized plasticity. Potential plasticity refers to the ability of a given phenotypic trait to vary in its response to variation in stimuli, experiences, or environmental conditions. Thus, potential plasticity is the theoretical range in behavioral plasticity that could be expressed. This value is never truly known, but serves more as a baseline in plasticity models. Realized plasticity, on the other hand, refers to the extent to which a given phenotype actually varies in response to changes in a specific stimulus, experience, or environmental condition.

== Individual differences in behavioral plasticity ==

Recent studies of animals have documented individual differences in virtually all of the different types of behavioral plasticities described above.&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt; In addition, behavioral plasticities may themselves be developmentally plastic: individual differences in a type of plasticity that is expressed at a given age may be affected by the conditions to which the subjects were exposed earlier in life. In a variety of species, for instance, social cues during the juvenile period affect the contextual plasticity of responses to cues from potential mates at adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodríguez|first1=Rafael|title=The evolution and evolutionary consequences of social plasticity in mate preferences|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2013|volume=85|pages=1041–1047|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case for many other types of plasticity, researchers studying the development of individual differences in behavioral plasticity have found that genes, prior experiences and interactions between these factors contribute to the individual differences in behavioral plasticity that are expressed at a given age or lifestage. Another question that is currently attracting interest from students of both animal and human behavior is whether different types of behavioral plasticities are correlated with one another across individuals: i.e., whether some individuals are generally more plastic than others. Although there is some evidence that certain types of cognitive traits tend to be positively correlated with one another across individuals (see the [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] in humans), at present there is scant evidence that other types of plasticity (e.g. contextual plasticity and ontogenetic plasticity) are correlated with one another across individuals or genotypes in humans or animals. 
 
==Evolutionary causes and consequences==
Behavioral plasticity can have major impacts on the [[evolution]]ary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of an individual. Both developmental and contextual plasticity influence the fitness of an animal in a novel environment by increasing the probability that the animal will survive in that environment. Developmental plasticity is particularly important in terms of survival in novel environments, because trial-and-error processes such as learning (which encompass both phenotype sampling and environmental feedback) have the ability to immediately shift an entire population close to a new adaptive norm. As such, the ability to express some level of behavioral plasticity can be very advantageous. In fluctuating environments, animals that can change how they respond to differences in stimuli would have a leg up over animals that were set in a rigid phenotype. However, this would only be the case if the costs of maintaining the ability to change phenotype was lower than the benefit conferred to the individual.

'''Cartesian anxiety''' refers to the notion that, since [[René Descartes]] posited his influential form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-mind dualism]], Western [[civilization]] has suffered from a longing for [[ontology|ontological]] certainty, or feeling that [[scientific method]]s, and especially the study of the world as a thing separate from ourselves, should be able to lead us to a firm and unchanging [[knowledge]] of ourselves and the world around us. The term is named after Descartes because of his well-known emphasis on "mind" as different from "body", "[[self]]" as different from "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]". 

[[Richard J. Bernstein]] coined the term in his 1983 book ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis''.

'''Collaborative language systems''' is a therapeutic approach largely based in contemporary [[hermeneutics]], the study of interpretation as a way to produce understanding, while considering both context and cognition, as well as [[social constructionism]]. This approach involves a reciprocal relationship between both the therapist and client, through which the client works through his or her clinical problems using [[dialogical conversation]] with the therapist. The therapist and client work together, utilizing their own, individual knowledge and understanding of the issues, to conceptualize and illuminate the client’s problems and provide new context, meaning and comprehension to those problems based on the collaboration.

== Early sources ==

The theoretical approach known as collaborative language systems evolved from the traditional basis of collaborative therapy. Together, Harlene Anderson and Harry Goolishian took the core values incorporated into practiced therapeutic techniques involving reciprocal approaches toward the client-patient relationship and applied a cooperative understanding of the use of modern language and the role it plays in the formulation of ideas and perception, as well as [[Carl Rogers|Rogerian]] theory towards the therapeutic relationship. Goolishian and Anderson were later joined by Lynn Hoffman in expanding the application of their ideas. The approach corrected by the collective contributors was eventually expounded upon by Tom Andersen, who thrust the theories into a broader range of practice within the field [[family therapy|family systems therapy]].&lt;ref name="Family Therapy Review"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombs|first=Robert|title=Family Therapy Review|year=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-4312-4|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creating collaborative therapy ==

Collaborative therapy emerged as a [[postmodernist]] concept rooted in philosophical principles as a way to challenge existing [[psychotherapeutic]] approaches. The basic foundations upon which collaborative language systems are based involve the formation of our understanding of events and situations based on the words used to describe them. Through narration and dialogue, it is theorized, we give meaning to situations. This meaning changes given the context of the conversation and how we choose to describe it. Collaborative therapists believe that knowledge and language, and thus the meaning each is given, are interdependent, dynamic processes that change through the exchange of information and ideas.&lt;ref name="The New Language of Change"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Harlene|chapter=On a roller coaster: A collaborative language systems approach to therapy |editor-first=Steven |editor-last=Friedman |title=The New Language of Change: Constructive Collaboration In Psychotherapy|year=1993|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-89862-145-3|pages=323–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapist–client relationship ==

Unlike traditional psychotherapy, the collaborative [[therapist]] plays a more active role in the therapist/patient relationship. As narration is essential to this form of therapy, the therapist constantly invites and facilitates the dialogue in order to sustain a constant exchange of ideas and experience. The therapist’s goal is to gain an understanding of the client’s problems through their narration by attempting to comprehend meaning from the perspective of the client. This process serves as a co-learning experience during which the therapist pays close attention to both what and how things are being said. Any comments or suggestions made by the therapist are used simply as a basis for continued conversation rather than an attempt at guidance or persuasion. The role of a collaborative therapist is to provide a context in which the client can begin to author, edit, and re-edit their own lives through the development and exchange of language. Despite the implicit implications regarding influence during this mutual exchange,&lt;ref name="Collaborative Influence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=Tom|title=Collaborative Influence|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy|year=2000|volume=21|issue=3|pages=144–145|url=http://www.anzjft.com/pages/articles/140.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process most closely resembles the ethical practice of re-framing rather than coaching. The collaborative therapist believes that the open exchange of ideas and continuous dialogue will create opportunities for growth and transformation within the client.

== Application of Ideas ==

Collaborative language systems holds to certain core concepts during the conversational practice of therapy. Those concepts are:

* Conversational Partners
* Client Expertise
* "Not Knowing"
* Transparency
* Uncertainty
* "Everyday Ordinary Life"
* Mutual Transformation&lt;ref name="Postmodern Collaborative and Person-Centered Therapies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Harlene|title=Postmodern Collaborative and Person-Centered Therapies|url=http://www.harleneanderson.org/Pages/rogers.htm|work=Journal of Family Therapy|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These philosophies attempt to ensure, while working in tandem, the relationship between client and therapist grows in a mutually inclusive way, expounding upon the knowledge and understanding of situations by placing both the parties on the same level, providing the client the ability to share and explore their understanding openly and freely while setting and meeting their goals for therapy based on the end points they set for themselves. In this way, collaborative therapy builds upon the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] ideals with the client as the expert. It then builds upon the social constructionist view of identity through open dialogue. This theory involves the creation and understanding of problem an situations based upon the context and exchange in which they are formed. As the client and the therapist build their relationship through dialogical conversation, the context and meaning the client gives to the problems they are facing is altered as new perspectives and alternative viewpoints are offered by the therapist for consideration.

{{Spirituality sidebar}}
According to '''divine illumination''', the process of human thought needs to be aided by [[divine grace]]. It is the oldest and most influential alternative to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in the [[theory of mind]] and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/illumination/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an important feature of ancient [[Greek philosophy]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[medieval philosophy]], and the [[Illuminationism|Illuminationist]] school of [[Islamic philosophy]].

==History==
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates detail.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]] ]]
[[Socrates]] says in [[Apology (Plato)|The Apology]] that he had a divine or spiritual sign that began when he was a child. It was a voice that turned him away from something he was about to do, although it never encouraged him to do anything.  [[Apuleius]] later suggested the voice was of a friendly demon &lt;ref&gt;''De deo Socratis'', XVII&amp;ndash;XIX)&lt;/ref&gt; and that Socrates deserved this help as he was the most perfect of human beings.

The early Christian philosopher [[Augustine]] (354 – 430) also emphasised the role of divine illumination in our thought, saying that "The mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside itself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself the nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord,"&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' IV.xv.25&lt;/ref&gt; and "You hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me."&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' X.ii.2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Augustine, God does not give us certain information, but rather gives us insight into the truth of the information we received for ourselves.

:If we both see that what you say is true, and we both see that what I say is true, then where do we see that? Not I in you, nor you in me, but both of us in that unalterable truth that is above our minds.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' XII.xxv.35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Augustine]]]]
Augustine's theory was defended by Christian philosophers of the later Middle Ages, particularly [[Franciscan]]s such as [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]] and [[Matthew of Aquasparta]].  According to Bonaventura:

:Things have existence in the mind, in their own nature (''proprio genere''), and in the eternal art. So the truth of things as they are in the mind or in their own nature &amp;ndash; given that both are changeable &amp;ndash; is sufficient for the soul to have certain knowledge only if the soul somehow reaches things as they are in the eternal art.&lt;ref&gt;''De scientia Christi'', q.4 resp&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine was criticised by [[John Pecham]] and [[Roger Marston]], and in particular by [[Thomas Aquinas]], who denied that in this life we have divine ideas as an object of thought, and that divine illumination is sufficient on its own, without the senses. Aquinas also denied that there is a special continuing divine influence on human thought. People have sufficient capacity for thought on their own, without needing "new illumination added onto their natural illumination".&lt;ref&gt;''Summa theologiae'' 1a2ae 109.1c&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was defended by [[Henry of Ghent]].  Henry argued against Aquinas that Aristotle's theory of [[abstraction]] is not enough to explain how we can acquire infallible knowledge of the truth, and must be supplemented by divine illumination.  A thing has two exemplars against which it can be compared. The first is a created exemplar which exists in the soul. The second is an exemplar which exists outside the soul, and which is uncreated and eternal.  But no comparison to a created exemplar can give us infallible truth. Since the dignity of man requires that we can acquire such truth, it follows that we have access to the exemplar in the divine mind.&lt;ref&gt;''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'', ed. Gracia and Noone&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's defence of divine illumination was strongly criticised by the Franciscan theologian [[Duns Scotus]], who argued that Henry's version of the theory led to [[scepticism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">'''Enterprise liability''' is a [[legal doctrine]] under which individual entities (for example, otherwise legally unrelated corporations or people) can be held [[Joint and several liability|jointly liable]] for some action on the basis of being part of a shared enterprise. Enterprise liability is a form of [[secondary liability]].

==United States==
Suppose high-risk manufacturing activities are shunted into one corporation, while a second "marketing" corporation keeps all the profits.  In the case that someone was injured by the manufacturing activity, a court might apply the enterprise liability doctrine to allow recovery from the marketing corporation, which holds all the assets.

The doctrine emerged from litigation in the wake of the 1977 [[Beverly Hills Supper Club fire]].&lt;ref name="alexander2005"&gt;Alexander, Roberta Sue (2005). ''A place of recourse: a history of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, 1803-2003.'' Ohio University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8214-1602-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhfire1982"&gt;''In Re: Beverly Hills Fire Litigation'', 695 F.2d 207 (6th Cir. 1982), cert, denied 461 US 929 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhfire1984"&gt;''In Re: Beverly Hills Fire Litigation'', 672 S.W.2d 922 (Ky.1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is examined in ''[[Walkovsky v. Carlton]]'', 223 N.E.2d 6 ([[New York Court of Appeals|N.Y.]] 1966).

Enterprise Liability has been used as alternative terminology for [[Industry-Wide Liability]].&lt;ref name="Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories 1980"&gt;Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, 607 P.2d 924 (Cal. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]'', 607 P.2d 924 (Cal. 1980) cites ''[[Hall v. E.I Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., Inc.]]'', 345 F.Supp. 353 (E.D.N.Y. 1972) to explain Industry-Wide Liability, which was equated to Enterprise Liability:

{{Cquote|In ''Hall'', plaintiffs were 13 children injured by the explosion of blasting caps in 12 separate incidents which occurred in 10 different states between 1955 and 1959. The defendants were six blasting cap manufacturers, comprising virtually the entire blasting cap industry in the United States, and their trade association. There were, however, a number of Canadian blasting cap manufacturers which could have supplied the caps. The gravamen of the complaint was that the practice of the industry of omitting a warning on individual blasting caps and of failing to take other safety measures created an unreasonable risk of harm, resulting in the plaintiffs' injuries. 

The complaint did not identify a particular manufacturer of a cap which caused a particular injury. The court reasoned as follows: there was evidence that defendants, acting independently, had adhered to an industry-wide standard with regard to the safety features of blasting caps, that they had in effect delegated some functions of safety investigation and design, such as labeling, to their trade association, and that there was industry-wide cooperation in the manufacture and design of blasting caps. In these circumstances, the evidence supported a conclusion that all the defendants jointly controlled the risk. Thus, if plaintiffs could establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the caps were manufactured by one of the defendants, the burden of proof as to causation would shift to all the defendants. 

The court noted that this theory of liability applied to industries composed of a small number of units, and that what would be fair and reasonable with regard to an industry of five or ten producers might be manifestly unreasonable if applied to a decentralized industry composed of countless small producers.&lt;ref name="Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories 1980"/&gt;}}

The concept of Enterprise Liability is distinguished from [[Market share liability]], a legal doctrine introduced in ''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories''.&lt;ref name="Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories 1980"/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main|UK company law|English tort law}}
The idea of enterprise liability was supported by the Court of Appeal in ''[[DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council]]'', a case on [[piercing the corporate veil]].&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 1 WLR 852&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally in the law of [[English tort law|tort]], the principle has been argued to have been recognised, albeit indirectly, by cases such as ''[[Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2001] UKHL 22, critiqued by [[S Deakin]], '‘Enterprise‐Risk’: The Juridical Nature of the Firm Revisited' (2003) [http://ilj.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/2/97.short 32(2) ILJ 97]&lt;/ref&gt; A general principle of joint liability in tort between different contractors that work in a supply chain was also recognised in ''[[Viasystems Ltd v Thermal Transfer Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2005] EWCA Civ 1151&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Holmes Howison''' (29 November 1834 – 31 December 1916) was an American philosopher who established the philosophy department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and held the position there of Mills Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity. He also founded the [[Philosophical Union]], one of the oldest philosophical organizations in the United States.

Howison's philosophy is set forth almost entirely in his volume entitled ''The Limits of Evolution, and other essays, illustrating the metaphysical theory of personal idealism'' (1901&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vAIQAAAAYAAJ&amp;ots=w5XKmPBykt&amp;dq=The%20limits%20of%20Evolution%20howison&amp;pg=PR29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 1st edition, Table of Contents]&lt;/ref&gt;, 2nd ed.: 1905&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dg3wkAkfKQ4C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 2nd edition, Title Essay, Page #1]&lt;/ref&gt;). Scrutinizing the idea of evolution that had come to the fore, he proved not only that no Person can be wholly "the product of 'continuous creation'", evolution, but went on also to show that, rooted in the very same (''a priori'') reason, fulfilled philosophy necessarily ends in the "Vision Beatific", "that universal circle of spirits which, since the time of the stoics, has so pertinently been called the City of God".

Friends and former students of Howison established the [[Howison Lectures in Philosophy]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradlectures.berkeley.edu/series/howison/|title=Howison Lectures in Philosophy &amp;#124; Series &amp;#124; Berkeley Graduate Lectures|publisher=gradlectures.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, the lecture series has included talks by distinguished philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

==Life==
George Holmes Howison was born on November 29, 1834, in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], and died in [[Berkeley, California]] on December 31, 1916. His parents were Robert Howison of Virginia and Eliza Holmes Howison of Maryland. These were old and distinguished Southern families, Presbyterians and slaveholders. Howison's biography is eclectic and the basis of Howison's later devotion to pluralism. Howison was the primary originator of philosophical pluralism in America, which was his most enduring contribution to philosophy. Although he was widely recognized during his lifetime, Howison's ideas have spread and come into the present mainly through influence on other notable philosophers whose names have continued to attract attention, especially [[Josiah Royce]], [[William James]], and [[Borden Parker Bowne]]. Howison was, by the accounts of those who knew him, a very persuasive philosopher.

When Howison was four years of age his parents freed their slaves and moved to Marietta, Ohio, for the improved educational and cultural life it offered at that time. The various Christian sects there had worked out a consensus and ecumenism, creating a co-operative community in which even Protestants and Catholics worked together. This religious pluralism was exceedingly rare in 19th century North America. Howison attended [[Marietta Academy]] and later [[Harmar Academy]] where he received a classical education, including ancient languages. He entered [[Marietta College]] at 14 and studied German. He studied philosophy in his senior year. After graduating, Howison pursued Christian ministry, graduating from [[Lane Seminary]] in Cincinnati and being licensed to preach. Howison did not take a church, however, and served as a schoolteacher and principal several Ohio towns. In 1862 he moved to Salem, Massachusetts as a school principal. There he met and married Lois Caswell, an English teacher, who was related to several prominent academic families associated with [[Yale University]] and [[Brown University]]. Howison continued to educate himself, especially in mathematics.

Having moved to better and better schools and having made a name for himself as an educator, in 1864 (when he was 30) Howison was offered a post as professor at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. During the following years Howison taught in all the branches of mathematics, including applied fields such as mechanics and astronomy, but also in political economy and Latin. Howison wrote a treatise on analytic geometry (1869) and an algebra primer (1870). In St. Louis Howison also came into contact with a subdivision of the [[St. Louis Philosophical Society]] called The Kant Club, which met at the home of [[William Torrey Harris]]. With this group he read [[G. W. F. Hegel]]'s [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]. His association with Harris and the [[St. Louis Hegelians]] turned Howison's main interest to philosophy. Harris' [[The Journal of Speculative Philosophy]] was started during this time and Howison published an important paper on the relations among the branches of mathematics in one of its early numbers. The Kant Club hosted speeches by both [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Bronson Alcott]]. Washington University offered no opportunity for Howison to pursue philosophy, so he returned to New England to become headmaster at [[English High School of Boston|English High School]] in Boston. In 1872 Howison moved to the new [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] as its Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science, remaining until 1878, when financial problems forced M.I.T. to eliminate his position. It was during these years that Howison began writing philosophy. He held various teaching positions and lectured for money between 1878 and 1882, including courses at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and the [[Concord School of Philosophy]], where he became better acquainted with Emerson and Alcott.

Also during these years he attended every two weeks the informal philosophical meetings in the Temple Street rooms of [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]] with a small group that included William James and Bowne. American philosophical [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and American [[personalism]] began here. These views were differently articulated and defended by James, Bowne, Davidson, and Howison, but their commonalities are many.

Beginning in 1880 Howison traveled and studied in [[Europe]]. In 1881 he enrolled at the [[University of Berlin]], studying [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] with [[Jules Michelet]] which moderated Howison's enthusiasm for Hegel and planted a predilection for Kantian thinking in Howison's mind which remained for the rest of his life.

Howison returned to the US in 1882, and hoped to teach at Harvard while James was on sabbatical, but Royce, being younger and very promising, was given preference. Howison taught privately for a year and although he did not want to leave Boston, he accepted a position at the [[University of Michigan]], which turned out to be not to his liking. At this time, the University of California decided to begin a philosophy program and recruited Howison, now 50 and a prominent voice in academia, as the Mills Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity, and they invited Howison to create a philosophy program according to his own vision. Howison's extensive administrative experience along with his connections to the eastern and mid-western intellectual lights led to great success. Howison was also an inspiring teacher and so the program attracted students easily. Howison's Philosophical Union became a prominent host for public lectures and even debates, hosting such speakers as James, Royce, and [[John Dewey]].

Howison became a popular and controversial speaker and became the progenitor of the California school of American personalism.&lt;ref&gt;See Rufus Burrow, Jr. Personalism: A Critical Introduction (St. Louis: Chalice Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  His heterodox teachings about the nature of God placed him at odds with the theological community, but his incisive ability to defend it against all challenges and his personal charity and moral excellence kept him safe from serious personal attacks. Despite Howison's dissatisfaction with other contemporary and historical metaphysicians, he did continue to profess Christianity. He recognized that his support of Jesus' position was not accepted as he might have hoped by his Christian peers, but maintained that his theory of [[personal idealism]] was in line with Jesus' teaching, particularly as presented by "the 4th gospeler", John. He said: "I feel the strongest assurance that my new interpretation of the name of God is the genuine fulfilment of the highest and profoundest prescience in the historic religious life."&lt;ref&gt;Howison, ''The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays'', 2nd ed. (1905), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was well known and widely respected in the young professional discipline of philosophy, Howison did not publish prolifically. Most of those who have written on Howsion attribute his reluctance to publish to his perfectionism regarding language and writing. He was exacting, as is indicated by his revision of a widely used dictionary of English synonyms (1892).

==Philosophy==

Howison was well aware of what the history of philosophy had to offer.  In fact, he has classified the contributions into four groups, highlighting the type of error into which each fell.  The best of these still fail by their recourse to efficient causation, where Howison notes (p.&amp;nbsp;394) that "combating it is like fighting organised civilisation itself."

The core of Howison's philosophy can be captured in four points: “The Limits of Evolution”, “Personalism”, “Pluralism”, and “Idealism”: 

===The limits of evolution===

This first point establishes a fundamental limit to the notion of evolution.  Experience cannot be the efficient cause of the capacity to experience.  An experience involves an organization of information, howsoever primitive, which could never come about without recourse to an ''a priori'' organizing principle.  The distinction between that which is presented to the senses (outer and/or inner), that is, phenomena, and that which is prerequisite for such apprehension, and noumenal, firmly establishes complexity in the philosopher's quest.  To wit (pp.&amp;nbsp;17–8):

&lt;blockquote&gt;''He'' [Kant] suggested that experience may be not at all simple, but always complex, so that the very possibility of the experience which seems to the empiricist the absolute foundation of knowledge may depend on the presence in it of a factor that will have to be acknowledged as ''a priori''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Personalism===

This second point establishes the nature and scope of the noumenon.  The kernal of the noumenon is Truth which is True whatsoever, with no possibility that it should ever be untrue.  For example: Pi is an irrational number, Necessarily.  Howison provides arguments not only for the noumenality of time-and-space, but, and most importantly, goes all the way to "Truth, Beauty, and, finally, the Good, i.e. benignant love."  This second point shows that the nature of the noumenon, the eternal, the Mind, the continuous copula, is undoubtedly a Person, and firmly establishes personalism in the philosopher's quest.  To wit (p.&amp;nbsp;54):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fulfilled philosophy vindicates our faith in the Personality of the Eternal Ideal, in the reality of God, by vindicating the reality of man the Mind, and exhibiting his legislative relation to Nature and thence to evolution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pluralism===

This third point establishes the personal demand for reciprocity, mutual personalism, pluralism.  Personality is not only ''a priori'' complex, but also ''a priori'' relational.  And, at its best, is in some sense all-inclusive, universal.  This point goes so far as to argue that no conception of God which does not rise to this degree of dignity, ultimate and eventual individual parity, in rights and duties, is no conception of God at all.  To wit (pp.&amp;nbsp;338–9):

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are not to evade, then, the eternity of free beings that is implied in any serious demand for freedom. If the souls of men are really free, they coexist with God in the eternity which God inhabits, and in the governing total of their self-active being they are of the same nature as he, — they too are self-put rational wholes of self-conscious life. As complete reason is ''his'' essence, so is reason ''their'' essence—their nature in the large—whatever may be the varying conditions under which their selfhood, the required ''peculiarity'' of each, may bring it to appear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Idealism===

This fourth point secures morality and freedom by confirming that our creative faculty is one of final causation, or idealism.  This point is mediated by Howison's argument that freedom and determinism harmonize upon "definiteness".  It confirms that the proper meaning of a Person's "eternity" is that the whole of its being is "self-supplying", that it is ''causa sui''.  It confirms that a complete definition of freedom dictates that the soul has a "fund of ultimate resources equal to fulfilling its duty to love as God loves."  To wit (p.&amp;nbsp;350-1):

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am to show you, too, that in the world of eternal free-agents, the Divine offices called creation and regeneration not only survive, but are transfigured; that in this transfiguration they are merged in one, so that regeneration is implicit in creation, and becomes the logical spring and aim of creation, while creation itself thus insures both generation and regeneration—the existence of the natural order within the spiritual or rational, and subject to this, and the consequent gradual transformation of the natural into the image of the spiritual: a process never to be interrupted, however devious, dark, or often retrograde, its course may be. I am to show you all this by the light of Final Cause, which is to take the place of the less rational category of Efficient Causation, since—let it be repeated — this last cannot operate to sustain moral relationship, and since moral values, measured in real freedom, are for the conscience and the new theology the measure of all reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Royce's ''The Conception of God''==

In 1897 [[Josiah Royce]] gave a talk which, along with the arguments of Sidney Edward Mezes, Joseph LeConte, and Howison (presaging his later definitive opus), and the follow-up replies by Royce Himself, was published in the book entitled "''The Conception of God: A philosophical discussion concerning the nature of the divine idea as a demonstrable reality''" (edited by Howison). Howison's section, entitled "The City of God, and the True God as its Head",&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conception of God: A Philosophical Discussion Concerning the Nature of the Divine Idea as a Demonstrable Reality|author1=Royce, J.|author2=LeConte, J.|author3=Howison, G.H.|author4=Mezes, S.E.|date=1897|publisher=Macmillan|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BdINAAAAYAAJ|page=79|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; spans pages 79–132.

Howison characterized Royce's God:

{{quote|Strictly construed, it is, as I have just endeavoured to show, simply the vindication of that active sovereign judgment which is the light of every mind, which organises even the most elementary perceptions, and which goes on in its ceaseless critical work of reorganisation after reorganisation, building all the successive stages of science, and finally mastering those ultimate implications of science that constitute the insights of philosophy.

In other words, the conception is a philosophical and real account of the nature of an ''isolated human being'', or created spirit, the numerical unit in the created universe, viewed as such a spirit appears in what has well been called its ''natural'' aspect; viewed, that is, as the organising subject of a ''natural-scientific'' experience, marked by fragmentariness that is forever being tentatively overcome and enwholed, — if I may coin a word to match the excellent German one ''ergänzt''.}}

At the end of the 80s,  Khutsishvili started researching various methodologies of finding water, biolocation, and bioenergy. His interest in this field was stirred after meeting with the representatives of American dowsers at a Conference in 1989 in the United States. Later, from the beginning of the 1990s, he became a member of the American Society of Dowsers. In 1989, the Institute of Neotic Sciences invited George Khutsishvili to conduct research and awarded him a membership for one year (1990-1991).

In 1988-1990 he went on to work as the head of the Department of Social Sciences at the Ministry of Education of Georgia. In 1992, the Tbilisi State Institute of Foreign languages and Pedagogical Sciences elected him  full professor. He had earlier since 1981 held the position of associate professor and chair of Philosophy.

The State Committee for Human Rights and Ethnic Relations, established in 1992, opened the Centre for Conflict Analysis, especially for Professor George Khutsishvili.  The Centre functioned for 1 year.

On 8 January 1993,  Khutsishvili  was invited to be a Research Fellow to the Centre for International Security and Arms Control, at [[Stanford University]] in the United States While there, he received funding from [[David Packard]],  The American press at that time spoke about George Khutsishvili as a “Fellowship Brings Unique Georgian Perspective to Stanford”. He was offered work as a consultant  the following year in the same Centre, on ethnic conflicts in the post-Soviet space (1994–95).

In the spring of 1993 he was awarded a [[NATO]] Research Fellowship (Democratic Institutions Individual Fellowships Program) grant for  “Caucasus Knot of Conflicts in Light of Growing Global Insecurity”.

==International Centre on Conflict and Negotiation (ICCN)==

Khutsishvili developed his interest in conflict resolution from the beginning of the 1990s. At that time, this field did not exist in Georgia, while in the west it was rather well developed.  In that period, he worked in the Tbilisi Business School where he first introduced his course of studies in conflictology.
 
Upon his return from the United States in 1994,  Khutsishvili established the first independent high-profile organization in Georgia, which gave birth to the Georgian educational and scientific programs on conflict and peace studies. George Khutsishvili and 63 other founding members launched their organization at a meeting held on 8 August 1994, where they established “The International Center on Conflicts and Negotiations Strategy”.  He was granted status as the founder. This non-profit organization with international status was registered by the Department of Registration of the Ministry of Justice of Republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] on 3 October 1994.

On 30 December 1998, the name of the centre was changed to the International Center on Conflict and Negotiation (ICCN) ([www.ICCN.ge]).   Khutsishvili headed the Center until the end of his life. The Centre continues its  activities  and is a powerful, field-oriented [[NGO]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], as well as in the [[Caucasian region]] .

===Peace activities===
Starting in 1995, he edited and issued trilingual magazines and bulletins which provided relevant expert and educational materials on conflict and peace issues for conflict affected

populations. With this, he made a valuable contribution to strengthening civil society; (“[[Conflicts and Negotiations]]” (1995-2001); “Alternative” (1996-1998); “Monada” (1997-1998); “Alternative to Conflict” (1998-2003); “Peace Times” (2001-2013)).

Since 1995, the foundation has been laid for [[Georgian-Abkhaz]] and [[Georgian-Ossetian]] dialogues, on the initiative of George Khutsishvili, in the format of public diplomacy. The International Centre on Conflict and Negotiation headed by  Khutsishvili was a pioneer to start dialogue process. He addressed the Abkhaz people at the Conference (1995) in [[Moscow]], proposing to start the first dialogue, where he met Manana Gurgulia and Roman Dbar. Kumar Rupesinkhe, who was then a representative of [[International Alert]] (IA), [[London]], took an interest in Khutsishvili’s idea, and later the first Georgian-Abkhazian dialogue project was implemented with Rupesinkhe’s support. This project lasted for many years. The first Georgian-Abkhazian dialogue took place in July 1996 . The process of a [[Georgian–Ossetian]] dialogue started in 1995 . The famous scientist Roger Fisher contacted professor Khutsishvili and offered his cooperation in the Georgian–Ossetian and Georgian-Abkhazian format ([[Conflict Management Group]] (CMG) USA). This is how the Georgian–Ossetian dialogue started with the support and financial aid of the NRC ([[Norwegian Refugee Council]]). From the very start, this organization ensured their support to Khutsishvili’s Centre in educational programs for IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons). The first Georgian-Ossetian meeting took place in January 1996, in [[Oslo]], upon the request of the NRC .

In 1996,  Khutsishvili held a joint seminar on “Developing a Regional Security Concept for the Caucasus” with [[NATO]] . This seminar attracted the attention of the West with the following message of his organization: “We need to develop the concept of regional security first, rather than the concepts of national security”. The working topic of this seminar was based on George Khutsishvili’s idea, which he had proposed to [[NATO]] . In that period, NATO was developing the concept of national security in almost all post–Soviet countries, in order to help the nations. Khutsishvili’s idea, which insisted that national security concepts could not be developed without regional security concepts, was considered, discussed and summarized at the seminar. The results were published in the following book in the Georgian and English languages: “Developing a Regional Security Concept for the Caucasus”, International Conference materials, 4–6 October 1996, Tbilisi, Georgia. Editor–George Khutsishvili, 1997 .  Later, [[NATO]] introduced the above approach to many other countries. 
In 2003, he was one of the conveners of a special meeting that founded the “Public Movement against Religious Extremism” to counteract the violent actions of religious extremism that had been gaining momentum in that period. .In 2003-2013, he was a member of the International Steering Group of the [[Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict]] (GPPAC). Within the format of this network, he participated in the work of groups studying different conflicts all over the world. As well as that, he was a member of special missions for international conflict studies, prevention and resolution. The organization founded by George Khutsishvili continues its membership in the GPPAC network, and is its representative in the Caucasus.

The first NGO Congress was held in 2006 in Georgia, followed by the Second and Third NGO Congresses, in 2007 and 2008 respectively, in which Georgian NGOs participated extensively.

After the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008, the post-war rounds of Georgian-Russian meetings and negotiations started on the initiative of professor George Khutsishvili, which later was called the Istanbul Process, being named so due to it being the first post-war meeting ever, which was held in Istanbul in November 2008 . This very first meeting laid the foundation for expert dialogue, which is still going on within the same format. By means of this dialogue, experts have studied the fundamental reasons of the conflict and the ways towards its resolution, jointly. The materials of this Georgian-Russian dialogue, and the ways discussed of overcoming the crises, have already been published in a book.

G. Khutsishvili was one of the initiators and a founder of the [[Public Constitutional Commission]] (PCC), www.konstitucia.ge), which was created in response to the existing political crisis in the country.  This PCC united  constitutionalists and public figures of the country in 2009-2011 . The Public Constitutional Commission developed a completely revised version of the Constitution for the country, which was free from political and party interests. This version of  the Constitution of Georgia, which was developed by the authorship of 17 commission members, was published on 9 April 2010 in a book form (an Expanded Concept of the New Edition of the Constitution of Georgia, Tbilisi, 9 April 2010, {{ISBN|978-9941-0-2364-4}}).

'''Guru''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|uː|r|uː}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ʊr|uː|,_|ˈ|ɡ|ʊər|-}}; {{lang-sa|गुरु}}, [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''guru'') is a [[Sanskrit]] term that connotes someone who is a "[[teacher]], [[guide]], [[expert]], or [[master (disambiguation)|master]]" of certain knowledge or field.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Pertz (2013), The Guru in Me - Critical Perspectives on Management, GRIN Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3638749251}}, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; In pan-[[Indian religions|Indian traditions]], ''guru'' is more than a teacher, in Sanskrit ''guru'' means the one who dispels the darkness and takes towards light, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the ''guru'' serving as a "counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student".&lt;ref name=joelmlecko/&gt; The term also refers to someone who primarily is one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the ''guru''s already realized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/guru-Hinduism Guru], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guru'' is also the word for "[[teacher]]" in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]&lt;ref&gt;https://kbbi.web.id/guru&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malay language]].

The oldest references to the concept of ''guru'' are found in the earliest Vedic texts of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=joelmlecko/&gt; The ''guru'', and ''gurukul'' – a school run by ''guru'', were an established tradition in India by the 1st millennium BCE, and these helped compose and transmit the various [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]], texts of various schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], and post-Vedic Shastras ranging from spiritual knowledge to various arts.&lt;ref name=joelmlecko/&gt;&lt;ref name=tamara/&gt;&lt;ref name=scharfetempleschools2/&gt; By about mid 1st millennium CE, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest numerous larger institutions of ''gurus'' existed in India, some near Hindu temples, where [[guru-shishya tradition]] helped preserve, create and transmit various fields of knowledge.&lt;ref name=scharfetempleschools2/&gt; These gurus led broad ranges of studies including Hindu scriptures, Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.&lt;ref name=scharfetempleschools2/&gt;&lt;ref name=michelltempleschool/&gt;

The tradition of ''guru'' is also found in [[Jainism]], referring to a spiritual preceptor, a role typically served by a Jain [[Jain monasticism|ascetic]].&lt;ref name="Jeffery D Long 2009 pages 110, 196"&gt;Jeffery D Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, IB Tauris, {{ISBN|978-1845116262}}, pages 110, 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patridge252/&gt; In [[Sikhism]], the ''guru'' tradition has played a key role since its founding in the 15th century, its founder is referred to as [[Guru Nanak]], and its scripture as [[Guru Granth Sahib]].&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1982), The Guru in Sikhism, Darton Longman &amp; Todd, {{ISBN|9780232515091}}, pages 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=singhakaur/&gt; The guru concept has thrived in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] Buddhism, where the tantric guru is considered a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.&lt;ref name=berkwitz130/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnston371/&gt;

In the [[Western world]], the term is sometimes used in a derogatory way to refer to individuals who have allegedly exploited their followers' naiveté, particularly in certain [[tantra]] schools, [[self-help]], [[hippie]] and [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref name="Forsthoefel and Humes"&gt;Forsthoefel, T. and C. Humes (2005), ''Gurus in America''&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru is not just a person but it is considered as the divine guiding energy which helps humanity to realise its true nature. This energy works through an able person who is pure enough to hold it. This is the reason in Hinduism Guru is considered as God himself.&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Citation needed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Definition and etymology ==
The word ''{{IAST|guru}}'' (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|गुरु}}), a noun, connotes "teacher" in [[Sanskrit]], but in Indian traditions it has contextual meanings with significance beyond what teacher means in English.&lt;ref name=joelmlecko&gt;Joel Mlecko (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269931 The Guru in Hindu Tradition] Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, pages 33-61&lt;/ref&gt; The ''guru'' is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a "counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life."&lt;ref name=joelmlecko/&gt; The word has the same meaning in other languages derived from or borrowing words from Sanskrit, such as [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The Malayalam term Acharyan or [[Aasaan|Asan]] are derived from the Sanskrit word [[Acharya]].

As a noun the word means the imparter of knowledge (''[[jnana|jñāna]]''; also [[Pali]]: ''ñāna''). As an adjective, it means 'heavy,' or 'weighty,' in the sense of "heavy with knowledge,"{{refn|"Guru: a spiritual master; one who is heavy with knowledge of the Absolute and who removes nescience with the light of the divine."&lt;ref name="tirha"&gt;Tirtha Goswami Maharaj, ''A Taste of Transcendence'', (2002) p. 161, Mandala Press. {{ISBN|1-886069-71-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} heavy with spiritual wisdom,&lt;ref name="lipner"&gt;[[Julius J.

Another etymological theory considers the term "guru" to be based on the syllables ''gu'' ({{lang|sa|गु}}) and ''ru'' ({{lang|sa|रु}}), which it claims stands for darkness and "light that dispels it", respectively.{{refn|"[...] the term is a combination of the two words ''gu''(darkness) and ''ru'' (light), so together they mean 'divine light that dispels all darkness.'"

(1997). p. 231.

[[Reender Kranenborg]] disagrees, stating that darkness and light have nothing to do with the word ''guru''. He describes this as a [[folk etymology]].{{refn|Dutch original: "a. De goeroe als geestelijk raadsman Als we naar het verschijnsel goeroe in India kijken, kunnen we constateren dat er op zijn minst vier vormen van goeroeschap te onderscheiden zijn. De eerste vorm is die van de 'geestelijk raadsman'. Voordat we dit verder uitwerken eerst iets over de etymologie. Het woord goeroe komt uit het Sanskriet, wordt geschreven als 'guru' en betekent 'zwaar zijn', 'gewichtig zijn', vooral in figuurlijk opzicht. Zo krijgt het begrip 'guru' de betekenis van 'groot', 'geweldig' of 'belangrijk', en iets verdergaand krijgt het aspecten van 'eerbiedwaardig' en 'vererenswaardig'. Al vrij snel word dit toegepast op de 'geestelijk leraar'. In allerlei populaire literatuur, ook in India zelf, wordt het woord 'guru' uiteengelegd in 'gu' en 'ru', als omschrijvingen voor licht en duister; de goeroe is dan degene die zijn leerling uit het materiële duister overbrengt naar het geestelijk licht. Misschien doe een goeroe dat ook inderdaad, maar het heeft niets met de betekenis van het woord te maken, het is volksetymologie."&lt;br /&gt;English translation "a. The guru as spiritual adviser: If we look at the phenomenon of gurus in India then we can see that there are at least four forms of guruship that can be distinguished. The first form is that of the "spiritual adviser." Before we will elaborate on this, first something about the etymology. The word ''guru'' comes from Sanskrit, is written as 'guru' and connotes philosophically 'being heavy' or 'being weighty'. In that way, the concept of guru gets the meaning of 'big', 'great', or 'important' and somewhat further it also gets aspects of 'respectable' and 'honorable'. Soon it is applied to the 'spiritual adviser'. In various popular literature, in India herself too, the word 'guru' is explained in the parts 'gu' and 'ru', as descriptions for light and darkness: the guru is then the person who bring the student from the material darkness into the spiritual light. A guru may indeed do that, but it has nothing to do with the meaning of the word, it is folk etymology."&lt;ref name="kraneborg2002"&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) ''Neohindoeïstische bewegingen in Nederland : een encyclopedisch overzicht'' page 50 (En: ''Neo-Hindu movements in the Netherlands'', published by Kampen Kok cop.

Joel Mlecko states, "''Gu'' means ignorance, and ''Ru'' means dispeller," with ''guru'' meaning the one who "dispels ignorance, all kinds of ignorance", ranging from spiritual to skills such as dancing, music, sports and others.&lt;ref name=mleckopage33&gt;Joel Mlecko (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269931 The Guru in Hindu Tradition] Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, page 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Pechelis states that, in the popular parlance, the "dispeller of darkness, one who points the way" definition for ''guru'' is common in the Indian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2004), The Graceful Guru, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195145373}}, pages 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion'', Pierre Riffard makes a distinction between "occult" and "scientific" etymologies, citing as an example of the former the etymology of 'guru' in which the derivation is presented as ''gu'' ("darkness") and ''ru'' ('to push away'); the latter he exemplifies by "guru" with the meaning of 'heavy'.&lt;ref name="wesr"&gt;Riffard, Pierre A. in ''Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion'' Faivre A. &amp; [[Wouter Hanegraaff|Hanegraaff W.]] (Eds.)

{{further|list of Hindu gurus}}
{{Hinduism}}
The ''Guru'' is an ancient and central figure in the traditions of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=mleckopage33/&gt; The ultimate liberation, contentment, freedom in the form of [[moksha]] and inner perfection is considered achievable in the Hindu belief by two means: with the help of ''guru'', and with evolution through the process of [[karma]] including rebirth in some schools of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref name=mleckopage33/&gt; At an individual level in Hinduism, the Guru is many things, including being a teacher of skills, a counselor, one who helps in the birth of mind and realization of one's soul, who instils values and experiential knowledge, an exemplar, an inspiration and who helps guide a student's (''[[shishya|śiṣya]]'') spiritual development.&lt;ref name=mleckopage33/&gt; At a social and religious level, the Guru helps continue the religion and Hindu way of life.&lt;ref name=mleckopage33/&gt; Guru thus has a historic, reverential and an important role in the [[Hindu culture]].&lt;ref name=joelmlecko/&gt;

===Scriptures===
The word ''Guru'' is mentioned in the earliest layer of [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts. The hymn 4.5.6 of Rigveda, for example, states Joel Mlecko, describes the guru as, "the source and inspirer of the knowledge of the Self, the essence of reality," for one who seeks.&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit original: {{lang|sa|इदं मे अग्ने कियते पावकामिनते '''गुरुं''' भारं न मन्म । बृहद्दधाथ धृषता गभीरं यह्वं पृष्ठं प्रयसा सप्तधातु ॥६॥}} – [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_४.५ Rigveda 4.5.6] Wikisource&lt;br&gt;English Translation: Joel Mlecko (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269931 The Guru in Hindu Tradition] Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Upanishad]]s, that is the later layers of the Vedic text, mention ''guru''. [[Chandogya Upanishad]], in chapter 4.4 for example, declares that it is only through ''guru'' that one attains the knowledge that matters, the insights that lead to Self-knowledge.&lt;ref name=mleckopage35/&gt; The [[Katha Upanisad]], in verse 1.2.8 declares the guru as indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge.&lt;ref name=mleckopage35&gt;English Translation: Joel Mlecko (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269931 The Guru in Hindu Tradition] Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, pages 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 3 of [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], human knowledge is described as that which connects the teacher and the student through the medium of exposition, just like a child is the connecting link between the father and the mother through the medium of procreation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 222-223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/AitareyataittiriyaUpanishadsWithShankaraBhashya-English/05AitareyataittiriyaUpanishadsWithShankaraBhashya-English#page/n61/mode/2up Taittiriya Upanishad] SS Sastri (Translator), The Aitereya and Taittiriya Upanishad, pages 65-67&lt;/ref&gt; In the Taittiriya Upanishad, the ''guru'' then urges a student, states Mlecko, to "struggle, discover and experience the Truth, which is the source, stay and end of the universe."&lt;ref name=mleckopage35/&gt;

The ancient tradition of reverence for the ''guru'' in Hindu scriptures is apparent in 6.23 of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], which equates the need of reverence and devotion for ''guru'' to be the same as for god,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume (1921), [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n431/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.23], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, page 411&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mlecko37&gt;Joel Mlecko (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269931 The Guru in Hindu Tradition] Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] is a dialogue where [[Krishna]] speaks to [[Arjuna]] of the role of a guru, and similarly emphasizes in verse 4.34 that those who know their subject well are eager for good students, and the student can learn from such a ''guru'' through reverence, service, effort and the process of inquiry.&lt;ref name=chapple&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (Editor) and Winthrop Sargeant (Translator), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, page 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane D.

{{Quote|
When the teacher finds from signs that knowledge has not been grasped or has been wrongly grasped by the student, he should remove the causes of non-comprehension in the student. This includes the student's past and present knowledge, want of previous knowledge of what constitutes subjects of discrimination and rules of reasoning, behavior such as unrestrained conduct and speech, courting popularity, vanity of his parentage, ethical flaws that are means contrary to those causes. The teacher must enjoin means in the student that are enjoined by the [[Śruti]] and [[Smriti|Smrti]], such as avoidance of anger, [[Yamas]] consisting of [[Ahimsa]] and others, also the rules of conduct that are not inconsistent with knowledge. He [teacher] should also thoroughly impress upon the student qualities like humility, which are the means to knowledge.

The teacher is one who is endowed with the power of furnishing arguments pro and con, of understanding questions [of the student], and remembers them. The teacher possesses tranquility, self-control, compassion and a desire to help others, who is versed in the Śruti texts ([[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]]), and unattached to pleasures here and hereafter, knows the subject and is established in that knowledge. He is never a transgressor of the rules of conduct, devoid of weaknesses such as ostentation, pride, deceit, cunning, jugglery, jealousy, falsehood, egotism and attachment. The teacher's sole aim is to help others and a desire to impart the knowledge.

{{Main|Brahmacharya|Guru-shishya tradition|Parampara|Gurukula}}

Traditionally, the ''Guru'' would live a simple married life, and accept ''shishya'' (student, Sanskrit: शिष्य) where he lived. A person would begin a life of study in the [[Gurukula]] (the household of the ''Guru''). The process of acceptance included proffering firewood and sometimes a gift to the guru, signifying that the student wants to live with, work and help the ''guru'' in maintaining the ''gurukul'', and as an expression of a desire for education in return over several years.&lt;ref name=mlecko37/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (2003), The Dharmaśāstas, in ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: Gavin Flood), Blackwell Publishing Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-21535-2}}, page 102-104&lt;/ref&gt; At the Gurukul, the working student would study the basic traditional [[Vedanga|vedic sciences]] and various practical skills-oriented sastras&lt;ref name=stella&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1958), Traditions of the Indian Craftsman, The Journal of American Folklore, Volume 71, Number 281, Traditional India: Structure and Change (Jul. - Sep., 1958), pages 224-230&lt;/ref&gt; along with the religious texts contained within the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=tamara/&gt;&lt;ref name=sameul&gt;Samuel Parker (1987), Artistic practice and education in India: A historical overview, Journal of Aesthetic Education, pages 123-141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Misra, R.

The ''Guru (teacher) Shishya (disciple) parampara'' or guru parampara, occurs where the ''knowledge'' (in any field) is passed down through the succeeding generations. It is the traditional, residential form of education, where the Shishya remains and learns with his Guru as a family member. The fields of study in traditional guru-sisya parampara were diverse, ranging from [[Hindu philosophy]], martial arts, music, dance to various [[Vedanga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;William Pinch (2012), Warrior Ascetics and Indian Empires, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107406377}}, pages 37-38, 141-144, 110-117&lt;br&gt;William Pinch, Peasants and Monks in British India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520200616}}, pages 57-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kothari and Avinash Pasricha (2001), Kuchipudi, Abhinav Publications, {{ISBN|978-8170173595}}, pages 155-170 and chapter on dance-arts related ''Guru parampara''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SS Kumar (2010), Bhakti - the Yoga of Love, LIT Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3643501301}}, pages 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender and caste====
The Hindu texts offer a conflicting view of whether access to ''guru'' and education was limited to men and to certain ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' (castes).&lt;ref name=murty&gt;[[Kotha Satchidanda Murthy]] (1993), Vedic Hermeneutics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120811058}}, pages 14-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt; The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or on ''varna''.&lt;ref name=murty/&gt; The Yajurveda and Atharvaveda texts state that knowledge is for everyone, and offer examples of women and people from all segments of society who are ''guru'' and participated in vedic studies.&lt;ref name=murty/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D Chand, [https://archive.org/stream/yajurveda029670mbp#page/n279/mode/2up Yajurveda], Verses 26.2-26.3, Osmania University, page 270&lt;/ref&gt; The Upanishads assert that one's birth does not determine one's eligibility for spiritual knowledge, only one's effort and sincerity matters.&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt;

In theory, the early Dharma-sutras and Dharma-sastras, such as Paraskara Grhyasutra, Gautama Smriti and Yajnavalkya smriti, state all four varnas are eligible to all fields of knowledge; while verses of Manusmriti state that Vedic study is available only to men of three varnas, unavailable to Shudra and women.&lt;ref name=murty/&gt;&lt;ref name=asharma&gt;[[Arvind Sharma]] (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195644418}}, pages 147-158&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[[Patrick Olivelle]] notes the modern doubts about the reliability of Manusmriti manuscripts. He writes, "Manusmriti was the first Indian legal text introduced to the western world through the translation of Sir William Jones in 1794. (...) This was based on the Calcutta manuscript with the commentary of Kulluka. It was Kulluka's version that has been assumed to be the original [vulgate version] and translated repeatedly from Jone (1794) and [[Wendy Doniger|Doniger]] (1991). The belief in the authenticity of Kulluka's text was openly articulated by Burnell. This is far from the truth.

=== Attributes ===
The [[Advayataraka Upanishad]] states that the true teacher is a master in the field of knowledge, well-versed in the [[Veda]]s, is free from envy, knows [[yoga]], lives a simple life that of a yogi, has realized the knowledge of the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (Soul, Self).&lt;ref name="feuerstein1990" /&gt; Some scriptures and gurus have warned against false teachers, and have recommended that the spiritual seeker test the guru before accepting him.  [[Swami Vivekananda]] said that there are many incompetent gurus, and that a true guru should understand the spirit of the scriptures, have a pure character and be free from sin, and should be selfless, without desire for money and fame.&lt;ref name="vivekananda1937"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] ''Karma-yoga and Bhakti-yoga'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}

According to the Indologist [[Georg Feuerstein]], in some traditions of Hinduism, when one reaches the state of Self-knowledge, one's own soul becomes the ''guru''.&lt;ref name="feuerstein1990"&gt;[[Georg Feusterstein|Feuerstein, Georg]] Dr. ''Encyclopedic dictionary of yoga'' Published by Paragon House 1st edition (1990) {{ISBN|1-55778-244-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tantra, states Feuerstein, the guru is the "ferry who leads one across the ocean of existence."&lt;ref name=georgtantra&gt;Georg Feuerstein (1998), Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy, Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1570623042}}, pages 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; A true ''guru'' guides and counsels a student's spiritual development because, states ''Yoga-Bija'', endless logic and grammar leads to confusion, and not contentment.&lt;ref name=georgtantra/&gt; However, various Hindu texts caution prudence and diligence in finding the right ''guru'', and avoiding the wrong ones.&lt;ref name=georgtantra91&gt;Georg Feuerstein (1998), Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy, Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1570623042}}, pages 91-94&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Kula-Arnava'' text states the following guidance:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Gurus are as numerous as lamps in every house. But, O-Goddess, difficult to find is a guru who lights up everything like a sun.
Gurus who are proficient in the Vedas, textbooks and so on are numerous. But, O Goddess, difficult to find is a guru who is proficient in the supreme Truth.
Gurus who rob their disciples of their wealth are numerous. But, O Goddess, difficult to find is a guru who removes the disciples' suffering.
Numerous here on earth are those who are intent on social class, stage of life and family. But he who is devoid of all concerns is a guru difficult to find.
An intelligent man should choose a guru by whom supreme Bliss is attained, and only such a guru and none other.
&lt;/poem&gt;

A true guru is, asserts ''Kula-Arnava'', one who lives the simple virtuous life he preaches, is stable and firm in his knowledge, master yogi with the knowledge of Self (soul) and [[Brahman]] (ultimate reality).&lt;ref name=georgtantra91/&gt; The guru is one who initiates, transmits, guides, illuminates, debates and corrects a student in the journey of knowledge and of self-realization.&lt;ref name=georgyoga&gt;Georg Feuerstein (2011), The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and Practice, Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1570629358}}, pages 127-131&lt;/ref&gt; The attribute of the successful guru is to help make the disciple into another guru, one who transcends him, and becomes a ''guru'' unto himself, driven by inner spirituality and principles.&lt;ref name=georgyoga/&gt;

=== In modern Hinduism ===
{{See also|Contemporary Hindu movements}}

In modern neo-Hinduism, Kranenborg states ''guru'' may refer to entirely different concepts, such as a ''spiritual advisor'', or someone who performs traditional rituals outside a temple, or an ''enlightened master'' in the field of tantra or yoga or eastern arts who derives his authority from his experience, or a reference by a group of devotees of a sect to someone considered a god-like ''[[Avatar]]'' by the sect.&lt;ref name="kraneborg2002" /&gt;

The tradition of reverence for ''guru'' continues in several denominations within modern Hinduism, but he or she is typically never considered as a prophet, but one who points the way to spirituality, Oneness of being, and meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;Ranade, Ramchandra Dattatraya ''Mysticism in India: The Poet-Saints of Maharashtra'', pp.392, SUNY Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-87395-669-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, James H and Sen, Satadru (Eds.), ''Confronting the Body: The Politics of Physicality in Colonial and Post-Colonial India'', pp.23, Anthem Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-84331-032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|"Gurus are not prophets who declare the will of God and appeal to propositions found in a Scripture.

In various Buddhist traditions, there are equivalent words for ''guru'', which include ''Shastri'' (teacher), ''Kalyana Mitra'' (friendly guide, Pali: [[Kalyāṇa-mittatā]]), ''Acarya'' (master), and ''Vajra-Acarya'' (hierophant).&lt;ref name=alexwayman&gt;Alex Wayman (1997), Untying the Knots in Buddhism: Selected Essays, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813212}}, pages 206, 205-219&lt;/ref&gt; The ''guru'' is literally understood as "weighty", states Alex Wayman, and it refers to the Buddhist tendency to increase the weight of canons and scriptures with their spiritual studies.&lt;ref name=alexwayman/&gt; In Mahayana Buddhism, a term for Buddha is [[Bhaisajyaguru|Bhaisajya guru]], which refers to "medicine guru", or "a doctor who cures suffering with the medicine of his teachings".&lt;ref&gt;Alex Wayman (1997), Untying the Knots in Buddhism: Selected Essays, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813212}}, pages 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams (1989), Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415025379}}, pages 247-249&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guru'' is the spiritual [[preceptor]] in Jainism, and typically a role served by Jain [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]].&lt;ref name="Jeffery D Long 2009 pages 110, 196"/&gt;&lt;ref name=patridge252&gt;Christopher Partridge (2013), Introduction to World Religions, Augsburg Fortress, {{ISBN|978-0800699703}}, page 252&lt;/ref&gt; The ''guru'' is one of three fundamental ''tattva'' (categories), the other two being ''dharma'' (teachings) and ''deva'' ([[God in Jainism|divinity]]).&lt;ref name=johncort/&gt; The ''guru-tattva'' is what leads a lay person to the other two ''tattva''.&lt;ref name=johncort&gt;John Cort (2011), Jains in the World : Religious Values and Ideology in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199796649}}, page 100&lt;/ref&gt; In some communities of the [[Śvētāmbara]] sect of Jainism, a traditional system of ''guru-disciple'' lineage exists.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fl Gel and Peter Flügel (2006), Studies in Jaina History and Culture, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1134235520}}, pages 249-250&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''guru'' is revered in Jainism [[Jain rituals and festivals#Rituals|ritually]] with ''Guru-vandan'' or ''Guru-upashti'', where respect and offerings are made to the ''guru'', and the ''guru'' sprinkles a small amount of ''vaskep'' (a scented powder mixture of sandalwood, saffron, and camphor) on the devotee's head with a mantra or blessings.&lt;ref&gt;John Cort (2011), Jains in the World : Religious Values and Ideology in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199796649}}, pages 111-115&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh gurus were fundamental to the [[Sikhs|Sikh]] religion, however the concept in Sikhism differs from other usages. [[Sikhism]] is derived from the Sanskrit word ''shishya'', or disciple and is all about the relationship between the teacher and a student.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parrinder (1971), World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present, Hamlyn Publishing, page 254, {{ISBN|978-0-87196-129-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Guru in [[Sikhism]] stands on two pillars i.e. Miri-Piri. 'Piri' means spiritual authority and 'Miri' means temporal authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance | publisher=University of Chicago Press |author1=E. Marty, Martin  |author2=Appleby R. Scott | date=1996 | pages=278 | isbn=0226508846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Guru in Sikhism is a teacher-leader. Traditionally, the concept of Guru is considered central in Sikhism, and its main scripture is prefixed as a ''Guru'', called [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the words therein called ''[[Gurbani]]''.&lt;ref name=singhakaur&gt;HS Singha &amp; Satwant Kaur, "Sikhism, A Complete Introduction", Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|81-7010-245-6}}, pages 21-29, 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western perspective==
As an alternative to established religions, some people in Europe and the USA looked to spiritual guides and gurus from India and other countries. Gurus from many denominations traveled to Western Europe and the USA and established followings.

In particular during the 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist [[David G. Bromley]] this was partially due to the repeal of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA.&lt;ref name="bromley1989"&gt;[[David G. Bromley|Bromley, David G.]], Ph.D. &amp; [[Anson Shupe]], Ph.D., ''Public Reaction against New Religious Movements'' article that appeared in ''Cults and new religious movements: a report of the Committee on Psychiatry and Religion of the American Psychiatric Association'', edited by Marc Galanter, M.D., (1989) {{ISBN|0-89042-212-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values.&lt;ref name="nugteren1997"&gt;[[Nugteren, Albertina (Tineke)]] Dr. (Associate professor in the phenomenology and history of Indian religions at the faculty of theology at the [[Universiteit van Tilburg|university of Tilburg]])''Tantric Influences in Western Esotericism'', article that appeared at a 1997 [[CESNUR]] conference and that was published in the book ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'' edited by [[Mikael Rothstein]] and Reender Kranenborg RENNER Studies in New religions [[Aarhus University]] press, (2003) {{ISBN|87-7288-748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the professor in [[sociology]] [[Stephen A. Kent]] at the [[University of Alberta]] and Kranenborg (1974), one of the reasons why in the 1970s young people including [[hippie]]s turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get ''high'' without drugs.&lt;ref name="kranenborg1974"&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) ''Zelfverwerkelijking: oosterse religies binnen een westerse subkultuur'' (En: [[Self-realization]]: eastern religions in a Western Sub-culture'', published by Kampen Kok (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kent2001"&gt;[[Stephen A.

One example of such group was the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement ([[ISKCON]]) founded by [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of [[bhakti yoga]] on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.{{refn|"Devotees don't have such an easy time.

*[[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], groomed to be a world spiritual teacher by the leadership of the [[Theosophical Society]] in the early part of the 20th century, publicly renounced this role in 1929 while also denouncing the concept of gurus, spiritual leaders, and teachers, advocating instead the unmediated and direct investigation of [[reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Jiddu, Krishnamurti (September 1929).

*Dr. [[David C.

Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus are likely to be more unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.
*Highlighting what he sees as the difficulty in understanding the guru from [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern tradition]] in Western society, Dr. [[Georg Feuerstein]], a well-known German-American [[Indologist]], writes in the article ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050205055250/http://www.yrec.info/contentid-23.html Understanding the Guru]'' from his book ''The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and practice'':"The traditional role of the guru, or spiritual teacher, is not widely understood in the West, even by those professing to practice Yoga or some other Eastern tradition entailing discipleship. [...] Spiritual teachers, by their very nature, swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits. They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace, or in pleasing egos. They are not even about morality. Typically, their message is of a radical nature, asking that we live consciously, inspect our motives, transcend our egoic passions, overcome our intellectual blindness, live peacefully with our fellow humans, and, finally, realize the deepest core of human nature, the Spirit. For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life, this kind of message is revolutionary, subversive, and profoundly disturbing.".&lt;ref name="feuerstein2003"&gt;[[Georg Feusterstein|Feuerstein, Georg]] Dr. ''The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and Practice'', Shambhala Publications, released on (2003) {{ISBN|1-57062-928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga'' (1990), Dr. Feuerstein writes that the importation of ''yoga'' to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority.&lt;ref name="feuerstein1990" /&gt;
*A British professor of psychiatry, [[Anthony Storr]], states in his book, ''Feet of Clay: A Study of Gurus'', that he confines the word guru (translated by him as "revered teacher") to persons who have "special knowledge" who tell, referring to their special knowledge, how other people should lead their lives. He argues that gurus share common character traits (e.g. being loners) and that some suffer from a mild form of [[schizophrenia]]. He argues that gurus who are authoritarian, [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[wikt:eloquent|eloquent]], or who interfere in the private lives of their followers are the ones who are more likely to be unreliable and dangerous. Storr also refers to [[Eileen Barker|Eileen Barker's checklist]] to recognize false gurus. He contends that some so-called gurus claim special spiritual insights based on personal revelation, offering new ways of spiritual development and paths to salvation. Storr's criticism of gurus includes the possible risk that a guru may exploit his or her followers due to the authority that he or she may have over them, though Storr does acknowledge the existence of morally superior teachers who refrain from doing so. He holds the view that the idiosyncratic belief systems that some gurus promote were developed during a period of [[psychosis]] to make sense of their own minds and perceptions, and that these belief systems persist after the psychosis has gone. Storr applies the term "guru" to figures as diverse as [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Gurdjieff]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jim Jones]] and [[David Koresh]].&lt;ref name="storr1996"&gt;Storr, Anthony Dr. ''Feet of clay: a study of gurus'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-684-83495-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian Indologist [[Koenraad Elst]] criticized Storr's book for its avoidance of the term [[prophet]] instead of guru for several people. Elst asserts that this is possibly due to Storr's pro-Western, pro-Christian cultural bias.
*[[Rob Preece]], a [[psychotherapist]] and a practicing Buddhist, writes in ''The Noble Imperfection'' that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience, the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards. He writes that these potential hazards are the result of ''naiveté'' amongst Westerners as to the nature of the guru/devotee relationship, as well as a consequence of a lack of understanding on the part of Eastern teachers as to the nature of Western psychology. Preece introduces the notion of [[transference]] to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective. He writes: "''In its simplest sense transference occurs when unconsciously a person endows another with an attribute that actually is projected from within themselves.''" In developing this concept, Preece writes that, when we transfer an inner quality onto another person, we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration, but also the potential for great danger: "In giving this power over to someone else they have a certain hold and influence over us it is hard to resist, while we become enthralled or spellbound by the power of the [[archetype]]".&lt;ref name="ref_preece"&gt;Preece, Rob, "The teacher-student relationship" in ''The Noble Imperfection: The challenge of individuation in Buddhist life'', Mudras Publications&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to a professor of [[religious studies]] at [[Dawson College]] in [[Quebec]], [[Susan J. Palmer]], the word guru has acquired very negative connotations in France.&lt;ref name="palmer2004"&gt;Palmer, Susan, article in the book ''NRMs in the 21st century: legal, political, and social challenges in global perspective'' edited by Phillip Charles Lucas and Thomas Robbins, (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-96577-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The psychiatrist [[Alexander Deutsch]] performed a long-term observation of a small [[cult]], called ''The Family'' (not to be confused with [[Family International]]), founded by an American guru called ''Baba'' or ''Jeff'' in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1972, who showed increasingly [[schizophrenic]] behavior. Deutsch observed that this man's mostly [[Jew]]ish followers interpreted the guru's pathological mood swings as expressions of different Hindu deities and interpreted his behavior as ''holy madness'', and his cruel deeds as punishments that they had earned. After the guru dissolved the cult in 1976, his mental condition was confirmed by Jeff's retrospective accounts to an author.&lt;ref name="deutsch1975"&gt;Deutsch, Alexander [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] ''Observations on a sidewalk ashram'' Archive Gen. Psychiatry 32 (1975) 2, 166-175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deutsch1980"&gt;Deutsch, Alexander M.D. ''Tenacity of Attachment to a cult leader: a psychiatric perspective'' American Journal of Psychiatry 137 (1980) 12, 1569-1573.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jan van der Lans]] (1933–2002), a professor of the [[psychology of religion]] at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Catholic University of Nijmegen]], wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based [[KSGV|Catholic Study Center for Mental Health]], about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false [[mysticism]]. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality, but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, the distinction between the person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical [[personality cult]].{{refn|"Wat [[Jan van der Lans|Van der Lans]] hier signaleert, is het gevaar dat de goeroe een instantie van absolute overgave en totale overdracht wordt. De leerling krijgt de gelegenheid om zijn grootheidsfantasieën op de goeroe te projecteren, zonder dat de goeroe daartegen als kritische instantie kan optreden. Het lijkt er zelfs vaak eerder op dat de goeroe in woord, beeld en geschrift juist geneigd is deze onkritische houding te stimuleren. Dit geldt zeker ook voor goeroe Maharaji, maar het heeft zich -gewild en ongewild ook voorgedaan bij Anandamurti en Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

*In their 1993 book, ''[[The Guru Papers]]'', authors [[Diana Alstad]] and [[Joel Kramer (Author)|Joel Kramer]] reject the [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru-disciple tradition]] because of what they see as its structural defects. These defects include the authoritarian control of the guru over the disciple, which is in their view increased by the guru's encouragement of [[surrender (religion)|surrender]] to him. Alstad and Kramer assert that gurus are likely to be [[Hypocrisy|hypocrites]] because, in order to attract and maintain followers, gurus must present themselves as purer than and superior to ordinary people and other gurus.&lt;ref name="kramer1993"&gt;Kramer, Joel, and Diana Alstad ''The guru papers: masks of authoritarian power'' (1993) {{ISBN|1-883319-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the journalist Sacha Kester, in a 2003 article in the Dutch newspaper [[De Volkskrant]], finding a guru is a precarious matter, pointing to the many holy men in India and the case of [[Sathya Sai Baba]] whom Kester considers a swindler. In this article he also quotes the book ''Karma Cola'' describing that in this book a German economist tells author [[Gita Mehta]], "It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus. Many of my friends have become crazy in India". She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners do not believe in spirituality and ridicule a true guru. Other westerners, Chakraverti said, on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler.&lt;ref&gt;Kester, Sacha "Ticket naar Nirvana"/"Ticket to Nirvana", article in the Dutch Newspaper [[De Volkskrant]] 7 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gyalpo spirits''' are one of the eight classes of haughty gods and spirits ({{bo|w=lha srin sde brgyad}}) in [[Tibetan mythology]] and religion. '''Gyalpo''' ({{bo|w=rgyal po|t=རྒྱལ་པོ}}), a word which simply means "king" in the [[Tibetic languages]], in Tibetan mythology is used to refer to the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] ({{bo|t=རྒྱལ་ཆེན་བཞི}}) and especially to a class of spirits, both [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Bon]], who may be either malevolent spirits or oath-bound as [[dharmapala]]s ({{bo|w=chos skyong, bon skyong}}).

==Nature==
Geoffrey Samuel describes these gyalpo spirits as "king-spirits" who are "the spirits of evil kings or of high lamas who have failed their vows." &lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Geoffrey (1995). p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that they are white in color. [[René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz|De Nebesky-Wojkowitz]] characterizes this type of spirit as generally red in colour and of violent character, harassing mainly lamas and religious people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nebesky-Wojkowitz |first=René de |authorlink=René Nebesky-Wojkowitz  |title=Oracles and demons of Tibet: the cult and iconography of the Tibetan protective deities|year=1956|publisher=Mouton |lccn=56043426 |isbn= 978-81-7303-039-0 &lt;!--(reprint)--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also laity and even animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lopez |first=Donald S. |authorlink= |author2=Donald S. Lopez Jr. |title=Elaborations on Emptiness: Uses of the Heart Sutra|year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 978-0-691-00188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, gyalpo spirits often have both white (peaceful) and red (wrathful) forms.

It is believed one can be protected against gyalpo spirits by means of appropriate rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beyer |first=Stephan |authorlink= |title=The cult of Tārā: magic and ritual in Tibet |year=1969 |publisher=University of Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In religious meditation instructions texts attributed to [[Padmasambhava]], he warns his disciples against magical displays of this class of spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sambhava |first=Padma |authorlink=Padmasambhava |author2=Marcia Binder Schmidt |author3=Nyang-ral nyi-ma-ʼod-zer |author4=Erik Pema Kunsang |title=Advice from the lotus-born |year=1994 |publisher=Rangjung Yeshe Publications}} p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gyalpos are believed to be bound by oath by [[Padmasambhava]], for example [[Gyalpo Pehar]] is believed to be the main guardian of [[Samye]], built at the time of Padmasambhava and King [[Trisong Detsen]].

[[Machig Labdrön]] enumerated outer, inner and secret ways gyalpo spirits manifest. The outer way are very elegant temples with beautiful ornaments, crystal stupas and many offerings, rich with silver and gold, with well dressed monks giving teachings, full of charisma; their characteristic provocation is nervousness and confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Labdron |first=Machig |authorlink=Machig Lapdron |title=Machik's Complete Explanation: Clarifying the Meaning of Chod |year=2003 |publisher=Snow Lion}} p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]] (1920–1996) wrote that as very often gyalpos manifest as masters, spiritual teachers and enlightened beings, several highly realised practitioners of the past fell for their tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author=Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche |authorlink=Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche |title=As it is vol. 2 |year=2004 |publisher=Rangjung Yeshe Publications}} p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gyalpo Pehar==
[[File:Pehar.jpg|thumb|Mural of Pehar in the assembly hall of Nechung Monastery.]]
According to [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] myth, [[Gyalpo Pehar]] ({{bo|t=རྒྱལ་པོ་དཔེ་ཧར |w=rgyal po dpe har}}] [also spelt: ''pe kar'' &amp; ''dpe dkar'') is the chief spirit belonging to the gyalpo class. When [[Padmasambhava]] arrived in [[Tibet]] in the eighth century, he subdued all gyalpo spirits and put them under control of Gyalpo Pehar, who promised not to harm any sentient beings and was made the chief guardian spirit of the [[Samye|Samye Temple]] built at that time. Some Tibetans believe that the protector of Samye sometimes enters the body of a medium (called the "Dharma Lord of Samye") and acts as an oracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol  |translator=Matthieu Ricard |editor=Constance Wilkinson |editor2=Michal Abrams |title=The life of Shabkar|year=1994 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn= 978-0-7914-1835-2}} p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nechung Gyalpo==
The Great Dharma King ''(rgyal chen)'' Nechung Dorje Drakden (rdo rje grags ldan) or Nechung Chokyong (chos skyong) is considered to be the chief minister of Gyalpo Pehar or the same as the activity aspect of Gyalpo Pehar.&lt;ref&gt;Heller 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the spirit of this deity which possesses the [[Nechung Oracle]] or State Oracle of Tibet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">The '''Johannite Church''', properly known by its full name, ''l'Église Johannite des Chrétiens Primitifs'' (The Johannite Church of Primitive Christians), is a [[Gnostic]] [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination founded by the French priest [[Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat]] in 1804.&lt;ref name="aps"&gt;"The Gnostics: History, Tradition, Scriptures, Influence" by Andrew Phillip Smith, Watkins, 2008 {{ISBN|1-905857-78-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/history_egc.htm Hermetic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Johannite Church received its full name in 1828 after Fabré-Palaprat's claimed discovery of the ''Levitikon'' gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Donald Donato, ''The Lévitikon: The Gospels According to The Primitive Church'' (Apostolic Johannite Church, 2010). {{ISBN|1-894981-99-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is "Johannite" because it claims a continuity with the primitive [[Johannine]] Christianity of the saints [[John the Baptist]] and [[John the Apostle]], and the Christian scriptures attributed to John.

'''Juha Varto''' (born 27 June 1949) is a Finnish philosopher, considered the most important [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] in Finland,&lt;ref name="analytic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Analytic philosophy in Finland|year=2003|isbn=90-420-0837-7|pages=496|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bMpeL1p3KIC&amp;pg=PA496&amp;dq=%22Juha+Varto%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wokhTcW3M8WQswbu9tD6DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Varto&amp;f=false|author=Leila Haaparanta|author2=Ilkka Niiniluoto|accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; known also for his prolific output on a variety of philosophical themes. Since 1999 he has been professor of research in visual art and education at the [[Aalto University]] School of Art and Design, [[Helsinki]]. Before that he taught research methodology and acted as director of research in various Finnish universities and polytechnics (1992–1999) and before that taught philosophy  at the [[University of Tampere]] (1973–1993). During the 1990s Varto produced{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} over 100 programmes for Finnish radio and television, mainly dealing with philosophical questions. He has been awarded an honorary doctorate for theatre and drama by the Theatre Academy Helsinki. Autumn 2016, the president of Aalto University, Tuula Teeri, appointed Varto an Aalto Distinguished Professor in recognition of his significant scientific merits.

July 2017, Varto retired from Aalto University.

==Career==
Varto’s early philosophical interest was in the history of [[logic]]; his mentor, professor [[Raili Kauppi]] was an internationally known [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] scholar and writer in [[intentional logic]]. Varto’s doctoral thesis dealt with the subject of 12th century logic. Later he wrote on questions that touch upon the relationship between formal and philosophical in logic. Varto’s main corpus of writing is in Finnish, since during his early career there were only few texts in Finnish in philosophy and even less on phenomenology. His pedagogical interest was in elaborating [[Plato]]’s texts as a starting point in philosophy. But he has also dealt with texts on [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Scheler]], [[Adolf Reinach]], [[Edith Stein]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]] and [[Michel Henry]]. He has also studied the writings of [[Simone Weil]] and her approach to issues important to every day life. In recent years Varto has published extensive texts on [[aesthetics]] and artistic thinking and the methodology of artistic research.

==The Tampere School of Phenomenology==
The so-called ”Tampere School of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]” emerged around Varto’s scholarship activities in the 1980s. This group included both philosophers and scholars of other areas, such as politics and sociology. Today, many of his former students from that period hold leading positions in Finnish universities, as well as governmental institutions and private enterprises. The group identified itself as the ”Finnish Phenomenological Institute”, but after Varto moved to Helsinki it became known as the ”Society of European Philosophy”. The Institute published 44 volumes of scholarship in phenomenology, ranging from doctoral theses to monographs on individual intellectuals and translations of works by foreign intellectuals. Like Varto himself, the Institute and later the Society  has been active in civil and public discussions on issues that previously lacked any intellectual approach. Notably, in 1993 they founded the philosophical journal ”niin&amp;näin”, which became a known discussion forum, not tied to any particular school.&lt;ref name="analytic" /&gt;

'''Keith Ward''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 22 August 1938) is a British philosopher, theologian, priest and scholar. He is a fellow of the [[British Academy]] and a priest of the [[Church of England]]. He was a canon of [[Christ Church, Oxford]] until 2003. [[Comparative theology]] and the [[relationship between science and religion]] are two of his main topics of interest. He was [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1991 to 2004.

==Academic work==

Ward graduated in 1962 with a BA from the [[University of Wales]] and from 1964 to 1969 was a lecturer in logic at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He earned a BLitt from [[Linacre College, Oxford]] in 1968. From 1969 to 1971 he was lecturer in philosophy at the [[University of St Andrews]]. In 1972, he was ordained as a priest in the [[Church of England]]. From 1971 to 1975 he was lecturer in philosophy of religion at the [[University of London]]. From 1975 to 1983, he was dean of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. He was appointed the F. D. Maurice Professor of Moral and Social Theology at the University of London in 1982, professor of history and philosophy of religion at [[King's College London]] in 1985 and [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1991, a post from which he retired in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'' entry&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Ward was a visiting professor at the [[Claremont Graduate University]] in California. In 1993–94, he delivered the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He was the [[Gresham Professor of Divinity]] between 2004 and 2008 at [[Gresham College]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/events.asp?pageid=45&amp;frmProfessor=69&amp;frmKeyword=Keyword&amp;frmAllDates=on&amp;image.x=16&amp;image.y=8 Online lecture archive at Gresham College]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward is on the council of the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] and is a member of the [[editorial board]]s of ''Religious Studies'', the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'', ''Studies in Inter-Religious Dialogue'' and ''World Faiths Encounter''. He is a member of the board of governors of the [[Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies]]. He has also been a visiting professor at [[Drake University]], Iowa, and at the [[University of Tulsa]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/text.asp?PageId=25 Professor Keith Ward], Gresham College profile, Accessed 26 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward has MA and DD degrees from both [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/text.asp?PageId=25 Professor Keith Ward], Gresham College profile, Accessed 7 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorary DD from the [[University of Glasgow]].

==Focus and beliefs==

One of Ward's main focuses is the dialogue between religious traditions, an interest which led him to be joint president of the World Congress of Faiths (WCF) from 1992 to 2001. His work also explores concepts of God and the idea of revelation.  He has also written on his opinion of a relationship between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.theology.ox.ac.uk/staff.phtml?lecturer_code=Kward Keith Ward's Oxford University profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229142038/http://resources.theology.ox.ac.uk/staff.phtml?lecturer_code=Kward |date=29 December 2006 }}, Accessed, 7 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As an advocate of [[theistic evolution]], he regards [[evolution]] and Christianity as essentially compatible, a belief he has described in his book ''God, Chance and Necessity'' and which is in contrast to his Oxford colleague [[Richard Dawkins]], a vocal and prominent [[atheist]]. Ward has said that Dawkins's conclusion that there is no God or any purpose in the universe is "naive" and not based on science but on a hatred of religion. Dawkins's strong anti-religious views originate, according to Ward, from earlier encounters with "certain forms of religion which are anti-intellectual and anti-scientific&amp;nbsp;... and also emotionally pressuring."&lt;ref&gt;http://meaningoflife.tv/video.php?speaker=ward&amp;topic=complete Video interview] by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]] for [http://www.meaningoflife.tv meaningoflife.tv] at 28:00 and following&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been highly critical of materialist philosophers of consciousness such as [[Daniel Dennett]], as well as social scientists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]], arguing that they each attempt to reduce the human person into aspects of their own discipline.

Ward has described his own Christian faith as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am a [[Born again Christianity|born-again]] Christian. I can give a precise day when Christ came to me and began to transform my life with his power and love. He did not make me a saint. But he did make me a forgiven sinner, liberated and renewed, touched by divine power and given the immense gift of an intimate sense of the personal presence of God. I have no difficulty in saying that I wholeheartedly accept Jesus as my personal Lord and Saviour.&lt;ref name="Ward1"&gt;Keith Ward. ''What the Bible Really Teaches: A Challenge for Fundamentalists'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ward has criticised modern-day [[Christian fundamentalism]], most notably in his 2004 book ''What the Bible Really Teaches: A Challenge for Fundamentalists''. He believes that fundamentalists interpret the Bible in implausible ways and pick and choose which of its passages to emphasise to fit pre-existing beliefs. He argues that the Bible must be taken "seriously" but not always "literally" and does not agree with the doctrine of [[Biblical inerrancy]], saying that it is not found in the Bible, elaborating that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There may be discrepancies and errors in the sacred writings, but those truths that God wished to see included in the Scripture, and which are important to our salvation, are placed there without error&amp;nbsp;... the Bible is not inerrant in detail, but God has ensured that no substantial errors, which mislead us about the nature of salvation, are to be found in Scripture.&lt;ref name="Ward1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Kinder, Küche, Kirche''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪndɐ ˈkʏçə ˈkɪʁçə}}), or the '''3 Ks''', is a [[German language|German]] slogan translated as “children, kitchen, church”. It now has a mostly derogatory connotation, describing what is seen as an antiquated female role model in contemporary Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/kinder-k%C3%BCche-kirche-nein-danke/a-1284368|title=Kinder, Küche, Kirche: Nein danke!|last=Mast-Kirschning|first=Ulrike|date=3 August 2004|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|language=German|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/die-besten-trios-aller-guten-dinge-sind-drei-1.73403-2|title=Kinder, Küche, Kirche|publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|language=German|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is vaguely equivalent to the American "[[barefoot and pregnant]]" or the Victorian "A woman's place is in the home".

== The origins ==
The origins of the phrase are normally attributed either to the last German Emperor [[Wilhelm II]], or to his first wife, Empress [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Augusta Victoria]]. She is likely to have adopted it from one of several similar German "sayings by number". The most suggestive of these is listed in the second volume of ''German proverbs Glossary: A treasure house of the German people'' published in 1870 by [[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander]]: "Vier K gehören zu einem frommen Weib, nemlich, dass sie Achtung gebe auff die Kirche, Kammer, Kuche, Kinder." - "Four K's are requisite of a pious woman, namely, that she keeps regard for church, chamber, kitchen, children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsches sprichwörter-lexikon: bd. Gott bis Lehren |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ocM4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=%22Kirche,+Kammer,+K%C3%BCche,+Kinder%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kirche%2C%20Kammer%22&amp;f=false|last1=Wander|first1=Karl Friedrich Wilhelm|year=1870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wander refers for the origins of this saying to a 16th-century commentary on [[Sirach]] by [[Johannes Mathesius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsches Sprichwörterlexikon: Ein Hausschatz für das deutsche Volk. A bis Gothen, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMpIAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Deutsches+Sprichw%C3%B6rterlexikon:+ein+Hausschatz+f%C3%BCr+das+deutsche+...,+Volume+1#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathesy&amp;f=false|last1=Wander|first1=Karl Friedrich Wilhelm|year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also lists another similar phrase: "Eine gute Hausfrau hat fünf K zu besorgen: Kammer, Kinder, Küche, Keller, Kleider." - "A good housewife has to take care of five K: chamber, kids, kitchen, cellar, clothes," which appeared first in the 1810 collection of the German proverbs ''Die weisheit auf der gasse: oder Sinn und geist deutscher sprichwörter'' - ''The wisdom of the streets; or, meaning and spirit of German proverbs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die weisheit auf der gasse: oder Sinn und geist deutscher sprichwörter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NepLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Kammer,+Kinder,+K%C3%BCche,+Keller,+Kleider#v=onepage&amp;q=Kammer%2C%20Kinder%2C%20K%C3%BCche%2C%20Keller%2C%20Kleider&amp;f=false|last1=Sailer|first1=Johann Michael|year=1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[Johann Michael Sailer]]. In 1844 "The newspaper for the German Nobility" published this latter saying in its traditional last page "feature" short statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zeitung für den deutschen Adel |url=https://books.google.com/?id=df5BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22Kinder,+k%C3%BCche%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kinder%2C%20k%C3%BCche%22&amp;f=false|year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase started to appear in its current form in writing in the early 1890s. "After Germany, where women apparently take no interest in public affairs, and seem to obey to the letter the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|young emperor's]] injunction "Let women devote themselves to the three K's, -- ''die Küche, die Kirche, die Kinder''" (kitchen, church, and children), the active interest and influence of English women on all great questions were refreshing." wrote Marie C. Remick in ''A Woman's Travel-notes on England'' in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Unitarian, a monthly magazine of liberal christianity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xf0kAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22die+K%C3%BCche,+die+Kirche,+die+Kinder%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22die%20K%C3%BCche%2C%20die%20Kirche%2C%20die%20Kinder%22&amp;f=false|last1=Sunderland|first1=Jabez Thomas|last2=Herford|first2=Brooke|last3=Mott|first3=Frederick B|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase then was used multiple times throughout the 1890s in liberal writing and speeches.

In August 1899 the influential British liberal ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' elaborated on the story, mentioning, as well, the 4th "K". A story titled "The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's"&lt;ref&gt;The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's, in: Westminster Gazette, 17. 8. 1899, S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; describes an audience given by the Kaiser to two American [[suffragettes]]. After hearing them out, the Kaiser replies: "I agree with my wife. And do you know what she says? She says that women have no business interfering with anything outside the four K's. The four K's are&amp;nbsp;– Kinder, Küche, Kirche, and Kleider: Children, Kitchen, Church, and Clothing".&lt;ref&gt;Paletschek, Sylvia, [http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/4725/pdf/Paletschek_Kinder_Kueche_Kirche.pdf ''Kinder – Küche – Kirche'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kaiser's 4 K's'' is encountered again in [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s 1911 book ''The man-made world''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Charlotte Perkins Gilman, The man-made world; or, Our Androcentirc Culture. New York, Charton Co., 1911 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=FHAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Gilman+The+man-made+world&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinder%2C%20&amp;f=false|last1= Gilman|first1= Charlotte Perkins|year= 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "3 K's" variation has remained by far more popular and well known.

== Third Reich ==

When Hitler came to power in 1933, he introduced a Law for the Encouragement of Marriage, which entitled newly married couples to a [[Marriage loan|loan]] of 1000 marks (around 9 months' average wages at that time). On their first child, they could keep 250 marks. On their second, they could keep another 250. They reclaimed all of the loan by their fourth child.

In a September 1934 speech to the [[NS-Frauenschaft|National Socialist Women's Organization]], [[Adolf Hitler]] argued that for the German woman her "world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home",&lt;ref&gt;Doramus, Max, ''The Complete Hitler. A Digital Desktop Reference to His Speeches &amp; Proclamations, 1932-1945'' (Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 1990), 532&lt;/ref&gt; a policy which was reinforced by the stress on "Kinder" and "Küche" in propaganda, and the bestowing of the [[Cross of Honor of the German Mother]] on women bearing four or more babies.

During this period, women were discriminated against in employment and forced out or bribed with numerous social benefits. Medicine, the law and civil service were occupations reserved for men alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERwomen.htm Spartacus Educational] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510014058/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERwomen.htm |date=2006-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his essays, [[T. S. Eliot]] reproduces and then comments upon a column in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' of May 10, 1939 headed {{"'}}Back to the Kitchen' Creed Denounced":

{{quote|Miss Bower of the Ministry of Transport, who moved that the association should take steps to obtain the removal of the ban (i.e. against married women Civil Servants) said it was wise to abolish an institution which embodied one of the main tenets of the Nazi creed – the relegation of women to the sphere of the kitchen, the children and the church.

The report, by its abbreviation, may do less than justice to Miss Bower, but I do not think that I am unfair to the report, in finding the implication that what is Nazi is wrong, and need not be discussed on its own merits. Incidentally, the term "relegation of women" prejudices the issue. Might one suggest that the kitchen, the children and the church could be considered to have a claim upon the attention of married women? or that no normal married woman would prefer to be a wage-earner if she could help it? What is miserable is a system that makes the dual wage necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= T. S. Eliot, Christianity and Culture |url= https://books.google.com/?id=eUsTlf1F2lYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22the+kitchen,+the+children,+and+the+church%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20kitchen%2C%20the%20children%2C%20and%20the%20church%22&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0156177351|last1= Eliot|first1= Thomas Stearns|year= 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During World War II in Germany, women eventually were put back in the factories because of the growing losses in the armed forces and the desperate lack of equipment on the front lines.

== Post-World War II ==

The phrase continued to be used in [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-feminist writing in the English-speaking world in the 1950s and 1960s. So, notably, the first version of the classic feminist paper by [[Naomi Weisstein]] "Psychology Constructs the Female"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= N. Weisstein, Psychology Constructs the Female |url= http://www.cwluherstory.com/psychology-constructs-the-female.html |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927130950/http://www.cwluherstory.com/psychology-constructs-the-female.html |archivedate= 2011-09-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was titled "Kinder, Küche, Kirche as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">The '''Life and Labor Commune''' was a [[Tolstoyan]] [[agricultural commune]] founded in 1921 and disbanded as a state run [[Collective farming|collective farm]] on January 1, 1939. The commune was founded near [[Moscow]] but was later resettled in central [[Siberia]], not far from [[Novokuznetsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=312| author=Josh Sanborn| title=Memoirs of Peasant Tolstoyans in Soviet Russia (book review)| publisher=H-Net Reviews| date=March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, it reportedly had as many as 1,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA713 | author=Karen Christensen and David Levinson| title=Encyclopedia of Community| page=713| publisher=Sage Publications Inc. (Thousand Oaks, California)| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its existence the members of the commune were persecuted by the [[Bolsheviks]], both for refusing to enlist or support their war efforts as well as for organizing themselves communally outside of the approved state structure.

== Founding (1921–1930) ==
The Life and Labor Commune was founded on December 31, 1921 with a rental contract with the Moscow District Land Department for the Shestakóvka estate, twelve miles outside of Moscow. The commune was built on land in the [[Volgograd|Tsarítsyn]] district of the [[Moscow]] region and fell under the village [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] of Troparyovo. The commune was named "Life and Labor" after the Tolstoyan and [[anarchist]] leanings of its founding members. From the very beginning, all [[communal meal]]s were strictly [[vegetarian]].

In 1927 the commune began to come under attack along with the Tolstoy New Jerusalem Commune, which was liquidated by the Soviet government in 1929. Many of the members from there joined the Life and Labor Commune. Leading members of the commune came under legal prosecution by the government, which attempted to revoke their charter. They were defended in court by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]], a member of the Public Defender's Office, as well as nephew of Kropotkin.

== Resettlement (1931) ==
Vladimir Cherkov, who intervened on behalf of [[conscientious objector]]s to the Red Army with Lenin and had won them their freedom from [[impressment]], suggested that the Life and Labor Commune resettle along with other followers of Tolstoy to form one large commune. On February 28, 1930 the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] issued a decree by the Presidium of the Committee, Protocol 41, Paragraph 5, about "the resettlement of Tolstoyan communes and cooperatives." After a scouting expedition in the spring of 1930, the location of [[Kuznetsk Depression|Kuznetsk]] along the [[Tom River]] was chosen. On March 22, 1931, after selling the livestock and donating the farm to an outpatient psychiatric hospital, the inhabitants of the Life and Labor Commune set out for outskirts of Siberia.

== Demise under Stalinism (1936–1939) ==
In 1936, the leaders of the commune were arrested, followed by additional waves of arrests in 1937 and 1938. By January 1939, the few remaining women and children were consolidated into a Soviet collective farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=312| author=Josh Sanborn| title= Memoirs of Peasant Tolstoyans in Soviet Russia (book review)| publisher=H-Net| date=March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the communards died in labor camps or were executed for refusing to serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA713 | author=Karen Christensen and David Levinson| title=Encyclopedia of Community| page=713| publisher=Sage Publications Inc. (Thousand Oaks, California)| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] wrote about the persecution of the commune:
{{quote| text="In the twenties, a large group of Tolstoyans was exiled to the foothills of the Altai mountains, and there they established communal settlements jointly with the Baptists.  When the construction of the Kuznetsk industrial complex began, they supplied it with food products. Then arrests began - first the teachers (they were not teaching in accordance with the government program), and the children ran after the police cars, shouting. And after that the commune leaders were taken."| sign=Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
| source=[[The Gulag Archipelago]], Chapter 2, p. 51}}

== Memoirs of participants ==
Several of the participants in the commune wrote memoirs of their experiences.
{{quote| text="Out of the stormy, boundless ocean of human life, with all its infinitely varied aspirations and fates, suddenly one part of it was caught up in a powerful maelstrom, whirled together into one unit, and torn away from the rest of the mass. It was carried off on the foamy crest of the wave. Then with a mighty surge it was lifted up into the air, toward the sun, and was thrown with powerful force against a cliff. It broke into thousands of droplets, sparkling with all the colors of the rainbow, then fell back into the ocean and merged with it. And it was no more. And it seemed that there had never been anything. But there was! And the memory of it lives on in the souls of those who experienced it as something bright, great, necessary, and joyous."| sign=Boris Mazurin| source=Memoirs Of Peasant Tolstoyans In Soviet Russia, p. 108}}

In a publishing career spanning 80 years (1930-2010),&lt;ref&gt;Gardner's first publication at age 16 was a magic trick in the periodical ''[[The Sphinx: An Independent Magazine for Magicians|The Sphinx]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[popular mathematics]] and [[Popular science|science]] writer '''[[Martin Gardner]]''' (1914-2010) authored or edited over 100 books and countless articles, columns and reviews.

All Gardner's works were non-fiction except for two novels — ''The Flight of Peter Fromm'' (1973) and ''[[Visitors from Oz]]'' (1998) — and two collections of short pieces — ''[[Irving Joshua Matrix|The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix]]'' (1967, 1985) and ''The No-Sided Professor'' (1987).

A '''non-linguistic meaning''' is an actual or possible derivation from sentience, which is not associated with signs that have any original or primary intent of communication.{{clarify|post-text=what?|date=November 2011}} It is a general [[jargon|term of art]] used to capture a number of different senses of the word "meaning", independently from its linguistic uses.

== Meaning as internal interpretation ==
The sense that sentient creatures have that the various objects of our universe are linked is commonly referred to as a person's sense of "meaning". This is the sense of meaning at work when asking a person when they leave a theater, "What did that movie mean to you?" In short, the word "meaning" can sometimes be used to describe the ''interpretations'' that people have of the world. Example: "Chunks are pieces of information linked and bound by meaning. (Remembering details vs. getting an overall meaning) links individual memory traces together, to create conceptual chunks." (Dr. Barbara Oakley, A Mind for Numbers, p.&amp;nbsp;55).

The field of [[semantics]] is often understood as a branch of [[linguistics]], but this is not strictly true.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Basic or non-idealized '''meaning''' as a type of [[semantics]] is a branch of [[psychology]] and [[ethics]] and reflects the original use of the term "meaning" as understood early in the 20th century by [[Lady Welby]] after her daughter had translated the term "semantics" from French. On the other hand, meaning, in so far as it was later objectified by not considering particular situations and the real intentions of speakers and writers, examines the ways in which words, phrases, and sentences can seem to have meaning. Objectified semantics is contrasted with communication-focused semantics where understanding the intent and assumptions of particular speakers and writers is primary as in the idea that people mean and not words, sentences or propositions. An underlying difference is that where causes are identified with relations or laws then it is normal to objectify meaning and consider it a branch of linguistics, while if causes are identified with particular agents, objects, or forces as if to cause means to influence as most historians and practical people assume, then real or non-objectified meaning is primary and we are dealing with intent or purpose as an aspect of human psychology, especially since human intent can be and often is independent of language and linguistics.

We are all familiar with how good or bad reputation can encourage or discourage us from reading or studying  about certain people, positions, or philosophies even before we have studied them. This is normally called pre-judgment or prejudice. To determine whether a reputation is deserved we normally have to carry out extensive and balanced research into human intent and assumptions in psychology, and in the sphere of language and linguistics where this research tends to focus not only on the differences between denotation and connotation, but especially on the presence and often tenacious character of value connotation, that is, the good or bad associations we make with words. Re-definition can change denotation for some people, but value connotation almost always remains, and is merely re-directed at a different target. Unfortunately, while dictionaries mention the most common denotations or main meanings we associate with words they normally ignore value connotation. Indeed, it is value connotation or the effect of using it which results in denotation becoming prejudicial, even denotation which is imagined to be fair,  neutral or objective. Indeed, much rhetoric is based on selecting words more for their value associations than for their denotations, and to expose and correct this bad habit it is normally wise to focus on the most likely intent and assumptions of particular people than to imagine that words have meaning in themselves or that either meaning or language can be genuinely objective, since in that process we are likely to forget the existence and dominating character of value connotation which is subjective in a bad sense, that is, which makes persuasion more an aspect of rhetoric and deception rather than judging people, positions and philosophy more by weight of evidence or legitimate argumentation.

One way to operationally define the meaningfulness of a stimulus is to look at the slope of the response time versus response probability line (Tarnow, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Tarnow, E., ''[http://cogprints.org/5366/ Response probability and latency: a straight line, an operational definition of meaning and the structure of short term memory]'', cogprints.org 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic meaning==
{{See also|Biosemiotics}}
{{tone|section|date=August 2017}}
In another sense, the word "meaning" can be used to describe the internal workings of the mind, independently of any linguistic activity. This sort of meaning is deeply psychological. If we look for other uses we can find intent, feeling, implication, importance, value, and signification. Since the negative form-- "meaningless"—challenges and would deny these uses, experts believe that underlying them all are understanding and understandability.

One approach to this way of understanding meaning was the psychosocial theorist [[Erik Erikson]]. Erikson had a certain perspective on the role of meaning in the process of human bodily development and socialization. Within his model, a "meaning" is the external source of gratification associated with the human erogenous zones and their respective modes. See [[imprinting (psychology)]] for some related topics.

Some communication by [[body language]] arises out of bodily signals that follow directly out of human instinct.  [[Blushing]], [[tears]], [[erections]] and the [[startle reaction]] are examples. This type of communication is usually unintentional, but nevertheless conveys certain information to anyone present.

== Natural meaning ==

This was coined by [[Paul Grice]], and describes associations in the natural world, as in the sentence, "Those clouds mean rain", "mean" is associating cloud with rain.

Another example of natural meaning is the weathervane: when it points in a certain direction, that is taken to mean that the wind is blowing in the same direction.

=== Consequences and meaning ===

Still another perspective comes courtesy of the [[Pragmatism|Pragmatists]], who insist that the meaning of an expression lies in its consequences. Philosopher and [[polymath]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] wrote the following:
{{quote|The whole function of thought is to produce [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] of action... To develop its meaning, we have, therefore, simply to determine what habits it produces, for what a thing means is simply what habits it involves. Now, the identity of a habit depends on how it might lead us to act, not merely under such circumstances as are likely to arise, but under such as might possibly occur, no matter how improbable they may be.

...I only desire to point out how impossible it is that we should have an idea in our minds which relates to anything but conceived sensible effects of things. Our idea of anything is our idea of its sensible effects; and if we fancy that we have any other we deceive ourselves.|(from the essay "[http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html How to Make Our Ideas Clear]", hosted courtesy of peirce.org).}}

Outside of the Pragmatic tradition was Canadian 20th century philosopher of media [[Marshall McLuhan]]. His famous dictum, "the medium is the message", can be understood to be a consequentialist [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]]. His idea was that the medium which is used to communicate carries with it information: namely, the consequences that arise from the fact that the medium has become popular. For example, one "meaning" of the light bulb might be the idea of being able to read during the night.

The controversial social psychologist and ethicist [[Thomas Szasz]] also seemed to hold this view, stating that "a word means its consequences" [http://www.szasz.com/isdepressionadiseasetranscript.html in debate].

==Meaning and cognition==
{{See also|Umwelt}}
Some non-linguistic meaning emerges from natural history as a development over vast periods of time.  This is the theory behind [[autopoiesis]] and [[self-organization]].  Some social scientists use autopoiesis as a model for the development of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925004709/http://www.imprint.co.uk/C%26HK/vol7/gudemi.PDF structural coupling] in the family.

A typical example of this kind of relationship is the [[predator|predator-prey]] relationship.  These relations carry strong intrinsic (life and death) meaning for all living organisms, including people.

Observations of child development and of behavioral abnormalities in some people indicate that some [[nature (innate)|innate]] capabilities of human beings are essential to the process of meaning creation.  Two examples are:

* rapid [[language development]] in children, at a pace that can not be accounted for by the usual learning process.
* the functioning of a personal "''[[Theory of mind#.22Theory of Mind.22 - interpersonal understanding of mental states|theory of mind]]''" about other people, or [[empathy]], as an innate capability of most people.  (Recently published research [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000B7F38-893D-152E-88E283414B7F0000&amp;sc=I100322] points to a reflex-based "''model of mind''" that is built upon the [[mirror neurons]] - that we share with certain other creatures.)

==Ideasthesia==
[[Ideasthesia]] refers to the capability of our minds to experience meaning. When concepts are activated i.e., when the meaning is extracted, the [[phenomenal consciousness|phenomenal experiences]] are affected. This tight relationship between meaning and experiences is investigated by research on ideasthesia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4964">'''Micheál Ó Mordha''' ({{lang-en|'''Michael Moore'''}}) (c.1639-1723) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] priest, philosopher and educationalist.

==Early life==

Ó Mordha – generally referred to as ''Moore'' or ''Moor'' in contemporary documents – was born in [[Dublin]] about 1639. He left Ireland at a young age to be educated in [[Nantes]] and Paris, where he taught [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]] at the Collège des Grassins. He was proposed for the position of [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at the [[University of Paris]] in June 1677 by a faction who wished to replace the then rector, Nicholas Pieres, but felt compelled to decline the offer.

Returning to Ireland in the early 1680s, he was ordained in 1684. [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], Patrick Russell (1683–92) appointed him [[vicar-general]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|Diocese of Dublin]].

==Provost of Trinity College==

Upon the flight of the [[Provost (education)|provost]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in 1689, Ó Mordha became the college's first [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] provost. He acquired the post via the influence of [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]] (1630–1691), to whom he was [[chaplain]] and [[confessor]]. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] states "The college was seized by the Jacobites, the chapel was made a powder magazine, one portion of the building was turned into a barrack, and another into a gaol for persons suspected of disaffection to the royal cause. .. He {Ó Mordha} upheld the rights of the college, secured it from further pillage, and endeavoured to mitigate the treatment of the prisoners. With the librarian, Father McCarthy, he prevented the soldiery from burning the library, and by preserving its precious collections rendered an incalculable service to letters."

However, a sermon which Ó Mordha delivered in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] concerning King James's ecclesiastical policies so offended the king that he was obliged to resign the post in 1690; after this, he returned to Paris. He moved to Rome in 1691 when King James arrived in Paris, after fleeing Dublin in the wake of the Jacobite defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].

==In Rome==

While in Rome, Ó Mordha became [[Censor Librorum|Censor]] of Books. He came to the attention and favour of the successive [[Pope]]s, [[Innocent XII]] (1691–1700) and [[Clement XI]] (1700–1721). When [[Cardinal Barbarigo]] established his college at [[Montefiascone]], he appointed Ó Mordha as rector and professor of philosophy and [[Greek language|Greek]]. The college attracted men of learning, and received from Innocent XII an annual grant of two thousand crowns.

==Rector of the University of Paris==

After the death of James II in 1701, Ó Mordha returned to France, where – through [[Cardinal de Noailles]] – he was appointed Rector of the University of Paris. He remains the only Irishman to hold the post, serving from 10 October 1701 to 9 October 1702. He was also made principal of the [[Collège de Navarre]], and professor of philosophy, Greek, and [[Hebrew]] in the [[Collège de France]].

==Final years==

In 1702 he delivered the annual [[panegyric]] on [[Louis XIV]]. Ó Mordha joined Dr. Farrelly (Fealy) in purchasing a house near the Irish College for poor Irish students. Blind for some years he had to employ an [[amanuensis]], who took advantage of his master's affliction to steal and sell many hundred volumes of his choice library. What remained, Ó Mordha bequeathed to the Irish College.

He died in the Collège de Navarre, and was buried in the vault under the chapel of the Irish College.

'''OneTaste''' is a [[business]] dedicated to researching and teaching the practices of ''orgasmic meditation'' and ''slow sex''. Though it embraces certain tenets based in [[Eastern philosophy]], OneTaste's central focus is female orgasm and sexuality,&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple /&gt;&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2009/03/17/slow_sex/|title= All hail the female orgasm|publisher= Salon.com|author=Tracy Clark-Flory|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in a practice called Orgasmic Meditation.

OneTaste was cofounded in [[San Francisco]] by Robert Kandell and [[Nicole Daedone]] in 2001. OneTaste originally operated two communal-style "urban retreat" centers, one in [[South of Market, San Francisco|San Francisco’s Soma District]] and the other on [[Lower East Side|Manhattan’s Lower East Side]], but has expanded to include Los Angeles, London, Melbourne, and six other U.S. cities. The organization's stated goal is "to create a clean, well-lit place where sexuality, relationship, and intimacy could be discussed openly and honestly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onetaste.us|title= The OneTaste.us website|publisher= OneTaste |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; OneTaste produces media, workshops, weekend retreats, and a coach training program.

OneTaste has drawn international media attention and controversy; several journalists have compared OneTaste to a [[cult]] and [[pyramid scheme]], while others have noted a push of orgasmic meditation into the mainstream.&lt;ref name="GT Weekly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-blogs-commentary/88-culture-beat/5208-the-big-om.html | title=GT Weekly | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/fashion/15commune.html?_r=0 | title=Brown NYT | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2013-10-17/7-things-to-know-about-orgasmic-meditation/ | title=The Frisky | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The pleasure principle {{!}} The Sunday Times|url = http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/living/Wellbeing/article1511684.ece|website = www.thesundaytimes.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this push into the mainstream, some journalists have called Orgasmic Meditation a new craze, while online estimates say OneTaste teaches 500 people each month in its "How to" classes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2014 OneTaste received Inc. 5000 Honors for Top Health companies.&lt;ref name="Inc.com on OneTaste" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/omg-how-the-orgasmic-meditation-craze-has-got-london-in-a-frenzy-10087384.html|title=OM...G!

The organization has often been criticized for its cult-like operations, secretive practices, and pyramid payment and leadership structure similar to groups such as Scientology and the Unification Church.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Orgasmic meditation==

Orgasmic meditation or ''OMing'' is a term coined by Nicole Daedone and Robert Kandell to signify a [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] practice in which the object of meditation is finger to genital contact.&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple/&gt; OMing is practiced in pairs, with one practitioner stroking the genitals of the other, and both focusing their attention on the sensation with the stated goal of developing connective resonance between them. Although the practitioners can be of either sex, the focus of orgasmic meditation seems to be on the female orgasm through subtle and deliberate stimulation of the clitoris.{{r|PleasurePrinciple}} Both partners, however, are said to share in the sensation and fulfillment via a kind of "pleasure by proxy."&lt;ref name="SF Weekly: Sex and Sensuality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2007-04-04/news/sex-and-sensuality/|title= Sex and Sensuality |publisher= San Francisco Weekly|date=April 4, 2007|author= Mary Spicuzza |accessdate=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents state that orgasmic meditation encompasses more than just [[orgasm]] and that it encourages greater emotional awareness, connected relationships, and sense of fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star: Sex"&gt;{{citation|url = https://www.thestar.com/article/421601|title = More to sex than intercourse|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date = 6 May 2008|author = Daphne Gordon|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others describe the sensation as "a heady buzz, mixed with equal parts wooziness and intensity of focus."{{r|"NY Post"}}

In press accounts, orgasmic meditation has been compared to [[neotantra|tantric practices]]. "The idea, similar to Buddhist Tantric sex, is to extend the sensory peak."&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple/&gt; Daedone has stated in interviews that OMing also borrows from other traditions including [[yoga]], and other forms of [[meditation]],&lt;ref name="Grazia" /&gt; and she describes it as a central element of what she terms the "Slow Sex Movement".&lt;ref name="SF Weekly: Sex and Sensuality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Weekly: Slow Sex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2009/04/slow-sex_movement_picking_up_s.php|title= Slow-Sex Movement Picking up Speed |publisher= "The San Francisco Weekly" |date = April 14, 2009|author=Ashley Harrell |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, when asked where she first was exposed to this practice, she states that a "Buddhist Monk" introduced her to the practice.&lt;ref name="Weiss 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/life/2016/08/orgasmic-meditation-nicole-daedone|title=Can You Orgasm Your Way to Enlightenment?|last=Weiss|first=Suzannah|date=2016-08-23|website=Complex|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that OMing brings [[consciousness]] to [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in the same way that sitting meditation brings consciousness to stillness and [[yoga]] brings consciousness to movement.&lt;ref name="Grazia"&gt;{{citation|title= Vuoi fare OMing con me?|magazine=Grazia|date= April 20, 2008|pages = 93–94|last=Cometto|first=Maria Teresa|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents maintain that the practice leads to more intense and profound orgasms,&lt;ref name="Toronto Star: Sex" /&gt; expands one's capacity to feel pleasure and other sensations, and promotes greater personal awareness and interpersonal connectivity.&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/fashion/15commune.html|title= The Pleasure Principle|publisher= Published by [[The New York Times]] Published March 15, 2009|author=Authors Patricia Leigh Brown and Carol Pogash|accessdate=2009-05-05 | date=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others describe more limited effects, such as simply "getting in touch with one's body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Justin | last = Berton | title = Mara Altman turns quest for Big O into a book | date = July 30, 2009 | publisher = Hearst Communications Inc. | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-07-30/entertainment/17218717_1_orgasm-tantric-sexuality | work = San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some who have participated in or witnessed the practice report feeling a sense of discomfort or inappropriateness. "I tried with great futility to make the connection between an austere Zen monastery filled with silent monks meditating on emptiness, and what I had just seen."&lt;ref name="O’Connor"&gt;{{cite news | first = Maura | last = O’Connor | title = Their Stroke of Insight | date = March–May 2009 | url = http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j43/stroke-of-insight.asp | work = EnlightenNext | accessdate = 2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of orgasmic meditation is done with a partner. A woman lies down, unclothed from the waist down, while her fully clothed partner sits alongside. The one sitting uses his or her [[index finger]] to slowly, deliberately stroke the clitoris of the other. Typically this [[safe sex]] practice involves the wearing of gloves. The session is timed and lasts for exactly 15 minutes. Both partners are directed to focus their attention on the point of contact, or "stroke."&lt;ref name="Nightline"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Adults-Only Businesses Find Growing Market Among Women | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=8311520&amp;page=1 | series = ABC News: Nightline | airdate = August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of orgasmic meditation claim that the practice nourishes the [[limbic system]], the part of the brain shared with other mammals and associated with emotion, empathy, and motivation.&lt;ref name="SF Weekly: Sex and Sensuality" /&gt; When the OMing session is over, both [[Significant other|partners]] share their experiences verbally.&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Post"/&gt;

Daedone states that the so-called "resonance" between two partners is essential to the experience of shared sensation.&lt;ref name="Daedone2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicole Daedone|title=Slow Sex: The Art and Craft of the Female Orgasm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGYwBg7I9RIC&amp;pg=PT152|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-446-56719-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; OM is usually practiced separately from sex and often in a location other than the bedroom; as distinct from foreplay, Daedone describes it as a practice "designed to keep a woman on a plateau of sensation." A visiting UK columnist surmised that "OM is a form of recalibration that prepares the body for better, more intense sex."&lt;ref name="Pelling2011"&gt;{{Citation  | title = The orgasm that lasts FOUR months.. | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2015805/The-orgasm-lasts-FOUR-months--achieving-involves-keeping-clothes-turning-lights.html  | date = July 18, 2011  | author = Pelling, Rowan  | journal = The Daily Mail  | accessdate = 2011-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slow sex==

''[[The New York Times]]'' portrays Daedone as leading a self-described "slow sex movement, one that places a near-exclusive emphasis on women’s pleasure — in which love, romance and even flirtation are not required."&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple /&gt; Daedone draws parallels between slow sex and the [[Slow Food]] movement associated with chef [[Alice Waters]].&lt;ref name="SF Weekly: Sex and Sensuality" /&gt; With sex as with food, she says, people can overindulge without getting nourishment, or go from one extreme of consuming mindlessly to the other extreme of self-denial.&lt;ref name="Grazia" /&gt;

In an interview with San Francisco's ''7x7'' magazine, Daedone states that slow sex encompasses [[orgasmic meditation]] and [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindful]] [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]] generally.&lt;ref name=Ladoceour2011&gt;{{Citation | title = The Big O | url = http://www.7x7.com/love-sex/big-o-nicole-daedone-onetaste-founder | year = 2011 | author = Ladoceour, Lauren | journal = 7x7 | accessdate = 2011-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She says that slow sex is not defined by speed or the amount of time spent, but rather these three ingredients: 1) developing attention to what's actually present rather than fixating on a goal, 2) simplicity, a stripping away of extraneous elements down to the level of pure sensation 3) cultivating desire by learning to acknowledge and articulate it.

In 2011, Daedone published ''Slow Sex: The Art and Craft of the Female Orgasm'', described as elevating "the female orgasm to a level of religious and spiritual practice."&lt;ref name="Salon2011"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Clark-Flory | first = Tracy | title = The worship of female pleasure| url = http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2011/05/21/slow_sex | publisher =  Salon.com | date = 21 May 2011  | accessdate = 28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''Salon.com'' explores whether these ideas and practices will appeal only to "alternative circles" or to a larger mainstream audience. ''Salon'' notes the demand for "female [[Viagra]]," with an estimated market of $2 billion US, and numerous studies that document women's dissatisfaction with sex and low frequency of orgasm.  The review concludes "Daedone's philosophy is a refreshing counterpoint to the porny mainstream, but it's certainly hard to picture Middle America embracing orgasmic meditation."&lt;ref name="Salon2011" /&gt;

==Press and controversy==
In March 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' featured OneTaste on the front page of its "Style" section. The article describes the organization as "the latest stop on this sexual underground, weaving together strands of radical individual freedom, Eastern spirituality and feminism." An [[Indiana University]] sociology professor who has studied San Francisco’s sexual subcultures, Elizabeth A. Armstrong, is quoted as saying “The notion of a San Francisco sex commune focused on female orgasm is part of a long and rich history of women being public and empowered about their sexuality.”&lt;ref name="PleasurePrinciple" /&gt;

The article also notes, "as with many a commune before it, the leader of One Taste, Ms. Daedone, is a polarizing personality, whom admirers venerate as a sex diva, although some former members say she has cult like powers over her followers... Much of the community’s tone revolves around Ms. Daedone, a woman of considerable charm, although detractors regard her as a master manipulator."&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple /&gt; In the ''New York Times'' interview, Ms. Daedone insists she does not aspire to guru status, while acknowledging that "there’s a high potential for this to be a cult."&lt;ref name=PleasurePrinciple /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' article led to several blog and opinion columns. ''[[Salon.com]]'' ran an essay that referenced the ''Times'' piece and discussed the merits of women joining a community dedicated to female orgasm, concluding that "within a mainstream sexual culture defined almost exclusively by dudely desires" that it might be healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|title=All hail the female orgasm|url=http://www.salon.com/2009/03/17/slow_sex/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of press accounts have since offered different perspectives on the organization including a 2013 Gawker article, also referencing online cult accusations, which documented the reporter's experience at a weekend conference hosted by OneTaste.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last = Tiku|first = Nitasha|title = My Life With the Thrill-Clit Cult|url = http://gawker.com/my-life-with-the-thrill-clit-cult-1445204953?src=longreads}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''GoodTimes Weekly'', 'The Big OM', refers to "cult allegations" by posters on Yelp.com,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goodtimes.sc/columns/wellness/the-big-om/|title=The Big OM - Good Times Santa Cruz|website=goodtimes.sc|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did one on [[Vice Media|Vice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wd48yq/apparently-orgasmic-meditation-will-awaken-your-vagina|title=Orgasmic Meditation Is a Whole New Way to Stroke Pussy|date=2013-10-29|work=Vice|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on Salon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/03/26/orgasmic_meditation_the_latest_craze_for_a_holistic_sexual_awakening_partner/|title=The sexy new fad for mindful living: Orgasmic meditation|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 episode of the podcast [[Love and Radio|Love + Radio]] is dedicated to the experience of a woman who had increasingly fraught relations with OneTaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loveandradio.org/2016/10/upper-left/|title=Upper Left {{!}} Love + Radio {{!}} Listen with headphones on|website=loveandradio.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in The Cut stated that "some cult experts have linked Daedone with Victor Baranco," the cult leader who ran [[Lafayette Morehouse]], and also suggests that it may be a [[pyramid scheme]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/10/techies-predictably-love-orgasmic-meditation.html|title=Techies Predictably Eat Up Orgasmic Meditation Lifestyle|work=The Cut|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an article in The Frisky described OneTaste as "[[Landmark Worldwide|Landmark Forum]] for the clitoris."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2013-10-17/7-things-to-know-about-orgasmic-meditation/|title=7 Things To Know About Orgasmic Meditation|date=2013-10-17|work=The Frisky|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Refinery 29 article cited the organization's "potentially aggressive sales tactics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2014/03/63548/meditation-cult#page-5|title=Orgasmic Meditation Cult - OneTaste, Public Sex|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Playboy magazine|Playboy Magazine]]'' compared OneTaste to [[Scientology]] and [[Landmark Forum]], saying it had a "pyramidal pricing structure"; a week-long training with Nicole Daedone had been advertised at $36,000. It said: "All I can think about is how easy it is to start a cult. .... the way the volunteers serve the leaders, jumping at their every demand to "get me water” and “move that stool”... the full-court sales pitch from the minute you walk in... I leave early and I’m furious". The author implies she was [[Gaslighting|gaslighted]] when she disagreed with the leaders. She writes that she was re-traumatized "for weeks" as memories of her past sexual trauma were triggered by a business promising female empowerment but "people probably just want your money."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/orgasmic-meditation|title=The Cost of Healing: What Everyone Ignores About Orgasmic Meditation|date=2017-03-24|work=Playboy|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Sensation'' by [[Isabel Losada]] ends with a "Warning" about "'hard sell' techniques... 'One Taste' (like many businesses) offer a wide range of courses which are outside the price range of most bank accounts. I'll say it again. Please don't spend money that you don't have."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/970027456|title=Sensation : adventures in sex, love and laughter|last=Isabel,|first=Losada,|publisher=|year=|isbn=1786780933|location=London, UK|pages=313|oclc=970027456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' published an article chronicling recent training changes and that was critical of how the company treated its employees and consultants, often pressuring them to take expensive courses, programs, and retreats that drove them into debt.&lt;ref name="Huet 2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huet|first=Ellen|date=2018-06-18|title=The Dark Side of the Orgasmic Meditation Company|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-18/the-dark-side-of-onetaste-the-orgasmic-meditation-company|access-date=2018-06-18|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plum Village''' ({{lang-vi|Làng Mai}}, {{lang-fr|Village des pruniers}}) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] meditation center of the [[Order of Interbeing]] in the [[Dordogne]], southern France. It was founded by two [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] monastics, [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] (a [[Zen master]] and [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]) and [[Chân Không]] (a [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]]), in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Harlen King ''[[Thomas Merton]] and Thich Nhat Hanh: Engaged Spirituality in an Age of Globalization'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baubérot, Franck Frégosi, Jean-Paul Willaime ''Le religieux dans la commune: régulations locales du pluralisme en France'' 2001 - p288 "On observe en effet, à Strasbourg, l'émergence d'un groupe encore informel qui se constitue autour de plusieurs personnes habituées à la fréquentation du « village des pruniers » de Thich Nhât Hanh dans le Périgord. Ce moine vietnamien ..." p289 "Bien que le maître réside en France, c'est paradoxalement aux Etats-Unis et au Canada que les centres sont les plus développés. Ce qui caractérise la voie préconisée par Thich Nhât Hanh, ce sont des méditations assises ainsi que la..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

After being refused the right to return to [[Vietnam]], Thích Nhất Hạnh formed a small [[mindfulness]] community 100 miles southeast of Paris at the village of Fontvannes&lt;ref&gt;http://interbeing.org.uk/manual_pages/5_2.html&lt;/ref&gt; called "the Sweet Potato" after the food that poor Vietnamese people eat. Following Thích Nhất Hạnh's expulsion from [[Singapore]] following illegal attempts to rescue [[Vietnamese boat people]], he settled in France and began to lead mindfulness retreats.

In 1981, the Sweet Potato community held its first summer retreat, which attracted more people than it could accommodate. Thích Nhất Hạnh then traveled south with Chân Không to find a larger site. They found a piece of land in [[Thénac, Dordogne]], which seemed ideal. The landowner, Mr. Dézon, didn't want to sell,&lt;ref name="thich"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thích|first1=Nhất Hạnh|authorlink1=Thích Nhất Hạnh|title=I have arrived, I am home|url=http://plumvillage.org/about/plum-village/i-have-arrived-i-am-home/|website=Plum Village}}&lt;/ref&gt; so they continued looking. A few days later, on September 28, 1982, [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] purchased a tract of land about {{convert|6|km}} away, which is now known as the Lower Hamlet ({{lang-vi|Xóm Hạ}}). Later that year, a hailstorm destroyed the vineyards on Mr. Dézon's property and he was forced to put his land on the market.&lt;ref name="thich"/&gt; Nhất Hạnh bought the land and called it Upper Hamlet ({{lang-vi|Xóm Thượng}}). Initially, these two hamlets were named Persimmon Village ({{lang-vi|Làng Hồng}}), but it soon became clear that [[plum]]s fared much better on the rocky soil, so it became Plum Village ({{lang-vi|Làng Mai}}).&lt;ref name="thich"/&gt;

Each year the community hosts a four-week Summer Opening retreat, which has grown increasingly popular in recent years. Attendance has grown from 232 people in total in 1983 to over 800 guests at a time in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plum Village|title=Summer Retreat Dharma Talks|url=http://plumvillage.org/retreats/info/summer-retreat-dharma-talks/|website=Plum Village}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the community hosts a variety of retreats year round, such as the Wake Up Retreat for young adults, the 21-Day Retreat for more experienced laypeople, and the 90-day Winter (Rains) Retreat.

==Hamlets==
Today, Plum Village is made up of four major residential hamlets. Upper Hamlet houses approximately 65 monks and laymen, as well as being Thích Nhất Hạnh's residence. Lower Hamlet houses over 40 nuns and laywomen. Son Ha Temple houses approximately 20 monks and the New Hamlet, 20 minutes away by bus, houses approximately 40 nuns and laywomen. Non-residential hamlets include Middle Hamlet and West Hamlet, which are used as expansion housing for lay guests during the Summer Opening retreat.

Plum Village has one sister monastery in Europe, the European Institute of Applied Buddhism (EIAB) in [[Waldbröl]], Germany, and three in the [[United States]]: [[Blue Cliff Monastery]] in [[Pine Bush, New York]], [[Deer Park Monastery]] (Tu Viện Lộc Uyển) in [[Escondido, California]], and [[Magnolia Village Practice Center|Magnolia Grove Monastery]] in [[Batesville, Mississippi]].

There are also branches in Thailand and Hong Kong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9433">'''Rogerian argument''' (or ''Rogerian Reasoning'') is a conflict-solving technique based on seeking [[Common ground (communication technique)|common ground]] instead of polarizing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kroll |first=Barry M. |date=Autumn 1997 |title=Arguing about public issues: what can we learn from practical ethics? |journal=Rhetoric Review |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=105–119 |doi=10.1080/07350199709389083 |jstor=465966 |quote=For nearly three decades, Rogerian rhetoric has offered an important alternative to adversarial argument. More recently, certain strands of [[feminist rhetoric]] have created new interest in cooperative approaches. In "Beyond Argument in Feminist Composition," for example, Catherine Lamb draws attention to negotiation theory as an important source of alternatives to competitive and confrontational rhetoric. As Lamb explains: "in both [[negotiation]] and [[mediation]]... the goal has changed: it is no longer to win but to arrive at a solution in a just way that is acceptable to both sides" (18). And Michael Gilbert has developed a related approach that he calls "coalescent argumentation," an approach that involves a "joining together" of divergent claims through "recognition and exploration of opposing positions.... forming the basis for a mutual investigation of non-conflictual options" (837). [...] This view is similar to the key idea in negotiation theory (especially the version presented in [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]]'s ''[[Getting to Yes]]'') that lying beneath people's "positions" on issues are concerns and interests that represent what they care about most deeply. Positions are often intractable. But by shifting the conversation to underlying interests, it's often possible to find common concerns and shared values, on the basis of which there may be grounds for discussion and, ultimately, agreement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaz Dziamka"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dziamka |first=Kaz |date=16 May 2007 |title=Just shut up and listen to your enemy: whatever happened to Rogerian argument? |website=counterpunch.org |publisher=[[CounterPunch]] |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/dziamka05162007.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629153749/http://www.counterpunch.org/dziamka05162007.html |archivedate=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kate Kiefer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kiefer |first=Kate |date=2005 |title=What is Rogerian argument? |website=writing.colostate.edu |publisher=[[Colorado State University]] |url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/teaching/co300man/com5e1.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202074141/http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/teaching/co300man/com5e1.cfm/ |archivedate=2016-12-02 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to English professor James Baumlin,
{{Quote|The Rogerian strategy, in which participants in a discussion collaborate to find areas of shared experience, thus allows speaker and audience to open up their worlds to each other, and in this attempt at mutual [[understanding]], there is the ''possibility'', at least, of persuasion. For in this state of sympathetic understanding, we recognize both the ''multiplicity'' of [[world-view]]s and our ''freedom'' to choose among them—either to retain our old or take a new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baumlin |first=James S. |date=Winter 1987 |title=Persuasion, Rogerian rhetoric, and imaginative play |journal=[[Rhetoric Society Quarterly]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=33–43 |doi=10.1080/02773948709390765 |jstor=3885207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origin==
The writings of American [[psychotherapist]] [[Carl R. Rogers]] inspired [[rhetoric]]ians to formulate principles of communication based on [[Empathy|empathizing]] with the views of others and seeking common ground.&lt;ref name="Young, Becker and Pike"&gt;The ''locus classicus'' of Rogerian rhetoric is: {{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Richard Emerson |last2=Becker |first2=Alton L. |authorlink2=Alton L. Becker |last3=Pike |first3=Kenneth L. |authorlink3=Kenneth Lee Pike |date=1970 |title=Rhetoric: discovery and change |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World |isbn=0155768956 |oclc=76890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Brent"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brent |first=Douglas |date=1996 |chapter=Rogerian rhetoric: an alternative to traditional rhetoric |editor1-last=Emmel |editor1-first=Barbara |editor2-last=Resch |editor2-first=Paula |editor3-last=Tenney |editor3-first=Deborah |title=Argument revisited, argument redefined: negotiating meaning in the composition classroom |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |pages=73–96 |isbn=0761901841 |oclc=34114559 |chapterurl=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~dabrent/art/rogchap.html |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetoricians proposed trying to understand the adversary's beliefs and emotions, by listening to them, instead of adopting a [[Point of view (cognitive)|point of view]] without considering those factors.&lt;ref name="Kaz Dziamka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kate Kiefer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Brent"/&gt;

Some rhetoricians have portrayed this form of argumentation as the opposite of [[Modes of persuasion|Aristotelian argumentation]], which they portrayed as an adversarial form of debate, because Rogerian argument attempts to find mutual understanding and compromise between two sides.&lt;ref name="Kaz Dziamka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Brent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bator |first=Paul |date=December 1980 |title=Aristotelian and Rogerian rhetoric |journal=[[College Composition and Communication]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=427–432 |doi=10.2307/356593 |jstor=356593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
Rogerian argument can be useful in emotionally charged topics since it defuses [[emotional reasoning]] and highlights rational [[argument]]s.&lt;ref name="Kate Kiefer"/&gt;

Young, Becker and Pike identified four stages:&lt;ref name="Young, Becker and Pike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Brent"/&gt;
# An introduction to the problem and a demonstration that the opponent's position is understood.
# A statement of the contexts in which the opponent's position may be valid.
# A statement of the writer's position, including the contexts in which it is valid.
# A statement of how the opponent's position would benefit if they were to adopt elements of the writer's position. If the writer can show that the positions complement each other, that each supplies what the other lacks, so much the better.

'''Rudolf Burger''' (born December 8, 1938 in [[Vienna]]) is an [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]].

== Life and career ==
Burger was born in the year of the occupation and the annexation of Austria into [[Nazi Germany]], called [[Anschluss]]. His parents were active [[communists]]. He concluded his studies of [[physics]] at the [[Technische Universität Wien|Technical University]] in Vienna and thereafter served as an assistant at the ''Institute of Applied Physics'', where he concluded his [[doctorate]] in 1965.

After working at the [[Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft|Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Condensed Matter Physics]] in Vienna, Burger switched to the [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle Institute]] in [[Frankfurt]]. There he was part of the team for research plannings. He also joined the Planning Commission of Germanys [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] in [[Bonn]].

From 1973 to 1990 Burger headed the department for [[research]] in [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] at the Austrian ''Ministry of Science''. In 1979 Burger achieved his [[habilitation]] in [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], in 1987 he became a professor at the [[Universität für angewandte Kunst Wien|University of Applied Arts]] in [[Vienna]], where he was appointed to the chair for [[philosophy]] in 1991. From 1995 to 1999 Burger served as rector of this university. In 2007 he retired.

Since the 1980s Burger initiated or participated in several intellectual and political discussions in Austria. His essays are published in the daily newspaper [[Die Presse]], in the weekly [[Profil (magazine)|profil]], as well as in intellectual magazines like [[FORVM]], [[Leviathan (magazine)|Leviathan]] or [[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]].

==Status==
Burger is well appreciated for his elegant style as an essayist and his avid love for [[intellectual]] [[criticism]]. His cynicism stirred some controversies, starting in 1990, when he opened the [[Günther Anders]] symposium of the city of Vienna by speaking of ''moralistic extortion'', comparing Anders and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], equating their philosophies, and finally stating:

{{quote|Though - as a biological species - the human is no value on itself, but rather - after the death of God - just a fact. It depends always only on the ''single being'' and the structure of the relations with those we live with, we love, we hate. And this surrounding is limited, also in the shadow of the bomb.|Rudolf Burger|Opening Speech at the Günther Anders Symposium&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Burger: ''Die Philosophie des Aufschubs'', in: FORVM, 444, V. XXXVII, December 15, 1990, 16-19&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Konrad Paul Liessmann]] defended ''Anders'' and responded: ''[...] therefore the circumstances are dancing; but where is the rose?''.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Paul Liessmann: ''Der Aufschub der Philosophie'', in: FORVM, 444, V. XXXVII, December 15, 1990, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Burger both criticised Austria's foreign policy at the balkans as ''warmonger'' (in German: kriegsgeil) and at the same time requested to let the parties of the war [[exsanguinate]].&lt;ref&gt;profil, August 20, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; These comments caused a nationwide controversy. In 2000 Burger criticised the ''Thursday Demonstrations'' against the [[Wolfgang Schüssel|Schüssel]]/[[Jörg Haider|Haider]] coalition as an ''antifascist carnival''&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Burger: ''Austromanie oder Der antifaschistische Karneval'', in: Merkur 5/2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and again unchained a national debate. Finally, in 2001 he angered a lot of critical intellectuals with his request to forget and close the debates on guilt and remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Burger: ''Die Irrtümer der Gedenkpolitik. Ein Plädoyer für das Vergessen'', in: Europäische Rundschau, 2/2001, 3-13&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Heribert Schiedel therefore named him ''the black and blue court philosopher,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://oesterreich-2005.at/txt/1108067894/1108068959] Formen des Vergessens: Von der Leugnung über die Relativierung zur Desavouierung&lt;/ref&gt; black referring to [[ÖVP]], blue to [[FPÖ]].

'''Rıza Tevfik [[Bey]]''' ('''Rıza Tevfik Bölükbaşı''' after the Turkish [[Surname Law]] of 1934; 1869 – 31 December 1949) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Turkish philosophy|philosopher]], [[poetry of Turkey|poet]], [[politician]] of [[liberalism|liberal]] signature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyIzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 |title=The Companion to Said Nursi Studies |first1=Ian S. |last=Markham |first2=Zeyneb |last2=Sayilgan |date=2017 |publisher=Pickwick Publications |isbn=978-1-4982-9222-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a community leader (for some members among the [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] community) of the late-19th-century and early-20th-century.

He was remarked as a restless personality during his student years, first in the famed [[Galatasaray High School]], and then in the Imperial School of Medicine ({{lang|tr|Tıbbiye}}), and he was arrested and incarcerated several times, not falling short of inciting fellow inmates to revolt during his prison months. He could graduate at the age thirty and became a doctor. In 1907, he joined the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), and was one of that party's deputies for [[Edirne]]&lt;ref name="Süssheim2002" /&gt; in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Chamber of Deputies]] (the popularly elected lower house of the re-established [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Parliament]]) of 1908. He split with the CUP in 1911, joining for a short while the newly founded opposition [[Freedom and Accord Party]] (Liberal Entente),&lt;ref name="Ozoglu2011" /&gt; and was vehemently opposed to its entry of the Ottoman Empire into [[World War I]].

==Political career in the Ottoman Empire==
[[File:SevresSignatories.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Rıza Tevfik (''far left'') with the three other representatives and signatories of the Ottoman Empire at the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]; the [[Grand vizier|grand vizier]] [[Damat Ferid Pasha]], the Ottoman education minister Tevfik Pasha, and the ambassador Reşad Halis; on board an Allied warship taking them to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]]]
Rıza Tevfik was named the Minister of Education of the Ottoman Empire ({{lang-tr|Maarif Nazırı}}) in several cabinets (11 November 1918 – 12 January 1919)&lt;ref name="Ozoglu2011" /&gt; formed after the fall of the CUP and the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I. He was also appointed to the [[Senate of the Ottoman Empire|Senate]] (the upper house of the Ottoman Parliament) by the sultan, of which he became President twice (24 May – 18 June 1919 and 31 July – 21 October 1920).

He was one of the four signatories of the stillborn [[Treaty of Sèvres]], being included in the delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] by the grand vizier [[Damat Ferid Pasha]], although he occupied no official position at the time of the negotiations, simply being a professor in [[Istanbul University]]. Since he was one of the signatories of the abortive treaty, he was included in the [[150 persona non grata of Turkey]] after the Turkish victory in the [[Turkish War of Independence]], and he had to leave Turkey in late 1922.

==Exile, return to Turkey, and death==
Rıza Tevfik lived in the United States, [[Cyprus]], [[Hejaz]], [[Jordan]] (where he was made the director of the National Museum and Library in 1925), and [[Lebanon]] during the following 20 years, until he could return to Turkey in the frame of a 1943 [[amnesty]].&lt;ref name="Ozoglu2011" /&gt; He adopted the last name Bölükbaşı after the 1934 [[Surname Law]]. In the meantime, he had had his collection of poetry published in [[Nicosia]].

He resumed work as a university professor in [[Istanbul]] until his death on 31 December 1949.&lt;ref name="Ozoglu2011" /&gt; Aside from his poetry and his articles on philosophy, he is also notable for his translations into Turkish for most of the poems of [[Omar Khayyam]].

# Evening cleaning of past impressions of the day (i.e., imagining the day's accumulated impressions out ones back and being replaced with divine light. 30 minutes)&lt;ref name="A Flexible Mind,"&gt;[http://www.ayl.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/articles/AYL_issue_7_FLEXIBLE_MIND.pdf "A Flexible Mind,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806221329/http://www.ayl.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/articles/AYL_issue_7_FLEXIBLE_MIND.pdf |date=2010-08-06 }} Elizabeth Denley, ''Australian Yoga Life,'' Issue 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A prayer-meditation at bedtime (10-15 minutes)&lt;ref name="Sahaj Marg System of Meditation,"&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/08/04/fea03.html "Sahaj Marg System of Meditation,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013158/http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/08/04/fea03.html |date=2007-09-30 }} C. Suntharamoorthy, ''Daily News,'' Sri Lanka, August 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weekly practices include the following:
#Group meditation sessions or Satsangh are held locally twice a week - Sunday morning and Wednesday evening. Satsangh is translated to association with truth ('sat' meaning Truth and 'sangha' meaning association, together or group). Satsanghs are held in many centers around the world ;&lt;ref name="A Flexible Mind,"/&gt;
#Cleaning sessions.&lt;ref name="Sahaj Marg System of Meditation,"/&gt;
#Universal prayer. The universal prayer is a feature of the practice that is dedicated to the welfare of all. The instructions for the prayer are as follows:&lt;BR&gt;At 9:00 P.M. sharp every abhyasi (practitioner), wherever he or she might happen to be at the time, should stop his or her work and meditate for fifteen minutes, thinking that all brothers and sisters are being filled up with love and devotion and that real faith is growing stronger in them. It shall be of immense value to them, which their practical experience only shall reveal.
#Constant remembrance. Meditation, cleaning and prayer make up the basic elements of the Sahaj Marg practice. Practice becomes dynamic and infused with life and feeling when it leads to the remembrance and experience of our connection with the divine within on a constant basis. One cultivates this ongoing connection through a specific training of mind and heart referred to as constant remembrance.

== History ==
The organizational body, [[Shri Ram Chandra Mission]] (SRCM), was formally registered in 1945 by Shri Ram Chandra of Shahjahanpur.&lt;ref name="Sahaj Marg System of Meditation,"/&gt;  Shri Ram Chandra was born on April 30, 1899 in Shahjahanpur, in a large town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India and attained mahāsamādhi on April 19, 1983, at the age of 83.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080803/Plus/sundaytimesplus_11.html "Sahaj Marg System of Meditation" - The Sunday Times, Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Sahaj Marg spiritual practice, Babuji adopted a technique taught by his spiritual master Lalaji using pranahuti.&lt;ref&gt;Pearmain, Rosalind. 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2555">'''Samuel Maximilian (Max) Rieser''' (1893&amp;ndash;1981) was an Austrian-born American [[lawyer]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]].

Born in [[Kraków]], where he went to school, he began the study of law in [[Vienna]]. His studies were interrupted by [[World War I]], during which he lived in [[Switzerland]]. After the war he returned to Vienna, completed his law studies and obtained a position at an insurance company. In 1938 he opened a private law practice. Among his clients was [[Reinhold Hanisch]], a childhood friend of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Rieser immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1939. Here he earned his living by writing under different pseudonyms for the [[New Yorker Staatszeitung]]. After [[World War II]] he worked for different European newsletters and as a [[Translation|translator]] for an immigrant service organization. Although he had never studied philosophy, he authored a series of essays, reviews and monographs, which appeared in different American philosophical journals. Among other things, he argued for a version of the [[Christ myth theory]], the view that [[Jesus]] never existed.

==''The True Founder of Christianity and the Hellenistic Philosophy''==
Rieser is occasionally remembered for his book, ''The True Founder of Christianity and the Hellenistic Philosophy'', published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Kenneth Humphreys, ''Jesus Never Existed'' (2nd edn; Uckfield: Iconoclast Press, 2008), p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt; Here he argues that [[Christianity]] was a product of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] urban world. Christianity, retroactively set in pre-70 [[Galilee]] and [[Jerusalem]], arrived last, not first, in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It is for this reason that very ancient Christian artifacts are typically found in [[Rome]], but not in [[Israel]]. Jesus, the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], and [[Saint Paul|Paul]] are seen as entirely fictional. The central importance of sacred meals in [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] is acknowledged.

'''San Francisco Zen Center''' (SFZC), is a network of affiliated [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] practice and retreat centers in the [[San Francisco Bay]] area, comprising City Center or '''Beginner's Mind Temple''', [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], and [[Green Gulch Farm Zen Center]]. The [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] was incorporated by [[Shunryu Suzuki]] Roshi and a group of his [[United States|American]] students in 1962. Today SFZC is the largest Sōtō organization in the West.

==History==
On May 23, 1959, Shunryu Suzuki (then age 55) came from [[Japan]] to [[San Francisco]] to serve as head priest of Sokoji—a [[Soto Zen]] temple then located at [[Bush Street Temple|1881 Bush Street]] in [[Japantown, San Francisco, California|Japantown]]. He was joined by his wife Mitsu (also from Japan) in 1961. Sokoji—founded by Hosen Isobe in 1934—had been housed in a former [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]] that is now Kokoro Assisted Living. Upon Suzuki’s arrival at Sokoji, the congregation was composed entirely of members of the [[Japanese-American]] population. Unlike his predecessors, Suzuki was a fluent speaker of [[English language|English]] who actually wanted to come to the United States. Suzuki's arrival came at the tail end of the [[Beat movement]] and just prior to the social movements of the 1960s, both of which had major roots in San Francisco. Before long, Sokoji had non-Japanese Americans — mostly [[beatniks]]— coming to the temple to sit [[zazen]] with him in the morning. Soon these Westerners participated in regular services, and new non-Asian students came to outnumber the Japanese-American congregation. This change in demography caused a rift in the Sokoji community.  The tension was alleviated when Suzuki’s Western students began gathering for separate services, albeit still at Sokoji, in 1961. Some of these students began calling their group City Center, and they incorporated in 1962 as the San Francisco Zen Center.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 121-137, 725-726&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="japantown"&gt;Japantown Task Force, 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clarke"&gt;Clarke, 44-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;Leighton, 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prebish"&gt;Prebish, 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of practitioners at SFZC grew rapidly in the mid-sixties. Within a couple of years, Suzuki considered founding a monastery to host more intensive practice for those students who were interested.  In 1966, Suzuki and Baker scouted [[Tassajara Hot Springs]], located in [[Los Padres National Forest]] behind [[Big Sur]], as a possible location for the envisioned monastic center.  After a major fundraising effort led by Baker, Zen Center purchased the land—which contained a rundown [[resort]] and [[mineral springs]] in 1967. [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]] ("Zen Mind Temple" or ''Zenshinji'') was the first Zen Buddhist monastery built in the United States, and the first in the world to allow co-ed practice.

1967 also saw the arrival of [[Kobun Chino Otogawa]] of [[Eiheiji]], who served as assistant to Suzuki. Kobun was resident teacher at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center until 1970. Around 1970, he began sitting regularly with a group in Santa Cruz that went on to form the [[Santa Cruz Zen Center]]. In 1971, he became resident priest at Haiku Zen Center, a practice center in Los Altos where Suzuki-roshi had been giving lectures, and soon after the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] there grew and changed its name to Bodhi. He served as Abbot there until 1978, moving the group to Jikoji in [[Los Gatos, California]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jikoji.org/kobun.html |title=Kobun Chino Roshi |publisher=Jikoji.org |date=2002-07-26 |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427200950/http://www.jikoji.org/kobun.html |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/suzuki%20stories/haiku1.html |title=Haiku Zendo - Stories of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi |publisher=Cuke.com |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://latc.com/2000/10/25/special_sect/yourhome1.print.html |title=Los Altos Town Crier - Home |publisher=Latc.com |date=2000-10-25 |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210175857/https://latc.com/2000/10/25/special_sect/yourhome1.print.html |archivedate=2012-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kobun Chino Otagowa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kobun Chino Otogawa]]]]  
Another assistant priest at SFZC was [[Dainin Katagiri]]-roshi, who served there from 1969 to 1971. Katagiri would go on to establish his own practice center—the [[Minnesota Zen Center]]—in 1972 in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;

[[File:Green Gulch Farm zendo (or, Green Dragon Temple).jpg|thumb|upright|Green Dragon Temple at [[Green Gulch Farm]]]]
In 1969, Sokoji's board of directors asked Suzuki to resign his position as the temple's priest, asserting that he was spending more time with his Western students than the Japanese-American congregation. Months later Suzuki—with the help of his [[United States|American]] students—purchased the current (and larger) City Center building, located on 300 Page Street.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Suzuki gave [[Dharma transmission]] to [[Zentatsu Richard Baker|Richard Baker]], his only American Dharma Heir and chosen successor at SFZC. Suzuki planned to give transmission to [[Jakusho Kwong|Bill Kwong]] but died before his completion.  Kwong's transmission was later completed by Suzuki's son, Hoitsu.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="richmond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suzuki"&gt;Suzuki, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki died of [[cancer]] on December 4, 1971.  He was 67 years old.  Despite having only had 12 years in the United States, Suzuki had gone a long way toward establishing Soto Zen in America. His death came shortly after the publication of ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'', a collection of lectures translated into numerous languages considered a classic of contemporary Zen literature.

[[File:Tea garden (Green Gulch farm).jpg|thumb|Green Gulch [[tea garden]]]]
Suzuki had asked Baker to locate a [[farm]] in the area for entire families to live a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] life while working together. Green Gulch Farm ("Green Dragon Temple", or ''Soryuji''), located in [[Sausalito, California]] in a [[valley]] on the [[Pacific Ocean]], was acquired by SFZC in 1972. The land was purchased from one of the founders of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], George Wheelwright. Despite hesitance of some members of SFZC due to the size of {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, Baker felt that acquiring Green Gulch Farm was very important for Buddhism in America. Members soon raised funds for a [[zendo]] to be built there, and over time the farm transformed into a [[monastery]] and retreat center for residents and guests with an [[organic farm]], [[flower garden]]s, a [[teahouse]] and a [[plant nursery]].&lt;ref name="richmond"&gt;Richmond, xiii, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oda"&gt;Oda, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="graham"&gt;Graham, 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seager"/&gt;

[[File:Edward Espe Brown.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edward Espe Brown]]]]
In 1976, SFZC purchased the Gallo Pastry Company to found the Tassajara Bakery, which became popular before being sold to the company Just Desserts in 1992.  The bakery was closed altogether in 1999. Tassajara Bakery was a Zen Center venture promoted by Richard Baker as an extension of the baking practices at [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]]. Tassajara baked bread for student and guest consumption since 1967, and [[Edward Espe Brown]]'s ''Tassajara Bread Book'', demonstrated consumer interest. The bakery supplied [[Greens Restaurant]] and some local grocers.&lt;ref name="sinton"&gt;Sinton&lt;/ref&gt;

Greens Restaurant, opened in 1979 in [[Fort Mason]] of [[San Francisco]], was another business venture by SFZC under the influence of Baker. A pioneer of gourmet [[vegetarian cuisine]] in America, the restaurant's first chefs were [[Edward Espe Brown]] and [[Deborah Madison]]. The duo published a book of recipes in 1987 titled ''The Greens Cookbook''. Throughout the 1980s Greens, which obtained produce from [[Green Gulch Farm]], was one of the most popular restaurants in San Francisco.

The center received significant media coverage concerning the 1984 resignation of then abbot [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]], who was ousted after it was alleged that he had been having an affair with the wife of a prominent Zen Center member. In the wake of Baker's resignation, SFZC transitioned to a democratically elected leadership model until in 2010 there was a new introduction of a predesignated slated of board members.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Additional businesses run by SFZC were the Alaya Stitchery storefront, which made [[zafu]]s, [[zabuton]]s and clothing, and Green Gulch Grocery, which sold produce from Green Gulch Farm.  Neither business is today operative.&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sinton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="madden"&gt;Madden, 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sim Van der Ryn"&gt;Sim Van der Ryn, 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fields"&gt;Fields, 268&lt;/ref&gt;

==SFZC today==
In 2000 [[Jiko Linda Cutts]] was appointed Abbess, having received [[Dharma transmission]] from [[Tenshin Reb Anderson]] in 1996. In 2003 [[Paul Haller]], who received transmission from [[Sojun Mel Weitsman]] in 1993, was installed as co-abbot with her. In 1987 SFZC started the Zen Hospice Project, a volunteer [[hospice]] program run out of a guest house on Page Street with five residential beds. Zen Hospice Project also continues to train and coordinate volunteers who provide non sectarian, non-medical care to residents of the hospice and palliative care ward at Laguna Honda Hospital, a skilled nursing facility operated by the City and County of San Francisco. The volunteer project's founding director was Frank Ostaseski, who served until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mettainstitute.org/Fbio.html |title=Metta : Frank Ostaseski Bio |publisher=Mettainstitute.org |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zen Hospice Project provides hospice care for individuals of any or no religion who are looking for a compassionate end to their life.&lt;ref name="Dimidjian"&gt;Dimidjian, 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lembke"&gt;Lembke, 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenhospice.org/2_hospice_services/hospice-services.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317065918/http://www.zenhospice.org/2_hospice_services/hospice-services.htm |date=March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today SFZC is the largest Soto organization with a foothold in the West.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;

===Tassajara Zen Mind Temple===
{{Main|Tassajara Zen Mountain Center}}
Located atop a bumpy {{convert|10|mi|km|sing=on}} road which is difficult for some vehicles to climb, Tassajara offers shuttles to and from the retreat for those inclined to forgo trying to make the trek on their own. Visitors can enjoy the springs, go swimming or on [[hiking]] trips, and have the opportunity to arrange for practice with the community living at the monastery for a few days. The [[monastery]] is closed to outsiders from the months of September through April, then opens to the public by reservation from May through August - offering retreats, seminars, and workshops. Students that come to practice at the monastery from September through April must undergo the tradition known as [[tangaryo]]. They will sit for five days or longer in the zendo before they are formally admitted into the monastery—a physically daunting challenge.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seager"&gt;Seager, 101-101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swan"&gt;Swan, 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="owens"&gt;Owens, 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Zen With a Difference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Gulch Green Dragon Temple===
{{Main|Green Gulch Farm Zen Center}}
The organic farm at Green Gulch supplies local restaurants and food suppliers and sells flowers, produce and herbs at Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in [[San Francisco]]. Guests stay at the Lindisfarne Guest House, a traditional [[Japanese architecture|Japanese]] building with a wood-burning stove as the heating source. Zen practice is not required to stay at Green Gulch, though guests are welcome to participate in [[zazen]] or any other activities. [[Tenshin Reb Anderson]]-roshi, former abbot of City Zen Center, is senior [[Dharma]] teacher at Green Gulch——training priests and [[Laity|laypeople]], leading [[sesshin]]s, giving talks and conducting workshops while also living onsite.&lt;ref name="pierce"&gt;Pierce, 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="joyce"&gt;Joyce&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;Rose&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfzc.org/zc/display.asp?catid=3,76,107&amp;pageid=96 |title=Senior Dharma Teacher Tenshin Reb Anderson - San Francisco Zen Center |publisher=Sfzc.org |date=2012-09-29 |accessdate=2012-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131065318/http://www.sfzc.org/zc/display.asp?catid=3,76,107&amp;pageid=96 |archive-date=2013-01-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Baker resigns===
[[File:Zentatsu Richard Baker in 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zentatsu Richard Baker]]]]

In March 1983 Baker was accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with the wife of an influential sangha member.  Although Baker claimed that his relationship was a love-affair which had not yet been consummated, the outcry surrounding the incident led to accusations of impropriety, including the admissions by several female members of the community that they had had affairs with Baker before or during his tenure as abbot.&lt;ref name="david schneider"&gt;Schneider, David. ''Street Zen'' pp.138-140&lt;/ref&gt; The community's sense of crisis sharpened when the woman's husband, one of SFZC's primary benefactors, threatened to hold the organization legally responsible for its abbot's apparent misconduct.&lt;ref name="crews"&gt;Crews, Frederick C. ''Follies of the Wise'' pp. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

These revelations led  Baker to resign as abbot in 1984.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; San Francisco Zen Center's web site now comments: "Although the circumstances leading to his resignation as abbot in 1984 were difficult and complex, in recent years, there has been increased contact; a renewal of friendship and dharma relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Lineage| work =| publisher =San Francisco Zen Center| url =http://www.sfzc.org/zc/display.asp?catid=1,5&amp;pageid=426|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Baker ordained [[Issan Dorsey]] as a priest. This was likely prompted by a conversation between [[Robert Baker Aitken]] and Baker at San Francisco Zen Center concerning the question of Zen's availability to interested [[gay]]s, for Dorsey went on to become abbot of the [[Hartford Street Zen Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dainin Katagiri.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Dainin Katagiri]]]]

Following Baker's resignation, [[Dainin Katagiri]] led the community until 1985. When Katagiri left, [[Tenshin Reb Anderson]] assumed Abbotship of the Zen Center—serving until 1995. In the early 1990s the Board of Directors at the Zen Center created the "Ethical Principles and Procedures for Grievance and Reconciliation" for its members, for conflict resolution mediation  guided by [[Buddhist precepts]]. The Board of Directors at SFZC also began [[election]] of leaders. In 1995 [[Zoketsu Norman Fischer]] was installed as Abbot at SFZC, and in 1996 [[Zenkai Blanche Hartman]] was appointed as co-Abbot with him (becoming the first female Abbot in SFZC history).&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seager"/&gt;

===Tenshin Reb Anderson's arrest===
[[File:TenshinRebAnderson.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Tenshin Reb Anderson]]]]
In 1983 [[Tenshin Reb Anderson]] received [[shihō]] from Zentatsu Richard Baker, becoming Baker's first Dharma heir (though Baker disputes this). From 1986 to 1988 he served as abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, and from 1988 to 1995 he served there as co-abbot with [[Sojun Mel Weitsman]]. Anderson became entangled in an incident in 1987 that reached back to 1983— just after [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]] had resigned as abbot. While jogging through [[Golden Gate Park]], Anderson deviated from the path to urinate in some bushes. There he found the corpse of a man with a bullet wound to the head and a revolver nearby. Rather than report this to the police, Anderson returned to the body over several days to meditate over the corpse. On one visit he decided to take the revolver home with him.&lt;ref name="anderson1"&gt;Being Upright; 187-189&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his final visit he found the body no longer there, and a fellow priest in whom he had confided showed him a newspaper article covering the apparent suicide. Five years later (in 1988), roughly fifteen months after Anderson had become abbot of the [[San Francisco]], Anderson was arrested for brandishing this same [[firearm]] in public. He reported being [[Robbery|mugged]] at [[knifepoint]] by a man just a block away from the San Francisco Zen Center at 300 Page Street. Anderson remembered stowing the revolver away in the San Francisco Zen Center's garage and quickly retrieved it. He then drove after the alleged mugger and followed him into a housing project with the revolver (unloaded) in hand, being arrested minutes later by a police officer with his own gun pointed at him.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;Anderson, 187-189&lt;/ref&gt;

This 1987 incident has had a damaging impact on Anderson's reputation as a teacher,  since his arrest received national media coverage. The leadership of San Francisco Zen Center required Anderson to take a [[leave of absence]] from his position as abbot.  After six months, he returned to his position.  Shocked by the series of scandal involving its senior teachers, the organization decided to appoint two abbots, who would share the position at any one time.  Zen priest [[Mel Weitsman]] served with Anderson as a co-abbot during the remainder of his term, and the tradition of two sitting Abbots continued for the next few decades.

Regarding this ordeal, Anderson wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"On both a personal and a professional level, I am still dealing with the consequences of this episode. Some people felt that I had committed an irrevocable betrayal of trust, and have discounted me and my teaching ever since. Others were more forgiving, but their trust in me and my integrity was permanently shaken. Even newer students, who come to Zen Center and find out about these incidents, are sometimes confused and question whether I can be their teacher. These events are a helpful reminder—both to me and to others—of my vulnerability to arrogance and inflation. I see how my empowerment to protect and care for the Triple Treasure inflated my sense of personal authority, and thus detracted from and disparaged the Triple Treasure. This ancient twisted karma I now fully avow."&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prof '''Simon Somerville Laurie''' [[FRSE]] LLD (13 November, 1829 – 2 March, 1909) was a Scottish educator. He became Bell Professor of Education at [[Edinburgh University]] in 1876. He campaigned energetically and successfully for better [[teacher training]] in Scotland.

Laurie also wrote extensively on philosophy, giving the [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1905–6.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Laurie was born on 13 November 1829 in [[Edinburgh]], the eldest son of Rev James Laurie or Lawrie and his wife Jean Somerville.&lt;ref name=Templeton&gt;Templeton, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[Presbyterian]] minister and chaplain to the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;Knox, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was the daughter of a United Presbyterian church minister at [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], Simon Somerville.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Watson, DNB supplement, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived near the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] at 112 Lauriston Place.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office directory 1829-1830&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie was educated at [[Edinburgh High School]] from 1839 to 1844.&lt;ref name=Knox/&gt; To help pay his own school fees, he was already teaching at age 11.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He studied Arts at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he graduated MA at then normal age of 19 in 1849.&lt;ref name=Knox/&gt; He then travelled for 5 years in England, Ireland and Europe, with private students.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Career===
[[File:22 George Square, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Laurie's house at 22 George Square, Edinburgh]]
In 1855 he became secretary and visitor of schools for the [[Church of Scotland]]'s education committee, which was then responsible for Scottish parish schools and for teacher training. Laurie held this role for 50 years, in which time he greatly improved the education of teachers in Scotland. He vigorously campaigned to have all teachers educated at university, with the teacher training colleges providing professional training only after that. It took until 1873 for the Scottish board of education to give the training colleges the right to send their best students, at least, to universities to gain full degrees. Laurie went further, campaigning to have day training colleges set up in England, and in 1890 he succeeded in this also, personally inaugurating the teacher training department of [[University College, Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1856 he became visitor and examiner for the [[James Dick|Dick Bequest Trust]]. The trust distributed money to the best school teachers in northeast Scotland (Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray counties) according to Laurie's published reports.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1868, the [[Merchant Company of Edinburgh]] and the [[Heriot Trust]] both invited Laurie to inspect their Edinburgh schools. The Merchant Company's schools were known as "hospitals" and were run in monastic style. His report was critical of these schools, observing that while a larger amount was spent on them than all the parish schools of Scotland, they were not providing adequate moral and intellectual education. Laurie recommended sending the boys to his alma mater, the Edinburgh High School, while a new high school should be opened for day girls. His recommendations were embodied in an 1869 [[Act of Parliament]] which abolished the monastic and alms-giving nature of the former "hospitals".&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1872, Laurie was appointed secretary to the royal commission on Scottish endowed schools. His reports for the commission led to the reorganisation of secondary schooling under [[Lord Moncrieff]] (1878) and [[Lord Balfour]] (1882–1889).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1876, Laurie became the first Bell Professor of Education at the University of Edinburgh. In his first year there, he had 12 students; the number rose to 120 by the end of his tenure in 1903. He used the position to improve pedagogy in the whole of Britain, not only in Scotland.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Also in 1876, he became honorary secretary of the Association for Promoting Secondary Education in Scotland, a voluntary campaigning organisation. It was dissolved in 1880 when it achieved its goal with the passing of the [[Endowed Institutions (Scotland) Act 1878]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1891, as president of the Teachers' Guild of Great Britain and Ireland, Laurie gave evidence before a select parliamentary committee, arguing for the registration and organisation of all state school teachers to improve the quality of teaching. At the same time, he was strongly opposed to centralised bureaucratic control by the board of education, favouring freedom for local education authorities.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Writings===
He wrote widely on education and on philosophical topics. [[Josipa Petrunic]] describes his philosophical writings as "often nebulous and obscure", in contrast to his more practical work on education.&lt;ref name=Petrunic&gt;Petrunic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie resigned his chair in 1903, and retired from his work with the Dick Bequest in 1907.&lt;ref name=Petrunic/&gt;
In 1905–6, he gave the Gifford Lectures in natural theology, in Edinburgh. He wrote up the lectures in ''Synthetica'' (1905–06), which "gave Laurie high rank among speculative writers". The French philosopher Georges Remacle translated and commented on ''Synthetica''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Awards and honours===
On his retirement, Laurie's admirers presented him with the portrait oil painting by [[George Fiddes Watt]] (see illustration).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The painting is now in the University of Edinburgh Fine Art Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/simon-somerville-laurie-18291909-94465 | title=Simon Somerville Laurie (1829–1909) | publisher=BBC | accessdate=7 October 2012 | author=Watt, George Fiddes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie was given honorary LL.D. degrees by the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1887, the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1903, and the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=RSE/&gt;

==Family==
[[File:The grave of Simon Somerville Laurie, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The grave of Simon Somerville Laurie, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
Laurie married Catherine Ann Hibburd in 1861; they had 4 children together,&lt;ref name=Petrunic/&gt; including the chemist [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]] (1861–1949) and the zoologist [[Malcolm Laurie]] (1866–1932), both of whom were elected Fellows of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=RSE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf | title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002 | publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh | work=Biographical Index, Part Two | date=July 2006 | accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Mary Struthers Laurie, married Sir [[David Orme Masson]].

Catherine died in 1895.&lt;ref name=RSE/&gt; Laurie then married Lucy Struthers, the daughter of [[John Struthers (anatomist)|Sir John Struthers]], in 1901.&lt;ref name=Petrunic/&gt;

He died on 2 March 1909 at his house 22 [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]], Edinburgh. He is buried in the [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The grave lies in the western extension against the southern wall, close to the south-west corner.

'''''Syntactic Structures''''' is a major work in [[linguistics]] by American linguist [[Noam Chomsky]].{{refn|&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In {{harvnb|Lees|1957}}, an influential review of ''Syntactic Structures'', linguist Robert Lees wrote that "Chomsky's book on syntactic structures is one of the first serious attempts on the part of a linguist to construct within the tradition of theory-construction a comprehensive theory of language which may be understood in the same sense that a chemical, biological theory is ordinarily understood by experts in those fields. It's not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalog, nor another speculative philosophy about the nature of Man and Language, but a rather rigorous explanation of our intuitions about language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle 1972"&gt;{{harvnb|Searle|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmeyer 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was first published in 1957. It introduced the idea of [[transformational generative grammar]]. This approach to [[syntax]] (the study of sentence structures) was fully [[Formal science|formal]] (based on symbols and rules). At its base, this method uses [[phrase structure rules]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From {{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=102}}: "In §§3-7 we outlined the development of some fundamental linguistic concepts in purely formal terms."&lt;/ref&gt; These rules break down sentences into smaller parts. Chomsky then combines these with a new kind of rules called "[[Transformational grammar#Transformations|transformations]]". This procedure gives rise to different sentence structures.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this limited set of rules, Chomsky aimed to "generate"&lt;ref name="ss"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Here, "generate" means giving a clear structural description of each sentence. In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1965|p=9}}, Chomsky writes that "When we speak of a grammar as generating a sentence with a certain structural description, we mean simply that the grammar assigns this structural description to the sentence."&lt;/ref&gt; all and only the grammatical sentences of a given language, which are unlimited in number.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957: 49"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syntactic Structures'' is Chomsky's first book. It is a short [[monograph]] of about a hundred pages, written for specialists in linguistics. Chomsky based it on the lecture notes he had prepared for his students at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref group=" note" name="MITnotes"/&gt; In it, he mentioned the now-famous sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]."&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt; Even though this sentence has no clear meaning, grammar-wise it still seems instinctively correct to a native English speaker. For Chomsky, the study of [[syntax]] is thus independent of [[semantics]] (the study of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]).&lt;ref name="ChomSynAuto"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From {{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=103}}:"...such  semantic notions as reference, significance, and synonymity played no role in the discussion."&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky wrote ''Syntactic Structures'' when he was still an unknown scholar.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Pullum|2011}} writes: "[Chomsky] was at the time an unknown 28-year-old who taught language classes at MIT"&lt;/ref&gt; Mouton, a small Dutch publisher, released the book.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See the "[[Syntactic Structures#Publication|Publication]]" section of this article&lt;/ref&gt; Still, this dense technical work was well received in the beginning. It was even considered a welcome addition&lt;ref name="hockett"&gt;{{harvnb|Hockett|1965|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the existing tradition of language study.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At that time, in the 1930s and 1940s, linguists studied languages with a [[Descriptive linguistics|descriptive]], [[Structural linguistics|structuralist]] approach pioneered by American linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, established older linguists soon began criticizing it for its bold new views.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to {{harvnb|Joseph|2001}}: "Starting in 1957 and with rapidly accelerating force from about 1960&amp;ndash;62 onward, the "transformational-generative linguistics" of Noam Chomsky set out to undo the underpinnings of American "structural" linguistics. Structuralism became the "vieux jeu" of the older "establishment" generation, swept aside by the transformational-generativism of the young rebels."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike them, younger linguists were eager to adopt Chomsky's way of doing research.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See {{harvnb|Harris|1993|loc=Chapter 3}} for details&lt;/ref&gt; And so linguistics changed course in the second half of the 20th century. It became normal to build more [[Formal science|formal]] theories with syntax at their center. This way of study valued language's place [[Mentalism (psychology)|in the mind]] over language [[Behaviorism|behavior]].&lt;ref group="note" name="BehavCritic" /&gt;

''Syntactic Structures'' has influenced fields outside linguistics. It had a big impact on the study of [[philosophy|knowledge]], [[psychology|mind]] and [[cognitive sciences|mental processes]]. It also had a smaller effect on the research on [[computer science|computers]] and [[neuroscience|brain]].&lt;ref name="reception" group="note"&gt;See [[Syntactic Structures#Reception|the "Reception" section]] of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialists have questioned Chomsky's theory. They think it is wrong to describe language as an ideal system. They also say it gives less value to the [[empiricism|gathering and testing of data]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Syntactic Structures#Criticisms|the "Criticisms" section]] of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, going into the  21st century, linguists and non-linguists alike praised the book. They recognized it as one of the most important studies of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Cook 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cogsci" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="timemag" /&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Noam Chomsky (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Noam Chomsky, the author of ''Syntactic Structures'' (1977 photo)]]
Chomsky's interest in language started at an early age. When he was twelve, he studied [[Hebrew grammar]] under his father.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Specifically, Chomsky read ''David Kimhi's Hebrew Grammar (Mikhlol)'' (1952), an annotated study of a 13th century Hebrew grammar. It was written by his father, [[William Chomsky]], one of the leading [[Hebrew]] scholars at the time. See {{harvnb|Barsky|1997|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied [[Arabic]] in his first year at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For its similarity to Hebrew. See {{harvnb|Barsky|1997|p=47}} and {{cite web | title=Noam Chomsky interviewed by David Samuels | website=Chomsky.info | url=https://chomsky.info/20101112/ | accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he met [[Zellig Harris]], the founder of the college's linguistics [[academic department|department]]. Harris was an established linguist. He did research in the way laid out by American linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barsky|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He let Chomsky proofread a copy of his book ''Methods in Structural Linguistics'' (1951).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the 1947 preface of {{harvnb|Harris|1951}}, Zellig Harris writes that “N. Chomsky has given
much-needed assistance with the manuscript."&lt;/ref&gt; This is how Chomsky came to know a formal theory of [[linguistics]]. He soon decided to major in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barsky|1997|pp=49&amp;ndash;50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  group="note"&gt;In his preface to {{harvnb|Chomsky|1975|}}, Chomsky writes that “My introduction to the field of linguistics was in 1947, when Zellig Harris gave me the proofs of his 'Methods in Structural Linguistics' to read."&lt;/ref&gt;

For his thesis, Chomsky set out to apply Harris's [[Zellig Harris#Major contributions in the 1940s|methods]] to Hebrew. Following Harris's advice, he studied [[logic]], [[philosophy]], and [[Foundations of mathematics|mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1975|p=33}} and {{harvnb|Thomas|2012|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found Harris's views on language much like [[Nelson Goodman]]'s work on philosophical systems.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Especially Goodman's work on [[constructional system]]s and on the inadequacy of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] approaches. See {{harvnb|Chomsky|1975|p=33}}. {{harvnb|Goldsmith|Huck|1995|p=24}} writes: "Chomsky has said that he was convinced from his days as a student of Goodman's that there is no inductive learning."&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky was also influenced by the works of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1975|p=33}} writes: "Quine's critiques of logical empiricism also gave some reason to believe that [a non-taxonomic approach to linguistic theory] might be a plausible one."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Otero|1994}} states that among non-American philosophers, it was only Rudolf Carnap whom Chomsky read as a student (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Tomalin|2003}} writes that "It is well known that Carnap's post-Aufbau work (especially ''Logische Syntax der Sprache'') influenced Chomsky directly to some extent."&lt;/ref&gt; Quine [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|showed]] that one cannot completely verify the meaning of a statement through observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap had developed a formal theory of language. It used symbols and rules that did not refer to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carnap|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there on, Chomsky tried to build a grammar of Hebrew. Such a grammar would generate the [[Phonetics|phonetic]] or sound forms of sentences. To this end, he organized Harris's methods in a different way.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Joseph|Love|Taylor|2001|p=125}} states: "The most significant discontinuity [between Harris's ''Methods'' and Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures''] is Chomsky's inversion of Harris's analytic procedures."&lt;/ref&gt; To describe sentence forms and structures, he came up with a set of [[Recursion#In language|recursive rules]]. These are rules that refer back to themselves. He also found that there were many different ways of presenting the grammar. He tried to develop a method to measure how simple a grammar is.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Tomalin|2006|p=116}} writes: "[Echoing] Goodman's pro-simplicity arguments&amp;nbsp;... the task of creating&amp;nbsp;... a simplicity measure is precisely the one Chomsky sets for himself in Chapter 4 of ''LSLT''."&lt;/ref&gt; For this, he looked for "generalizations" among the possible sets of grammatical rules.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1951|p=5}} states: "We want the reduction of the number of elements and statements, any generalizations&amp;nbsp;... to increase the total simplicity of the grammar"&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky completed his undergraduate thesis ''The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew'' in 1949. He then published a revised and expanded version of it as his master's thesis in 1951.

In 1951, Chomsky became a Junior Fellow at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graffi|2001|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he tried to build an all-[[mathematical formalism|formal]] linguistic theory.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Before Chomsky, Israeli mathematician and linguist [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]] had already shown in {{harvnb|Bar-Hillel|1953}} that formal languages and methods used in symbolic logic can be adapted to analyze human languages.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a clear break with the existing tradition of language study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilvray|2005|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Chomsky published his first paper as a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he tried to adapt the symbol-based language of [[mathematical logic|logic]] to describe the syntax of a human language. During his fellowship, Chomsky organized all his ideas into a huge manuscript. It was around 1,000 typewritten pages long. He gave it the title ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (''LSLT'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barsky|1997|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Chomsky found a job at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. He worked there as a linguist in the [[mechanical translation]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barsky|1997|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he submitted his doctoral dissertation to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The university granted him a Ph.D. for his thesis ''Transformational Analysis.'' In fact, it was just the ninth chapter of ''LSLT''.&lt;ref name="Sampson 2001 152"&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
In 1955, Chomsky had a doctorate in linguistics. Even so, he struggled at first to publish his theory and views on language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sklar|1968|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered the manuscript of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (''LSLT'') for publication. But MIT's [[MIT Press|Technology Press]] refused to publish it. He also saw a paper promptly rejected by the academic linguistics journal ''[[WORD (journal)|WORD]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Chomsky writes in {{harvnb|Chomsky|1979|pp=131–132}}: "As for the reception accorded to LSLT [the Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory], there is little to say. I've already told you that I did not have the impression the reaction on the part of linguists was surprising. I offered LSLT to the MIT-Press – who refused it. Quite rightly, I think, because at that time the situation was very unfavourable for a general book on that subject, especially one by an unknown author. I also submitted a technical article on simplicity and explanation to the journal Word, at the suggestion of Roman Jakobson, but it was rejected virtually by return mail. So I had little hope of seeing any of this work published, at least in a linguistic journal."&lt;/ref&gt;  So he remained an outsider to the field of linguistics. His reviews and articles at the time were mostly published in non-linguistic journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barsky|1997|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In particular, Chomsky wrote an academic paper in 1956 titled ''Three Models for the Description of Language'' published in the technological journal ''IRE Transactions on Information Theory'' ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1956}}). It foreshadows many of the concepts presented in ''Syntactic Strucutres''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton &amp; Co.]] was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publishing house based in [[The Hague]]. They had gained academic reputation by publishing works on [[Slavic Studies]] since 1954.&lt;ref name="Hamans 2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamans|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, they had published works by linguists Nicolaas Van Wijk and [[Roman Jakobson]]. Soon they started a new series called ''Janua Linguarum'' or the "Gate of Languages."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinrichs|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to be a series of "small monographs" on general linguistics.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The series's editor Van Schooneveld is quoted thus in {{harvnb|Hinrichs|2001|pp=5–6}}: "I had originally conceived of the ''Janua'' as a series of small monographs of the size of a large article, too interesting to get drowned in a periodical amongst other contributions and to be lost to oblivion by the current of time."&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of the ''Janua Linguarum'' series was written by Roman Jakobson and [[Morris Halle]]. It was called ''Fundamentals of Language'', published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jakobson|Halle|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky had already met Jakobson, a professor at Harvard University, during his fellowship years. Halle was Chomsky's graduate classmate at Harvard and then a close colleague at MIT. In 1956, Chomsky and Halle collaborated to write an article on phonology, published in a [[festschrift]] for Jakobson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|Halle|Lukoff|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festschrift was published by Mouton in 1956.

Cornelis van Schooneveld was the editor of the ''Janua Linguarum'' series at Mouton. He was a Dutch linguist and a direct student of Jakobson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinrichs|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was looking for monographs to publish for his series. Consequently, he visited Chomsky at MIT in 1956. With Morris Halle's (and possibly Jakobson's) mediation,&lt;ref name="Hamans 2014"/&gt; Chomsky showed van Schooneveld his notes for his introductory linguistics course for undergraduate students. Van Schoonefeld took an interest in them. He offered to publish an elaborate version of them at Mouton, to which Chomsky agreed.&lt;ref group="note" name="MITnotes"&gt;Chomsky is quoted in {{harvnb|Riemsdijk|Huybregts|1982|p=63}} saying: "It [Syntactic Structures] was course notes for an undergraduate course at MIT. Van Schooneveld [a Dutch linguist who was associated with Mouton] showed up here once and took a look at some of my course notes from the undergraduate course I was teaching and said I ought to publish it." In ({{harvnb|Dillinger|Palácio|1997|pp=162&amp;ndash;163}}), Chomsky recounted: "At the time Mouton was publishing just about anything, so they decided they'd publish it along with a thousand other worthless things that were coming out. That's the story of ''Syntactic Structures'': course notes for undergraduate science students published by accident in Europe." The publication of ''Syntactic structures'' is also discussed in {{harvnb|Noordegraaf|2001}} and {{harvnb|van Schooneveld|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky then prepared a manuscript of the right size (no longer than 120 pages)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to {{harvnb|Hinrichs|2001|p=7}}, Peter de Ridder, the managing director of Mouton, wrote to van Schooneveld that "new titles in the series [should be] no bigger than about 120 pages."&lt;/ref&gt; that would fit the series. After revising an earlier manuscript, Chomsky sent a final version in the first week of August in 1956 to van Schooneveld.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
A scan of Chomsky's own typewritten letter dated 5 August 1956 to Mouton editor Cornelis van Schooneveld can be found in {{harvnb|Hamans|2014}}. This letter accompanied the final version of the manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; The editor had Chomsky rename the book's title to ''Syntactic Structures'' for commercial purposes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Hinrichs|2001|p=7}} mentions De Ridder writing to Van Schooneveld that "I am convinced that the book will sell well with this title."&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also pre-ordered in big numbers by MIT. These gave more incentives to Mouton to publish the book. Mouton finally published Chomsky's monograph titled ''Syntactic Structures'' in the second week of February 1957.

Soon after the book's first publication, [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]], editor of the prestigious journal ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', gave linguist [[Robert Lees (linguist)|Robert Benjamin Lees]], a colleague of Chomsky's at MIT, the opportunity to write a review of the book. Lees's very positive&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Oenbring|2009}} remarks that Lees's review was "hyperbolic", his language "loaded" and {{harvnb|Harris|1993}} refers to Lees as "Chomsky's Huxley", referring to the proselytizing "bulldog" role played by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in defense of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories on evolution. {{harvnb|Voegelin|1958}} considers Lees to be "Chomsky's explicator". Chomsky himself considers Lees's review "provocative." ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1975|p=3}})&lt;/ref&gt;  essay-length review appeared in the July–September 1957 issue of ''Language''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lees|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early but influential review made ''Syntactic Structures'' visible on the linguistic research landscape. Shortly thereafter the book created a putative "[[Paradigm shift|revolution]]" in the discipline.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Thorne|1965}} remarked that "a revolution of the kind Kuhn describes has recently taken place in linguistics – dating from the publication of Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1957". According to {{harvnb|Sklar|1968}}: "What has happened in linguistics since Chomsky appeared on the scene almost perfectly fits Kuhn's description of how a scientific revolution works." {{harvnb|Searle|1972}} writes that "[Chomsky's] revolution followed fairly closely the general pattern described in Thomas Kuhn's ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''". See also {{harvnb|Newmeyer|1986}} and {{harvnb|Newmeyer|1996}}; For a critical and elaborate account, consult the contributions in {{harvnb|Kibbee|2010}}. To read about an alternative take which casts doubt on whether a revolution really took place, consult {{harvnb|Koerner|2002}}. Three decades after his original review, {{harvnb|Searle|2002}} wrote that "Judged by the objectives stated in the original manifestoes, the revolution has not succeeded. Something else may have succeeded, or may eventually succeed, but the goals of the original revolution have been altered and in a sense abandoned."&lt;/ref&gt; As for ''LSLT'', it would be 17 more years before it saw publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syntactic Structures'' was the fourth book in the ''Janua Linguarum'' series. It was the series's bestselling book. It was reprinted 13 times until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinrichs|2001|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, a Russian translation by Konstantin Ivanovich Babisky, titled ''Синтакси́ческие структу́ры'' (''Sintaksychyeskiye Struktury''), was published in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Yasuo Isamu wrote a Japanese translation of the book, named ''文法の構造'' (''Bunpō no kōzō'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, a French translation by [[Michel Braudeau]], titled ''Structures Syntaxiques'', was published by [[Éditions du Seuil]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Mouton published a German translation by Klaus-Peter Lange, titled ''Strukturen der Syntax''.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1973"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been translated into [[Korean language|Korean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish language|Spanish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech language|Czech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bugarski|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1973"/&gt; languages.

==Contents==
===Goals of syntactic investigation===
In ''Syntactic Structures'', Chomsky tries to construct a "formalized theory of linguistic structure". He places emphasis on "rigorous formulations" and "precisely constructed models".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|loc=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first chapter of the book, he gives a definition of human language [[syntax]]. He then talks about the goals of syntactic study. For Chomsky, a linguist's goal is to build a [[grammar]] of a language. He defines grammar as a device which produces all the sentences of the language under study. Secondly, a linguist must find the abstract concepts beneath grammars to develop a general method. This method would help select the best possible device or grammar for any language given its [[Speech corpus|corpus]]. Finally, a linguistic theory must give a satisfactory description of all the levels of language analysis. Examples of these levels include [[phonology|sounds]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|words]] and [[syntax|sentence structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammaticality===
{{See also|Grammaticality|Colorless green ideas sleep furiously}}
[[File:Cgisf-tgg.svg|thumb|400px|A tree diagram of the sentence "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"]]
The second chapter is titled "The Independence of Grammar". In it, Chomsky states that a language is "a set ... of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements". A linguist should separate the "grammatical sequences" or sentences of a language from the "ungrammatical sequences".&lt;ref name="ss"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By a "grammatical" sentence Chomsky means a sentence that is intuitively "acceptable to a native speaker".&lt;ref name="ss" /&gt; It is a sentence pronounced with a "normal sentence intonation". It is also "recall[ed] much more quickly" and "learn[ed] much more easily".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky then analyzes further about the basis of "grammaticality." He shows three ways that do ''not'' determine whether a sentence is grammatical or not. First, a grammatical sentence need not be included in a corpus. Secondly, it need not be meaningful. Finally, it does not have to be statistically probable. Chomsky shows all three points using a nonsensical sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]."&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the sentence is instinctively "grammatical" to a native English speaker. But it is not included in any known corpus at the time and is neither meaningful nor [[Probability distribution|statistically probable]].

Chomsky concludes that "grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning." He adds that "probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure."&lt;ref name="ChomSynAuto" /&gt;

====Carnap's influence====
British linguist Marcus Tomalin stated that a version of "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" was suggested decades earlier by [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomalin|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebuschi|2001|p=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This German philosopher offered in 1934 the pseudo-sentence "Piroten karulieren elatisch".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carnap|1934|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to American linguist Reese Heitner, Carnap's sentence showed the autonomy of both syntactic and phonological structures.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to {{harvnb|Heitner|2005}}: "[Carnap's sentence] actually does the double duty of demonstrating the "autonomy" of syntactic and phonological structure, an indication that not only can sentences be recognized as syntactically well-formed, but individual words can also be recognized as phonologically well-formed independent of semantics."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar models and transformations===
{{See also|Transformational grammar}}
In the third chapter titled "An Elementary Linguistic Theory", Chomsky tries to determine what sort of device or model gives an adequate account of a given set of "grammatical" sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky hypothesizes that this device has to be finite instead of infinite. He then considers [[finite state grammar]], a [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication|communication theoretic]] model&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Specifically, the model proposed in {{harvnb|Shannon|Weaver|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; which treats language as a [[Markov process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=19&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the fourth chapter titled "Phrase Structure", he discusses [[phrase structure grammar]], a model based on [[immediate constituent analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=26&amp;ndash;33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth chapter titled "Limitations of Phrase Structure Description", he claims to show that both these models are inadequate for the purpose of linguistic description. As a solution, he introduces [[transformational generative grammar]] (TGG), "a more powerful model&amp;nbsp;... that might remedy these inadequacies."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957: 49"/&gt;
[[File:Chomsky-Syntactic-Structures-Grammar-Model.jpg|thumb|400px|The grammar model discussed in Noam Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' (1957)]]
Chomsky's transformational grammar has three parts: [[phrase structure rule]]s, [[transformational rules]] and [[Morphophonemics|morphophonemic]] rules.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957: 45"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase structure rules are used for expanding [[Lexical category|grammatical categories]] &lt;!-- Here grammatical category is actually lexical category--&gt; and for substitutions. These yield a string of [[morpheme]]s. A transformational rule "operates on a given string&amp;nbsp;... with a given constituent structure and converts it into a new string with a new derived constituent structure."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957 44"/&gt; It "may rearrange strings or may add or delete morphemes."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957 46"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational rules are of two kinds: obligatory or optional. Obligatory transformations applied on the "terminal strings" of the grammar produce the "kernel of the language".&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957: 45"/&gt; Kernel sentences are simple, active, declarative and affirmative sentences. To produce passive, negative, interrogative or complex sentences, one or more optional transformation rules must be applied in a particular order to the kernel sentences. At the final stage of the grammar, morphophonemic rules convert a string of words into a string of [[phoneme]]s.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957 46"/&gt; Chomsky then applies this idea of transformational rules in the [[English language|English]] [[auxiliary verb]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=38&amp;ndash;40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Borrowing of terminology====
In ''Syntactic Structures'', the term "transformation" was borrowed from the works of [[Zellig Harris]]. Harris was Chomsky's initial mentor. Harris used the term "transformation" to describe equivalence relations between sentences of a language. By contrast, Chomsky's used the term to describe a formal rule applied to underlying structures of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2008|pp=66&amp;ndash;67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky also borrowed the term "generative" from a previous work of mathematician [[Emil Post]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1959}}, Chomsky writes that he was "following a familiar technical use of the term "generate," cf. {{harvnb|Post|1944}}". In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1965|p=9}}, Chomksy justifies his choice of the term "generate", writing that "the term 'generate' is familiar in the sense intended here in logic, particularly in Post's theory of combinatorial systems. Furthermore, 'generate' seems to be the most appropriate translation for Humboldt's term ''erzeugen'', which he frequently uses, it seems, in essentially the sense here intended. Since this use of the term 'generate' is well established both in logic and in the tradition of linguistic theory."&lt;/ref&gt; Post wanted to "mechanically [derive] inferences from an initial axiomatic sentence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Post|1943}},  {{harvnb|Post|1944}} and  {{harvnb|Pullum|Scholz|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky applied Post's work on [[logical inference]] to describe sets of [[String (computer science)|string]]s (sequence of letters or sounds) of a human language. When he says a finite set of rules "generate" (i.e. "recursively enumerate"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pullum|Scholz|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the set of potentially infinite number of sentences of a particular human language, he means that they provide an explicit, structural description of those sentences.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1965|p=8}}, Chomsky writes that "by a generative grammar I mean simply a system of rules that in some explicit and well-defined way assigns structural descriptions to sentences."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification of grammars===
In the sixth chapter titled "On the Goals of Linguistic Theory", Chomsky writes that his "fundamental concern" is "the problem of justification of grammars".&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957: 49"/&gt; He draws parallels between the theory of language and theories in [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]]. He compares a finite [[Speech corpus|corpus]] of [[utterance]]s of a particular language to "[[observation]]s". He likens grammatical rules to "[[Physical law|laws]]" which are stated in terms of "hypothetical constructs" such as [[phoneme]]s, [[phrase]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957: 49"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chomsky, the criteria for the "justification of grammars" are "external conditions of adequacy", the "condition of generality" and "simplicity". To choose the best possible grammar for a given corpus of a given language, Chomsky shows his preference for the "evaluation procedure" (which uses the aforementioned criteria). He rejects the "discovery procedure"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=55}} writes: "Our main point is that a linguistic theory should not be identified with a manual of useful procedures, nor should it be expected to provide mechanical procedures for the discovery of grammars"&lt;/ref&gt; (employed in [[structural linguistics]] and supposed to automatically and mechanically produce the correct grammar of a language from a corpus&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|1980|pp=76}} notes that "the fullest and most interesting expression of 'discovery procedure' is [the] book ''Methods in Structural Linguistics'' ({{harvnb|Harris|1951}}) by Zellig Harris, Chomsky's mentor.&lt;/ref&gt;). He also dismisses the "decision procedure" (supposed to automatically choose the best grammar for a language from a set of competing grammars).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=49&amp;ndash;56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky thus shows preference for "explanatory depth" with some "empirical inadequacies" over the pursuit of very detailed empirical coverage of all data.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See {{harvnb|Chomsky|1978|pp=9–10}}. Chomsky characterized this approach as the "Galilean Style" of inquiry which had already been applied in modern natural sciences with "great success" since the 17th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application of transformational grammar in English===
In the seventh chapter titled "Some Transformations in English", Chomsky strictly applies his just-proposed transformation-based approach on some aspects of English. He treats at length the formation of [[English language|English]] [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] [[Passive voice|passive]] sentences, yes-no and wh- [[Interrogative word|interrogative]] sentences, etc. He claims in the end that transformational analysis can describe "a wide variety of&amp;nbsp;... distinct phenomena" in English grammar in a "simple", "natural" and "orderly" way.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=68}} states:"a wide variety of apparently distinct phenomena [in English language] all fall into place in a very simple and natural way when we adopt the viewpoint of transformational analysis and that, consequently, the grammar of English becomes much more simple and orderly."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructional homonymity and distinct levels of linguistic analysis===
In the eighth chapter titled "The explanatory power of linguistic theory", Chomsky writes a linguistic theory cannot content itself by just  generating valid grammatical sentences. It also has to account for other structural phenomena at different levels of linguistic representation. At a certain linguistic level, there can be two items which can be understood having different meanings but they are structurally indistinguishable within that level. This is called a “constructional homonymity” [sic]. The relevant ambiguity can be resolved by establishing a higher level of linguistic analysis. At this higher level, the two items can be clearly shown having two different structural interpretations. In this way, constructional homonymities at the phonemic level can be resolved by establishing the level of morphology, and so forth. One of the motivation of establishing a distinct, higher level of linguistic analysis is, then, to explain the structural ambiguity due to the constructional homonymities at a lower level. On the other hand, each linguistic level also captures some structural similarities within the level that are not explained in lower levels. Chomsky uses this argument as well to motivate the establishment of distinct levels of linguistic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=85-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky then shows that a grammar which analyzes sentences up to the phrase structure level contains many constructional homonymities at the phrase structure level where the resulting ambiguities need to be explained at a higher level. Then he shows how his newly invented “transformational level” can naturally and successfully function as that higher level. He further claims that any phrase structure grammar which cannot explain these ambiguities as successfully as transformational grammar does must be considered "inadequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of semantics in syntax===
In the ninth chapter titled "Syntax and Semantics", Chomsky reminds that his analysis so far has been "completely [[Formal language|formal]] and non-semantic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then offers many counterexamples to refute some common linguistic assertions about grammar's reliance on [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. He concludes that the correspondence between meaning and grammatical form is "imperfect", "inexact" and "vague." Consequently, it is "relatively useless" to use meaning "as a basis for grammatical description".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support his point, Chomsky considers a similar relation between semantics and [[phonology]]. He shows that in order to build a theory of [[Phoneme|phonemic]] distinction based on meaning would entail "complex", "exhaustive" and "laborious investigation" of an "immense", "vast [[Speech corpus|corpus]]".&lt;ref name="chomcorp"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=96&amp;ndash;97}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, phonemic distinctness can be easily explained in a "straightforward" way and in "completely non-semantic terms" with the help of "pair tests".&lt;ref name="chomcorp" /&gt; Chomsky also claims that a strictly formal, non-semantic framework of syntactic theory might ultimately be useful to support a parallel independent semantic theory.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Because it would "reveal" insights about sentence structures. See {{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical style==
Randy Allen Harris, a specialist of the [[rhetoric of science]], writes that ''Syntactic Structures'' "appeals calmly and insistently to a new conception" of linguistic science. He finds the book "lucid, convincing, syntactically daring, the calm voice of reason&amp;nbsp;... [speaking] directly to the imagination and ambition of the entire field." It also bridged the "rhetorical gulf" to make the message of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (a highly abstract, mathematically dense, and "forbiddingly technical" work) more palatable to the wider field of linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1993|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more detailed examination of the book, Harris finds Chomsky's argumentation in ''Syntactic Structures'' "multilayered and compelling". Chomsky not only makes a logical appeal (i.e. [[logos]]) to a highly formalized model of language, but also appeals explicitly and tacitly to the [[Ethos#Rhetoric|ethos]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Chomsky’s analysis of the complex English auxiliary verb system in ''Syntactic Structures'' had great rhetorical effect. It combined simple phrase structure rules with a simple transformational rule. This treatment was based entirely on formal simplicity. Various linguists have described it as “beautiful”, “powerful”, “elegant”, “revealing”, “insightful”, “beguiling” and “ingenious”.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1987|p=24}} wrote that “[Chomsky’s] examples of defects of phrase structure grammar were illustrated simultaneously with the demonstration that grammars containing the more powerful transformational rules can handle the same phenomena in an elegant and revealing manner.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to {{harvnb|Brown|2010|p=188}}, "this apparently curious analysis is rather ingenious" and "the powerful tool of different levels of structure related by transformations was particularly beguiling, since  transformations appeared to offer a means of explaining the often amazingly complex relationships between the forms of sentences and their understanding."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In his introduction to ''Syntactic Structures'' ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=ix}}), American linguist David Lightfoot wrote that "this ingenious transformation...avoided hopelessly complex phrase structure rules and yielded an elegant account... ”&lt;/ref&gt; According to American linguist Frederick Newmeyer, this particular analysis won many “supporters for Chomsky” and “immediately led to some linguists’ proposing generative-transformational analysis of particular phenomena”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1987|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to British linguist E. Keith Brown, "the elegance and insightfulness of this account was instantly recognized, and this was an important factor in ensuring the initial success of the transformational way of looking at syntax."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2010|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; American linguist Mark Aronoff wrote that this “beautiful analysis and description of some very striking facts was the rhetorical weapon that drove the acceptance of [Chomsky’s] theory”. He added that in Chomsky’s treatment of English verbs, “the convergence of theory and analysis provide a description of facts so convincing that it changed the entire field”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aronoff|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Oenbring, a doctorate in the rhetoric of science, thinks that Chomsky "overstates the novelty" of transformational rules. He "seems to take all the credit for them" even though a version of them had already been introduced by [[Zellig Harris]] in a previous work. He writes that Chomsky himself was "cautious" to "display deference" to prevailing linguistic research. His enthusiastic followers such as [[Robert Lees (linguist)|Lees]] were, by contrast, much more "confrontational". They sought to drive a "rhetorical wedge" between Chomsky's work and that of post-Bloomfieldians (i.e. American linguists in the 1940s et 1950s), arguing that the latter does not qualify as linguistic "science".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oenbring|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Impact on linguistics===
In an early review of the book, American structural linguist [[Charles F. Voegelin]] wrote that ''Syntactic Structures'' posed a fundamental challenge to the established way of doing linguistic research. He stated that it had the potential to accomplish "a [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican revolution]]" within linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voegelin|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another American linguist [[Martin Joos]] called the Chomskyan brand of linguistic theory a "heresy" within the [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joos|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early remarks proved to be prescient. American linguist [[Paul Postal]] commented in 1964 that most of the "syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States" were "versions of the theory of [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the sense of Chomsky".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postal|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965, linguists were saying that  ''Syntactic Structures'' had "mark[ed] an epoch",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levin|1965|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a "startling impact"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bach|1965|pp=111&amp;ndash;12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhnian]] "revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thorne|1965|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; British linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] wrote in 1966 that "no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyons|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; British historian of linguistics [[R. H. Robins]] wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' was "probably the most radical and important change in direction in [[descriptive linguistics]] and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|1967|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historian of linguistics [[Frederick Newmeyer]] considers ''Syntactic Structures'' "revolutionary" for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a [[Formal language|formal]] yet non-[[Empiricism|empiricist]] theory of language was possible. Chomsky demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of [[English grammar]]. Secondly, it put [[syntax]] at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. Subsequently, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the study of structure and formation of words) and [[phonology]] (i.e. the study of organization of sounds in languages) were relegated in importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1996|pp=24&amp;ndash;26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American linguist Norbert Hornstein wrote that before ''Syntactic Structures'', linguistic research was overly preoccupied with creating hierarchies and categories of all observable language data. One of the "lasting contributions" of  ''Syntactic Structures'' is that it shifted the linguistic research methodology to abstract, rationalist theory-making based on contacts with data, which is the "common scientific practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=On Syntactic Structures | website=Faculty of Language| author = Norbert Hornstein |date = 27 January 2017 | url=http://facultyoflanguage.blogspot.com/2017/01/on-syntactic-structures.html | accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on other disciplines===
;Psychology
The generative grammar of ''Syntactic Structures'' heralded Chomsky's [[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalist]] perspective in linguistic analysis. Shortly after its publication, in 1959, Chomsky wrote a critical review&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1959"&gt;{{harvnb|Chomsky|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner had presented the [[Language acquisition|acquisition]] of human language in terms of conditioned responses to outside [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and [[reinforcement]]. Chomsky opposed this [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] model. He argued that humans produce language using separate syntactic and semantic components inside the [[mind]]. He presented the generative grammar as a coherent abstract description of this underlying [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] reality.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1959"/&gt; Chomsky's argument had a forceful impact on psycholinguistic research. It changed the course of the discipline in the following years.&lt;ref group="note" name="BehavCritic"&gt;According to {{harvnb|Steinberg|Hiroshi|Aline|2013|p=371}}: "[Chomsky's generative system of rules] was more powerful that anything&amp;nbsp;... psycholinguists had heretofore had at their disposal. [It] was of special interest to these theorists. Many psychologists were quick to attribute generative systems to the minds of speakers and quick to abandon&amp;nbsp;... Behaviorism."&lt;/ref&gt;
;Philosophy
''Syntactic Structures'' initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between [[Philosophy of language|philosophers of language]] and linguists. American philosopher [[John Searle]] called it a "remarkable intellectual achievement" of its time. He compared the book "to the work of [[Keynes]] or [[Freud]]". He credited it with producing not only a "revolution in linguistics", but also having a "revolutionary effect" on "[[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]".&lt;ref name="Searle 1972"/&gt; Chomsky and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], a stridently anti-mentalistic philosopher of language, debated many times on the merit of Chomsky's linguistic theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many philosophers supported Chomsky's idea that natural languages are [[Psychological nativism#Language|innate]] and syntactically rule-governed. They also believed in the existence of rules in the human mind which bind meanings to [[utterance]]s. The investigation of these rules started a new era in [[philosophical semantics]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Stokhof|2012|p=548}} writes: "That natural languages are indeed not systematic enough to allow formal treatment&amp;nbsp;... is&amp;nbsp;... a complaint that has been leveled against natural languages by philosophers for centuries. The work of Chomsky in generative linguistics apparently inspired much more confidence in philosophers and logicians to assert that perhaps natural languages weren't as unsystematic and misleading as their philosophical predecessors had made them out to be&amp;nbsp;... at the end of 1960s formal semantics began to flourish."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Davidson|1967}} writes: "Recent work by Chomsky and others is doing much to bring the complexities of natural languages within the scope of serious semantic theory".&lt;/ref&gt;
;Computer science
With its formal and logical treatment of language, ''Syntactic Structures'' also brought linguistics and the new field of [[computer science]] closer together. Computer scientist [[Donald Knuth]] (winner of the [[Turing Award]]) recounted that he read ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1961 and was influenced by it.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From the preface of {{harvnb|Knuth|2003}}: "...&amp;nbsp;researchers in linguistics were beginning to formulate rules of grammar that were considerably more mathematical than before. And people began to realize that such methods are highly relevant to the artificial languages that were becoming popular for computer programming, even though natural languages like English remained intractable. I found the mathematical approach to grammar immediately appealing—so much so, in fact, that I must admit to taking a copy of Noam Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' along with me on my honeymoon in 1961. During odd moments, while crossing the Atlantic in an ocean liner and while camping in Europe, I read that book rather thoroughly and tried to answer some basic theoretical questions. Here was a marvelous thing: a mathematical theory of language in which I could use a computer programmer's intuition! The mathematical, linguistic, and algorithmic parts of my life had previously been totally separate. During the ensuing years those three aspects became steadily more intertwined; and by the end of the 1960s I found myself a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, primarily because of work that I had done with respect to languages for computer programming."&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's "Three models" paper ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1956}}), published a year prior to the ''Syntactic Structures'' and containing many of its ideas, was crucial to the development of the theory of [[formal languages]] within computer science.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Boden|2006|p=648}} writes:"[Papers like the "Three Models"] had a huge, lasting influence on pure computer science" and that they are cited in "virtually every introduction to compiler design". {{harvnb|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=9}} states that "Chomsky's notion of a context-free grammar&amp;nbsp;... has aided immensely the specification of programming languages."&lt;/ref&gt;
;Neuroscience
In 2011, a group of French neuroscientists conducted research to verify if actual brain mechanisms worked in the way that Chomsky suggested in ''Syntactic Structures''. The results suggested that specific regions of the brain handle syntactic information in an abstract way. These are independent from other brain regions that handle semantic information. Moreover, the brain analyzes not just mere strings of words, but hierarchical structures of constituents. These observations validated the theoretical claims of Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pallier|Devauchelle|Dehaene|2011|pp=2522&amp;ndash;2527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]] at [[New York University]] conducted experiments to verify if the human brain uses "hierarchical structure building" for processing languages. They measured the magnetic and electric activities in the brains of participants. The results showed that "[human] brains distinctly tracked three components of the phrases they heard." This   "[reflected] a hierarchy in our [[Neurolinguistics|neural processing]] of linguistic structures: words, phrases, and then sentences—at the same time." These results bore out Chomsky's hypothesis in ''Syntactic Structures'' of an "internal grammar mechanism" inside the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chomsky Was Right, NYU Researchers Find: We Do Have a "Grammar" in Our Head | website=New York University | url=http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/december/chomsky-was-right-nyu-researchers-find-we-do-have-a-grammar-in-our-head.html | accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
;Erroneous idealization
In his 1964 presidential address to the [[Linguistic Society of America]], American linguist [[Charles Hockett]] considered ''Syntactic Structures'' one of "only four major breakthroughs in modern linguistics".&lt;ref name="hockett" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The other three are [[Sir William Jones]]'s address to the Asiatic Society in 1786, [[Karl Verner]]'s ''Eine Ausnahme der ersten Lautverschiebung'' in 1875 and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de Linguistique Générale]]'' in 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; But he rapidly turned into a fierce critic of Chomskyan linguistics. By 1966, Hockett rejected "[Chomsky's] frame of reference in almost every detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hockett|1966|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1968 book ''The State of the Art'', Hockett writes that Chomsky's main [[fallacy]] is that he treats language as a [[Formal science|formal]], well-defined, stable system and proceeds from this idealized [[abstraction]]. Hockett believes such an idealization is not possible. He claims that there is no [[Empiricism|empirical evidence]] that our [[language faculty]] is, in reality, a well-defined underlying system. The sources that give rise to language faculty in humans, e.g. physical [[genetic transmission]] and cultural transmission, are themselves poorly defined.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{harvnb|Hockett|1968|p=83}} states:  "we must not promote our more or less standardized by-and-large characterization of the language to the status of a monolithic ideal, nor infer that because we can achieve a fixed characterization some such monolithic ideal exists, in the lap of [[God]] or in the brain of each individual speaker."&lt;/ref&gt; Hockett also opposed Chomsky's hypothesis that syntax is completely independent of the study of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hockett|1968|pp=67–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Non-empiricism
Contrary to Hockett, British linguist [[Geoffrey Sampson]] thought that Chomsky's assumptions about a well-defined grammaticality are "[justified] in practice." It brought syntax "within the purview of scientific description". He considers it a "great positive contribution to the discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|1980|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he maintains that Chomsky's linguistics is overly "[[intuition]]-based". For him, it relies too much on native speakers' subjective [[Introspection|introspective]] judgments about their own language. Consequently, language data empirically observed by impersonal third parties are given less importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=5}}, {{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=10}} and {{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Influence of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''
According to Sampson, ''Syntactic Structures'' largely owes its good fortune of becoming the dominant theoretical paradigm in the following years to the charisma of Chomsky's intellect. Sampson writes that there are many references in ''Syntactic Structures'' to Chomsky's own ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (LSLT) in matters regarding the formal underpinnings of Chomsky's approach, but ''LSLT'' was not widely available in print for decades. Nevertheless, Sampson's argument runs, ''Syntactic Structures'', albeit "sketchy", derived its "aura of respectability" from ''LSLT'' lurking in the background. In turn, the acceptance of Chomsky's future works rested on the success of ''Syntactic Structures''.&lt;ref name="Sampson 2001 152"/&gt; In the view of British-American linguist [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]], ''Syntactic Structures'' boldly claims that "it is impossible, not just difficult" for finite-state devices to generate all grammatical sentences of English, and then alludes to ''LSLT'' for the "rigorous proof" of this. But in reality, ''LSLT'' does not contain a valid, convincing proof dismissing finite-state devices.&lt;ref name="Pullum 2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Pullum|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Originality
Pullum also remarks that the "originality" of ''Syntactic Structures'' is "highly overstated". For him, it "does not properly credit the earlier literature on which it draws".&lt;ref name="Pullum 2011"/&gt; He shows in detail how the approach in ''Syntactic Structures'' goes directly back to the work of the mathematical logician [[Emil Post]] on formalizing [[Mathematical proof|proof]]. But "few linguists are aware of this, because Post's papers are not cited."&lt;ref name="Pullum 2011"/&gt; Pullum adds that the use of formal [[axiomatic system]]s to generate probable sentences in language in a [[Top-down parsing|top-down]] manner was first proposed by [[Zellig Harris]] in 1947, ten years before the publication of ''Syntactic Structures''. This is downplayed in ''Syntactic Structures''.&lt;ref name="Pullum 2011"/&gt;
;Necessity of transformations
In 1982, Pullum and another British linguist [[Gerald Gazdar]] argued that Chomsky's criticisms of [[Context-free grammar|context-free phrase structure grammar]] in ''Syntactic Structures'' are either mathematically flawed or based on incorrect assessments of the empirical data. They stated that a purely phrase structure treatment of grammar can explain linguistic phenomena better than one that uses transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pullum|Gazdar|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Versions of such non-transformational phrase structure grammars include [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG), [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG) and [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In 2000, [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Cognitive Sciences compiled a list of the 100 most influential works in [[cognitive science]] from the 20th century. In total, 305 scholarly works and one movie were nominated via the internet. ''Syntactic Structures'' was ranked number one on this list, marking it as the most influential work of cognitive science of the century.&lt;ref name="cogsci" group="note"&gt;See the list of the 100 most influential works in cognitive science from the 20th century online here: https://web.archive.org/web/20040821111702/http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/final.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syntactic Structures'' was included in ''[[The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]]'', a book on intellectual history by British literary critic and biographer [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seymour-Smith|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syntactic Structures'' was also featured in a list of 100 best English language non-fiction books since 1923 picked by the American weekly magazine [[Time Magazine|Time]].&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/syntactic-structures-by-noam-chomsky/ |title=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books : Syntactic Structures |last=Grossman |first=Lev |publisher= |date=17 August 2016 |website=Time |access-date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Culture of Nakedness and the Nakedness of Culture'' deals with the issues of [[women's rights]] and the wearing of the [[hijab]] by [[Muslim]] women according to Islamic teachings and traditions. According to [[Babar Awan]], this is a "controversial subject" and has various effects both within Islamic societies and the West.&lt;ref name="PK"/&gt; It addresses the importance of [[hijab]] for Islamic societies and argues that a "society's culture determines its dress style".&lt;ref name="Shahidian"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shahidian|first1=Hammed|title=Women in Iran: Gender Politics in the Islamic republic|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780313314766|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXnmC1UPykQC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Culture of Nakedness and the Nakedness of Culture'' discusses the effects of various factors on the form and size of clothing, without investigating those effects or discussing the quality and limits of clothing from a religious viewpoint. The relationship between Western clothing and culture, [[capitalism]] and clothing, historical backgrounds on nudity, the relationship between the hijab and Islamic culture, and the [[Westernization]] of traditional Japanese clothing, are among the subjects discussed in the book.&lt;ref name="Fars"&gt;{{cite news|title=The book 'Culture of Nudity and Nudity of Culture' reached its 23th print|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13930318000731|accessdate=30 December 2016|work=Fars News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing "the dress philosophy in post-[[Renaissance]] Europe and non-Western societies", Haddad-Adel argues that "Western clothes are short and tight", while Eastern clothing is "long and loose", because these societies have "divergent notions of humankind".&lt;ref name="Shahidian"/&gt;

==Reception==
The book's launch event was held by the National Language Authority of [[Pakistan]]. According to Fateh Malik, Dean of Faculty, Islamic University of Pakistan, the book was much needed in Pakistan’s present socio-cultural environment.&lt;ref name="PK"/&gt; The book is described by Zahra Pamela Karimi, a professor of art history at [[UMass Dartmouth]],&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marya|first1=Hannun|title=A guide to Iran’s elite eight presidential candidates|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/23/a-guide-to-irans-elite-eight-presidential-candidates/|access-date=9 February 2017|work=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the best examples articulating the anti "Western Pahlavi reforms and global influences" in Iran whose ideas were based on the "dichotomies of 'public' and 'private' and 'foreign' and 'local'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karimi|first1=Zahra Pamela|title=Domesticity and Consumer Culture in Iran: Interior Revolutions of the Modern Era|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780415781831|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gRKGSjBwcwC&amp;pg=PA156|access-date=6 February 2017|language=en|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad-Adel supports "the concealment of women's bodies as a way to protect the larger society from the manipulation of capitalism and imperialism", according to Pamela Karimi. According to Karimi, he tried to "catch up with modernity and yet indigenize it through Islam".&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

[[Image:FeuerbachTitlepage1848.jpg|right|thumb|Title page, second edition (1848).]]
'''''The Essence of Christianity''''' ({{lang-de|Das Wesen des Christentums}}; historical orthography: ''Das Weſen des Chriſtenthums'') is a book by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] first published in 1841. It explains Feuerbach's [[philosophy]] and [[critique of religion]].

== Influence ==

The book is often considered a classic of [[humanism]] and the author's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were strongly influenced by the book, although they criticised Feuerbach for his inconsistent espousal of [[materialism]]. Feuerbach's theory of [[Social alienation|alienation]] would later be used by Marx in his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]. [[Max Stirner]] directed his ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' against it. Rather than simply a polemic, Stirner's work uses Feuerbach's idea of God as a human abstraction as the basis of his critique of Feuerbach.

== In the consciousness of the infinite ==

Feuerbach's theme was a derivation of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] speculative theology in which the Creation remains a part of the Creator, while the Creator remains greater than the Creation. When the student Feuerbach presented his own theory to professor Hegel, Hegel refused to reply positively to it.

In Part I of his book, Feuerbach developed what he calls the "true or anthropological essence of religion." Treating of God in his various aspects "as a being of the understanding," "as a moral being or law," "as love" and so on.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Feuerbach, Ludwig Andreas |volume=10 |pages=302–303 |first=Henry |last=Sturt |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feuerbach talks of how man is equally a conscious being, more so than God because man has placed upon God the ability of understanding. Man contemplates many things and in doing so he becomes acquainted with himself. Feuerbach shows that in every aspect God corresponds to some feature or need of human nature. "If man is to find contentment in God," he claims, "he must find himself in God."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Thus God is nothing else than man: he is, so to speak, the outward projection of man's inward nature.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This projection is dubbed as a chimera by Feuerbach, that God and the idea of a higher being is dependent upon the aspect of benevolence. Feuerbach states that, "a God who is not benevolent, not just, not wise, is no God", and continues to say that qualities are not suddenly denoted as divine because of their godly association. The qualities themselves are divine therefore making God divine, indicating that man is capable of understanding and applying meanings of divinity to religion and not that religion makes a man divine.

The force of this attraction to religion though, giving divinity to a figure like God, is explained by Feuerbach as God is a being that acts throughout man in all forms. God, "is the principle of [man's] salvation, of [man's] good dispositions and actions, consequently [man's] own good principle and nature". It appeals to man to give qualities to the idol of their religion because without these qualities a figure such as God would become merely an object, its importance would become obsolete, there would no longer be a feeling of an existence for God. Therefore, Feuerbach says, when man removes all qualities from God, "God is no longer anything more to him than a negative being". Additionally, because man is imaginative, God is given traits and there holds the appeal. God is a part of man through the invention of a God. Equally though, man is repulsed by God because, "God alone is the being who acts of himself".

In part 2 he discusses the "false or theological essence of religion," ''i.e.'' the view which regards God as having a separate existence over against man. Hence arise various mistaken beliefs, such as the belief in revelation which he believes not only injures the moral sense, but also "poisons, nay destroys, the divinest feeling in man, the sense of truth," and the belief in sacraments such as the Lord's Supper, which is to him a piece of religious materialism of which "the necessary consequences are superstition and immorality."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A caustic criticism of Feuerbach was delivered in 1844 by [[Max Stirner]]. In his book ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' (''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'') he attacked Feuerbach as inconsistent in his [[atheism]]. (see External Links)

'''''The Mentor Philosophers''''' was a series of six books each covering a period of philosophical thought, published by the [[New American Library]].   Each book was edited by an esteemed contemporary philosophy academic and contained analysis of a group of philosophers from a chosen period.

The series was very influential during the 1950s and 1960s and went a number of editions in paperback.  Literary historian [[Gilbert Highet]] called it a "very important and interesting series".

'''''The Sound of Zen''''' is a 2002 solo [[shakuhachi]] album by [[Atsuya Okuda]].  The album contains recordings of six [[honkyoku]], the music of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] monks, played by Okuda.&lt;ref name="iss"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.komuso.com/albums/Sound_of_Zen,_The.html | title=Recording: Sound of Zen, The | author=The International Shakuhachi Society | accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Okuda has played shakuhachi since 1985 but until this album he refused to record his playing, believing that only live sound leads to an understanding of jinashi shakuhachi.&lt;ref name="shak"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shakuhachi.com/R-Shaku-Okuda.html | title=Atsuya Okuda - Shakuhachi Recordings | author=shakuhachi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CD was published by [[S-Two Corporation]].&lt;ref name="iss"/&gt;

'''Yuri Fyodorovich Samarin''' ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий Фёдорович Сама́рин}}; May 3, 1819, [[Saint Petersburg]] – March 31, 1876, [[Berlin]]) was a leading [[Russia]]n [[Slavophile]] thinker and one of the architects of the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]].

He came from a noble family and befriended [[Konstantin Aksakov]] from an early age. An ardent admirer of [[Hegel]] and [[Aleksey Khomyakov|Khomyakov]], Samarin attended the [[Moscow University]], where his teachers included [[Mikhail Pogodin]]. He came to believe that "[[Orthodoxy]], and Orthodoxy alone, is a religion which philosophy can recognize" and that "the Orthodox church cannot exist apart from Hegel's philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Samarin's words quoted from: V. V. Zenkovsky. ''A History of Russian Philosophy''. Vol. 1. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003. Page 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Samarin's dissertation was a study of [[Feofan Prokopovich]]'s influence on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. 

He later joined the government service and settled in [[Riga]], where the well entrenched influence of [[Baltic German]] nobility exasperated him to such a degree that he urged the government to step up [[Russification]] activities in the region. This outburst of [[chauvinism]] led to his brief imprisonment in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]. (Samarin's Slavophilism passed for [[Pan-Slavism]], which was viewed by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] as a "rebellious doctrine").

In his latter years, Samarin continued to write copiously on national and "peasant" questions, advocating the step-by-step abolition of [[serfdom in Russia|serfdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Field. ''The end of serfdom: nobility and bureaucracy in Russia, 1855-1861''. Harvard University Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[January Uprising]] he advised [[Nikolai Milyutin]] to support Polish peasantry as the embodiment of "the Slavic soul" of Poland at the expense of "the forces of Latinism",&lt;ref&gt;David L. Ransel, Bożena Shallcross. ''Polish Encounters, Russian Identity''. Indiana University Press, 2005. Page 93.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., rebellious nobility and [[Roman catholicism|Catholic]] clergy. He died in Berlin of [[sepsis]] and was buried next to Khomyakov in the [[Danilov Monastery]].

'''Đuro Arnold''' (24 March 1853 – 22 February 1941) was a [[Croatia]]n writer and [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name="PROLEKSIS"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/8207/ |contribution=Arnold, Đuro |title=[[Proleksis Encyclopedia]] |date=September 2013 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and study==
Arnold was born as the 19th of 24 children of Ivan, a [[tax gatherer]], and Sofija, née [[Vukanić]]. His ancestors arrived from [[Switzerland]] during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="HBL"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://hbl.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=856 |contribution=ARNOLD, Đuro |last=Flego |first=Višnja |author-link=Višnja Flego |last2=Kaminski |first2=Martin |author2-link=Martin Kaminski |title=[[Croatian Biographical Lexicon]] |year=1983 |volume=1 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Ivanec]] and spent his early childhood in [[Krapina]]. He attended [[primary school]] in [[Zagreb]], and high school in [[Varaždin]] and Zagreb, where he graduated in 1873.

In 1874 he enrolled at the [[Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb]] majoring in [[philosophy]], with a minor in [[history]] and [[geography]]. During the [[Bosnian crisis]] he was recruited, and it was only in 1879 that he was hired as a professor in a Zagreb [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. In 1880 he was promoted as the first PhD in philosophy at the [[University of Zagreb]], with a thesis ''Ethics and history'' (''Etika i povijest''), which was published in 1879.&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt; He continued his studies at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1880), Berlin and Paris (1881/1882).

== Work ==
Since 1889 he served as the Director of the Royal Teacher's School. In 1894 he was appointed as a professor extraordinarius, and since 1896 as the full professor of theoretical and practical philosophy and pedagogy at the [[Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb]]. He retired in 1923. He was the dean of the Faculty of Arts in the periods of 1898-1899, and 1912-1913, and also the rector of the [[University of Zagreb]] in the period 1899-1900.

He was appointed as a corresponding member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 1891, and as a full member in 1899. He served as the president of [[Matica hrvatska]] in 1902–1909. In 1892 he became an honorary member of the Croatian Pedagogic-Literary Society, in 1924 a member of the Society of the Brothers of the Croatian Dragon, and an [[honorary citizen]] of [[Krapina]].&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;

==Writer==
As a writer, his work is a continuation of Croatia's romantic poetry in the tradition of [[August Šenoa]] and [[Franjo Marković]].&lt;ref name="PROLEKSIS"/&gt; His first appearance as a writer was the song ''Pri povratku'' ("On the way back", ''Vienac'', 1873, 49). He mostly published patriotic songs, romances and [[ballad]]s with themes from [[Croatian history]] and [[folklore]] (''Krapinske elegije'', ''Damjan Juda, knez dubrovački'', ''Kata Lovićeva'' etc.), as well as reflexive lyricism in publications such as [[Vienac]] (1873-1886, 1888-1891, 1893-1902 ), [[Hrvatska lipa]] (1875), [[Hrvatski dom]] (1876), [[Obzor]] (1898, 1900, 1901, 1904), [[Prosvjeta]] (1904–1913), [[Hrvatsko kolo]] (1905, 1906, 1908, 1930), [[Katolički list]] (1906, 1915, 1916), [[Hrvatska smotra]] (1907–1910, 1933), [[Hrvatsko pravo]] (1908, 1924), [[Koledar hrvatskoga katoličkoga narodnoga đaštva]] (1909, 1910), [[Serafinski perivoj]] (1909–1913), [[Književni prilog]] (1911, 1912, 1913–1915), [[Hrvatska (publication)|Hrvatska]] (1912, 1914, 1915), [[Hrvatska prosvjeta]] (1914–1918), [[Naša misao]] (1914, 1915 ), [[Jeka od Osijeka]] (1918, 1919), [[Vijenac]] (1923, 1925, 1927), [[Hrvatsko pravo]] (1924, 1925), [[Omladina]] (1924, 1925), [[Hranilovićeva spomenica]] (1925), [[Selo i grad]] (1928/1929, 1930, 1931), [[Hrvatski list]] (1939), [[Novo doba]] (1940) and others. He wrote a single short story ''Samo četvrt sata'' (Vienac, 1880, 15–18).&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;

He signed his works in codes and pseudonyms: ''A.'', ''G. A.'', ''Gj. A.'', ''Gj. A-d'', ''Gj. Ar.'', ''O. D.'', ''R. R.'', ''Ivančanin'', ''Georg Arnold''.&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt; He published several books of poems, and the poem ''Domovina'' has gained him popularity.&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt; His works were published in many anthologies, calendars and almanacs. The selection of his poetry was translated to [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Esperanto]], [[German language|German]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. He expressed his views on literature in talks at the Matica hrvatska conferences: ''Umjetnost prema znanosti'', ''Može li umjetnost zamijeniti vjeru'', ''Jedinstvena hrvatska narodna kultura'' (Glas Matice hrvatske, 1906, 1908, 1909).&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;

==Philosopher==
As a philosopher, he was influenced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] and [[Hermann Lotze]], representing the "spiritualist positivism" movement and the view that the knowledge of the world can be reached only by the combined efforts of [[science]], [[art]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref name="PROLEKSIS"/&gt;  He wrote on the fundamental questions of philosophy, which he defined as the science of "final causes and purposes of being".&lt;ref&gt;''Logika'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the treatise ''Zadnja bića'' ("Last beings", Rad JAZU, 1888, 93 ) he conceived a world composed from the variety of simple, immutable soullike "last beings" that are connected by the feeling of touch and hierarchically arranged according to different levels of awareness, with absolute consciousness, the [[God]], occupying the peak of the hierarchy.&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt; According to Arnold, faith represents the supreme stronghold of a man and the basic principle of harmony of his spiritual functions.&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=3953 |contribution=Arnold, Đuro (Gjuro) |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some opinions, in his later works such as ''O psihologiji bez duše'' and ''Monizam i kršćanstvo'' (Rad JAZU, 1909, 176 and 178) Arnold has abandoned his earlier philosophical views. Others such as [[Pavao Vuk-Pavlović]], [[Stjepan Matičević]] and [[Blaženka Despot]] however maintain that Arnold's philosophical view was uniform and consistent - spiritualist pluralism which doesn't completely exclude spiritualist [[monism]].&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;

Arnold is one of the founders of the Croatian philosophical terminology,&lt;ref name="PROLEKSIS"/&gt; having authored two influential high school textbooks (''Logika'' and ''Psihologija'') that were standard textbooks for more than thirty years.&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;

At Arnold's proposal, in 1896 the Pedagogical Seminar for theoretical and practical training of future secondary school teachers was founded at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. As a teacher, organizer of educational system, the first Professor of Pedagogy at the Faculty of Philosophy and the first head of the Pedagogical Seminar, has influenced many generations of teachers.&lt;ref name="HBL"/&gt;

Arnold died in Zagreb.
