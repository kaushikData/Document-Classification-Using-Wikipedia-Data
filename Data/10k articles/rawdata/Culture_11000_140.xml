The '''1946-S copper cent die clash''' is a [[numismatics|rare collectible coin]] of the [[United States]].

==Background==
This coin exhibits a [[mint-made errors#Die clash|die clash]] error in which the obverse image (the portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]) is partially transferred to the reverse die, and thus partially visible on the struck coins. This type of error was quite rare for the 1946-S copper cent: only six specimens are known to exist, so an uncirculated specimen could be valued at several thousand dollars. Two uncirculated coins are listed in private collectors' catalogs, while four circulated specimens are known to exist.

Pedagogical tools for teaching articulatory setting. In M. J. Solé &amp; D. Recasens (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 15th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences''. 1603–1606. Adelaide: Causal Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mompean|title=Voice and Linguistic Background|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_A_Mompean/publications?pubType=presentation|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the default position or standard settings of a speaker's organs of articulation when ready to speak. Different languages each have their own basis of articulation, which means that native speakers will share a certain position of tongue, lips, jaw, possibly even uvula or larynx, when preparing to speak. These standard settings enable them to produce the sounds and prosody of their native language more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Celce-Murcia, D. Brinton and J. Goodwin (1996) ''Teaching Pronunciation'', Cambridge University Press pp 27-8&lt;/ref&gt; Honikman suggests thinking of it in terms of having a "gear" for English, another for French, and so on depending on which language is being learned; in the classroom, when working on pronunciation, the first thing the learner must do is to think themselves into the right gear before starting on pronunciation exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Honikman, B. (1964) 'Articulatory Settings' in ''In Honour of Daniel Jones'', eds. D. Abercrombie et al, Longman, pp 73-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner (2001) gives a detailed account of how this idea arose and how Honikman has been credited with its invention despite a considerable history of prior study.&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, B. (2001) 'Articulatory setting:genealogies of an idea', ''Historiographia Linguistica'' 28:121-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Different accents within a given language may have their own characteristic basis of articulation, resulting in one accent being perceived as, e.g., more 'nasal', 'velarized' or 'guttural' than another. According to Cruttenden, "The articulatory setting of a language or dialect may differ from GB [General British]. So some languages like Spanish may have a tendency to hold the tongue more forward in the mouth, while others like Russian may have a tendency to hold it further back in the mouth. Nasalization may be characteristic of many speakers of American English, while denasal voice ... is frequently said to occur in Liverpool".&lt;ref&gt;Cruttenden, A. (2014) ''Gimson's Pronunciation of English'', Routledge, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed exposition can be read in Gili Gaya (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gili Gaya|first=Samuel|year=1956|chapter=Base de articulación|title=Elementos de fonética general|edition=5th|language=Spanish|location=Madrid|publisher=Editorial Gredos}} [http://www.peterroach.net/basis-of-articulation.html English translation] by Emilio Márquez.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native speakers typically find the basis of articulation one of the greatest challenges in acquiring a foreign language's pronunciation. Speaking with the basis of articulation of their own native language results in a foreign accent, even if the individual sounds of the target language are produced correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messum|first=Piers|year=2010|title=Understanding and teaching the English articulatory setting|journal=Speak Out! (IATEFL Pronunciation Special Interest Group Newsletter)|issue=43|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Basis of articulation'' is used in a slightly different sense to refer to a hypothesized articulatory "baseline" which is neutral in respect of individual vowels and consonants. This is done in the phonetic framework section of Chomsky and Halle (1968) for the purposes of explaining various distinctive features in terms of their deviation from the neutral position.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. and Halle, M. (1968) ''The Sound Pattern of English''&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Odden has written "...some features are characterized in terms of the 'neutral position' which is a configuration that the vocal tract is assumed to have immediately prior to speaking. The neutral position, approximately that of the vowel [ɛ], defines relative movement of the tongue”&lt;ref&gt;Odden, D. (2005) ''Introducing Phonology'', Cambridge University Press, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if this should be taken to refer only to English.

'''Biological control''' or '''biocontrol''' is a method of [[pest control|controlling pests]] such as [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[weed]]s and [[phytopathology|plant diseases]] [[bioeffector|using other organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Flint, Maria Louise |author2=Dreistadt, Steve H. |last-author-amp=yes |editor=Clark, Jack K. |title=Natural Enemies Handbook: The Illustrated Guide to Biological Pest Control |publisher=University of California Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-520-21801-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBJvpMqcV9UC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515072525/https://books.google.com/books?id=FBJvpMqcV9UC |archivedate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on [[predation]], [[parasitism]], [[herbivory]], or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It can be an important component of [[integrated pest management]] (IPM) programs.

There are three basic strategies for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is introduced in the hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jenny.tfrec.wsu.edu/opm/displaySpecies.php?pn=-40 |title=Biological control |last=Unruh |first=Tom R. |date=1993 |website=Orchard Pest Management Online, Washington State University |access-date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural enemies of insect pests, also known as biological control agents, include predators, [[parasitoid]]s, [[pathogen]]s, and [[Competition (biology)|competitors]]. Biological control agents of [[plant disease]]s are most often referred to as antagonists. Biological control agents of weeds include seed predators, [[herbivore]]s and plant pathogens.

Biological control can have side-effects on [[biodiversity]] through attacks on non-target species by any of the same mechanisms, especially when a species is introduced without thorough understanding of the possible consequences.

==History==

The term "biological control" was first used by Harry Scott Smith at the 1919 meeting of the Pacific Slope Branch of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, in [[Riverside, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biocontrol.ucr.edu/hoddle/harrysmithfund.html |title=Biological Control: Harry Smith Fund |accessdate=2 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421234114/http://biocontrol.ucr.edu/hoddle/harrysmithfund.html |archivedate=21 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was brought into more widespread use by the entomologist Paul H. DeBach (1914–1993) who worked on citrus crop pests throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventory of the Paul H. DeBach Papers, 1921–1989 (bulk 1955–1980) |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt2c60258h/ |publisher=Online Archive of California |accessdate=7 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408081537/http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark%3A/13030/kt2c60258h/ |archivedate= 8 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DeBach P., Hagen K. S. |date=1964 |title=Manipulation of entomophagous species |pages=429–458 |editor=P. DeBach |work=Biological control of insect pests and weeds |publisher=Reinhold}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice has previously been used for centuries. The first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from "[[Nanfang Caomu Zhuang]]" (南方草木狀 ''Plants of the Southern Regions'') (ca. 304 AD), attributed to [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Western Jin dynasty]] botanist ''Ji Han'' (嵇含, 263–307), in which it is mentioned that "''[[Jiaozhi]] people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes, the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal. Without such ants, southern citrus fruits will be severely insect-damaged''".&lt;ref name="http-server.carleton.ca"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://http-server.carleton.ca/~bgordon/Rice/papers/peng83.htm |title=Biological Control – One Of The Fine Traditions Of Ancient Chinese Agricultural Techniques |author=Peng, Shijiang |journal=Scientia Agricultura Sinica |date=1983 |volume=1 |pages=92–98 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220073341/http://http-server.carleton.ca/~bgordon/Rice/papers/peng83.htm |archivedate=2016-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants used are known as ''huang gan'' (''huang'' = yellow, ''gan'' = citrus) ants (''[[Oecophylla smaragdina]]''). The practice was later reported by Ling Biao Lu Yi (late [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] or Early [[Five Dynasties]]), in ''Ji Le Pian'' by ''Zhuang Jisu'' ([[Song Dynasty|Southern Song Dynasty]]), in the ''Book of Tree Planting'' by Yu Zhen Mu ([[Ming Dynasty]]), in the book ''Guangdong Xing Yu'' (17th century), ''Lingnan'' by Wu Zhen Fang (Qing Dynasty), in ''Nanyue Miscellanies'' by Li Diao Yuan, and others.&lt;ref name="http-server.carleton.ca"/&gt;

Biological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the US, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites ''Tyroglyphus phylloxera'' to help fight the grapevine phylloxera ([[Phylloxera|''Daktulosphaira vitifoliae'']]) that was destroying grapevines in France. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid ''[[Cotesia glomerata]]'' in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, ''[[Pieris rapae]]''. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, ''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'', a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, ''[[Icerya purchasi]]''. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, but by the end of 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.&lt;ref name="Coulson J. R. 2000"&gt;Coulson, J. R.; Vail, P. V.; Dix M.E.; Nordlund, D.A.; Kauffman, W.C.; Eds. 2000. 110 years of biological control research and development in the United States Department of Agriculture: 1883–1993.

In 1905 the USDA initiated its first large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth, ''[[Lymantria dispar dispar]]'', and brown-tail moth, [[Brown-tail|''Euproctis chrysorrhoea'']], invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also led to the development of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.&lt;ref name="Coulson J. R. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reardon |first1=Richard C. |title=Biological Control of The Gypsy Moth: An Overview |url=http://www.main.nc.us/SERAMBO/BControl/gypsy.html#conclu |website=Southern Appalachian Biological Control Initiative Workshop |accessdate=10 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905052259/http://www.main.nc.us/SERAMBO/BControl/gypsy.html |archivedate= 5 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Larvaefeedingoncacti.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Cactoblastis cactorum]]'' larvae feeding on ''[[Opuntia]]'' prickly pear cacti]]

[[Opuntia|Prickly pear cacti]] were introduced into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant, the cactus moth ''[[Cactoblastis cactorum]]'', and the scale insect ''[[Dactylopius]]''. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/55301/IPA-Prickly-Pear-Story-PP62.pdf |title=The Prickly Pear Story |publisher=Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Queensland |accessdate=7 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610135855/https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/55301/IPA-Prickly-Pear-Story-PP62.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in Canada involves the parasitoidal wasp ''Trichogramma minutum''. Individuals were caught in New York State and released in Ontario gardens in 1882 by William Saunders, trained chemist and first Director of the Dominion Experimental Farms, for controlling the invasive currantworm ''[[Nematus ribesii]]''. Between 1884 and 1908, the first Dominion Entomologist, James Fletcher, continued introductions of other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McLeod J.

==Types of biological pest control==
There are three basic biological pest control strategies: importation (classical biological control), augmentation and conservation.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/what.html |publisher=Cornell University |title=What is Biological Control? |accessdate=7 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613054724/http://www.biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/what.html |archivedate=13 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vedalia Beetle (15959056801).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'', the vedalia beetle, was imported from Australia to California in the 19th century, successfully controlling [[cottony cushion scale]].]]

Importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.&lt;ref name="Classical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Biological Control: Importation of New Natural Enemies |url=http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea103.html |publisher=University of Wisconsin |accessdate=7 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613023600/http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea103.html |archivedate=13 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be most effective at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.&lt;ref name=follett&gt;{{cite book |author=Follett, P. A.; Duan, J. J. |date=2000 |title=Nontarget effects of biological control |publisher=Kluwer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Needham]] noted a Chinese text dating from 304 AD, ''Records of the Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions'', by Hsi Han, which describes mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants which attack and kill insect pests of the orange trees.

One of the earliest successes in the west was in controlling ''[[Icerya purchasi]]'' (cottony cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect ''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'' (the vedalia beetle).

Damage from ''[[Hypera postica]]'', the alfalfa weevil, a serious introduced pest of forage, was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies. 20 years after their introduction the population of [[weevil]]s in the [[alfalfa]] area treated for alfalfa weevil in the [[Northeastern United States]] remained 75 percent down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Manage Pests.

===Augmentation===

[[File:Lady bugs are a beneficial insect commonly sold for biological control of aphids..jpg|thumb|''[[Hippodamia convergens]]'', the convergent lady beetle, is commonly sold for biological control of [[aphids]].]]

Augmentation involves the supplemental release of natural enemies that occur in a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.&lt;ref name="Augmentation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Augmentation: The Periodic Release of Natural Enemies |url=http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea104.html |publisher=University of Wisconsin |accessdate=7 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317104655/http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea104.html |archivedate=17 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of inoculative release occurs in the horticultural production of several crops in [[greenhouse]]s. Periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp, ''[[Encarsia formosa]]'', are used to control greenhouse [[whitefly]],&lt;ref name=Hoddle1998/&gt; while the predatory mite ''[[Phytoseiulus persimilis]]'' is used for control of the two-spotted spider mite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biological control.

The egg parasite ''[[Trichogramma]]'' is frequently released inundatively to control harmful moths. Similarly, ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' and other microbial insecticides are used in large enough quantities for a rapid effect.&lt;ref name="Augmentation"/&gt; Recommended release rates for ''Trichogramma'' in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according to the level of pest infestation.&lt;ref name="Peter2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peter |first=K.

Nematodes (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae &amp; Heterorhabditidae) |url=http://www.biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/pathogens/nematodes.php |author1=Shapiro-Ilan, David I |author2=Gaugler, Randy |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=7 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215090802/http://www.biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/pathogens/nematodes.php |archivedate=15 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===

The conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control.&lt;ref name="Conservation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation of Natural Enemies: Keeping Your "Livestock" Happy and Productive |url=http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea201.html |publisher=University of Wisconsin |accessdate=7 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318120526/http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea201.html |archivedate=18 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Natural enemies are already adapted to the [[habitat]] and to the target pest, and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gurr | first=Geoff M. | title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture | journal=Nature Plants | date=22 February 2016 | language=English | url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614 | doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 | pmid=27249349 | volume=2 | issue=3 | page=16014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators of aphids were similarly found to be present in tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;

[[File:Dermaptera flowerpot.jpg|thumb|An inverted flowerpot filled with straw to attract [[Dermaptera|earwigs]]]]

Cropping systems can be modified to favor natural enemies, a practice sometimes referred to as habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a [[Windbreak|shelterbelt]], [[hedgerow]], or [[beetle bank]] where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as [[hedgehog]]s and [[shrew]]s. [[Compost pile]]s and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and [[pond]]s support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruberson, John R. |title=Handbook of Pest Management |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b-9sIMbz38C&amp;pg=PA428 |year=1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-9433-0 |pages=428–432 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410235857/https://books.google.com/books?id=9b-9sIMbz38C&amp;pg=PA428 |archivedate=2017-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=L.

For example, [[Dermaptera|earwigs]] are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with [[straw]] or [[wood wool]]. Green [[lacewings]] can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In cotton production, the replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as [[Bt cotton]] can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or [[parasitoids]] can control pests not affected by the [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt protein]]. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naranjo|first1=Steven E.|title=Impacts of Transgenic Cotton on Integrated Pest Management|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=8 June 2011|volume=59|issue=11|pages=5842–5851|doi=10.1021/jf102939c|pmid=20942488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological control agents==

===Predators===
[[File:Chrysopidae 3035.jpg|thumb|left|[[Predator]]y [[Chrysopidae|lacewings]] are available from biocontrol dealers.]]

Predators are mainly free-living species that directly consume a large number of [[prey]] during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. [[Ladybugs|Lady beetles]], and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of [[aphid]]s, and also consume [[mites]], [[scale insect]]s and small [[caterpillar]]s. The spotted lady beetle (''[[Coleomegilla maculata]]'') is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the [[Colorado potato beetle]] (''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Acorn, John |title=Ladybugs of Alberta: Finding the Spots and Connecting the Dots |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7r8Xjx6d7FcC&amp;pg=PA15 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Alberta |isbn=978-0-88864-381-0 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larvae of many [[hoverfly]] species principally feed upon [[aphid]]s, one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime. Their effectiveness in commercial crops has not been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Know Your Friends.

Not all biological control agents are directed at crop pests. For instance, there are both traditional and technological strategies for controlling urban pests. A traditional example comes from the control of mice infestations using cats. For [[Rodent#As pests and disease vectors|rodent pests]], [[cat]]s are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of [[Refuge (ecology)|"harborage"/hiding]] locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-abstract/38/4/466/833606?redirectedFrom=fulltext |title=The Use of Food as a Buffer in a Predator-Prey System |first=David E. |last=Davis |date=20 November 1957 |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=466–472 |accessdate=11 November 2017 |doi=10.2307/1376399 |jstor=1376399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambert"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD| last1=Lambert |first1=Mark |title=Control Of Norway Rats In The Agricultural Environment: Alternatives To Rodenticide Use|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/27745/1/2003LambertMSPhD.pdf |publisher=University of Leicester |pages=85–103 |format=Thesis |date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wodzicki"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prospects for biological control of rodent populations |first=Kazimierz |last=Wodzicki |date=11 November 1973 |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=461–467 |accessdate=|pmid=4587482 |pmc=2481104}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cats are effective at preventing rodent [[Irruptive growth|"population explosions"]], they are not effective for eliminating pre-existing severe infestations.&lt;ref name="Wodzicki"/&gt; [[Barn owls]] are also sometimes used as biological rodent control.&lt;ref name=Charter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owls.org/conservation/ewExternalFiles/barn_owls_in_israel.pdf |title=Using barn owls (''Tyto alba erlangeri'') for biological pest control in Israel |author=Charter, Motti |publisher=World Owl Trust |accessdate=11 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111095113/http://www.owls.org/conservation/ewExternalFiles/barn_owls_in_israel.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964416301256 |title=Are avian predators effective biological control agents for rodent pest management in agricultural systems? |first1=Lushka |last1=Labuschagne |first2=Lourens H. |last2=Swanepoel |first3=Peter J |last3=Taylor |first4=Steven R. |last4=Belmain |first5=Mark |last5=Keith |date=1 October 2016 |journal=Biological Control |volume=101 |issue=Supplement C |pages=94–102 |accessdate=11 November 2017 |doi=10.1016/j.biocontrol.2016.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4ddfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141 |title=Crop Protection in Medieval Agriculture: Studies in pre-modern organic agriculture |first=Jan C. |last=Zadoks |date=16 October 2013 |publisher=Sidestone Press |accessdate=11 November 2017 |via=Google Books|isbn=9789088901874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://attra.ncat.org/calendar/question.php/how_can_i_control_rodents_organically |title=How can I control rodents organically? |publisher=ATTRA - National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880916301293 |title=Agricultural land use, barn owl diet, and vertebrate pest control implications |first1=Sara M. |last1=Kross |first2=Ryan P. |last2=Bourbour |first3=Breanna L. |last3=Martinico |date=1 May 2016 |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment |volume=223 |issue=Supplement C |pages=167–174 |accessdate=11 November 2017 |via=ScienceDirect |doi=10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.barnowltrust.org.uk/barn-owl-facts/barn-owl-home-range/ |title=Barn Owl home range |publisher=The Barn Owl Trust |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since most cockroaches remain in the sewer system and sheltered areas which are inaccessible to insecticides, employing active-hunter wasps is a strategy to try and reduce their populations.  
===Parasitoids===
{{main|parasitoid}}

Parasitoids lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect [[parasitoid]]s are [[Parasitoid wasp|wasps]] or [[Fly|flies]], and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the [[Ichneumonidae|ichneumonid wasps]], which mainly use [[caterpillar]]s as hosts; [[Braconidae|braconid wasps]], which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; [[chalcid wasp]]s, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and [[Tachinidae|tachinid flies]], which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, [[beetle]] adults and larvae, and [[Hemiptera|true bugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parasitoid Wasps (Hymenoptera) |url=https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/insects/parasitoid-wasps-hymenoptera |publisher=University of Maryland |accessdate=6 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827072031/https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/insects/parasitoid-wasps-hymenoptera |archivedate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parasitoids are most effective at reducing pest populations when their host organisms have limited [[refuge (ecology)|refuges]] to hide from them.&lt;ref name="HawkinsThomas1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=B.

Parasitoids are among the most widely used biological control agents. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term, low daily output systems.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, S.M. |date=1996 |title=Biological control with Trichogramma: advances, successes, and potential of their use |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=41 |pages=375–406 |pmid=15012334 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.41.010196.002111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most instances, production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Knoll, Valery; Ellenbroek, Thomas; Romeis, Jörg; Collatz, Jana |year=2017 |title=Seasonal and regional presence of hymenopteran parasitoids of ''Drosophila'' in Switzerland and their ability to parasitize the invasive ''Drosophila suzukii'' |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=40697 |pages=40697 |doi=10.1038/srep40697 |pmid=28098183 |pmc=5241644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sithanantham, S. |author2=Ballal, Chandish R. |author3=Jalali, S.K. |author4=Bakthavatsalam, N. |title=Biological Control of Insect Pests Using Egg Parasitoids |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCO4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246 |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-81-322-1181-5 |page=246 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410133425/https://books.google.com/books?id=cCO4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246 |archivedate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

''[[Encarsia formosa]]'' is a small predatory [[chalcid wasp]] which is a parasitoid of [[whitefly]], a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and [[Sooty mold|black sooty moulds]] in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection over a long period of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate.&lt;ref name=Hoddle1998&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biology and Use of the Whitefly Parasitoid Encarsia Formosa |author1=Hoddle, M.

The [[Choristoneura fumiferana|eastern spruce budworm]] is an example of a destructive insect in [[fir]] and [[spruce]] forests. Birds are a natural form of biological control, but the ''Trichogramma minutum'', a species of parasitic wasp, has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.&lt;ref name="smith2"&gt;Smith, S.M.; Hubbes, M.; Carrow, J.R. 1986.

Entomol. 101(1):29–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathogens===
{{Further|biopesticide}}

Pathogenic micro-organisms include [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[viruses]]. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively host-specific. Various [[microbial]] insect diseases occur naturally, but may also be used as [[biological pesticide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/134na5.pdf Encouraging innovation in biopesticide development.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515143828/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/134na5.pdf |date=15 May 2012}} European Commission (2008).

====Bacteria====

Bacteria used for biological control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swan, L.A. |date=1964 |title=Beneficial Insects |publisher= |page= 249}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', a soil-dwelling bacterium, is the most widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against [[Lepidoptera]]n ([[moth]], [[butterfly]]), [[Coleoptera]]n (beetle) and [[Diptera]]n (true fly) insect pests.

==== Oomycota ====
''[[Lagenidium giganteum]]'' is a water-borne mould that parasitizes the larval stage of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This mould has the advantages of a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/pathogens/lagenidium.php |title=Biological control: ''Lagenidium giganteum'' |author=Kerwin, James L. |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=20 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620032211/http://www.biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/pathogens/lagenidium.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitors===
The [[legume]] vine ''[[Mucuna pruriens]]'' is used in the countries of [[Benin]] and [[Vietnam]] as a biological control for problematic ''[[Imperata cylindrica]]'' grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by [[Competition (biology)|out-competing]] them for space and light. ''Mucuna pruriens'' is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area.&lt;ref name="tropical"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tropicalforages.info/key/Forages/Media/Html/Mucuna_pruriens.htm |title=Factsheet – Mucuna pruriens |publisher=Tropical Forages |accessdate=21 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515210229/http://www.tropicalforages.info/key/Forages/Media/Html/Mucuna_pruriens.htm |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Desmodium]] [[Desmodium uncinatum|uncinatum]]'' can be used in [[push-pull technology|push-pull farming]] to stop the [[parasitic plant]], witchweed (''[[Striga (plant)|Striga]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Khan | first1=Z. | last2=Midega | first2=C.

The Australian bush fly, ''[[Musca vetustissima]]'', is a major nuisance pest in Australia, but native decomposers found in Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] (1965–1985), led by [[George Bornemissza]] of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]], released forty-nine species of [[dung beetle]], to reduce the amount of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.&lt;ref name="adbp"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bornemissza | first1=G. F. | year=1976 | title=The Australian dung beetle project 1965–1975 | journal=Australian Meat Research Committee Review | volume=30 | issue=| pages=1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined use of parasitoids and pathogens===
In cases of massive and severe infection of invasive pests, techniques of pest control are often used in combination. An example is the [[emerald ash borer]], ''[[Agrilus planipennis]]'', an invasive [[beetle]] from [[China]], which has destroyed tens of millions of [[ash trees]] in its introduced range in [[North America]]. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely ''Tetrastichus planipennisi'', a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, ''[[Oobius agrili]]'', a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and ''[[Spathius agrili]]'', a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the [[United States|United States of America]] as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for ''Tetrastichus planipennisi'' have shown promise, and it is now being released along with ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', a fungal [[pathogen]] with known insecticidal properties.&lt;ref name="APHIS"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gould |first=Juli |author2=Bauer, Leah |title=Biological Control of Emerald Ash Borer (''Agrilus planipennis'') |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/emerald_ash_b/downloads/eab-biocontrol.pdf |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=28 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110005023/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/emerald_ash_b/downloads/eab-biocontrol.pdf |archivedate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer |first1=L.S. |last2=Liu |first2=H.-P. |last3=Miller |first3=D. |last4=Gould |first4=J. |year=2008 |title=Developing a classical biological control program for Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), an invasive ash pest in North America |journal=Newsletter of the Michigan Entomological Society |volume=53 |issue=3&amp;4 |pages=38–39 |url=http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2008/nrs_2008_bauer_002.pdf |accessdate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004090830/http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2008/nrs_2008_bauer_002.pdf |archivedate= 4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110426111415.htm |title=Biocontrol: Fungus and Wasps Released to Control Emerald Ash Borer |date=26 April 2011 |website=Science News |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504012056/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110426111415.htm |archivedate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==
Many of the most important pests are exotic, invasive species that severely impact agriculture, horticulture, forestry and urban environments. They tend to arrive without their co-evolved
parasites, pathogens and predators, and by escaping from these, populations may soar. Importing the natural enemies of these pests may seem a logical move but this may have [[unintended consequences]]; regulations may be ineffective and there may be unanticipated effects on biodiversity, and the adoption of the techniques may prove challenging because of a lack of knowledge among farmers and growers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Messing, Russell H.; Wright, Mark G. |year=2006 |title=Biological control of invasive species: solution or pollution? |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=132–140 |doi= 10.1890/1540-9295(2006)004[0132:bcoiss]2.0.co;2|pmid= |pmc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233794457 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051543/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Wright6/publication/233794457_Biological_control_of_invasive_species_Solution_or_pollution/links/00b7d52cdb2f1a2810000000.pdf |archivedate=2017-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side effects===

Biological control can affect [[biodiversity]]&lt;ref name=follett/&gt; through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species.&lt;ref name=council&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council |date=1996 |title=Ecologically Based Pest Management:New Solutions for a New Century |publisher=The National Academies Press |url=https://www.nap.edu/read/5135/chapter/1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725125103/http://www.nap.edu/read/5135/chapter/1 |archivedate=2016-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An introduced control does not always target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Society for Conservation Biology |date=2002 |title=Biocontrol backfires again |url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/C/20025043.html |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014858/http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/C/20025043.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may have a negative impact on the native ecosystem; however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wright | first1=M.

[[File:Cane toad distribution stills.png|thumb|[[Cane toad]] (introduced into Australia 1935) spread from 1940 to 1980: it was ineffective as a control agent. Its distribution has continued to widen since 1980.]]

Vertebrate animals tend to be generalist feeders, and seldom make good biological control agents; many of the classic cases of "biocontrol gone awry" involve vertebrates. For example, the [[cane toad]] (''Rhinella marina'') was intentionally introduced to [[Australia]] to control the [[cane beetle|greyback cane beetle]] (''Dermolepida albohirtum''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cane Toad |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/canetoads/index.html |website=Exotic Animals – Major Pests |publisher=Northern Territory Government, Australia |accessdate=14 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315083841/http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/canetoads/index.html |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other pests of sugar cane. 102 toads were obtained from [[Hawaii]] and bred in captivity to increase their numbers until they were released into the sugar cane fields of the tropic north in 1935. It was later discovered that the toads could not jump very high and so were unable to eat the cane beetles which stayed on the upper stalks of the cane plants. However, the toad thrived by feeding on other insects and soon spread very rapidly; it took over native [[amphibian]] [[habitat]] and brought foreign disease to native [[toad]]s and [[frog]]s, dramatically reducing their populations. Also, when it is threatened or handled, the cane toad releases [[poison]] from [[parotoid gland]]s on its shoulders; native Australian species such as [[goanna]]s, [[tiger snake]]s, [[dingo]]s and [[northern quoll]]s that attempted to eat the toad were harmed or killed. However, there has been some recent evidence that native predators are adapting, both physiologically and through changing their behaviour, so in the long run, their populations may recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/publications/factsheet-cane-toad-bufo-marinus |title=The cane toad (''Bufo marinus'') |year=2010 |publisher=Australian Government: Department of the Environment |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712233540/http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/publications/factsheet-cane-toad-bufo-marinus |archivedate=12 July 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rhinocyllus conicus]]'', a seed-feeding weevil, was introduced to North America to control exotic [[Carduus nutans|musk thistle]] (''Carduus nutans'') and [[Cirsium arvense|Canadian thistle]] (''Cirsium arvense''). However, the weevil also attacks native thistles, harming such species as the [[Endemism|endemic]] [[Cirsium neomexicanum|Platte thistle]] (''Cirsium neomexicanum'') by selecting larger plants (which reduced the gene pool), reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species' survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rose, K.

The [[small Asian mongoose]] (''Herpestus javanicus'') was introduced to [[Hawaii]] in order to control the [[rat]] population. However, the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; the mongoose therefore preyed on the [[endemic birds of Hawaii]], especially their [[egg]]s, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mauiinvasive.org/2012/04/18/moving-on-from-the-mongoose-the-succuss-of-biological-control-in-hawaii/ |title=Moving on from the mongoose: the success of biological control in Hawai'i |date=18 April 2012 |website=Kia‘i Moku |publisher=MISC |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619021310/http://mauiinvasive.org/2012/04/18/moving-on-from-the-mongoose-the-succuss-of-biological-control-in-hawaii/ |archivedate=19 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sturdy and prolific [[eastern mosquitofish]] (''Gambusia holbrooki'') is a native of the southeastern United States and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and '40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat [[malaria]]. However, it has thrived at the expense of local species, causing a decline of endemic fish and frogs through competition for food resources, as well as through eating their eggs and larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

H. Arthington and L. L. Lloyd stated that "biological population control is well beyond present capabilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gambusia.net/ |title=Gambusia Control |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716125052/http://www.gambusia.net/ |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grower education===
A potential obstacle to the adoption of biological pest control measures is that growers may prefer to stay with the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thacker, J.R.M. |date=2002 |title=An Introduction to Arthropod Pest Control |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Charlet |first1=Larry |title=The Impact of Pesticides on Natural Enemies |url=http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea202.html |publisher=University of Wisconsin Department of Entomology |accessdate=9 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014222138/http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/fea202.html |archivedate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Heong | first1=K.

In 2016, poet [[Mahogany L. Browne]] created a [[poetry slam|slam poetry]] piece entitled "Black Girl Magic".&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/poet-mahogany-l-browne-on-black-girl-magic|title=Poet Mahogany L. Browne on ‘black girl magic’|date=February 25, 2016|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==

===Hashtag===

In 2013, Thompson coined the phrase via the [[hashtag]] #BlackGirlsAreMagic— now shortened to #BlackGirlMagic—to create an online dialogue centered around the achievements of black women, in a society that has historically recognized very few of these achievements.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Since being popularized, one can find the hashtag being used on [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and other social media and mainstream media platforms, celebrating positive messages and images of black women all across the globe.

=== Clothing campaign===

In January 2014, Thompson began selling t-shirts sporting the "Black Girls Are Magic" logo that she created with her friend.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; At the time, Thompson only meant to sell these shirts to her friends and family, but has since sold over 3,000 T-shirts through her Teespring account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= D'Oyley|first1=Demetria Lucas|title= Elle, You Just Don’t Understand #BlackGirlMagic.|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/01/elle_you_just_don_t_understand_blackgirlmagic/|accessdate=30 November 2016|work=TheWrap|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the popularity of the shirts started among active social media users, Thompson was quickly surprised to see that people were also buying them as gifts for granddaughters, daughters, and nieces, as they felt that the message was encouraging for young girls too.

The shirts have also gained some celebrity recognition, with prominent young black women such as [[Willow Smith]] and [[Amandla Stenberg]] posting pictures of themselves on various social media platforms wearing their Black Girls Are Magic gear.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Philosophy==

"I say 'magic' because it's something that people don't always understand," Thompson told [[Los Angeles Times|''The Los Angeles Times'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-everyones-saying-black-girls-are-magic-20150909-htmlstory.html|title=Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to explain how "Sometimes our accomplishments might seem to come out of thin air, because a lot of times, the only people supporting us are other black women." At its core, the purpose of this movement is to create a platform where women of color can stand together against the [[stereotyping]], [[colourism]], [[misogynoir]] and [[racism]] that is often their lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversy==

As its usage has grown, the concept has also drawn criticism.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

==="Black girls aren't magic. We're human." ===

While many black women support the concept of Black Girl Magic, some{{who?|date=November 2017}} feel it reinforces the "strong black woman" [[archetype]] that black women often confront. In an article for [[Elle (magazine)|Elle Magazine]], Linda Chavers argued that the movement suggests that black women are superhuman, or something other than human.&lt;ref name= ":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1= Chavers|first1=Linda|title= Here's My Problem With #BlackGirlMagic|url=http://www.elle.com/life-love/a33180/why-i-dont-love-blackgirlmagic//|accessdate=6 November 2016|work=Elle Magazine|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to explain how, historically, black women have been seen and treated as subhuman beings, and how the image of black women persevering despite her suffering, is the epitome of the strong black woman type that is often celebrated while simultaneously being criticized in today's culture.&lt;ref name= ":2"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2016, Black Girl Magic Ltd was established as an [[nonprofit organization]] in an attempt to create a legacy and continuity throughout the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10477476|title=BLACK GIRL MAGIC LTD - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scarification by Lestyn Flye.jpg|thumb|[[Scarification]] in progress]]
'''Body modification''' (or '''body alteration''') is the deliberate altering of the [[human anatomy]] or [[human physical appearance]].&lt;ref name='Thompson 2010'&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Thompson | first1 = Tim | last2 = Black | first2 = Sue | title = Forensic Human Identification: An Introduction | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | year = 2010 | pages = 379–398 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=2o6iyCnwmDEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2013-02-25 | isbn = 978-1420005714}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done for aesthetics, sexual enhancement, rites of passage, religious beliefs, to display group membership or affiliation, to create [[body art]], for [[shock value]], and as self-expression, among other reasons.&lt;ref name='Thompson 2010'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/whatisbodymod_pdv.htm|title=What Is Body Modification?|date=16 May 1986|work=Essortment|accessdate=20 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128093431/http://www.essortment.com/all/whatisbodymod_pdv.htm|archivedate=28 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its broadest [[definition]] it includes [[plastic surgery]], socially acceptable decoration (''e.g.'', common [[earring|ear piercing]] in many societies), and religious [[rites of passage]] (e.g., [[circumcision]] in a number of cultures), as well as the [[modern primitive]] movement.

Nullification involves the voluntary removal of body parts. Body parts that are commonly removed by those practicing body nullification are: [[penectomy|penis]], [[castration|testicles]], [[clitoris]], [[Labia (genitalia)|labia]] and [[nipple]]s. Sometimes people who desire a nullification may be diagnosed with [[gender identity disorder]], [[body integrity identity disorder]] or [[apotemnophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slweekly.com/index.cfm?do=article.details&amp;id=1CA812CA-2BF4-55D0-F1F09D9BE9B80EB9|title=Underground|publisher=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]]|author=Jamie Gadette|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015152/http://www.slweekly.com/index.cfm?do=article.details&amp;id=1CA812CA-2BF4-55D0-F1F09D9BE9B80EB9|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Penis enlargement#Jelqing|Jelqing]] - penis enlargement &lt;!-- no weights or spacing devices used --&gt;
*Non-surgical [[wikt:elongation|elongation]] of organs by prolonged stretching using weights or spacing devices. Some cultural traditions prescribe for or encourage members of one sex (or both) to have one organ stretched till permanent re-dimensioning has occurred, such as:
**The 'giraffe-like' stretched necks (sometimes also other organs) of women among the Burmese [[Kayan (Myanmar)|Kayan]] tribe, the result of wearing [[Neck ring|brass coils]] around them. This compresses the collarbone and upper ribs but is not medically dangerous. It is a myth that removing the rings will cause the neck to 'flop'; Padaung women remove them regularly for cleaning etc.

==Controversy==
"Disfigurement" and "mutilation" (regardless of any appreciation this always applies objectively whenever a bodily function is gravely diminished or lost) are terms used by opponents of body modification to describe certain types of modifications, especially non-consensual ones. Those terms are used fairly uncontroversially to describe the victims of [[torture]], who have endured damage to [[ear]]s, eyes, feet, [[genitalia]], [[hand]]s, [[human nose|noses]], [[teeth]], and/or [[tongue]]s, including [[amputation]], [[burn (injury)|burning]], [[flagellation]], [[piercing]], [[skinning]], and [[breaking wheel|wheeling]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

Some surgical procedures that modify human genitals are performed with the [[informed consent]] of the patient, using [[anesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/0315/p1514.html#sec-2|title=Adult Circumcision|author=John R. Holman-Keith A. Stuessi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/malecircumcision/who_mc_local_anaesthesia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "[[Genital modification and mutilation|Genital mutilation]]" is sometimes used to describe procedures that individuals are forced to undergo without their informed consent, or without anesthesia or sterilised surgical tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rationalising circumcision: from tradition to fashion, from public health to individual freedom—critical notes on cultural persistence of the practice of genital mutilation| pmc=1733870 | pmid=15173357|volume=30| issue=3 |date=June 2004|pages=248–53 | last1 = Hellsten | first1 = SK | journal=J Med Ethics | doi=10.1136/jme.2004.008888}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been applied to involuntary [[castration]], [[male circumcision]], and [[female genital mutilation]]. Intersex campaigners say that childhood modification of genitals of individuals with [[intersex]] conditions without their informed consent is a form of mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilchins|first=Riki|title=A Girl's Right to Choose: Intersex Children and Parents Challenge Narrow Standards of Gender|url=http://www.now.org/nnt/summer-2002/intersex.html|work=NOW Times|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many use body modification and self-mutilation interchangeably. In many ways self-mutilation is very different than body-modification. Body modification gives one the feeling of pride and excitement, giving one something to show off to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bradley University: Body Modification &amp; Body Image|url = http://www.bradley.edu/sites/bodyproject/disability/modification/|website = www.bradley.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, those who self-mutilate typically are ashamed of what they've done and want to hide any evidence of harm. Body modification is explored for adornment, self-expression, and an array of many other positive reasons, while self-mutilation is inflicted because of mental or emotional stress and the inability to cope with psychological pain. Those who self-mutilate do so in order to punish themselves, express internal turmoil, and reduce severe anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Self-injury/cutting Causes - Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/self-injury/basics/causes/con-20025897|website = www.mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2262">'''British studies''' is the academic study of [[Great Britain|Britain]] &amp;mdash; its [[British culture|culture]], geography and history.

Britain is significant as a topic because it was the location of the [[industrial revolution]]; the [[British Empire]] was large and influential in world history; and English is now a major international language.  The topic is especially studied in the USA as students there often have a heritage of British ancestry which encourages [[Anglophilia]] while the shared language of English makes British culture readily accessible.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/02/british-studies-american-academics |journal=[[The Guardian]] |title=British studies, the latest import from the US? |author=Zoë Corbyn |date=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the topic is a specialism of ''Kulturkunde'' and ''Landeskunde'' and there is a ''Journal for the Study of British Cultures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory |author1=Michael Payne |author2=Jessica Rae Barbera |pages=253–255 |isbn=978-1-4051-6890-8 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A course was started at the [[University of Texas]] in 1975 and, more recently, courses have started at other universities such as [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Yale]]&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; and the [[Faculty of World Studies]] at [[University of Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;http://fws.ut.ac.ir/ltr/Groups.aspx?Ind=-1&amp;Id=112&amp;LanId=2 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521224056/http://fws.ut.ac.ir/ltr/Groups.aspx?Ind=-1&amp;Id=112&amp;LanId=2# |date=2015-05-21 }} | University of Tehran, Faculty of British Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Classification des dialectes arméniens''''' (''Classification of Armenian dialects'') is a 1909 book by the Armenian linguist [[Hrachia Adjarian]], published in Paris. It is Adjarian's translation into French of his original work [http://www.nayiri.com/imagedBook.jsp?id=1 Հայ Բարբառագիտութիւն] (Armenian Dialectology) that was later published as a book in 1911 in Moscow and New Nakhichevan. The French translation lacks the dialectal examples.

Adjarian surveyed the Armenian dialects in what is now [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]] and other countries settled by [[Armenians]].

Unlike the traditional division of Armenian into two dialects ([[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]]), he divided Armenian into three main dialects based on the present and imperfect indicative particles that were used. He called as the -owm (-ում) dialects, -gë (-կը) dialects, and -el (-ել) dialects. The three major dialects were further divided into subdialects.&lt;ref&gt;Adjarian, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; The book is one of the few reliable sources of Armenian dialects that existed at the time. After the [[Armenian Genocide]], linguists Gevorg Jahukyan, Jos Weitenberg, Bert Vaux and Hrach Martirosyan have extended the understanding of Armenian dialects.

'''Dan Park''' (born May 4, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Birth data from Ratsit.se | url = http://www.ratsit.se/19680504-Dan_Fredrik_Park_Limhamn/ph-02o_-HdApJMgEYq_agD6UsZabOtLv6Y4ZEYM2q8M}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Swedish [[street artist]] who has been arrested, fined, and sentenced to jail for [[Hate speech#Sweden|hate speech]] in Swedish Courts several times for his art.

In 2011, Park was arrested for a collage poster depicting an Afro-Swede &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate'  | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; student activist naked and in chains along with text saying "Our negro slave has run away", and the activist's personal contact information. Park singled out the student activist for reporting a student party with people in blackface. Park was convicted of defamation and racial agitation, and given a suspended sentence, fined, and ordered to pay damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Artist avoids jail for 'negro slave taunt' | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20120127/38756 | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Park was arrested at the opening of an exhibition of his collage posters, and was sentenced to 6 months in jail for incitement to racial agitation and defamation, and ordered to pay a total of 60,000 kronor ($8,700) in damages to four people depicted in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures |title=Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate' pictures |work=[[The Local]] |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the court ordered 9 of his works destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sentenced: Swedish Artist Dan Park "Incited Against an Ethnic Group" | url = http://hyperallergic.com/154676/sentenced-swedish-artist-dan-park-incited-against-an-ethnic-group/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park himself insists that his works are not racist, but a satiric commentary on current events and against [[political correctness]] in Sweden. Park is mainly notable for the intense public debate about [[freedom of speech]] that his case and works have generated, especially in Denmark, where his works have been exhibited in the Parliament building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Parks forbudte billeder vises på Christiansborg i dag | publisher=Politiken | url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/kunst/ECE2432649/dan-parks-forbudte-billeder-vises-paa-christiansborg-i-dag/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFA was adopted by The Dakar Framework in April 2000 at the World Education Forum in Senegal, Africa, with the goal in mind that all children would receive primary education by 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eldis.org/vfile/upload/1/document/0708/DOC16941.pdf|title=INCLUSIVE EDUCATION:  AN EFA STRATEGY FOR ALL CHILDREN|last=Peters|first=Susan|date=November 2004|website=The World Bank|access-date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurence_Tamatea/publication/44837942_The_Dakar_framework_Constructing_and_deconstructing_the_global_neo-liberal_matrix_Globalisation_Societies_and_Education_33_311-334/links/577b855f08aece6c20fcb693/The-Dakar-framework-Constructing-and-deconstructing-the-global-neo-liberal-matrix-Globalisation-Societies-and-Education-33-311-334.pdf|title=The Dakar Framework: Constructing and Deconstructing the Global Neoliberal Matrix|last=Tamatea|first=Laurence|date=November 2005|website=Research Gate|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Not all children receive the education they need or want, therefore this goal was put in place to help those children.

[[UNESCO]] has been mandated to lead the movement and coordinate the international efforts to reach Education for All. Governments, development agencies, civil society, non-government organizations and the media are but some of the partners working toward reaching these goals.

The EFA goals also contribute to the global pursuit of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), especially MDG 2 on universal primary education and MDG 3 on gender equality in education, by 2015.

The [[Fast Track Initiative]] was set up to implement the EFA movement, aiming at "accelerating progress towards quality universal primary education".

UNESCO also produces the annual [[Education for All Global Monitoring Report]].  For further information, see UNESCO's website for the Education for All Global Monitoring Report: http://www.unesco.org/en/efareport. This report has been replaced by the Global Education Monitoring Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About us |publisher=Global Education Monitoring Report  |accessdate=14 May 2017 |url=http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNESCO==
[[UNESCO]] works with others around the world to reach a mutual understanding for everyone to work well together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/about-us/introducing-unesco|title=Our Vision|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNESCO coordinates international cooperation which allows access to education, grow and live in a diverse community, learn from advancements in technology, and freedom of expression.  This cooperation allows UNESCO to work with others to create opportunities for children and other citizens around the world.  Goals are created to provide all children with an elementary education, which is important to some families.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Educational programs are also created through the cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/about-us/introducing-unesco|title=Introducing UNESCO|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audrey Azoulay]] was elected as the Director-General on November 15, 2017 for a four-year term.  Azoulay has priorities in place and one of the highest ones is education.  Working with others will allow the education programs to spread globally.  Azoulay is working hard to make sure all these goals and cooperation are kept in line to help better the present and future for children and other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/director-general|title=Director-General, Audrey Azoulay|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She believes that these issues faced by countries cannot be met by one country alone, therefore working with different countries will make it more possible to solve these issues and meet goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/director-general|title=Director-General, Audrey Azoulay|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
Partnerships is what helps UNESCO fix global challenges.  These partnerships are managed very carefully to reassure that the goals set in place are met.  UNESCO works in different ways with their partnerships such as collaboration, volunteers, advocacy, and consultations.  By having these different ways of working with others, UNESCO is able to have many partnerships and have them globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/partnerships|title=Partnerships|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNESCO's partners range from individuals to institutions all around the world.  Some of them are governments, [[Private sector|Private Sector]] companies, [[Goodwill ambassador|Goodwill Ambassadors]], media organizations, corporate and [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] foundations, [[parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarian]]s, the wider UN family, other [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental organizations]], specialized networks in UNESCO, and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/partnerships|title=Partnerships|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNESCO offers many entry levels for partnerships, which are organizations that have leadership and goals/priorities set in place to achieve.  Some examples of those are education, natural sciences, oceans, social and human sciences, culture, communication and information, priority Africa, and crisis and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/partnering|title=Partnering with UNESCO|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Education is the top priority for UNESCO and they are working with EFA to create better education for all children and adults.  The problem that comes from this is that every country is different and that reflects achieving these education goals.  Countries differ in quality of education due to economics and culture.  This is where is great need to strengthen in finances, resources, and technology.  Technology is booming in this time and that has an effect on how much education students have access to globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/partnering/coordination-and-advocacy-efa|title=Coordination and advocacy for EFA|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Therefore, those areas need to be strengthen to ensure that education is top priority going into the future.

==World Education Forum (Dakar, Senegal, 2000)==
In 2000, ten years later, the international community met again at the World Education Forum in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], an event which drew 1100 participants. The forum took stock of the fact that many countries were far from having reached the goals established at the World Conference on Education for All in 1990. The participants agreed on the '''Dakar Framework for Action''' which re-affirmed their commitment to achieving Education for All by the year 2015, and identified six key measurable education goals which aim to meet the learning needs of all children, youth and adults by 2015. In addition, the forum reaffirmed UNESCO’s role as the lead organization with the overall responsibility of coordinating other agencies and organizations in the attempts to achieve these goals. The six goals established in The Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting Our Collective Commitments are:

*Goal 1: Expand early childhood care and education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Early Childhood |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.|accessdate=11 September 2010|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/efa/efa-goals/early-childhood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Goal 2: Provide free and compulsory primary education for all&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Primary Education |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. |accessdate=11 Sep 2010|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/efa/efa-goals/primary-education.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Goal 3: Promote learning and life skills for young people and adults&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lifelong Learning |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. |accessdate= 11 Sep 2010 |url=http://www.unesco.org/en/efa/efa-goals/lifelong-learning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Goal 4: Increase adult [[literacy]] by 50 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Adult Literacy|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. |accessdate=11 Sep 2010 |url=http://www.unesco.org/en/efa/efa-goals/adult-literacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Goal 5: Achieve gender parity by 2005, gender equality by 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gender Parity |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.|accessdate=11 Sep 2010 |url=http://www.unesco.org/en/efa/efa-goals/gender-parity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Goal 6: Improve the quality of education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Quality Education |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. |accessdate=11 Sep 2010|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/efa/efa-goals/quality-education.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to evaluate each country's progress with regards to the EFA's goals set in the Dakar Framework for Action, UNESCO has developed the Education for All Development Index (EDI). The EDI measures four of the six EFA goals, selected on the basis of data availability. Each of the four goals is evaluated using a specific indicator, and each of those components is then assigned an equal weight in the overall index.

The EDI value for a given country is thus the arithmetic mean of the four indicators. Since they are all expressed as percentages, the EDI value can vary from 0 to 100% or, when expressed as a ratio, from 0 to 1. The higher the EDI value, the closer the country is to achieving Education For All as a whole.

The four goals measured in the EDI and their corresponding indicators are:

*Goal 1: Expand early childhood care and education - The indicator selected to measure progress towards this goal is the total primary net enrolment ratio (NER), which measures the percentage of primary-school-age children who are enrolled in either primary or secondary school. Its value varies from 0 to 100%. Therefore, a NER of 100% means that all eligible children are enrolled in school.
*Goal 4: Increase adult literacy by 50 percent - Although existing data on literacy are not entirely satisfactory, the adult literacy rate for those aged 15 and above is used here as a proxy to measure progress.
*Goal 5: Achieve gender parity by 2005, gender equality by 2015: The indicator selected to measure progress towards this goal is the gender-specific EFA index, the GEI, which is itself a simple average of the three gender parity indexes (GPI) for primary education, secondary education and adult literacy, with each being weighted equally. Therefore, it encompasses the two sub-goals of the original EFA goal: gender parity (achieving equal participation of girls and boys in primary and secondary education) and gender equality (ensuring that educational equality exists between boys and girls) proxied by the GPI for adult literacy
*Goal 6: Improve the quality of education - The survival rate to Grade 5 was selected for as being the best available proxy for assessing the quality component of EDI, as comparable data are available for a large number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=EFA Development Index |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. |accessdate= 11 Sep 2010 |url=http://www.unesco.org/en/efareport/resources/statistics/efa-development-index.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==EFA and Inclusion==
Inclusion is a main component that is used with EFA.  Since EFA is a global movement all children are involved: different cultures, religions, disabilities, and more.  The problem that is faced with inclusion is how different countries define disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  To be more specific the problem comes with the definition of special needs.  This can affect how or if those students can meet the goals that are created.  To make sure all children are included schools collaborate to see how all the children can meet the certain goals given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ainscow|first=Mel|last2=Miles|first2=Susie|date=2008-03-01|title=Making Education for All inclusive: where next?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11125-008-9055-0|journal=PROSPECTS|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=15–34|doi=10.1007/s11125-008-9055-0|issn=0033-1538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This area may be a challenging one for some and it comes down to what does the term "all" really mean in Education For All?&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Susan|date=September 1, 2007|title="Education for All?" A Historical Analysis of International Inclusive Education Policy and Individuals With Disabilities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10442073070180020601|journal=Journal of Disability Policy Studies|volume=18|pages=|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is an answer that will vary country to country and every where around the world.  There have been predictions that by the year 2025 the number of children with disabilities will have risen.  A majority of that number will be children in developing countries.  Therefore, answers are needed on how to include all children in the learning and educational goals set.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Similar to technology in schools, inclusion can grow and become more common in schools.

==Meeting Goals==
These goals set by the EFA were not able to be met by all.  Some countries were unable to meet these goals due to conflict in the area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED474426|title=Children, Education and War: Reaching Education for All (EFA) Objectives in Countries Affected by Conflict. Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit Working Paper.|last=Sommers|first=Marc|date=June 2002|website=ERIC|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflicts can cause destruction and prevent children from even going to school or learning from home.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  There was a fear that certain countries would not be able to gain access to certain technology and support to meet these goals.  Technology is a problem that countries run into with trying to improve education for children and even adults.  As technology advances it is becoming a bigger key component in some schools.  Depending on some areas technology is the central focus point to help students learn.  In other areas that may not be the case.  If technology keeps advancing that may have different affects on countries.  Some may not be able to keep up with the advances and other may be able to keep up.  This all goes back to financial stability and economics in each country.  One of UNESCO's partners, World Bank worked with the countries that were most likely not going to meet the goals by the deadline (2015).  [[World Bank]] provided these countries with support and in return they would get certain policy reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Harvey|date=February 2004|title=Education For All: the globalization of learning targets|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f983/9014a43661ca43570485a840f39487165145.pdf|journal=Comparative Education|volume=40|pages=|via=Semantic Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows countries to receive support to help achieve the educational goals.  This can be helpful for countries that are less fortunate in financial and economic stability.  Some of these countries that struggled were in East Africa: [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]].  When all the countries in East Africa had declared independence, then education became the priority for all.  The problem became that those countries struggled with educational on literacy challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orodho|first=John|date=January 2014|title=Policies On Free Primary and Secondary Education in East Africa: Are Kenya and Tanzania on Course to Attain Education For All (EFA) Goals by 2015?|url=http://ir-library.ku.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/123456789/11675/Policies%20On%20Free%20Primary%20And....pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=ISOR Journal of Humanities and Social Science|volume=19|pages=11-20|via=ISOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent UNESCO Updates ===
The UNESCO revealed in its 2017 Global Education Monitoring Report that around 264 million youngsters do not attend school. An additional $39 billion is needed annually to enhance the quality of schools worldwide. This will provide 2.2 billion children globally equal access to learning. At present, only 83 percent of students who attend school are able to finish elementary education and a low of 45 percent of kids 15 up to 17 years old complete the secondary level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/unesco-264-million-children-dont-go-to-school/a-41084932|title=UNESCO: 264 million children don't go to school {{!}} DW {{!}} 24.10.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova stated in an official statement that "''Education is a shared responsibility between us all: governments, schools, teachers, parents and private actors''." Accountability describes how mentors teach, students learn, and bureaucracies take action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/don-t-just-blame-teacher-when-system-fault-says-unesco|title=Don’t just blame the teacher when the system is at fault, says UNESCO|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''El Sawy Culture Wheel''' ({{lang-ar|ساقية الصاوى}}) ([[transliterated]]: Sakkiat Al-Sawy) is an all-purpose, private [[cultural center]], located on [[Gezira Island]] in the [[Zamalek]] district, central [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. Named after its sole founder and owner, Abdelmoniem El-Sawy, it is considered one of the most important cultural venues in Egypt.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabic.cnn.com/2009/entertainment/2/26/sawi.culture/index.html|title=El Sawy Culturewheel in Egypt: From a place for beggars to a resort for intellectuals|publisher= [[CNN]]|date=2009-03-17|accessdate=2009-04-01|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Al Jazeera]], the center gets more than 20000 visitors monthly and its website receives  approximately 150000 visitors/month.&lt;ref name="jazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/News/archive/archive?ArchiveId=1080109|title=El Sawy Culturewheel in Egypt chooses minds as a focus for its 2008 activities|publisher= [[Aljazeera]]|date=2008-01-07|accessdate=2009-04-01|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
El Sawy Culture Wheel was established in 2003 by [[Mohamed El-Sawy]]. Prior to its construction, its location, beneath the 15th May Bridge in [[Zamalek]], was a garbage dump and a shelter for homeless people and drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/916/sc1.htm |title=Many reasons for one visit |publisher=[[Al Ahram Weekly]] |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216164003/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/916/sc1.htm |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Sawy named his center in honor of his father's — Abdel Moneim El-Sawy, an [[Egypt]]ian novelist and a former [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|minister of culture]] — five-part [[book series|novel series]]: "El-Sakkia" or (The Wheel).&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2514 |title=Inventing the Wheel |publisher=[[Egypt Today]] |date=October 2004|accessdate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118134623/http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2514 |archivedate=2008-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations and halls==
As of April 2009, El Sawy culturewheel has 3 branches: the main branch in Zamalek, a branch in Algeel Algadeed school, and a temporary branch in [[Qena]]. The main branch has 8 halls: Wisdom hall, River hall, Earth hall, Word halls 1 and 2, Garden Hall, El Naseeb and Bostan El Nil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.culturewheel.com/sections/venus/zamalek-branch From the Culturewheel website]&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent premises in Qena is scheduled for opening in [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elbadeel.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50704&amp;Itemid=100 |title=Cornerstone for El Sawy culturewheel in Qena laid |publisher=Al-badeel Newspaper |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-04-01 |language=ar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924045215/http://www.elbadeel.net/index.php?option=com_content |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

'''''Ilium/Olympos''''' is a series of two [[science fiction]] novels by [[Dan Simmons]]. The events are set in motion by beings who appear to be [[List of Greek mythological characters|ancient Greek gods]]. Like Simmons' earlier series, the [[Hyperion Cantos]], it is a form of "literary science fiction"; it relies heavily on [[intertextuality]], in this case with [[Homer]] and [[Shakespeare]] as well as  references to [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (or ''In Search of Lost Time'') and [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]''.

As with most of his science fiction and in particular with ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'', ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]'' demonstrates that Simmons writes in the [[soft science fiction]] tradition of [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. ''Ilium'' is based on a literary approach similar to most of Bradbury's work, but describes larger segments of society and broader historical events. As in Le Guin's [[Hainish Cycle|Hainish series]], Simmons places the action of ''Ilium'' in a vast and complex universe made of relatively plausible technological and scientific elements. Yet ''Ilium'' is different from any of the works of Bradbury and Le Guin in its exploration of the very far future of humanity, and in the extra human or [[Posthuman (Human evolution)|post-human]] themes associated with this. It deals with the concept of [[technological singularity]] where technological change starts to occur beyond the ability of humanity to presently predict or comprehend. The first book, ''Ilium'', received the [[Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel|Locus Award for Best Science Fiction novel]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="WWE-2004"&gt;{{cite web

==Plot introduction==
{{main|Ilium (novel)|Olympos (novel)}}

The series centers on three main character groups: that of the scholic Hockenberry, Helen and Greek and Trojan warriors from the Iliad; Daeman, Harman, Ada and the other humans of Earth; and the [[moravec (robot)|moravec]]s, specifically Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io. The novels are written in first-person, present-tense when centered on Hockenberry's character, but features third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. Much like Simmons' Hyperion where the characters' stories are told over the course of the novels and the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters' stories are told over the course of the novels and their stories do not begin to converge until the end.

==Characters in ''Ilium/Olympos''==

===Old-style humans===
The "old-style" humans of Earth exist at what the post-humans claimed would be a stable, minimum herd population of one million. In reality, their numbers are much smaller than that, around 300,000, because each woman is allowed to have only one child. Their [[DNA]] incorporates [[moth]] genetics which allows [[sperm]]-storage and the choice of father-sperm years after [[sexual intercourse]] has actually occurred. This [[reproduction|reproductive]] method causes many children not to know their father, as well as helps to break [[incest taboo]]s in that the firmary, which controls the fertilization, protects against a child of close relatives being born. The old style human never appear any older than about 40 since every twenty years they are physically rejuvenated.
* '''Ada''': the owner of Ardis Hall and Harman's lover. She is just past her first twenty. She hosts Odysseus/Noman for his time on Earth.
* '''Daeman''': a pudgy man approaching his second Twenty. Both a ladies' man and a [[lepidopterist]]. Also terrified of [[dinosaur]]s. At the start of Ilium he is a pudgy, immature man-child who wishes to have sex with his cousin (as incest taboos have all but ceased to exist in his society), Ada (whom he had a brief relationship with when she was a teenager), but by the end of the tale he is a mature leader who is very fit and strong. Mother's name is Marina.
* '''Hannah''': Ada's younger friend. Both inventor and artist. Develops a [[Limerence|romantic interest]] in Odysseus.
* '''Harman''': Ada's lover. 99 years old. Only human with the ability to read, other than Savi.
* '''Savi''': the [[Wandering Jew]]. The only old-style human not gathered up in the final fax 1,400 years earlier. She has survived the years by spending most of them sleeping in [[Cryogenics|cryo crèches]] and spending only a few months awake at a time every few decades.

===Moravecs===
Named after the [[roboticist]] [[Hans Moravec]], they are autonomous, sentient, self-evolving [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] organisms that dwell on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] [[moon]]s. They were seeded throughout the [[outer Solar System]] by humans during the Lost Age. Most moravecs are self-described [[Humanities|humanists]] and study Lost Age culture, including literature, television programs and movies.
* '''Mahnmut the [[Europa (moon)|Europan]]''': explorer of Europa's oceans and [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] of the submersible, ''The Dark Lady''. An amateur Shakespearean scholar.
* '''Orphu of [[Io (moon)|Io]]''': a heavily armored, 1,200-year-old [[Vacuum|hard-vac]] moravec that is shaped not unlike a [[crab]]. Weighing eight [[ton]]s and measuring six meters in length, Orphu works in the sulfur-torus of Io, and is a Proust enthusiast.
* '''rockvecs''': a subgroup of the moravecs, the rockvecs live on the [[Asteroid Belt]] and are more adapted for combat and hostile environments than the moravecs.

===Scholics===
Dead scholars from previous centuries that were rebuilt by the Olympian gods from their DNA. Their duties are to observe the [[Trojan War]] and report the discrepancies that occur between it and Homer's ''Iliad''.
* '''Dr. Thomas Hockenberry''': [[Doctorate|Ph.D.]] in [[classical studies]] and a Homeric scholar. Died of cancer in 2006 and is resurrected by the Olympian Gods as a ''scholic''. Lover of [[Helen of Troy]].
* '''Dr. Keith Nightenhelser''': Hockenberry's oldest friend and a fellow ''scholic''. (The real Nightenhelser was Simmons' roommate at [[Wabash College]] and is currently a professor at [[DePauw University]].)

===Others===
* '''[[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] and [[Troy|Trojans]]''': the heroes and minor characters are drawn from Homer's epics, as well as the works of [[Virgil]], [[Proclus]], [[Pindar]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], and classical [[Greek mythology]].
* '''[[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]]''': a character from ''The Tempest'' and the avatar of the [[evolution|evolved]], [[self-aware]] [[biosphere]]. Using locks of Harman's hair, Daeman's hair, and her own hair, Savi makes a deal with Ariel in order that they might pass without being attacked by the ''calibani''.
* '''[[Caliban]]''': a monster, son of [[Sycorax]] and servant of [[Prospero]], whom one reviewer describes as "a cross between [[Gollum]] and the [[Xenomorph (Alien)|alien]] of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue321/excess.html |title=Excessive Candour: Arena ''Iliad'' |date=2003-06-16 |accessdate=2006-12-22 |author=Clute, John |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017020532/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue321/excess.html |archivedate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is cloned to create the ''calibani'', weaker clones of himself. Caliban speaks in strange speech patterns, with much of his dialogue taken from the [[dramatic monologue]] "[[Caliban upon Setebos]]" by [[Robert Browning]]. Simmons chooses not to portray Caliban as the "oppressed but noble native soul straining under the yoke of capitalist-colonial-imperialism" that current interpretations employ to portray him, which he views as "a weak, pale, politically correct shadow of the slithery monstrosity that made audiences shiver in Shakespeare's day ... Shakespeare and his audiences understood that Caliban was a ''monster''{{spaced ndash}}and a really monstrous monster, ready to rape and impregnate Prospero's lovely daughter at the slightest opportunity." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue330/interview.html |title=Science Fiction Weekly Interview with Dan Simmons |date=2003-08-18 |accessdate=2006-12-22 |author=Shindler, Dorman T. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907163614/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue330/interview.html |archivedate=2006-09-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Odysseus''': Odysseus after his [[Odyssey]], ten years older than the Odysseus who fights in the Trojan War. In ''Olympos'', he adopts the name Noman, which is a reference to the name Odysseus gives to [[Polyphemus]] the [[Cyclops]] on their encounter, in Greek, ''[[Outis]]'' ({{lang|grc|Οὖτις}}), meaning "no man" or "nobody".
* '''Olympian Gods''': former post-humans who were transformed into gods by Prospero's technology. They do not remember the science behind their technology, save for Zeus and Hephaestus, and they are described both as preliterate and post-literate, for which reason they enlist the services of Thomas Hockenberry and other ''scholics''. They dwell on [[Olympus Mons]] on Mars and use [[quantum teleportation]] in order to get to the recreation of [[Troy]] on an alternate Earth. Though the events of the Trojan War are being recreated with the knowledge of Homer's ''Iliad'', the only ones who know its outcome are the ''scholics'' and [[Zeus]] as Zeus has forbade the other gods from knowing.
* '''post-humans''': former humans who enhanced themselves far beyond the normal bounds of humanity and dwelt in orbital rings above the Earth until Prospero turned some into Olympian gods. The others were slaughtered by Caliban. They had no need of bodies, but when they took on human form they only took on the shape of women.
* '''Prospero''': a character from ''The Tempest'' who is the avatar of the self-aware, post-[[Internet]] [[logosphere]], a reference to [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]'s idea of the [[noosphere]].
* '''Setebos''': Sycorax and Caliban's god. The god is described as "many-handed as a [[cuttlefish]]" in reference to "Caliban upon Setebos" by Robert Browning and is described by Prospero as being an "arbitrary god of great power, a [[9/11|September eleven]] god, an [[Auschwitz]] god."
* '''Sycorax''': a [[witch]] and Caliban's mother. Also known as [[Circe]] or [[Demyx]] or [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]].
* '''The Quiet''': an unknown entity (presumably, [[God]], from the Demogorgon's speeches and the words of Prospero) said to incarnate himself in different forms all across the universe. He is Setebos' nemesis, which could create a kind of God-Against-the Devil picture as Setebos is the background antagonist and Prospero and Ariel, servants of The Quiet, are the background protagonists.
* '''zeks''': the [[Little Green Men]] of Mars. A [[chlorophyll]]-based lifeform that comes from the Earth of an alternate universe. Their name comes from a [[slang]] term related to the [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''sharashka'', which is a scientific or technical institute staffed with prisoners. The prisoners of these [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] labor camps were called ''zeks''.&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of ''Ilium/Olympos''==
As much of the action derives from fiction involving gods and wizards, Simmons rationalises most of this through his use of far-future technology and science, including:
* [[String theory]]: interdimensional transport is conducted via [[Membrane (M-theory)|Brane]] Holes.
* [[Nanotechnology]] provides the gods' immortality and powers, and many of the cybernetic functions possessed by some of the humans.
* Reference to [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]'s idea of the [[noosphere]] is made to explain the origins of powerful entities such as [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] and [[Prospero]], the former arising from a network of datalogging [[mote (sensor)|mote]] machines, and the latter of whom derives from a post-[[Internet]] [[logosphere]].
* [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] and [[Quantum gravity|Quantum Gravity]] are also used to account for a number of other things, from [[Achilles]]' immortality (his mother, [[Thetis]], set the quantum probability for his death to zero for all means of death other than by Paris' bow) to teleportation and shapeshifting powers.
* [[ARNist]]s use [[recombinant DNA]] techniques to resurrect long-dead and prehistoric animals.
* [[World as Myth|Pantheistic solipsism]] is used to explain how 'mythical' characters have entered the "real" world.

===Weapons===
* [[Old style humans]]{{spaced ndash}}Other than flechette rifles scavenged from caches, crossbows are the main form of weapon as old style humans have forgotten almost everything and can only build crossbows.
* [[Gods]]{{spaced ndash}}Tasers, energy shields and titanium lances.
* [[Moravec (robot)|Moravec]]s{{spaced ndash}}Weapons of mass destruction including the Device, ship-based weapons, kinetic missiles.

==Miscellaneous==
What follows is a definition of terms that are either used within ''Ilium'' or are related to its science, technology and fictional history:
* ''[[ARNists]]'': short for "recombinant RNA artists". ARNists use [[recombinant DNA]] techniques to resurrect long-dead and prehistoric animals. Simmons borrows this term from his ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]''.
* ''E-ring''/''P-ring'': short for "equatorial ring" or "polar ring" respectively. The rings described are not solid, but rather similar to the rings around Jupiter or Saturn: hundreds of thousands of large individual solid elements, built and occupied by the post-humans before Caliban and Prospero were stranded there and Caliban began murdering the post-humans. The rings are visible from the Earth's surface, but the old-style humans do not know exactly what they are.
* ''Faxnodes'': much as the [[transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' works, the faxnode system takes a living organism, maps out its structure, breaks down its atoms and assembles a copy at the faxport at the intended destination. This copy is a facsimile, or ''fax'', of the original.  (Unlike most science-fiction transporter technology, it is revealed late in the story that the matter is not "changed into energy" or "sent" anywhere; a traveler's body is completely destroyed, and re-created from scratch at the destination.)
* ''Final fax'': the 9,113 Jews of Savi's time to live through the Rubicon virus are suspended in a fax beam by Prospero and Ariel with the understanding that once the two get the Earth back into order, they will be released.
* ''Firmary'': short for "infirmary". A room in the e-ring that the humans of Earth fax to every Twenty (every twentieth birthday), or when hurt or killed in order to be healed. If they were killed, the firmary removes all memory of their death in order to lessen the psychological impact of the event.
* ''Global Caliphate'': an empire that, among other things, attempts to destroy the Jewish population of Earth. They released the Rubicon virus to kill all Jews on Earth as well as programmed the voynix to kill any remaining Jews who escaped the infection.
* ''[[Introduction to quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]]'' and ''[[quantum gravity]]'': used to account for a number of other things, from [[Achilles]]' immortality, in that Thetis set the quantum probability for his death to zero for all other means of death other than by Paris' bow, to teleportation and [[shapeshifting]] powers.
* ''Rubicon virus'': created by the Global Caliphate and released with the intention of exterminating those of Jewish descent. It had the reverse effect, killing eleven billion people (ninety-seven percent of the world's population), but Israeli scientists were able to develop an inoculation against the virus and inoculate their own people's DNA, but did not have the time to save the rest of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Dan. ''Olympos'', p. 626.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Turin cloth'': a cloth used by the people of Earth that, when draped over the eyes, allows them to view the events of the Trojan War, which they believe is just a drama being created for their entertainment. Named after the [[Shroud of Turin]]
* ''Voynix'': named after the [[Voynich manuscript]]. The voynix are biomechanical, self-replicating, programmable robots. They originated in an alternate universe, and were brought into the ''Ilium'' universe before 3000 A.D. The Global Caliphate somehow gained access to these proto-voynix and after replicating three million of them, battled the New European Union around 3000 A.D. In 3200 A.D., the Global Caliphate upgraded the voynix and programmed them to kill Jews. Using [[time travel]] technology acquired from the [[French people|French]] (previously used to investigate the Voynich Manuscript and which resulted in the destruction of Paris), the Global Caliphate sent the voynix forward in time to 4600 A.D. Upon their arrival they begin to replicate rapidly in the Mediterranean Basin. As the post-human operations there were put at risk, Prospero and Sycorax created the ''calibani'' to fend off the voynix, and eventually Prospero reprogrammed them into inactivation. After the final fax, they were reprogrammed to serve the new old-style humans.

==Literary and cultural influences==
Simmons references in passing through his novel such historical figures, fictional characters and works as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', [[Plato]], [[Gollum]], the [[Disney]] character [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and [[William Butler Yeats]]' "[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]", among others. As well as referencing these works and figures, he uses others more extensively, shaping his novel by the examples he chooses, such as 9/11 and its effects on the Earth and its nations.

''Ilium'' is thematically influenced by [[extropianism]], peopled as it is with post-humans of the far future. It therefore continues to explore the theme pioneered by [[H. G. Wells]] in ''[[The Time Machine]]'', a work which is also referenced several times in Simmons' work. One of the most notable references is when the old woman Savi calls the current people of Earth ''[[eloi]]'', using the word as an expression of her disgust of their self-indulgent society, lack of culture and ignorance of their past.

''Ilium'' also includes allusions to the work of [[Nabokov]]. The most apparent of these are the inclusion of Ardis Hall and the names of Ada, Daeman and Marina, all borrowed from ''Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle''. The society that the old-style humans live in also resembles that of [[Antiterra]], a parallel of our Earth circa 19th century, which features a society in which there exists a lack of repression and [[Christian]] [[morality]], shown by Daeman's intent to seduce his cousin. Simmons also includes references to Nabokov's fondness for butterflies, such as the butterfly genetics incorporated in the old-style humans and Daeman's enthusiasm as a lepidopterist.

Mahnmut of Europa is identified as a Shakespearean scholar as in the first chapter he is introduced where he analyzes [[Sonnet 116]] in order to send it to his correspondent, Orphu of Io, and it is here that Shakespeare's influence on ''Ilium'' begins. Mahnmut's submersible is named ''The Dark Lady'', an allusion to a figure in [[Shakespeare's sonnets]]. There is also, of course, ''The Tempest''{{'}}s presence in the characters of Prospero, Ariel and Caliban. There are also multiple references to other Shakespeare works and characters such as [[Falstaff]], [[Henry IV, Part I]] and ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. Shakespeare himself even makes an appearance in a [[dream]] to Mahnmut and quotes from [[Sonnet 31]].

Proustian memory investigations had a heavy hand in the novel's making, which helps explain why Simmons chose ''Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle'' over something more well-understood of Nabokov's, such as ''[[Pale Fire]]''. ''Ada or Ardor'' was written in such a structure as to mimic someone recalling their own [[memories]], a subject which Proust explores in his work '' À la recherche du temps perdu.'' Orphu of Io is more interested in Proust than Mahnmut's Shakespeare, as he considers Proust "perhaps the ultimate explorer of time, memory, and perception."

Simmons' portrayal of Odysseus speaking to the old-style humans at Ardis Hall is also reminiscent of the ''[[Bible]]''{{'}}s [[Jesus]] teaching his disciples. Odysseus is even addressed as "Teacher" by one of his listeners in a way reminiscent of Jesus being addressed as "''[[Rabbi]]''," which is commonly translated as "Teacher".

==Movie adaptation==
In January 2004, it was announced that the screenplay he wrote for his novels ''Ilium'' and ''Olympos'' would be made into a film by [[Digital Domain]] and Barnet Bain Films, with Simmons acting as executive producer. ''Ilium'' is described as an "epic tale that spans 5,000 years and sweeps across the entire solar system, including themes and characters from [[The Iliad|Homer's ''The Iliad'']] and [[The Tempest (play)|Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'']]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49233">'''Language revitalization''', also referred to as '''language revival''' or '''reversing language shift''', is an attempt to halt or reverse the decline of a language or to revive an extinct one.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 169. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved can include parties such as linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments. Some argue for a distinction between '''language revival''' (the resurrection of a [[dead language]] with no existing native speakers) and '''language revitalization''' (the rescue of a "dying" language). It has been pointed out that there has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival, [[Revival of the Hebrew language|that of the Hebrew language]], creating a new generation of native speakers without any pre-existing native speakers as a model.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Redish (2001), ‘Native Languages of the Americas: Endangered Language Revitalization and Revival’.  http://www.native-languages.org/revive.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}

Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is [[Endangered language|severely limited]]. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive [[extinct language]]s. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or [[language death]].

Reasons for revitalization vary. In recent times{{when|date=January 2015}} alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Languages |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/ |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409141047/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/ |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique "cultural treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Grenoble, Lenore A., and Lindsay J. Whaley. Saving Languages: An Introduction to Language Revitalization. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. p. 20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A community often sees language as a unique part of their culture, connecting them with their ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of their history and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of [[language documentation]]. In this field, linguists attempt to create full records of a language's grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.&lt;ref&gt;New Perspectives on Endangered Languages. Ed. José A.F. Farfán and Fernando F. Ramallo. Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2010. pp. 1-7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
==The four degrees of language endangerment==
;Healthy/strong
:all generations use language in variety of settings
;Weakening/sick
:spoken by older people; not fully used in younger generations
;Moribund/dying
:only a few speakers (non-children) remain; no longer used as [[first language|native language]] by children
;Dead
:no longer spoken as a native language
;Extinct
:no longer spoken or potentially spoken

==Theory==
One of the most important preliminary steps in language revitalization/recovering involves establishing the degree to which a particular language has been “dislocated”. This helps involved parties find the best way to assist or revive the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsunoda|first=Tasaku|title=Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization|year=2005|publisher=Mounton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps in reversing language shift===
There are many different theories or models that attempt to lay out a plan for language revitalization. One of these is provided by celebrated linguist [[Joshua Fishman]].
Fishman's model for reviving threatened (or sleeping) languages, or for making them sustainable,&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, J. A. (1991). ''Reversing language Shift: Theory and Practice of Assistance to Threatened Languages''. Clevedon : Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, J. A. (ed.) (2001). ''Can Threatened Languages Be Saved? Reversing Language Shift, Revisited: A 21st Century Perspective''. Clevedon : Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of an eight-stage process. Efforts should be concentrated on the earlier stages of restoration until they have been consolidated before proceeding to the later stages. The eight stages are:

#Acquisition of the language by adults, who in effect act as language apprentices (recommended where most of the remaining speakers of the language are elderly and socially isolated from other speakers of the language).
#Create a socially integrated population of active speakers (or users) of the language (at this stage it is usually best to concentrate mainly on the spoken language rather than the written language).
#In localities where there are a reasonable number of people habitually using the language, encourage the informal use of the language among people of all age groups and within families and bolster its daily use through the establishment of local neighbourhood institutions in which the language is encouraged, protected and (in certain contexts at least) used exclusively.
#In areas where oral competence in the language has been achieved in all age groups, encourage literacy in the language, but in a way that does not depend upon assistance from (or goodwill of) the state education system.
#Where the state permits it, and where numbers warrant, encourage the use of the language in compulsory state education.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in the workplace (lower worksphere).
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in local government services and mass media.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage use of the language in higher education, government, etc.

This model of language revival is intended to direct efforts to where they are most effective and to avoid wasting energy trying to achieve the later stages of recovery when the earlier stages have not been achieved. For instance, it is probably wasteful to campaign for the use of a language on television or in government services if hardly any families are in the habit of using the language.

Additionally, Tasaku Tsunoda describes a range of different techniques or methods that speakers can use to try to revitalize a language, including techniques to revive extinct languages and maintain weak ones. The techniques he lists are often limited to the current vitality of the language.

He claims that the [[Language immersion|immersion]] method cannot be used to revitalize an extinct or moribund language. In contrast, the master-apprentice method of one-on-one transmission on language proficiency can be used with moribund languages. Several other methods of revitalization, including those that rely on technology such as recordings or media, can be used for languages in any state of viability.&lt;ref name=illustrate&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 201. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors in successful language revitalization===
[[David Crystal]], in his book ''Language Death'', proposes that language revitalization is more likely to be successful if its speakers
*increase the language's prestige within the dominant community;
*increase their wealth and income;
*increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community;
*have a strong presence in the education system;
*can write down the language;
*can use electronic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2000). ''Language Death''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 130-141. {{ISBN|0-521-65321-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival linguistics===
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] proposes "Revival Linguistics" as a new linguistic discipline and paradigm.
{{quote|Zuckermann's term 'Revival Linguistics' is modelled upon 'Contact Linguistics'. Revival linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] and Walsh, Michael 2011.  [https://adelaide.academia.edu/Zuckermann/Papers/267186/Stop_Revive_Survive_Lessons_from_the_Hebrew_Revival_Applicable_to_the_Reclamation_Maintenance_and_Empowerment_of_Aboriginal_Languages_and_Cultures 'Stop, Revive, Survive: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures'], ''Australian Journal of Linguistics'' Vol. 31, No. 1, pp. 111-127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Zuckermann, "revival linguistics combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning. After all, language reclamation is the most extreme case of second-language learning. Revival linguistics complements the established area of [[language documentation|documentary linguistics]], which records endangered languages before they fall asleep."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Zuckermann proposes that "revival linguistics changes the field of historical linguistics by, for instance, weakening the family [[tree model]], which implies that a language has only one parent."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

There are disagreements in the field of language revitalization as to the degree that revival should concentrate on maintaining the traditional language, versus allowing simplification or widespread borrowing from the [[majority language]].
====Compromise====
Zuckermann acknowledges the presence of "local peculiarities and idiosyncrasies"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Ghil'ad Zuckermann, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian, Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but suggests that &lt;blockquote&gt;"there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would help revivalists and first nations' leaders to work more efficiently. For example, it is easier to resurrect basic vocabulary and verbal conjugations than sounds and word order. Revivalists should be realistic and abandon discouraging, counter-productive slogans such as "Give us authenticity or give us death!"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Nancy Dorian]] has pointed out that conservative attitudes toward loanwords and grammatical changes often hamper efforts to revitalize endangered languages (as with [[Tiwi language|Tiwi]] in Australia), and  that a division can exist between educated revitalizers, interested in historicity, and remaining speakers interested in locally authentic idiom (as has sometimes occurred with [[Irish language|Irish]]). Some have argued that structural compromise may, in fact, enhance the prospects of survival, as may have been the case with English in the post-Norman period.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy C. Dorian, ‘Purism v. compromise in language revitalisation and language revival’ in 
''Language in Society'' 23, pp. 479-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traditionalist====
Other linguists have argued that when language revitalization borrows heavily from the majority language, the result is a new language, perhaps a [[creole language|creole]] or [[pidgin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Mari C.|title=Language Obsolescence and Revitalization: Linguistic Change in Two Sociolinguistically Contrasting Welsh Communities|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198237112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9u_GG41b_8C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq=neo+breton+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jg86DeYXE&amp;sig=52c4ZvYBqk2yVOeMfd47AqIN9UU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis8Pr4mpDTAhUD4IMKHaJcChwQ6AEIVzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=neo%20breton%20language&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the existence of "Neo-Hawaiian" as a separate language from "Traditional Hawaiian" has been proposed, due to the heavy influence of English on every aspect of the revived Hawaiian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=R. Keao NeSmith|title=Tūtū’s Hawaiian and the Emergence of a Neo Hawaiian Language|journal=‘Ōiwi Journal3—A Native Hawaiian Journal|date=2005|url=http://hstrial-knesmith.homestead.com/Oiwi-Journal-_3-1-09_.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been proposed for Irish, with a sharp division between "Urban Irish" spoken by second-language speakers and traditional Irish as spoken as a first language in [[Gaeltacht]] areas. Ó Béarra stated: "...[to] follow the syntax and idiomatic conventions of English, [would be] producing what amounts to little more than English in Irish drag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feargal Ó Béarra|title=Academic paper insights: Late Modern Irish and the Dynamics of Language Change and Language Death|date=July 2008|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291382217_Late_Modern_Irish_and_the_Dynamics_of_Language_Change_and_Language_Death|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the then-moribund [[Manx language|Manx]] language, the scholar T. F.

Total revival of a [[dead language]] (in the sense of having no [[native speaker]]s) into a self-sustaining community of several million [[first language]] speakers has happened only once, in the case of the [[Hebrew language]], now the [[national language]] of [[Israel]].  In this case, there was a unique set of historical and cultural characteristics that facilitated the revival (''see [[Revival of the Hebrew language]]'').

In a related development, [[literary language]]s without [[native speaker]]s enjoyed great prestige and practical utility as [[lingua franca]]s, often counting millions of fluent speakers at a time.  In many such cases, a decline in the use of the literary language, sometimes precipitous, was later accompanied by a strong renewal.  This happened, for example, in the revival of [[Classical Latin]] in the [[Renaissance]], and the revival of [[Sanskrit]] in the early centuries A.D.  An analogous phenomenon in contemporary [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking areas is the expanded use of the literary language ([[Modern Standard Arabic]], a form of the [[Classical Arabic]] of the 6th century A.D.). This is taught to all educated speakers and is used in radio broadcasts, formal discussions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, Alan S. "Arabic." Morphologies of Asia and Africa. Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2007. 560-77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, literary languages have sometimes risen to the level of becoming [[first language]]s of very large language communities.  An example is standard [[Italian language|Italian]], which originated as a literary language derived from the language of 13th-century [[Florence]], especially as used by such important Florentine writers as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]].  This language existed for several centuries primarily as a literary vehicle, with few native speakers; even as late as 1861, on the eve of [[Italian unification]], the language only counted about 500,000 speakers, many non-native, out of a total population of c. 22,000,000.  The subsequent success of the language has been through conscious development, where speakers of any of the numerous [[Italian languages]] were taught standard Italian as a [[second language]] and subsequently imparted it to their children, who learned it as a first language.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Of course this came at the expense of local Italian languages, most of which are now [[Languages_of_Italy#Conservation_status|endangered]]. Success was enjoyed in similar circumstances by [[German language|High German]], [[Czech language|standard Czech]], [[Spanish language|Castilian Spanish]] and other languages.

===Asia===
The [[Ainu language]] of the indigenous [[Ainu people]] of northern Japan is currently moribund, but efforts are underway to revive it. A 2006 survey of the [[Hokkaido]] Ainu indicated that only 4.6% of Ainu surveyed were able to converse in or "speak a little" Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TpdTRuAm8R4C&amp;pg=PA219 Cultural Diversity, Heritage and Human Rights: Intersections in Theory and ... - William Logan, Máiréad Nic Craith - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2001, Ainu was not taught in any elementary or secondary schools in Japan, but was offered at numerous language centres and universities in Hokkaido, as well as at Tokyo's [[Chiba University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oScUXmAkRXIC&amp;pg=PA340 Can Threatened Languages Be Saved?: Reversing Language Shift, Revisited : A ... - Joshua A.

In China, the [[Manchu language]] is one of the most endangered languages, with speakers only in three small areas of Manchuria remaining.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 28. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some enthusiasts are trying to revive the language of [[Manchu people|their ancestors]] using available dictionaries and textbooks, and even occasional visits to [[Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County]] in [[Xinjiang]], where the related [[Xibe language]] is still spoken natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125452110732160485

In the Philippines, a variation of [[Philippine Spanish|Spanish]] that was primarily based on [[Mexican Spanish]] was the ''lingua franca'' of the country since Spanish colonization in 1565 and was an official language alongside [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (a standardized form of the [[Tagalog language]]) and [[Philippine English|English]] until 1987 following a ratification of a new Constitution where it was re-designated as a voluntary language. As a result of its loss as an official language and years of marginalization at the official level during and after American colonization, the use of the Spanish language amongst the overall populace decreased dramatically and became moribund with the remaining native speakers left being mostly elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rn4RHtiX?url=http://lgpolar.com/page/read/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/cultura/2016/04/12/actualidad/1460464651_728256.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19991009202835/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/june98/05_37_013.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is currently seeing a slow revival due to past government promotion under the administration of former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.congress.gov.ph%2Fdownload%2Fra_12%2FRA09187.pdf&amp;date=2010-07-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070902192237/http://www.ulap.gov.ph/reso2006-28.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, Resolution No. 2006-028 reinstated Spanish as a mandatory subject in secondary schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rE2xF3Ga?url=http://www.schoolsandcourses.com/noticias_ver.asp?idNoticia=238&lt;/ref&gt; Results were immediate as the job demand for Spanish speakers had increased since 2008. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fglobalnation.inquirer.net%2Fnews%2Fbreakingnews%2Fview%2F20081119-173154%2FDemand-for-Spanish-speakers-growing&amp;date=2010-07-14&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the [[Instituto Cervantes|''Instituto Cervantes de Manila'']] reported the number of Filipino Hispanophones with native or non-native knowledge at approximately 3 million (including those who speak the native Spanish-based Creole [[Chavacano Language|Chavacano]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcastellano.org/noticia.php?id=505&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to government efforts, Spanish has also seen a small revival of interest in media thanks to the importing of [[Telenovela|telenovelas]] and [[Music of Latin America|music from Latin America]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rE4Vg911?url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20071206-105314/Spanish_on_comeback_trail_in_Philippines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/spanish+language+culture/ari27-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hebrew]], once largely a liturgical language, was [[Hebrew revitalization|reestablished as a means of everyday communication]] by Jews migrating to what is now the State of Israel and the Palestinian territories, starting in the nineteenth century: it is the world's most famous and successful example of language revitalization.

In Thailand, there exists a [[Chong language]] revitalization project which is headed by Suwilai Premsrirat.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Australia and New Zealand===
The European colonization of Australia, and the consequent damage sustained by Aboriginal communities, had a catastrophic effect on indigenous languages in the southeast and south of the country, leaving them with no living traditional native speakers. A number of Aboriginal communities in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and elsewhere are now trying to revive these languages. The work is typically directed by a group of elders and other knowledgeable people, with community language workers doing most of the research and teaching. They analyze the data, develop spelling systems and vocabulary and prepare resources. Decisions are made in collaboration. Some communities employ linguists, and there are also linguists who work independently.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Christina Eira, community linguist with the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages (VACL), ‘Aboriginal Revival Languages,’ Lingua Franca, 27 June 2009, Radio National: http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/aboriginal-revival-languages/3066470. Retrieved  21 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best cases of relative success in language revitalization is the case of [[Māori language|Māori]] also known as ''te reo Māori''. It is the ancestral tongue of the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand and a vehicle for prose narrative, sung poetry, and genealogical recital.&lt;ref name=senft&gt;{{cite book|last=Senft|first=Gunter|title=Endangered Austronesian and Australian Aboriginal Languages|year=2010|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|location=Canberra|isbn=9780858836235|pages=185–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of the Māori people is taught in ''te reo Māori'' in sacred learning houses through oral transmission. Even after ''te reo Māori'' became a written language, the oral tradition was preserved.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt;

Once European colonization began, many laws were enacted in order to promote the use of English over ''te reo Māori'' among indigenous people.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; The Education Ordinance Act of 1847 mandated school instruction in English and established boarding schools to speed up assimilation of Māori youths into European culture. The Native School Act of 1858 forbade ''te reo Māori'' from being spoken in schools. The colonial masters also promoted the use of English in Māori homes, convincing many parents that their children would not get jobs unless they spoke English.

During the 1970s, a group of young Māori people, called the Nga Tamatoa, successfully campaigned for Māori to be taught in schools.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; Also, Kohanga Reo, Māori language preschools, called language nests, were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinton &amp; Hale|title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0-12-349353-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis was on teaching children the language at a young age, a very effective strategy for language learning. The Māori Language Commission was formed in 1987, leading to a number of national reforms aimed at revitalizing ''te reo Māori''.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; They include media programs broadcast in ''te reo Māori'', undergraduate college programs taught in ''te reo Māori'', and an annual Māori language week. Each iwi, or tribe, created a language planning program catering to its specific circumstances. These efforts have resulted in a steady increase in children being taught in ''te reo Māori'' in schools since 1996,&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; creating a significant number of fluent speakers and making Māori prominent and useful in the people's daily lives. The program has been so successful that similar programs have been based on it. See [[Māori language revival]].

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the use of both local and learned [[languages of Europe|languages]] declined as the central governments of the different states imposed their vernacular language as the standard throughout education and official use (this was the case in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and  [[Greece]], and to some extent, in [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the last few decades, local [[nationalism]] and [[human rights]] movements have made a more [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] policy standard in European states; sharp condemnation of the earlier practices of suppressing regional languages was expressed in the use of such terms as "[[language death|linguicide]]". Campaigns have raised the profiles of local languages to such an extent that in some European regions, the local languages have acquired the status of [[official language]]s, along with the national language. The [[Council of Europe]]'s action in this area (see [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]) is in contrast to the [[European Union]]'s granting of official status to a restricted number of official languages (see [[Languages of the European Union]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Presently, official attempts to revitalise languages under threat, such as the promotion of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in their respective native regions, have seen varying degrees of success.

====Irish====
{{main|Revival of the Irish language}}
One of the best known European attempts at language revitalization concerns the [[Irish language]]. While English is dominant through most of Ireland, Irish, a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], is still spoken in certain areas called ''[[Gaeltacht]]aí'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Carnie, Andrew. "Modern Irish: Modern Irish: A Case Study in Language Revival Failure." (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; but there it is in serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;This decline was noted in 2002. {{cite web|url=http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |title=Report of the Gaeltacht Commission |year=2002 |accessdate=20 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017090003/http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges faced by the language over the last few centuries have included exclusion from important domains, social denigration, the death or emigration of many Irish speakers during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 1840s, and continued emigration since. Efforts to revitalise Irish were being made, however, from the mid-1800s, and were associated with a desire for Irish political independence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Contemporary Irish language revitalization has chiefly involved teaching Irish as a compulsory language in mainstream English-speaking schools. But the failure to teach it in an effective and engaging way means (as linguist Andrew Carnie notes) that students do not acquire the fluency needed for the lasting viability of the language, and this leads to boredom and resentment. Carnie also noted a lack of media in Irish (2006),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; though this is no longer the case.

The decline of the Gaeltachtaí and the failure of state-directed revitalisation have been countered by an urban revival movement. This is largely based on an independent community-based school system, known generally as [[Gaelscoil]]eanna. These schools teach entirely through Irish and their number is growing, with over thirty such schools in Dublin alone.&lt;ref&gt;Gaelscoileanna Teo – Statistics: http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/en/about/statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; They are an important element in the creation of a network of urban Irish speakers (known as Gaeilgeoirí), who tend to be young, well-educated and middle-class. It is now likely that this group has acquired critical mass, a fact reflected in the expansion of Irish-language media.&lt;ref name="gaelport"&gt;http://www.gaelport.com/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=3726: ‘Schism fears for Gaeilgeoirí,’ Brian Ó Broin, 16 January 2010, ''The Irish Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish language television has enjoyed particular success.&lt;ref&gt;See the website of TG4: http://www.tg4.ie/.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that they tend to be better educated than monolingual English speakers and enjoy higher social status.&lt;ref&gt;‘Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market,’ The Economic and Social Review, Vol. 40, No. 4, Winter, 2009, pp. 435–460: https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html&lt;/ref&gt; They represent the transition of Irish to a modern urban world, with an accompanying rise in prestige.

====Scottish Gaelic====
There are also current attempts to revive the related language of [[Scottish Gaelic]], which was suppressed following the formation of the United Kingdom, and entered further decline due to the [[Highland clearances]]. Currently, Gaelic is only spoken widely on the Western Isles and some areas of the Highland and Islands.  The decline in fluent Gaelic speakers has slowed, however the population center has shifted to L2 speakers in urban areas, especially Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Census shows decline in Gaelic speakers 'slowed' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24281487 |accessdate=23 June 2014 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=ALISON CAMPSIE|title=Gaelic speakers map: Where in Scotland is Gaelic thriving?|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/gaelic-speakers-map-where-in-scotland-is-gaelic-thriving-1-3903467|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=www.scotsman.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manx====
{{main|Manx language revival}}
Another Celtic language, [[Manx language|Manx]], lost its last native speaker in 1974 and was declared extinct by [[UNESCO]] in 2009, but never completely fell from use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/isle_of_man/7901763.stm|title=UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct'|date=2009-02-20|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is now taught in primary and secondary schools including the [[Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]], used in some public events and spoken as a second language by approximately 1800 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/02/how-manx-language-came-back-from-dead-isle-of-man|title=How the Manx language came back from the dead|last=Whitehead|first=Sarah|date=2015-04-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revitalization efforts include radio shows in Manx Gaelic and social media and online resources.

====Cornish====
There have been a number of attempts to revive the [[Cornish language]], both privately and some under the [[Cornish Language Partnership]]. Some of the activities have included translation of the Christian scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evertype.com/books/testament-noweth-ucr.html Cornish New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt; a guild of bards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/welcome.htm guild of bards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706051224/http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/welcome.htm |date=2009-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of [[Cornish literature]] in modern Cornish, including novels and poetry.

===North America===
In recent years, a growing number of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes have been trying to revitalize their languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In addition, there are apps (including phrases, word lists and dictionaries) in many Native languages ranging from [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] and [[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]], to [[Lakota language|Lakota]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibway]] and [[Oneida language|Oneida]], [[Massachusett language#Revival|Massachusett]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Gwich'in language|Gwych'in]].

[[Massachusett language|Wampanoag]], a language spoken by the people of the same name in Massachusetts, underwent a revitalization project led by [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]]. The project has seen children speaking the language fluently for the first time in over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessielittledoe.com/jessie_CV.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810115929/http://www.jessielittledoe.com/jessie_CV.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/features/wampanoag-language&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are currently attempts at revitalizing the [[Chochenyo language]] of California, which had become extinct.

===South America===
[[Kichwa language|Kichwa]] is the variety of the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] language spoken in [[Ecuador]] and is one of the most widely spoken indigenous languages in South America. Despite this fact, Kichwa is a threatened language, mainly because of the expansion of Spanish in South America. One community of original Kichwa speakers, Lagunas, was one of the first indigenous communities to switch to the Spanish language.&lt;ref name=beginning&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|pages=71–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to King, this was because of the increase of trade and business with the large Spanish-speaking town nearby. The Lagunas people assert that it was not for cultural assimilation purposes, as they value their cultural identity highly.&lt;ref name=beginning /&gt; However, once this contact was made, language for the Lagunas people shifted through generations, to Kichwa and Spanish bilingualism and now is essentially Spanish monolingualism. The feelings of the Lagunas people present a dichotomy with language use, as most of the Lagunas members speak Spanish exclusively and only know a few words in Kichwa.

The prospects for Kichwa language revitalization are not promising, as parents depend on schooling for this purpose, which is not nearly as effective as continual language exposure in the home.&lt;ref name=end&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|pages=187–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schooling in the Lagunas community, although having a conscious focus on teaching Kichwa, consists of mainly passive interaction, reading, and writing in Kichwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to grassroots efforts, national language revitalization organizations, like [[CONAIE]], focus attention on non-Spanish speaking indigenous children, who represent a large minority in the country. Another national initiative, Bilingual Intercultural Education Project (PEBI), was ineffective in language revitalization because instruction was given in Kichwa and Spanish was taught as a second language to children who were almost exclusively Spanish monolinguals.
Although some techniques seem ineffective, Kendall A. King provides several suggestions:

# Exposure to and acquisition of the language at a young age.
# 
# Extreme immersion techniques.
# 
# Multiple and diverse efforts to reach adults.
# 
# Flexibility and coordination in planning and implementation
# 
# Directly addressing different varieties of the language.
# 
# Planners stressing that language revitalization is a long process
# 
# Involving as many people as possible
# 
# Parents using the language with their children
# 
# Planners and advocates approaching the problem from all directions.

Specific suggestions include imparting an elevated perception of the language in schools, focusing on grassroots efforts both in school and the home, and maintaining national and regional attention.&lt;ref name=end /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[John McWhorter]] has argued that programs to revive indigenous languages will almost never be very effective because of the practical difficulties involved. He also argues that the death of a language does not necessarily mean the death of a culture.  Indigenous expression is still possible even when the original language has disappeared, as with Native American groups and as evidenced by the vitality of black American culture in the United States, among people who speak not Yoruba but English. He argues that language death is, ironically, a sign of hitherto isolated peoples migrating and sharing space: “To maintain distinct languages across generations happens only amidst unusually tenacious self-isolation—such as that of the Amish—or brutal segregation”.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;John McWhorter, ‘The Cosmopolitan Tongue: The Universality of English’ in World Affairs Journal, Fall 2009: http://worldaffairsjournal.org/article/cosmopolitan-tongue-universality-english&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenan Malik]] has also argued that it is "irrational" to try to preserve all the world's languages, as language death is natural and in many cases inevitable, even with intervention. He proposes that language death improves communication by ensuring more people speak the same language. This may benefit the economy and reduce conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11304255 |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Are dying languages worth saving? |date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenanmalik.com/essays/die.html |title=Let Them Die |first=Kenan |last=Malik |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]] |date=November 20, 2000 &lt;!-- original publication: http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/letthemdie/ --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others{{who?|date=April 2018}} have pointed out that similarities in language and culture have not prevented brutal civil wars.

[[File:Bestiaires festoyant arène Thysdrus Musée Bardo.JPG|thumb|[[Roman mosaic|Mosaic]] (220–250 AD) from [[El Djem]], Tunisia (Roman Africa), with the Latin caption "Silence! Let the bulls sleep" ''(Silentiu[m] dormiant tauri)'' and the convivial banter of five banqueters (possibly [[gladiator]]s) represented as if in [[speech balloon]]s:&lt;br&gt;- "We're going to be naked" ''([N]os nudi [f]iemus)''&lt;br&gt;- "We're here to drink" ''(Bibere venimus)''&lt;br&gt;- "you're all talking a lot" ''(Ia[m] multu[m] loquimini)''&lt;br&gt;- "We may get called away" ''(Avocemur)''&lt;br&gt;- "We're having three [glasses]." ''(Nos tres tenemus)''&lt;br&gt;The scene may convey a proverbial expression equivalent to both "[[wikt:let sleeping dogs lie|Let sleeping dogs lie]]" and "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we may die"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brilliant, "Scenic Representations," in ''[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/156533 Age of Spirituality: Late Antique and Early Christian Art, Third to Seventh Century]'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1979), pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
 
[[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] were the official '''languages of the Roman Empire''', but other languages were important regionally. Latin was the original language of the Romans and remained the language of imperial administration, legislation, and the military throughout the classical period.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," translated by James Clackson, in ''A Companion to the Latin Language'' (Blackwell, 2011), p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western Roman Empire|West]] it became the lingua franca and came to be used for even local administration of the cities including the law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Mullen, "Introduction: Multiple Languages, Multiple Identities," in ''Multilingualism in the Graeco-Roman Worlds'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," pp. 554, 556.&lt;/ref&gt; After all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire were [[Constitutio Antoniniana|universally enfranchised]] in 212 AD, a great number of [[Roman citizens]] would have lacked Latin, though they were expected to acquire at least a token knowledge, and Latin remained a marker of "Romanness".&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language," ''Classical Quarterly'' 53.1 (2003), pp. 185–186, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious | reason=Widely discredited notion; broadly speaking Romans did not attempt to enforce a strong language policy; Greek, in particular, was widely accepted and encouraged|date=October 2017}}

[[Koine Greek]] had become a [[lingua franca|shared language]] around the eastern Mediterranean and diplomatic communications in the East even beyond the borders of the Empire. The international use of Greek was one condition that enabled the [[Christianization|spread of Christianity]], as indicated for example by the choice of Greek as the language of the New Testament in the Bible&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State,'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and its use for the [[ecumenical councils]] of the Christian Roman Empire rather than Latin. With the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|dissolution of the Empire]] in the West, Greek became the dominant language of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Roman Empire in the East]], modernly referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Because communication in ancient society was predominantly oral, it can be difficult to determine the extent to which regional or local languages continued to be spoken or used for other purposes under Roman rule. Some evidence exists in inscriptions, or in references in Greek and Roman texts to other languages and the need for interpreters. For [[Punic language|Punic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and [[Aramaic]] or [[Syriac language|Syriac]], a significant amount of [[epigraphy]] or literature survives.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Valantasis, introduction to ''Religions of Late Antiquity in Practice'' (Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Celtic languages#Classification|Celtic languages]] were widespread throughout much of western Europe, and while the orality of Celtic education left scant written records,&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages in the Roman Empire," pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic epigraphy is limited in quantity but not rare.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eska, "Inscriptions in the Celtic World," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), pp. 965–970.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic languages of the Empire have left next to no inscriptions or texts, with the exception of [[Gothic language|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] contributed to the "cultural triangulation" by means of which an individual who was neither Greek nor Roman might construct an identity through the processes of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] and [[Hellenization]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' pp. 264–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decentralization of political power in [[late antiquity]], Latin developed locally in the Western provinces into branches that became the [[Romance languages]], including [[History of Spanish|Spanish]], [[History of the Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[History of French|French]], and [[History of Italian|Italian]]. In the early 21st century, the first or second language of more than a billion people derived from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;James Clackson, introduction to ''A Companion to the Latin Language'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin itself remained an international medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with [[Renaissance humanism]] up to the 17th century, and for [[legal Latin|law]] and the [[Church Latin|Roman Catholic Church]] to the present.

[[File:BordereaudecuissonGraufesenqueMuséeFenaille1.jpg|thumb|[[Latin cursive]] on [[terra sigillata]] from [[La Graufesenque]] in Roman Gaul]]

Latin was the language of the Romans from the earliest known period. Writing under the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]], [[Virgil]] emphasizes that Latin was a source of Roman unity and [[mos maiorum|tradition]]. In Virgil's epic ''[[Aeneid]]'' about the [[founding of Rome]], the [[Jupiter (mythology)|supreme deity]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] dictates that the [[Trojan War|refugee Trojans]] who have come to settle in Italy will use the language of the native [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]] as a means of unification: "they will keep the speech ''(sermo)'' and ''[[mos maiorum|mores]]'' of their fathers ... and I will make them all  Latins with one mode of expression" ''(uno ore,'' literally "with one mouth").&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 12.834 and 837; Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," pp. 549, 563; Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language," p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] emperors, who claimed descent from the Virgilian hero [[Aeneas]], encouraged high standards of correct Latin ''(Latinitas)'', a linguistic movement identified in modern terms as [[Classical Latin]], and favored Latin for conducting official business.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin became the language of conquered areas because local people started speaking it, and not because the population was displaced by Latin-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;József Herman, ''Vulgar Latin'', translated by Roger Wright (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000, originally published 1975 in French), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin was not imposed officially on peoples brought under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 549; Charles Freeman, ''The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World'' (New York: Penguin, 1999), pp. 389–433.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] observed that Romans preferred for Latin to be adopted ''per pacem societatis'', through a [[social contract|social pact]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'' 19.7.18, as cited by Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[language policy]] contrasts with that of Alexander, who aimed to impose [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] throughout his empire as the official language.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 549, citing [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'' 47.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin was not a requirement for [[Roman citizenship]], and there was no state-supported schooling that privileged it as the medium for education: fluency was desirable for its "high cultural, political, legal, social and economic value".&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin was needed for Imperial service and advancement, and was the language used for the internal functioning of government.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Edicts and official communications of the emperor were in Latin, including rulings on local laws that might be in another language.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans placed a high value on the written word, as indicated by their obsession with documentation and public inscriptions. The Imperial bureaucracy was so dependent on writing that the [[Babylonian Talmud]] declared "if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2000), pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the average [[literacy rate]] in the Empire range from 5 to 30 percent or higher, depending in part on the definition of "literacy".&lt;ref&gt;William V. Harris, ''Ancient Literacy'' (Harvard University Press, 1989), p. 5; William A. Johnson, ''Ancient Literacies: The Culture of Reading in Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), pp. 3–4, especially note 5; T.J. Kraus, "(Il)literacy in Non-Literary Papyri from Graeco-Roman Egypt: Further Aspects of the Educational Ideal in Ancient Literary Sources and Modern Times," ''Mnemosyme'' 53.3 (2000), p. 325; [[Marietta Horster]], "Primary Education," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', pp. 89, 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of state intervention in access to education was a barrier to literacy, since formal education was available only to children from families who could pay for it.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Laes, ''Children in the Roman Empire: Outsiders Within'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011, originally published in Dutch 2006), p. 108; Horster, "Primary Education," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dedication L Minucius Natalis Chiaramonti Inv1249.jpg|thumb|left|Greek [[votum|dedication]] on an altar to [[Asclepius|Asclepius the Savior]] by the [[Roman consul]] Lucius Minucius Natalis (133–134 AD)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' 14.1125&lt;!--:Ἀσκληπιῷ ∙ θ[εῷ]&lt;br&gt;σωτῆρι&lt;br&gt;Λ(ούκιος) ∙ Μινίκιος Νατάλιος,&lt;br&gt;ὕπατος, ἀνθύπατος Λιβύης,&lt;br&gt;αὔγουρ ∙ πρεσβευτὴς ∙καὶ&lt;br&gt;ἀντιστράτηγος ∙ Σεβαστοῦ&lt;br&gt;Μυσίας τῆς κάτω,&lt;br&gt;τὸν ναὸν καὶ τὸν βωμὸν&lt;br&gt;ἀνέθηκεν.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Birth registration in Ancient Rome|birth certificates]] and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin until the time of [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 222–235).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language," pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe ''([[scriba (ancient Rome)|scriba]])'' read or write their official documents for them.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'', p. 101; Kraus, "(Il)literacy in Non-Literary Papyri from Graeco-Roman Egypt," pp. 325–327.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out.&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Mattern, ''Rome and the Enemy: Imperial Strategy in the Principate'' (University of California Press, 1999), p. 197; Teresa Morgan, ''Literate Education in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2000), pp. 1–2 ''et passim''; Greg Woolf, "Literacy or Literacies in Rome?" in ''Ancient Literacies,'' p. 46ff.; Horster, "Primary Education," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'', p. 97. Ando poses the question as "what good would 'posted edicts' do in a world of low literacy?' in ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or ability to read.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire'', pp. 152, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of story ballet ''(pantomimus)'' was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire in part because it relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Hall, introduction to ''New Directions in Ancient Pantomime'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin was the official language of the [[Imperial Roman army|Roman army]] until the mid-6th century, and remained the most common language for military use even in the Eastern empire until the 630s.&lt;ref&gt;Rance, "The ''De Militari Scientia'' or Müller Fragment," pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, only two bishops are known to have spoken Latin at the ecumenical councils held during the reign of [[Theodosius II]] (d. 450 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek==
{{See also|History of Greek}}
[[Koine Greek]] had become the [[lingua franca|common language]] of the eastern Mediterranean and into [[Asia Minor]] after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 279; Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society,'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian]] even imagines that Greek is the universal language of the dead in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Dialogue of the Dead'' 25; Anderson, ''The Second Sophistic,'' p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[late antiquity]], a Greek-speaking majority lived in the [[Greek peninsula]] and [[Greek islands|islands]], major cities of the East, western [[Anatolia]], and some coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek continued as the language of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], and developed into a distinctive [[medieval Greek]] that gave rise to [[modern Greek language|modern Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Zimmer, "Indo-European," in ''Celtic Culture: An Historical Encyclopedia'', p. 961.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P.Ryl. I 61.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|A 5th-century [[papyrus]] showing a parallel Latin-Greek text of a speech by [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[In Catilinam]]'' 2.15, [[Rylands Papyri|P.Ryl.]] I 61 "[[recto]]".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The emperor [[Claudius]] tried to limit the use of Greek, and on occasion revoked the citizenship of those who lacked Latin. Even in addressing the [[Roman Senate]], however, he drew on his own bilingualism in communicating with Greek-speaking ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suetonius]] quotes him as referring to "our two languages,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Claudius'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and the employment of two imperial secretaries, one for Greek and one Latin, dates to his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 553; Lee I. Levine, ''Jerusalem: Portrait of the City in the Second Temple Period (538 B.C.E. – 70 C.E.)'' (Jewish Publication Society, 2002), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday interpenetration of the two languages is indicated by bilingual inscriptions, which sometimes even switch back and forth between Greek and Latin. The epitaph of a Greek-speaking soldier, for instance, might be written primarily in Greek, with his rank and unit in the Roman army expressed in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 556; Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language," p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern empire, laws and official documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," pp. 553–554.&lt;/ref&gt; Both languages were in active use by government officials and the Church during the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 93¬94.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 6th century, Greek culture was studied in the West almost exclusively through Latin translation.&lt;ref&gt;Moatii, "Translation, Migration, and Communication," p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin [[loanword]]s appear liberally in Greek texts on technical topics from late antiquity and the Byzantine period.&lt;ref&gt;Rance, "The ''De Militari Scientia'' or Müller Fragment," p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language reform movements==
[[Atticism]] was a trend of the [[Second Sophistic]]. Intellectuals such as [[Aelius Aristides]] sought to restore the standards of classical Greek characteristic of the [[Attic dialect]], represented by  [[Thucydides]], [[Plato]], [[Demosthenes]], and other authors from the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]]. Prose stylists who aspired to Atticism tried to avoid the [[vulgarism]]s of koine—an impractical goal, but this [[linguistic purism]] also reflected the 2nd-century flourishing of [[Alexandrine grammarians|grammarians]] and [[lexicographer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''The Second Sophistic,'' pp. 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Expertise in language and literature contributed to preserving Hellenic culture in the Roman Imperial world.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''The Second Sophistic,'' p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other reforms, the emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284–305) sought to renew the authority of Latin, and the Greek expression ἡ κρατοῦσα διάλεκτος ''(hē kratousa dialektos)'' attests to the continuing status of Latin as "the language of power."&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar [[Libanius]] (4th century) regarded Latin as causing a decline in the quality of Greek rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 560; A.H.M. Jones, ''The Decline of the Ancient World'' (Longmanns, 1966), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 6th century, the emperor [[Justinian]] engaged in a quixotic effort to reassert the status of Latin as the language of law, even though in his time Latin no longer held any currency as a living language in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," pp. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional languages==

[[File:PalmyraWoman.JPG|thumb|Funerary bust (2nd century AD) of Aqmat, a Syrian woman, with an inscription in the Palmyrene dialect of Aramaic]]
The dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite may obscure the continuity of spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Miles, "Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power," in ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where Syriac, Coptic, Hebrew and Aramaic were spoken, they coexisted with Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aramaic and Syriac===
{{Main|Aramaic language|Syriac language}}
Aramaic was the primary language of Syria and Mesopotamia, with several dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Syriac was in use around [[Antioch]], one of the three largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syriac literature]] is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in [[Edessa]].&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and emphasis on verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as [[Eusebius]], [[St. Basil|Basil]] and [[Theodoret]].&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest Syriac literature was the ''[[Diatessaron]]'' of [[Tatian]], and translations of sections from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prolific Syrian scholar [[Bardesanes]] knew Greek and sent his son for schooling in Athens, but chose to write in his ethnic language. In addition to Syriac [[homily|homilies]] and [[treatise]]s, Bardesanes wrote 150 hymns "of enormous influence and doubtful doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Syriac literature of the time included Christian treatises, dialogues, and apocryphal Acts.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Syriac literature had [[Gnostic]] elements, and also played a role in the dissemination of [[Manicheanism]]. From the 5th century onward, it included [[Monophysite]] and [[Nestorian]] writings.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works by the Syriac writer [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraim]] were translated into Greek.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The satirist and rhetorician [[Lucian]] came from [[Samosata]] in the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]]; although he wrote in Greek, he calls himself a Syrian, and a reference to himself as a "[[barbarian]]" suggests that he spoke Syriac.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards ''et al.'', introduction to ''Apologetics in the Roman Empire'', p. 7; Matthew W. Dickie, "Lucian's Gods: Lucian's Understanding of the Divine," in ''The Gods of Ancient Greece: Identifies and Transformations'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soldiers from [[Palmyra]] even used their [[Palmyrene dialect|dialect of Aramaic]] for inscriptions, in a striking exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language,"  p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coptic===
{{Main|Coptic language}}
[[File:Codex Tchacos p33.jpg|thumb|upright|left|First page of the [[Gospel of Judas]] in the Coptic [[Codex Tchacos]] (3rd–4th century AD)]]
"Coptic" is the modern term for the form of [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] that had developed in late antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sheridan, ''From the Nile to the Rhone and Beyond: Studies in Early Monastic Literature and Scriptural Interpretation'' (Studia Anselmiana, 2012), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Written Coptic as a literary language seems to have resulted from a conscious effort among Egypt's educated class to revive their cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''From the Nile to the Rhone,'' p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century, Coptic script—based on the Greek alphabet with additional characters from [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Egyptian demotic]] to reflect [[Egyptian phonology]]—is found in documents in several dialects, including [[Bohairic|Old Bohairic]], [[Fayyumic|Fayumic]], [[Akhmimic|Achmimic]], and [[Sahidic]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''From the Nile to the Rhone,'' p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Coptic emerged as a fully literary language, including major translations of Greek scriptures, liturgical texts, and [[patristic]] works.&lt;ref&gt;Maged S.A. Mikhail, "An Historical Definition for the 'Coptic Period'," in ''Coptic Studies on the Threshold of a New Millennium. Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Coptic Studies Leiden 2000'' (Peeters, 2004), vol. 2, p. 972.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 4th to 7th centuries, original works—including homilies, [[hagiography|saints' lives]], [[monastic rules]], [[epistles|letters]], and [[exhortation]]s—were composed in Coptic, primarily in the Sahidic dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail, "An Historical Definition for the 'Coptic Period'," p. 973; Sheridan, ''From the Nile to the Rhone,'' p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; As a writing system, Coptic was used for everyday purposes such as inventories and real estate transactions, as well as for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail, "An Historical Definition for the 'Coptic Period'," p. 973.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 640s, when [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt came under Arab rule]], [[Coptic Christians|Coptic-speaking Christians]] constituted the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail, "An Historical Definition for the 'Coptic Period'," p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 7th century, legal texts might still be written in Coptic: in one example, a bilingual Greek-Arabic [[Protocol (politics)|protocol]] with a reference to [[Mohammed]] precedes a document entirely in Coptic that invokes the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail, "An Historical Definition for the 'Coptic Period'," p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punic===
[[Punic language|Punic]], the [[Semitic language]] of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]], continued to be used in North Africa during the Imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' pp. 201, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Roman conquest in 146 BC, nearly all Punic inscriptions had been votives to the deities [[Tanit]] and [[Ba'al]] or funerary commemorations, but during the Roman era a broader range of content is found in [[Neo-Punic]], often appearing with parallel texts in Latin or Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson, "Neo-Punic and Latin Inscriptions in Roman North Africa: Function and Display," in ''Multilingualism in the Graeco-Roman Worlds,'' pp. 266–268.&lt;/ref&gt; A striking occurrence of Neo-Punic is found at the otherwise thoroughly Roman temple of [[Roma (goddess)|Roma]] and [[Divus Augustus|Augustus]], built 14–19 AD at [[Leptis Magna]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Neo-Punic and Latin Inscriptions in Roman North Africa," p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the latest Neo-Punic inscriptions on a monument dates to the reign of [[Domitian]] (81–96 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Neo-Punic and Latin Inscriptions in Roman North Africa," p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; No inscription in Punic script on stone can be dated later than the 2nd or 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Neo-Punic and Latin Inscriptions in Roman North Africa," p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin script was used to write Punic in the 4th and 5th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Neo-Punic and Latin Inscriptions in Roman North Africa," p. 307ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Punic was spoken at the highest level of society: the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (reigned 193–211) was born in Leptis Magna and spoke Punic as well as Latin and Greek, while his sister supposedly had little command of Latin at all.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Jongeling and Robert M. Kerr, ''Late Punic Epigraphy'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2005), p. 4; Wilson, "Neo-Punic and Latin Inscriptions in Roman North Africa," p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine, who was from North Africa, several times mentions Punic; he observed that it was related to Hebrew and Syriac, and his knowledge of Punic helped him figure out transliterated Semitic words from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Jongeling and Kerr, ''Late Punic Epigraphy'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic===
[[Celtic languages#Classification|Celtic languages]] at the beginning of the Imperial period include [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], spoken in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] (''Gallia,'' present-day France, Belgium, Switzerland and northern Italy); [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]], in parts of [[Hispania]] (Spain and Portugal); [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] in Britannia ([[Roman Britain]]), and [[Galatian language|Galatian]], a branch of Celtic brought to [[Anatolia]] by the Gallic invasions of the 3rd century BC. The place name [[Galatia]], a [[Galatia (Roman province)|Roman province]], derives from the Greek word for "[[Gauls]]" or "[[Celts]]", ''Galatai''. Loanwords from Gaulish are recorded in Latin as early as the time of [[Ennius]] (ca. 239–169 BC), due to the presence of Celtic settlements on the Italian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 185 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; By late antiquity, some Gaulish words had become so Latinized that their origin was no longer recognized as such.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tésera hospitalidad (Uxama).jpg|thumb|Celtiberian inscription on a hospitality token from the Republican period]]
Celtiberian is documented as a written language only after contact with the Romans in the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona A. Rose, "Text and Image in Celtiberia: The Adoption and Adaptation of Written Language into Indigenous Visual Vocabulary," ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'' 22.2 (2003), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in [[Iberian script]] are hospitality tokens ''(tesserae hospitales)'', twenty of which are in the shape of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, "Text and Image in Celtiberia," pp. 157, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The social custom of pledging mutual support among families or communities was compatible with ''[[hospitium]]'' in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, "Text and Image in Celtiberia," p. 159; Leonard A. Curchin, ''The Romanization of Central Spain: Complexity, Diversity and Change in a Provincial Hinterland'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the [[Tarraconensis]] province.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, "Text and Image in Celtiberia," p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several references to Gaulish in late antiquity may indicate that it continued to be spoken. [[Irenaeus]], bishop of [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyon) from 177 AD, complains that he has to communicate with his parishioners in their "barbarous tongue", probably Gaulish.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'' I, preface; Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La langue gauloise: description linguistique, commentaire d'inscriptions choisies'' (Editions Errance, 2003), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[jurist]] [[Ulpian]] (170–228) mentions the need to recognize Gaulish [[verbal contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 31.1.11; Lambert, ''La langue gauloise,'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aelius Lampridius|Lampridius]] says that a [[druid]]ess made a prophecy in Gaulish to [[Alexander Severus]] (208–235).&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''La langue gauloise,'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] (331–420), who had first-hand knowledge, observes that the Gallic [[Treveri]] speak a language "more or less the same" as that of the Galatians.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, commentary on the ''[[Letter to the Galatians]]''; Lambert, ''La langue gauloise,'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of pharmacological recipes by [[Marcellus of Bordeaux]] (late 4th- or early 5th-century) contains several Gaulish words, mainly plant names, and seems to indicate that the language remained in use for at least some purposes such as [[traditional medicine]] and magic.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulpicius Severus]] (363–425), also from [[Gallia Aquitania]], takes note of Gaulish-Latin bilingualism, with Gaulish as the [[first language]]. Other mentions of people who speak "in the Gallic manner" ''(gallice)'' or similar may refer to speaking Latin with a regional Gaulish accent.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''La langue gauloise,'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of [[historical linguistics]] scholarship postulates that Gaulish was indeed still spoken as late as the mid to late 6th century in France.&lt;ref name=Helix&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Hélix| title=Histoire de la langue française|ISBN=978-2-7298-6470-5|publisher=Ellipses Edition Marketing S.A.|page=7|quote=Le déclin du Gaulois et sa disparition ne s'expliquent pas seulement par des pratiques culturelles spécifiques: Lorsque les Romains conduits par César envahirent la Gaule, au 1er siecle avant J.-C., celle-ci romanisa de manière progressive et profonde. Pendant près de 500 ans, la fameuse période gallo-romaine, le gaulois et le latin parlé coexistèrent; au VIe siècle encore; le temoignage de Grégoire de Tours atteste la survivance de la langue gauloise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture, the Gaulish language is held to have survived and had coexisted with spoken Latin during the centuries of Roman rule of Gaul.&lt;ref name=Helix/&gt;

===Germanic===
Next to nothing is recorded of the [[Germanic languages]] spoken in the Empire, with the exception of [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. A phrase of Gothic is quoted in an [[elegiac couplet]] from the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Latin Anthology'' 285 (= 279 in the edition of Shackleton Bailey): ''Inter 'eils' Goticum 'scapia matzia ia drincan' / non audet quisquam dignos edicere versus'' ;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; and more substantially parts of the [[Gospels]] were translated into Gothic and preserved by the 6th-century [[Codex Argenteus]].&lt;ref&gt;Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; While Latin gained some Germanic loanwords, most linguistic influence ran the other way.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Weihestein Vagdavercustis.JPG|thumb|Scene of Roman sacrifice on an altar with a Latin dedication to the Germanic or Celtic goddess [[Vagdavercustis]], set up by a [[praetorian prefect]] in 165 AD at ''Colonia [[Ubii|Ubiorum]]'' ([[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium|Cologne]], Germany)]]
Bilingualism in a Germanic language and Latin was especially important in the military for officers in command of units recruited from Germanic-speaking areas. [[Tacitus]] observes that [[Arminius]], the [[Cherusci|Cheruscan]] officer who later led a [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|disastrously successful rebellion]] against the Romans, was bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' pp. 274–275, citing Tacitus, ''Annales'' 2.10.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] employed a bilingual Germanic [[military tribune]] as a spy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] 18.2.2; Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; The officers and secretaries who kept the records preserved in the [[Vindolanda tablets]] were [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavian]], but their Latin contains no hint; the common soldiers of their units, however, may have retained their Germanic speech.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly, Latin-speaking officers learned a Germanic language through their service and acted as interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' pp. 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring Germanic might be regarded as a dubious achievement inducing anxieties of "barbarism": in 5th-century Gaul, [[Sidonius]] thinks it funny that his learned friend [[Syagrius]] has become fluent in Germanic.&lt;ref&gt;Sidonius, ''Epistle'' 5.5; Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism==
Trilingualism was perhaps not uncommon among educated people who came from regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken. The Latin novelist [[Apuleius]] also wrote in Greek, and had learned Punic from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Moatti, "Translation, Migration, and Communication," p. 111, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Babatha|Babatha Archive]] is a suggestive example of practical multilingualism. These [[papyri]], named for a Jewish woman in the [[Arabia (Roman province)|province of Arabia]] and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and Latin influences; a petition to the [[Roman governor]], however, was written in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," pp. 553–555.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking example of multilingualism as well as multiculturalism in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at [[South Shields]], northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer ''([[vexillarius]])'' of that name from Palmyra, Syria.&lt;ref&gt;The second inscription comes from [[Corstopitum]] (Corbridge), about 50 kilometers away.&lt;/ref&gt; He was most likely in the military stationed along [[Hadrian's Wall]]. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically in the manner of Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid cursive script, and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name ''Regina'', which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British [[Catuvellauni]], a people whose ''[[civitas]]'' capital was [[Verulamium]], but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling ''Catuallauna'' ([[grammatical gender|feminine]]) is used in the Latin inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, introduction to ''Multilingualism in the Graeco-Roman Worlds'' pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==

===Italian peninsula and Sicily===

In Italy, the written use of Latin had replaced [[Oscan language|Oscan]]—like Latin, an [[Italic language]]—and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] by the end of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, "Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power," p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Oscan graffiti are preserved by the [[eruption of Vesuvius]] in 79 AD at [[Pompeii]], which was in the Oscan region, and a couple may date after the earlier eruption in 63.&lt;ref&gt;James Clackson and Geoffrey Horrocks, ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 83; Herman, ''Vulgar Latin,'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1st century, the emperor Claudius, who had keen [[Antiquarianism in ancient Rome|antiquarian]] interests, knew Etruscan and wrote a multivolume history of the Etruscans, but the work has not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano Bonfante and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The Etruscan Language'' (Manchester University Press, rev. ed. 2002), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilingualism had been characteristic of [[Sicily (Roman province)|Sicily]] for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While the slave trade during the [[Roman Republic|Republican period]] brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;Kalle Korhonen, "Sicily in the Roman Imperial Period," in ''Language and Linguistic Contact in Ancient Sicily'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Korhonen, "Sicily in the Roman Imperial Period," pp. 336–338.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian inscriptions are far more likely to be in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Korhonen, "Sicily in the Roman Imperial Period," 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt; In late antiquity, Greek-Latin bilingualism was common enough that it would have been acquired through everyday personal interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Korhonen, "Sicily in the Roman Imperial Period," p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish communities of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] seem to have been bilingual in Greek and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Korhonen, "Sicily in the Roman Imperial Period," p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some Sicilian evidence of Syriac.&lt;ref&gt;Korhonen, "Sicily in the Roman Imperial Period," p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western provinces===
[[File:Ex Voto MAN St Germain.jpg|thumb|upright|Votive bust (late 1st century AD) with the Gaulish name Esumopas Cnustious and the Latin abbreviation VSLM (''[[votum]] solvit libens merito'', "fulfilled his vow freely, as is deserved")]]
In the Western Empire, Latin gradually replaced the Celtic languages, which were related to it by a shared [[Proto-Indo-European|Indo-European origin]]. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," p. 550; Stefan Zimmer, "Indo-European," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 961; Leonard A. Curchin, "Literacy in the Roman Provinces: Qualitative and Quantitative Data from Central Spain," ''American Journal of Philology'' 116.3 (1995), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narbonensis|Mediterranean Gaul]] ([[southern France]]) had become trilingual (Greek, Latin, Gaulish) by the mid-1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]] as quoted by [[Isidore of Seville]], ''Origines'' 15.1.63, ''trilingues quod et graece loquantur et latine et gallice''; Edgar C. Polomé, "The Linguistic Situation in the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II (De Gruyter, 1983), p. 527; Philip Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'' (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2001), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Latin in gaining access to the ruling power structure caused the rapid extinction of inscriptions in scripts that had been used to represent local languages on the [[Iberian peninsula]] ''([[Roman Spain|Hispania]])'' and in Gaul. Among other aspects of a distinctive [[Gallo-Roman culture]] was the creation of Gallo-Latin text.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, "Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power," pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin commemorative inscriptions, individuals with Celtic names rarely identify themselves as "Celtic" or "Gallic"; they are much more likely to name the people of their ''[[civitas]]'' (such as [[Aedui]], [[Remi]], [[Pictones]])&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' p. 8, especially note 10.&lt;/ref&gt; or their [[Roman voting tribes|voting tribe ''(tribus)'']] as Roman citizens.  Several major writers of Latin came from the Iberian peninsula in the Imperial period, including [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Lucan]], [[Quintilian]],&lt;ref&gt;Herman, ''Vulgar Latin,'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martial]], and [[Prudentius]]. However despite acquisition of Latin, Gaulish is held by some to have held on quite a long time, lasting at least until the middle of the 6th century CE, despite considerable Romanization in the local material culture.&lt;ref name=Helix/&gt; 

Most of the 136 Greek inscriptions from Mediterraean Gaul (the [[Narbonensis]]), including those from originally [[Greek colonies]], are post-[[Augustus|Augustan]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' pp. 266, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Their content indicates that Greek was used increasingly for specialized purposes: "education, medicine, acting, agonistic activities, art, magic, religion, including Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions from [[Marseilles]] (ancient Massilia), founded as a Greek [[Phocaea]]n colony around 600 BC, show the continued use of Greek, especially in education and medicine, into the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen,  ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Latin poet and scholar [[Ausonius]], from [[Gallia Aquitania]] (present-day [[Bordeaux]]), characterizes his physician father as speaking Attic Greek with more eloquence than Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Ausonius, ''Epicedion in patrem'' 9–10 (a [[First-person narrative|first-person]] poem written in the voice of his father); J.N. Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 356–357, especially note 109, citing R.P.H. Green, ''The Works of Ausonius'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 1991), p. 276 on the view that Gaulish was the native language of Iulius Ausonius. Adams is inclined to believe that he simply spoke Latin with a Gaulish accent. See also Mullen, ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' p. 269 (note 19).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basque language|Basque]], not an Indo-European language, survived in the region of the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;Karmele Rotaetxe, "Basque as a Literary Language," in ''A Comparative History of Literatures in the Iberian Peninsula'' (John Benjamins, 2010), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day [[Aquitaine]] and [[Navarre]]) were regarded by [[Julius Caesar]] as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the [[Aquitanian language]] they spoke was [[Vasconic language|Vasconic]] like Basque, judging from place names. The [[Aquitani]] adopted Latin under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Clackson and Horrocks, ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language'', pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaulish was probably spoken in central and northern parts of Gaul into the 4th and possibly 5th century, and in [[Brittany]] (ancient [[Aremorica]]) perhaps into the 6th.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, ''Vulgar Latin,'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin did not become as deeply entrenched in the [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]], and may have dwindled rapidly after the Roman withdrawal around 410 AD, although pockets of Latin-speaking Britons survived in western Britain until about 700 AD.&lt;ref name= C-E&gt;{{cite book |title=Wales and the Britons, 350-1064 |last=Charles-Edwards |first=T. M. |year=2012 |isbn=0198217315 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman, ''Vulgar Latin,'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of Latin loanwords into [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] suggests that the Latin of Roman Britain was academic, in contrast to the everyday conversational Latin ("Vulgar" Latin) on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===African provinces===
[[File:Inscription Theatre Leptis Magna Libya.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Bilingual Latin-Punic inscription at the theatre in [[Leptis Magna]] in present-day Libya]]

In the [[Africa (Roman province)|provinces of Africa]] westwards of [[Cyrenaica]] (a region colonised by Greeks since the 7th century BC), the people of Carthage and other [[Phoenician colonies]] spoke and wrote Punic, with Latin common in urban centers. Other Roman Africans spoke [[Afroasiatic languages]] ([[Eastern Berber languages|Libyan]], [[Numidian language|Numidian]]), debatably early versions of [[Berber language|Berber]].&lt;ref&gt;Clackson and Horrocks, ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language'', pp. 86–87; Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," pp. 128–129, expressing skepticism about identifying the non-Punic languages of North Africa as "Berber".&lt;/ref&gt;

Punic was used for legends on coins during the time of [[Tiberius]] (1st century AD), and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century, some bilingual with Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, "Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power," pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions might also be trilingual: one pertaining to [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] presents "the official Latin, the local Punic, and the Greek of passing traders and an educated or cosmopolitan elite".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Neo-Punic and Latin Inscriptions in Roman North Africa," pp. 284, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions in Libyan use a script similar to ''[[tifinagh]]'', usually written vertically from the bottom up. The 23 characters are "of a rather rigid geometric form".&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual examples are found with either Punic or Latin, and indicate that some people who could write these languages could also at least transliterate their names into the Libyan script. Although Libyan inscriptions are concentrated southeast of [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]], near the present-day Algerian-Tunisia border, their distribution overall suggests that knowledge of the language was not confined to isolated communities.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," pp. 128–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable writers of Latin from Africa during the Imperial period include the novelist [[Apuleius]], and the [[Church Fathers]] [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine]]. Latin-speaking communities remained in North Africa, particularly around Carthage, during the period of the [[Vandal Kingdom]] (435–534), but died out by the late 7th century, with the Arab conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, ''Vulgar Latin,'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[File:Wheat transport BM Gr1999.6-29.1.jpg|thumb|left|Fragment from a storage vessel recording in Coptic the transport of wheat to a mill, dated June 2, 321 AD]]
In Egypt, Coptic predominated,&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," pp. 558–559.&lt;/ref&gt; but Greek had been in use since the conquest of Alexander, and Latin and Greek were the administrative languages during the Roman Imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''From the Nile to the Rhone,'' p. 226.&lt;!--ADDITIONAL CIT NEEDED FOR LATIN--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandria]], founded in 331 BC under Greek rule and one of the three largest cities of the Roman Empire, was a leading city in Greek intellectual life during the Hellenistic and Imperial periods. Famed for the [[Library of Alexandria]], it was also a center for the dissemination of Christianity, which spread first among Greek speakers in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''From the Nile to the Rhone,'' p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 700 AD, Greek was replaced for administrative use by [[History of Arabic|Arabic]], the language of the conquerors. Coptic began to decline, and from this point was preserved mainly for liturgical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''From the Nile to the Rhone,'' p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern empire===
Although Greek was in common use around the Mediterranean and into Asia Minor even beyond Imperial borders, linguistic distribution in the eastern part of the Empire was complex. Now-[[extinct language]]s in [[Anatolia]] included [[Galatian language|Galatian]] (the form of Celtic introduced by invading Gauls in the 3rd century BC), [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], [[Pisidian language|Pisidian]], and [[Ancient Cappadocian language|Cappadocian]], attested by Imperial-era inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, "Communicating Culture, Identity, and Power," p. 58; Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian sources also mention the survival of Galatian, Cappadocian, [[Mysian language|Mysian]], and [[Isaurian language|Isaurian]] in Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Greek and Latin, these are categorized as Indo-European. Phrygian is not named as a language in a literary text until the 6th century, but is preserved in about a hundred funerary inscriptions in Greek script, most accompanied by Greek text as well and dating from the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; A Cappadocian accent in speaking Greek seems to be mentioned in a few sources.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," p. 127, citing [[Philostratus]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman military diploma Carnuntum 00.jpg|thumb|[[Roman military diploma]] in Latin dated June 13, 80 AD, from [[Carnuntum]], in the Danubian province of [[Noricum]]]]
Outside the military, Latin never became the language of everyday life in the East. An exception was the [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] of [[Berytus]] (present-day Beirut), where a Latin education could be obtained, and which became famous for its [[Law School of Beirut|school of Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Morgan, "Education," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danubian provinces and Balkans===
The [[Danubian provinces]] lay within a geographical area encompassing the middle and lower [[Danube basin]]s, the [[Eastern Alps]], the [[Dinarides]], and the [[Balkan mountains|Balkans]]. Provinces in this general region include [[Noricum]], [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Moesia]], [[Thracia|Thrace]], [[Scythia Minor|Scythia]], and [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Wilkes, "The Roman Danube: An Archaeological Survey," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 95 (2005), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; 
The relative influence of Latin versus Greek and vice versa in this area and in the Balkans in general, is sometimes demarcated by the [[Jireček Line]].

Greek had been in use in the southern part of the Balkans since the late 4th century BC, as a result of the Macedonian conquests of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] and Alexander. The [[ancient Macedonian language]], perhaps a Greek dialect,&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the modern [[Macedonian language]], which is [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]].&lt;/ref&gt; may have been spoken in some parts of what is now Macedonia and northern Greece; to the north of this area, [[Paeonian language|Paeonian]] would have been used, and to the south [[Epirus|Epirot]], both scantily attested.&lt;ref&gt;Clackson and Horrocks, ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] was spoken in the northwest, and to the northeast [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Dacian language|Dacian]].&lt;ref&gt;Clackson and Horrocks, ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; These three languages, all Indo-European, are sometimes thought to be earlier forms of [[Albanian language|Albanian]].&lt;ref&gt;Clackson and Horrocks, ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; From his exile in Tomis on the [[Black Sea]] (present-day [[Constanța]], Romania), the Augustan poet [[Ovid]] learned [[Getic language|Getic]] and [[Sarmatian language|Sarmatian]], and noted that Greek was spoken with a markedly Getic accent.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," p. 126, citing also L.P. Wilkinson, ''Ovid Recalled'' (1955), ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions from Tomis in the Imperial period are generally Greek, with Thracian personal names and religious references.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, "Local Cultures in the Roman Empire," p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish diaspora===
[[File:DuraSyn-III-Jeremiah.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ezra]] or [[Jeremiah]] reading from a scroll, in a painting from the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] (3rd century)]]
Inscriptions in Greek and Latin set up by Jews attest to Jewish bi- or multilingualism, and their distribution in the Empire reflects the [[Jewish diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Mission and Conversion,'' pp. 48, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  These may have the Hebrew tag ''[[shalom]]'' at the end.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, introduction to ''Multilingualism in the Graeco-Roman Worlds,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for Jews in Egypt is preserved by papyri until the [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt of 116–117]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Mission and Conversion,'' p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 5th century, Greek coexisted with Hebrew and [[Jewish Aramaic]] in the Jewish communities of [[Palaestina Prima]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Secunda]], and is found in mosaic inscriptions even in synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Mission and Conversion,'' p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jews writing in Greek during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial period—notably the philosopher [[Philo]] and the historian [[Josephus]]—included [[gentiles]] among their intended audience.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Mission and Conversion'', pp. 53, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sibylline Oracles]] and the [[Wisdom of Solomon]] are other examples of Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Mission and Conversion,'' pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

No surviving Greek texts written after the year 100 can be securely identified as having a Jewish author. After this time, Jewish writings in Greek became irrelevant to Christians, who were thus unlikely to preserve them. The manuscription tradition of [[Jews in the Middle Ages|medieval Jewish culture]] has preserved only writings in Hebrew and Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''Mission and Conversion'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian communities===
The ''[[Epistle to Diognetus]]'' states that language was not a determining factor in Christian identity; Christians might speak any language.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Price, "Latin Christian Apologetics: Minucius Felix, Tertullian, and Cyprian," in ''Apologetics in the Roman Empire: Pagans, Jews, and Christians'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; By late antiquity, at least some [[Christian literature]] had been created for virtually every language in regular use throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Valantasis, introduction to ''Religions of Late Antiquity'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|thumb|This funerary stele (3rd century) is among the [[early Christian inscriptions|earliest Christian inscriptions]]: the abbreviation ''D.M.'' at the top refers to the [[Manes|Di Manes]], the old Roman spirits of the dead, but accompanies Christian anchor and  [[Ichthys|fish symbolism]] expressed by the Greek phrase "Fish of the Living", followed by the deceased's epitaph in Latin&lt;ref&gt;Robin Margaret Jensen, ''Understanding Christian Art'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 51; Alison E. Cooley, ''The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The international use of Greek was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State,'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, presumably knew some Greek, but Latin was spoken in his court, and he used an interpreter to address Greek-speaking bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edwards, "The Constantinian Circle and the Oration to the Saints," in ''Apologetics,'' p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian Latin West, Greek became associated with "[[Hellenes (religion)|paganism]]" and regarded as a foreign language (''lingua peregrina)''.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Confessions'' 1.14.23; Moatii, "Translation, Migration, and Communication," p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Augustine confessed that he loathed Greek and found it hard to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Confessions'' 1.13.20 and 2.38.91; Moatti, "Translation, Migration, and Communication," p. 112, note 16.&lt;/ref&gt; By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a "Hellene" in matters of religion and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Swain, "Defending Hellenism: Philostratus, in Honour of Apollonius," in ''Apologetics,'' p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated,&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Acta Conciliorum'' ("Acts of the Church Councils") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into Latin, Syriac, or Coptic.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Latin played only a subordinate role in the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]], as did representatives from the Western empire.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Although traditionally [[Armenian language|Armenian]] is regarded as having been established as a Christian language by this time, it does not appear in the ''Acta''.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; There are hints that Coptic might be spoken at the councils, but no secure record.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; On-the-spot translation into Greek was available for the participant who used his own language, including some who are referred to as "[[Arabs]]", "[[Saracens]]" or "[[Ishmaelites]]".&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian content has been found in a few Arabic inscriptions from the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual language==
The form of private or personalized ritual characterized as [[magic in the Greco-Roman world|"magic"]]&lt;ref&gt;Alderik Bloom, "''Linguae sacrae'' in Ancient and Medieval Sources: An Anthropological Approach to Ritual Language," in ''Multilingualism in the Graeco-Roman Worlds,'' p. 124, prefers "ritual" to the problematic distinction between "religion" and "magic" in antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; might be conducted in a hodgepodge of languages. Magic, and even some therapies for illnesses, almost always involved incantation or the reciting of spells ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmina]])'', often accompanied by the ritualized creation of inscribed tablets ''(lamellae)'' or [[amulet]]s. These are known from both archaeological artifacts and written texts such as the [[Greek Magical Papyri]], a collection of spells dating variously from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. Although Augustus attempted to suppress magic [[book burning|by burning]] some 2,000 esoteric books early in his reign,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Dieter Betz]], "Introduction to the Greek Magical Papyri," ''The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells'' (University of Chicago Press, 1986, 1996), p. xli.&lt;/ref&gt; magical practices were disseminated widely throughout the Greco-Roman world, and attest to an awareness of multilingualism among the peoples of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Breshear, "The Greek Magical Papyri: An Introduction and Survey," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II 18.5 (1994), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; Spells were not translated, because their efficacy was thought to reside in their precise wording;&lt;ref&gt;Blom, "''Linguae sacrae''," p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; a language such as Gaulish thus may have persisted for private ritual purposes when it no longer had everyday currency.&lt;ref&gt;James Clackson, "Language Maintenance and Shift," in ''Multilingualism in the Graeco-Roman Worlds,'' p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magical book Kircherian Terme.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Bound lead tablets of magic inscriptions (300–500 AD)]]
The Greek Magical Papyri ''(PGM)'' reflect Greco-Egyptian [[interpretatio graeca|syncretism]], incorporating not only [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] and [[Hellenistic religion]], but Near Eastern elements, including [[Practical Kabbalah|Jewish magic]] and dashes of [[Gospel magic|Christian magic]]. Egyptian and Greek deities, the [[Jewish God|God of the Jews]] and [[Angels in Judaism|Judaic angels]], and [[Jesus]] are named. The ''PGM'' are written primarily in Greek with substantial passages in [[Demotic Egyptian]]&lt;ref&gt;Betz, introduction to "The Greek Magical Papyri," pp. xlv–xlvi; Janet H. Johnson, "Introduction to the Demotic Magical Papyri," p. lv in the same volume (page numbering of the two introductions is independent, not sequential).&lt;/ref&gt; and inserted strings of syllables that are "pronounceable, though unintelligible".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Bonner, “Harpokrates (Zeus Kasios) of Pelusium,” ''Hesperia'' 15 (1946), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; These ''[[voces magicae]]'' ("magic words") occur throughout magic texts and inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the ''PGM,'' charms are common in texts from late antiquity, including the collected pharmacological recipes of Marcellus of Bordeaux; Pseudo-Apuleius, ''Herbarius''; [[Sextus Placitus]], ''Liber medicinae ex animalibus''; ''Hippiatrica''; ''[[Physica Plinii]]''; Pseudo-Dioscurides, ''De herbis feminis''; and the Anglo-Saxon ''[[Lacnunga]]''. See Blom, "''Linguae sacrae''," p. 127, note 22. Inscriptions are found on amulets, [[intaglio gem]]s, [[incantation bowl]]s, curse tablets, and ''lamellae'' (metal-leaf tablets).&lt;/ref&gt; and often suggest corrupt Coptic or Egyptian,&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Graf, “Prayer in Magic and Religious Ritual,” in ''Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion,'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 191, and Roy Kotansky, “Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amulets,” also in ''Magika Hiera,'' p. 132, note 60, both on Egyptian; John G.  Gager, “A New Translation of Ancient Greek and Demotic Papyri, Sometimes Called Magical,” ''Journal of Religion'' 67 (1987), p. 83 on Coptic.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;Gager, “A New Translation of Ancient Greek and Demotic Papyri,", p. 83; Paul Mirecki, “The Coptic Wizard's Hoard,” ''Harvard Theological Review'' 87 (1994), pp. 457–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Aramaic or other Semitic languages,&lt;ref&gt;Kotansky, “Incantations and Prayers for Salvation," p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; and Celtic.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''La langue gauloise'', pp. 176–178, particularly on a 3rd–4th century tablet from the Gallo-Roman town [[Rom, Deux-Sèvres|Rom]] that may be Celtic in a Latin context.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hebrew and Greek appear in Demotic magical texts; Coptic magic incorporates Hebrew; Egyptian pops up in Latin spells.&lt;ref&gt;Breshear, "The Greek Magical Papyri," p. 3435.&lt;/ref&gt; While many ''voces magicae'' may be deliberate [[neologism]]s or [[obscurantism]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Klinghardt, “Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,” ''Numen'' 46 (1999), p. 50; Hans Dieter Betz, "Secrecy in the Greek Magical Papyri," in ''Secrecy and Concealment: Studies in the History of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Religions'' (Leiden 1995), 153–175, especially 158–164; Brashear, “The Greek Magical Papyri," p. 3434.&lt;/ref&gt; scholars have theorized that the more recognizable passages may be the products of garbled or misunderstood transmission, either in copying a source text or transcribing oral material.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Janko, “Forgetfulness in the Golden Tablets of Memory,” ''Classical Quarterly'' 34 (1984), pp. 89–100 on problems of oral transcription; Graf, “Prayer in Magic and Religious Ritual,” p. 191; Betz, "The Greek Magical Papyri," p. xlvi; Breshear, "The Greek Magical Papyri," pp. 3434–3438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions for the practice of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century [[curse tablet]] from Autun ([[Augustodunum]]) lists the names of those to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of ''voces magicae''.&lt;ref&gt;''IGF'' 159; Mullen,  ''Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean,'' pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[defixio]]'' (binding spell) from [[Amélie-les-Bains]] seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''lamella'' from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.&lt;ref&gt;L.C. Youtie, "A Medical Prescription for Eye-salve," ''ZPE'' 23 (1976), pp. 121–29&lt;!--this citation may be incorrect--&gt;; Collingwood and Wright, “Roman Inscriptions of Britain I” (Oxford 1965), p. 144, no. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in late antiquity might insert Hebrew into Greek exorcisms.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Origen]], ''Commentary on Matthew'' (''PG'' 13.1757): ''Hebraeo acceptis adiurant daemonia''; Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Jerome]] reports an odd story about a [[Frankish language|Frankish]]-Latin bilingual man of the ''[[Scholae Palatinae|Candidati]]'' Imperial bodyguard who, in a state of [[demonic possession]], began speaking perfect Aramaic, a language he did not know.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Vita Hilarionis'' 13.7: ''videres de ore barbaro, et qui Francam tantum et Latinam linguam noverat, Syra ad purum verba resonare'': Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language,'' p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal language==
[[Roman law]] was written in Latin, and the "letter of the law" was tied strictly to the words in which it was expressed.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Any language, however, could be binding in more general [[verbal contract]]s and procedures grounded in the ''[[ius gentium]]'' or international law.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ius gentium'' was not a written legal code, but was thought to exist among all peoples as a matter of [[natural law]]. Roman [[jurist]]s show a concern for local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding and application of laws and oaths.&lt;ref&gt;Rochette, "Language Policies in the Roman Republic and Empire," pp. 558–559.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin until the 220s,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language," pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[legal opinion]] of [[Ulpian]] (ca. 215), ''[[fideicommissa]]'' ([[bequest]]s in [[Trust law|trust]]&lt;ref&gt;W.W. Buckland ''A Textbook of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian'', 3rd ed. edited by Peter Stein (Cambridge University Press, 1921, 2007), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;) were not limited to Latin or even Greek, but could also be created in "Punic, Gaulish or any other" language.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 32.11 pr.; [[Ramsey MacMullen]], "Provincial Languages in the Roman Empire," ''American Journal of Philology'' 87.1 (1966), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, a [[testator]]'s ''fideicommissum'' placed the heir under a moral rather than legal obligation,&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berg, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1980, 1991), pp. 470–471. In late antiquity, ''fideicommissa'' could be legally binding as well.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ulpian asserted that "any kind of speech contains the obligation of its words, provided that each party understands the other's language himself or through accurate interpreters".&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 45.1.1.6; MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gaius (jurist)|jurist Gaius]] distinguished between verbal contracts that derived their validity from formulaic utterance in Latin, and obligations expressing a mutual understanding of the ''ius gentium'' regardless of whether the parties were Roman or not.&lt;ref&gt;Gaius, ''Institutiones'' 3.93; MacMullen, "Provincial Languages," pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic legacy==
{{main article|Romance languages}}
[[File:Vatra.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Map showing in pink area where [[Romance languages]] were spoken in Eastern Europe in the 4-7th century.]]
[[File:Romance 14c en.png|thumb|Map showing distribution of Romance languages in the 14th century]]
After the decentralization of political power in late antiquity, Latin developed locally in the Western provinces into branches that became the [[Romance languages]], including [[History of Spanish|Spanish]], [[History of the Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[History of French|French]], [[History of Italian|Italian]], [[History of Romanian|Romanian]] and [[History of Catalan|Catalan]]. As an international language of learning and literature, Latin itself continued as an active medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with [[Renaissance humanism]] up to the 17th century, and for [[legal Latin|law]] and the [[Church Latin|Roman Catholic Church]] to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Waquet, ''Latin, Or, The Empire of the Sign: From the Sixteenth to the Twentieth Century'' (Verso, 2001; originally published 1998 in French), pp. 1–2; Kristian Jensen, "The Humanist Reform of Latin and Latin Teaching," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'' (Cambridge University Press, 1996, 2003), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek continued as the language of the Byzantine Empire, but never replaced certain [[Afroasiatic languages]] with which it had long coexisted—primarily Coptic in Egypt, and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, "''Romanitas'' and the Latin Language,"  p. 199; Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society,'' pp. 5, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latino World Order''' (abbreviated '''lWo''' or '''LWO''') was a [[professional wrestling]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] that existed in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1998 and 1999 led by [[Eddie Guerrero]]. The name of the stable was invented by [[Jason Hervey]] and was inspired by and intended as a mockery of the famous [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo).

==History==
===Concept===
The LWO was formed in late 1998 after [[Eddie Guerrero]]'s spat with WCW head [[Eric Bischoff]], a real-life conflict that was turned into a storyline.&lt;ref name=eddie169&gt;Guerrero, Eddie. ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'', p. 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the group was the idea of [[Jason Hervey]], a friend of Bischoff.&lt;ref name=eddie172/&gt; The stable was originally supposed to revolve around [[Konnan]], but it was given to Guerrero after Konnan joined the nWo Wolfpac.&lt;ref name=eddie172/&gt;

===Beginnings===
On August 17, Guerrero gave a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work| shoot]], where he claimed to want out of his contract.&lt;ref name=eddie169/&gt; After being taken off television for several weeks, Guerrero returned on the October 5 edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', forming the LWO with several other Mexican wrestlers.&lt;ref name=eddie172&gt;Guerrero, Eddie. ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'', p. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Steel Chair to the Head|last=Sammond|first=Nicholas|pages=248–249|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8223-3438-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group consisted of the majority of the Mexican roster, as well as Guerrero's friend Art Flores, who played the role of a bodyguard named Spyder.&lt;ref name=eddie174/&gt;

The group consisted of almost every major [[Mexico|Mexican]] wrestler on the WCW roster including [[Psicosis|Psychosis]], [[Adolfo Tapia|La Parka]], [[Hector Garza]], and [[Juventud Guerrera]]. Their main feud lied with [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]], after he refused to join the group.&lt;ref name=eddie174&gt;Guerrero, Eddie. ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'', p. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt; They also feuded with [[Billy Kidman]], Mysterio's on-and-off American tag team partner. Mysterio was forced to become a member after losing a match to Eddie Guerrero. [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] attempted to join several times, but Eddie did not allow him to become a member since Chavo was ([[kayfabe]]) mentally unstable at the time and carried around a [[Hobby horse (toy)|wooden horse]] named Pepé.

===Demise and aftermath===
A car accident suffered by Guerrero on January 1, 1999 would help bring a premature end to the LWO.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Eddie. ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, the two factions of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)#1999|New World Order reunited]], and before long, various members of the LWO were found lying unconscious backstage. The nWo approached the LWO and demanded they immediately disband or face further consequences. The next week Ric Flair also asked the LWO to disband and fight for WCW promising he would treat them better than Bischoff did and also promising them money, women and limousines. Every member other than Mysterio agreed, removing their LWO shirts and exiting the ring. Mysterio, who was not originally a willing member of the group, proved himself the most loyal when he refused to remove his LWO colors. The nWo beat him down and forcibly tore off his LWO shirt, leading to a feud between Mysterio and [[The Outsiders (WCW)|The Outsiders]].

The reunited nWo also betrayed their only Latino member, [[Konnan]], who had objected to the brutality used against Mysterio, leading them to form a team against The Outsiders. As Eddie Guerrero healed and made his in-ring return, key LWO members such as himself, Mysterio, and Juventud Guerrera formed a popular new group with Konnan known as [[The Filthy Animals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22779">The following is a list of stories written by [[Stuart McLean]] featuring his popular fictional characters "Dave and Morley" from the radio program ''[[The Vinyl Cafe]]''. First read on air in 1994, many of the stories were eventually compiled in book form, followed by audio recording compilations from the program.

Note that this list features only the stories that have been published in book form and on audio. Numerous other stories have been written and read out loud on the radio show, but are not currently listted. Several stories also have titles in the book different from those on the audio versions.

The first collection of stories in book form, ''Stories from the Vinyl Cafe,'' contains several stories that did not feature Dave and Morley or any other characters acquainted with them. Subsequent collections of stories featured Dave and Morley-related content exclusively.

==Characters==
The major characters in the stories are Dave, Morley, their family and assorted friends and neighbours. The family's last name is never mentioned, although in one story Dave's mother's name is given as Margaret McNeal.

===Dave, Morley, and Family===
* '''Dave''' is in his late forties to early fifties. He runs an [[Independent business|independent]] [[record store]], called "The Vinyl Cafe", whose slogan is "We may not be big, but we're small". Dave represents an alternative view on life that is not based on financial success and status but on human relationships and music. He grew up in Big Narrows, on [[Cape Breton Island]], where his mother Margaret still resides. Dave is frequently neurotic and prone to small accidents and mishaps that he usually inadvertently escalates into major ones and he is somewhat of a [[hypochondriac]]. He is painfully awkward and a terrible liar. These attributes motivate many of the stories, which range from an incident with the Christmas turkey, to accidentally destroying Mary Turlington's treasured candles, to filling the elementary school playground with frogs. It is his wife, Morley, who often has to resolve the mess Dave creates.
:Dave enjoys a good prank and has a tradition of pulling outrageous jokes on his friend, Kenny Wong (owner of "Wong's Scottish Meat Pies"), every [[April Fools' Day]]. Dave worked as a tour manager "for some of the best indie acts; certainly for some of the weirdest" before he met Morley. His enjoyment of pranks is seen in his younger days as a tour manager, as well. Dave's last name has never been revealed; although in "School Days", his mother's last name is McNeal, it's unclear whether she uses her married name or reverted to her maiden name after Dave's father died.
* '''Morley''' was a stay-at-home mom, until she re-entered the workforce. She is currently employed at a local theatre. She loves to [[figure skating|figure-skate]]. She and Dave first met at an ice-rink in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], when they were in their twenties. She is often more level-headed and practical than Dave and frequently long suffering when it comes to his adventures. Morley works hard at running the family and, more often than not, Dave is more like a third child to her. Dave will then go to great lengths to prove his love again. Morley was named for McLean's personal friend David Morley;&lt;ref name=morley&gt;"David Morley". ''[[Here and Now (Toronto)|Here and Now]]'' ([[CBLA-FM]]), February 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the story "Skunks", the first to introduce Morley, was inspired by a real incident that had happened to David Morley's family.&lt;ref name=morley/&gt; 
* '''Stephanie''' is a jaded and skeptical Toronto teenager who often fights with her brother Sam. In the first stories, she was fourteen or fifteen years old. She was frequently rebellious and sullen which led to many disagreements with her parents and Sam. In more recent stories, she attends university in another city and dates a young man named Tommy Nowlan. Since then, some episodes feature coming of age stories. She spent one summer planting trees north of [[Thunder Bay]]. Soon after her job ended, Stephanie visited her aged 'Aunt Dorothy' in England. She assumed that she would dislike the trip but discovered an interest in history and the past while away.
* '''Sam''' is about seven or eight years younger than Stephanie. In many stories, he was referred to as seven; although his age has recently made a jump to age eleven. Only a few stories have Sam placed at any age between seven and eleven. Despite his ineptitude at sports, he plays goalie on his [[hockey]] team and plays on the girls field hockey team, which was the subject of one story. He likes to [[knitting|knit]] and help his neighbours, Eugene and Maria. Sam is frequently portrayed as sensitive, slightly goofy and often naive. Several of his friends have been minor characters in several stories.  This includes a skateboarding girl whom he met on a school trip to [[Quebec City]], when he missed the bus to an [[IMAX]] theatre;  although they spoke different languages and he never got her contact information or even her name, it proved an exhilaratingly romantic experience for the boy. According to Stuart McLean's friends and colleagues, Sam is the character who most resembles McLean himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Canada's Storyteller: A Tribute to Stuart McLean''. [[CBC Radio]], February 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Arthur''' is the family dog. He likes soft ice-cream and  considers himself dominant to Dave (much to Dave's surprise) and steals socks and potatoes. He was once a sheep in a Christmas pageant. Arthur is considered a full family member. In a story at the end of the ''Revenge of the Vinyl Cafe'' collection (2015), Arthur dies of old age and is mourned by the family. After the story of his death was originally broadcast on the radio show, McLean named his "Arthur Awards", an annual episode in which he would present awards to people whose acts of kindness and generosity were nominated by listeners, after the dog.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/remembering-stuart-what-everyday-act-of-an-ordinary-person-in-your-community-do-you-think-should-be-honoured-1.3987950 "Remembering Stuart: What everyday act of an ordinary person in your community do you think should be honoured?"] ''[[Cross Country Checkup]]'', February 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Galway''' is the mysterious family cat, who came from Dave's sister Annie, and is named for American poet [[Galway Kinnell]]. Galway was intentionally brought on one family vacation and accidentally came on another, by stowing away in the trunk. The vacation was ruined partially due to her. She was briefly toilet-trained (until she almost flushed herself down the toilet) but still enjoys flushing the toilet when the bathroom door is left open.
*'''Margaret''' is Dave's mother. She still lives in Dave's childhood home in Big Narrows. Before retirement, Margaret taught elementary school in Big Narrows and was known for her ability to burp the alphabet. After the death of her husband and Dave's father, Charlie, she was a widow for many years. She recently remarried a local volunteer firefighter named Smith Gardener. 
*'''Charlie''' is Dave's father. He died before the stories began and in the story ''Fish Head'', Dave mentions that Charlie died just before Sam was born. Charlie was musically talented and introduced both his children to music. He would wake them up singing each morning and would often have local musicians over to the house for an informal jam session.  
*'''Annie''' is Dave's younger sister. The age gap is never clear but seems to be about five years. Annie is a concert violinist and has a daughter, Molly. When she is on tour one summer, she asks Dave and Morley to care for Molly, who is ten years old at the time. Galway was given to Dave and Morley by Annie as she could not keep a cat while touring. 
*'''Helen''' is Morley's mother. In the initial stories, Helen (sometimes called Nancy) is still married to Morley's father. However, in the later stories, it is mentioned that Morley's father has died. Helen briefly lives with the family when Morley is concerned about her ability to live alone. The arrangement ends after only a few months when Helen moves into a retirement community.
*'''Aunt Dorothy''' is a cousin of Margaret. She lives in London, England, and has never married or had children. She is known for her brusqueness and impulsiveness about travel, having invited herself to go camping with Dave and his family, and having sent Stephanie, unannounced, a prepaid air ticket to London so she could visit.

===Other recurring characters===
* '''Jim Scoffield''' is Dave's closest friend and neighbour, although he has a tendency to be present at Dave's most awkward moments, such as Dave's infamous incident with the Christmas turkey. Jim is originally from the [[Annapolis Valley]], Nova Scotia. He is described as a "confirmed bachelor" and owns a cat named Molly. He briefly dated one of Dave's cousins and a romantic relationship with his friend and cat sitter has been hinted at.  
* '''Bert and Mary Turlington''' live next door to Dave and Morley. They have three children, Adam, who is younger than Stephanie, and twins Chris and Christina, who are older than Sam. Bert is a talkative [[criminal law]]yer, while Mary is a [[chartered accountant]] and Dave's neighbourhood nemesis. Her meticulous perfectionism and fixed ideas of an ordered life make her Dave's opposite; her plans and projects are frequently upended by Dave's propensity for causing chaos. Mary resents that Dave loves his job, considering his happy-go-lucky lifestyle sanctimonious and phony, while Dave thinks that Mary is stiff and intimidating.'They have a teacup Pomeranian dog named Tissue. 
* '''Ted and Polly Anderson''' are an elegant upper-class couple who throw an annual Christmas house-party. Polly is the neighbourhood's "Martha Stewart" figure and "perfect home-maker". Morley often feels inadequate around Polly. Ted is an avid cyclist.
* '''Carl and Gerta Lowbeer''' are neighbours of Morley and Dave. They are somewhat older, Carl having recently retired from his job as an [[engineer]]. He keenly missed the company fishing trip and has since started to attend the fishing tourney with Dave and other neighbours as part of his team. Since retirement, Carl has begun to take philosophy courses. Carl once asked Dave to "babysit" his sourdough bread starter, while he and Gerta were on holiday. Gerta has been revealed to be a keen birdwatcher and is a close friend of Morley. 
* '''Morty and Irene Zuckerman''' live on Brock Avenue, a five-minute walk away. Not particularly close friends, Morty's surprise invitation to dinner one night is the subject of the story "Late Date".
*'''Emir and Rashida Chudary''' are new residents in Dave and Morley's neighbourhood. Emir considers Dave to be an imbecile &amp; their families do not socialize much. However, Emirs' attitude softens after Rashida recruits Dave to help their young daughter Fatima overcome her [[nightmares]], a problem Dave's daughter Stephanie also suffered from at a young age. Their lack of understanding of Canadian gift giving expectations at Christmas sparks a mass gift exchange in the neighbourhood on one occasion. Sam and his friend Murphy occasionally babysit Fatima one summer, which prompts the creation of the infamous water slide.  
* '''Eugene and Maria Conte''' are an elderly couple who live next-door. Eugene loves to garden. His famous fig tree is the focus of a story. Maria loves to dote on the children. They have a son, Anthony Thomas, who lives in London. They have always called Anthony Thomas "Tony" but he has been going by his middle name ever since moving to England. Eugene is originally from a village in Calabria called Rendi in Fiori. Sam and Eugene are friends, and Sam helps with the emails that Tony sends them. Eugene makes home-made wine, and has offered it to Sam on several occasions. He tends to smoke cigars. Dave is often concerned about their well being and their strange habit of only living in the basement of their house but realizes they will ask for help when they need it. Morely first meets Maria when brings over a basket of homegrown tomatoes after Stephanie is born. 
* '''Kenny Wong''' runs Wong's Scottish Meat Pies, a shop located near the Vinyl Cafe. It is largely referred to as a Chinese restaurant, but has once supplied meat pies and deep-fried Mars bars to Sam's birthday party. Kenny is from the town of Burnt Creek. While he was living there, he and his family were excluded by most of the town's citizens because they were the only Chinese family living there. Kenny is known for his austerity and his loyalty to his "regulars". He enjoys pranks just as much as Dave, who is frequently the victim in his jokes, and vice versa.
* '''Murphy Kruger''' is in Sam's class and his best friend. He and Sam cause some minor mischief in several stories and live in their own world. Murphy often motivates Sam to their adventures. Murphy is Jewish and has a Bar Mitzvah in one episode. 
* '''Peter Moore''' is another one of Sam's friends. On the grade 8 trip to Quebec City, Peter spent all of his money on plastic trolls.
* '''Emil''' is a homeless man who resides around the Vinyl Cafe and occasionally asks for money from various people around the neighbourhood. He has his own philosophy of life, and is a lovable misfit who for some time had his own library in a shopping cart and started gardening plants in public places. He once won ten thousand dollars in the lottery, which he quickly gave away to his regular donors.
*'''Dorothy Capper''' is a friend of Dave's, who owns "Woodsworth's Books". Her store is located down the street from the Vinyl Cafe, and Dave frequently stops by just to hang out and ask for advice on some neurotic problem. There have been two stories focused on her in the series. The first one is about her problems with her dog, Stanley, and the second is about her growing disinterest in owning a book store. At the end of the story, her zest for selling books is renewed and she continues to run her store.
*'''Marcus Portnoy''' is the bully at Sam's school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11163">Since its mass rollout, some of 2004 and 2005's most popular albums have been released on [[DualDisc]] in the hopes that the extra exposure will help the new technology gain acceptance in the marketplace.

Note: A typical [[DualDisc]] will have a DVD side that is [[DVD-Audio]] formatted. However, this is not the case with several titles. Instead, a standard DVD-Video format DVD side will be present, and will not actually meet the high-fidelity sound that [[DVD-Audio]] provides. In other words, not all DualDisc titles are also DVD-Audio titles.

==High profile DualDisc releases==
Some of the high-profile titles which have seen release on DualDisc include:

[[Folk music]] is one of the major divisions of [[music]], now often divided into traditional folk music and contemporary folk music.  There are many styles of folk music, all of which can be classified into various traditions, generally based around some combination of ethnic, racial, religious, tribal, political or geographic boundaries.

*[[List of North American folk music traditions|North]], [[List of Central American folk music traditions|Central]], [[List of South American folk music traditions|South American]] and the [[List of Caribbean folk music traditions|Caribbean]]
*[[List of Asian folk music traditions|Asia]]: East, Southeast, Northern, Central, Caucasus and South Asia
*[[List of European folk music traditions|Europe]]: Northern, Eastern, Southeastern, Western and Southern Europe
*[[List of Middle Eastern and North African folk music traditions|Middle East and North Africa]]: Southwest Asia, North Africa
*[[List of Oceanic and Australian folk music traditions|Oceania and Australia]]: Polynesia, Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia
*[[List of Sub-Saharan African folk music traditions|Sub-Saharan Africa]]: East, Southern, Central and West Africa

As well as dividing songs according to geography, it is possible to categorise them by subject matter:

* [[War song]]
* [[Anti-war song]]
* [[Tamang Selo]]
* [[Sea song (genre)|Sea songs]], including [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]]
* [[Drinking song]]
* [[Work song]]
* [[Love song]]
* [[Child Ballads]] (tragic ballads)
* [[Protest song]]
* [[Murder ballad]]
* [[Sporting song]]

Other folk music relates to social events:

* [[Christmas carol]]
* [[Pub session]]

This is a list of symbols used in all branches of [[mathematics]] to express a formula or to represent a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]].

A mathematical concept is independent of the symbol chosen to represent it. For many of the symbols below, the symbol is usually synonymous with the corresponding concept (ultimately an arbitrary choice made as a result of the cumulative history of mathematics), but in some situations, a different convention may be used. For example, depending on context, the [[triple bar]] "{{math|≡}}" may represent congruence or a definition. However, in mathematical logic, numerical equality is sometimes represented by "{{math|≡}}" instead of "{{math|{{=}}}}", with the latter representing equality of [[well-formed formula]]s. In short, convention dictates the meaning.

Each symbol is shown both in [[HTML]], whose display depends on the browser's access to an appropriate font installed on the particular device, and typeset as an image using [[TeX]].

==Guide==
This list is organized by symbol type and is intended to facilitate finding an unfamiliar symbol by its visual appearance. For a related list organized by mathematical topic, see [[List of mathematical symbols by subject]]. That list also includes LaTeX and HTML markup, and Unicode code points for each symbol (note that this article doesn't have the latter two, but they could certainly be added).

There is a Wikibooks guide for using maths in LaTeX,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LaTeX/Mathematics|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics|website=Wikibooks|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a comprehensive LaTeX symbol list.&lt;ref name="LaTeX_Symbols" /&gt; It is also possible to check to see if a Unicode code point is available as a LaTeX command, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=John|title=Unicode / LaTeX conversion|url=https://www.johndcook.com/unicode_latex.html|website=John Cook Consulting|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also note that where there is no LaTeX command natively available for a particular symbol (although there may be options that require adding packages), the symbol could be added via other options, such as setting the document up to support Unicode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LaTeX/Special Characters|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters|website=Wikibooks|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entering the character in a variety of ways (e.g. copying and pasting, keyboard shortcuts, the &lt;code&gt;\unicode{&lt;insertcodepoint&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
title=\unicode - Tex Command|

accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as other options&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicode characters in pdflatex output using hexcode without UTF-8 input|url=https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/89796/unicode-characters-in-pdflatex-output-using-hexcode-without-utf-8-input|website=Tex Stack Exchange|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extensive additional information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fontenc vs inputenc|url=https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44694/fontenc-vs-inputenc#44699|website=TeX Stack Exchange|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pdflatex crashes when Latex code includes \unicode{f818} and \unicode{f817} and how to handle it|url=https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/192626/pdflatex-crashes-when-latex-code-includes-unicodef818-and-unicodef817-and|website=TeX Stack Exchange|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Basic symbols:''' Symbols widely used in mathematics, roughly through first-year calculus. More advanced meanings are included with some symbols listed here.
* '''Symbols based on equality "{{math|{{=}}}}":''' Symbols derived from or similar to the equal sign, including double-headed arrows. Not surprisingly these symbols are often associated with an [[equivalence relation]].
* '''Symbols that point left or right:''' Symbols, such as {{math|&lt;}} and {{math|&gt;}}, that appear to point to one side or another.
* '''Brackets:''' Symbols that are placed on either side of a variable or expression, such as {{math|{{abs|''x''}}}}.
* '''Other non-letter symbols:''' Symbols that do not fall in any of the other categories.
* '''Letter-based symbols:''' Many mathematical symbols are based on, or closely resemble, a letter in some alphabet. This section includes such symbols, including symbols that resemble upside-down letters. Many letters have conventional meanings in various branches of mathematics and physics. These are not listed here. The [[#See also|See also]] section, below, has several lists of such usages.
** '''Letter modifiers:''' Symbols that can be placed on or next to any letter to modify the letter's meaning.
** '''Symbols based on [[English alphabet|Latin letters]]''', including those symbols that resemble or contain an {{math|X}}
** '''Symbols based on [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters''' e.g. {{math| ב ,א, δ, Δ, π, Π, σ, Σ, Φ. }} ''Note:'' symbols resembling {{math|Λ}} are grouped with "{{math|V}}" under Latin letters.
* '''Variations:''' Usage in languages written right-to-left

{{Sustainable energy}}
{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
'''Microgeneration''' is the small-scale generation of heat and [[electric power]] by individuals, small businesses and communities to meet their own needs, as alternatives or supplements to traditional centralized grid-connected power.  Although this may be motivated by practical considerations, such as unreliable grid power or long distance from the [[electrical grid]], the term is mainly used currently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or [[low-carbon]] footprints or cost reduction. It differs from [[micropower]] in that it is principally concerned with fixed [[power plant]]s rather than for use with mobile devices.

==Technologies and set-up==
Microgeneration technologies include small-scale [[wind turbines]], [[micro hydro]], [[solar PV systems]], [[microbial fuel cell]]s, [[ground source heat pump]]s, and [[micro combined heat and power]] installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/on_site_renewable_energy.html|title=On-site renewable energy - Renewable Energy - Reusable Energy - The Merton Rule - Pros Cons Renewable Energy Options - Microgeneration - Green Energy Solutions - Ground Source Heat Pumps - Green Energy Options|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies are often combined to form a [[hybrid power]] solution that can offer superior performance and lower cost than a system based on one generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ginn|first1=Claire|title=Energy pick n' mix: are hybrid systems the next big thing?|url=https://blog.csiro.au/energy-pick-n-mix-hybrid-systems-next-big-thing/|website=www.csiro.au|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=9 September 2016|date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power plant===
In addition to the electricity production plant (e.g. wind turbine and solar panel), infrastructure for [[emergency power system|energy storage and power conversion]] and a [[net metering|hook-up to the regular electricity grid]] is usually needed and/or foreseen. Although a hookup to the regular electricity grid is not essential, it helps to decrease costs by allowing [[net metering|financial recompensation schemes]]. In the developing world however, the start-up cost for this equipment is generally too high, thus leaving no choice but to opt for alternative set-ups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=269 Practical Action - Energy for rural communities]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extra equipment needed besides the power plant===
[[Image:PVSolarSystem.svg|thumb|right|250px|A complete PV-solar system]]

The whole of the equipment required to set up a working system and for an off-the-grid generation and/or a hook up to the electricity grid herefore is termed a [[balance of system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=10620|title=Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy - Department of Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is composed of the following parts with PV-systems:

====Energy storage apparatus====
A major issue with off-grid solar and wind systems is that the power is often needed when the sun is not shining or when the wind is calm, this is generally not required for purely grid-connected systems:
* a series of [[Deep cycle battery|deep cycle]], stationary or [[sealed battery|sealed maintenance free batteries]] (the most common solution) &lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=269 Practical Action - Energy for rural communities (includes short description batteries)]&lt;/ref&gt;
or other means of energy storage (e.g. hydrogen [[fuel cells]], [[Flywheel energy storage]], [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], [[compressed air]] tanks, ...)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesietch.org/projects/Hydrogenmaker/index.htm|title=Welcome to The Sietch - Projects Make Your Own Hydrogen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[charge controller]] for charging the batteries or other energy storage

For converting DC battery power into AC as required for many appliances, or for feeding excess power into a commercial power grid:
* an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] or [[Grid-tie inverter|grid-interactive inverter]]. The whole is also sometimes referred to as "power conditioning equipment"

====Safety equipment====
* [[ground (electricity)|ground]]ings, [[transfer switch]]es or  [[isolator switch]]es and [[surge protector|surge protectors]]. The whole is also sometimes referred to as "safety equipment"

Usually, in microgeneration for homes in the developing world, prefabricated house-wiring systems (as [[Cable harness|wiring harnes]]ses or prefabricated [[Power distribution unit|distribution units]]) are used instead .&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=269 Mentioning of prefabricated house-wiring and its systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Simplified house-wiring boxes and cables, known as wiring harnesses, can simply be bought and mounted into the building without requiring much knowledge about the wiring itself. As such, even people without technical expertise are able to install them. In addition, they are also comparatively cheap and offer safety advantages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=269 Benefits of wiring harnasses]&lt;/ref&gt;
* battery meters (for [[Battery charger|charging]] rate and [[voltage]]), and meters for [[power consumption]] and electricity provision to the regular power grid

[[Image:Wind generator system-vectorised.svg|thumb|right|150px|Small-scale (DIY) generation system]]
&lt;!-- keep in mind that with wind turbines, the whole of the extra equipment is not always called a balance-of-system (depending on source)--&gt;

====Wind turbine specific====

* a manual disconnect switch
* foundation for the tower
* grounding system
* shutoff and/or dummy-load devices for use in high wind when power generated exceeds current needs and storage system capacity.

===== Vibro-wind power =====

A new wind energy technology is being developed that converts energy from wind energy vibrations to electricity. This energy, called Vibro-Wind technology, can use winds of less strength than normal wind turbines, and can be placed in almost any location.
	 
A prototype consisted of a panel mounted with oscillators made out of pieces of foam. The conversion from mechanical to electrical energy is done using a piezoelectric transducer, a device made of a ceramic or polymer that emits electrons when stressed. The building of this prototype was led by Francis Moon, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at [[Cornell University]]. Moon's work in Vibro-Wind Technology was funded by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] at Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ju|first=Anne|title=Students harness vibrations from wind for electricity|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/May10/VibroWind.html|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible set-ups===
Several microgeneration set-ups are possible. These are:

*[[Off-the-grid]] set-ups which include:
** Off-the grid set-ups without energy storage (e.g., battery, ...)
** Off-the grid set-ups with energy storage (e.g., battery, ...)
** Battery charging stations &lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=269 Battery charging stations explained]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Grid-connected set-ups which include:
** Grid connected with backup to power critical loads
** Grid-connected set-ups without financial recompensation scheme
** Grid-connected set-ups with [[net metering]]
** Grid connected set-ups with [[net purchase and sale]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=10600|title=Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy - Department of Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All set-ups mentioned can work either on a single power plant or a [[combination]] of power plants (in which case it is called a [[hybrid power]] system).
For safety, grid-connected set-ups must automatically switch off or enter an "anti-islanding mode" when there is a failure of the mains power supply. For more about this, see the article on the condition of  [[islanding]].

==Costs==
Depending on the set-up chosen (financial recompensation scheme, power plant, extra equipment), prices may vary. According to [[Practical Action]], microgeneration at home which uses the latest in cost saving-technology (wiring harnesses, ready boards, cheap DIY-power plants, e.g. DIY wind turbines) the household expenditure can be extremely low-cost. In fact, Practical Action mentions that many households in farming communities in the developing world spend less than $1 for electricity per month. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?cPath=21&amp;products_id=269 Households reducing their energy ependitures to $1 a month using renewable microgeneration]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if matters are handled less economically (using more commercial systems/approaches), costs will be dramatically higher. In most cases however, financial advantage will still be done using microgeneration on renewable power plants; often in the range of 50-90% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=10880|title=Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy - Department of Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance [[power line]]s or energy losses from the [[Joule effect]] in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.schneider-electric.com/energy-management-energy-efficiency/2013/03/25/how-big-are-power-line-losses/|title=How big are Power line losses? - Schneider Electric Blog|date=25 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the government offers both grants and feedback payments to help businesses, communities and private homes to install these technologies. Businesses can write the full cost of installation off against taxable profits whilst homeowners receive a flat rate grant or payments per kW h of electricity generated and paid back into the national grid. Community organisations can also receive up to £200,000 in grant funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microgeneration.com/grants-and-funding UK Grant Funding information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109225234/http://www.microgeneration.com/grants-and-funding |date=2009-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the Microgeneration Certification Scheme provides approval for Microgeneration Installers and Products which is a mandatory requirement of funding schemes such as the Feed in Tariffs and Renewable Heat Incentive.

===Grid parity===
[[Grid parity]] (or '''socket parity''') occurs when an [[alternative energy]] source can generate electricity at a [[levelized cost]] (LCoE) that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from [[Mains electricity|the electricity grid]]. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without [[subsidy|subsidies]] or government support. It is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity.

Grid parity has been reached in some locations with on-shore wind power around 2000, and with solar power it was achieved for the first time in Spain in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2012/12/26/solar-grid-parity-comes-to-spain/|title=Solar Grid Parity Comes to Spain|first=Peter|last=Kelly-Detwiler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Spain-Achieves-Grid-Parity-for-Solar-Power.html|title=Spain Achieves Grid Parity for Solar Power - OilPrice.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conergy.com/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-136/281_read-831/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225065134/http://www.conergy.com/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-136/281_read-831/ |archivedate=2013-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microgeneration can dynamically balance the [[supply and demand]] for electric power, by producing more power during periods of high demand and high grid prices, and less power during periods of low demand and low grid prices.  This "hybridized grid" allows both microgeneration systems ''and'' large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than either could alone.

== Domestic self-sufficiency ==
{{Further|Autonomous building}}
{{See also|Earthship|Off-the-grid}}
[[File:Micro WindMill.jpg|thumb|Horizontal Axis Micro-Windmill in Lahore, 1000Watt Rated Output]]
Microgeneration can be integrated as part of a [[self-sufficient]] house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems ([[permaculture]] and [[agroecosystem]]), [[rainwater harvesting]], [[composting toilets]] or even complete [[greywater treatment]] systems. Domestic microgeneration technologies include: [[photovoltaic array|photovoltaic solar systems]], small-scale [[wind turbines]], [[micro combined heat and power]] installations, [[biodiesel]] and [[biogas]].

[[File:Quietrevolution Bristol 3513051949.jpg|thumb|upright|A small [[Quietrevolution wind turbine|Quietrevolution QR5]] [[Gorlov helical turbine|Gorlov type]] vertical axis wind turbine in Bristol, England. Measuring 3&amp;nbsp;m in diameter and 5&amp;nbsp;m high, it has a nameplate rating of 6.5 kW to the grid.]]

Private generation decentralizes the generation of electricity and may also centralize the pooling of surplus energy. While they have to be purchased, solar shingles and panels are both available. [[Capital cost]] is high, but saves in the long run. With appropriate power conversion, solar PV panels can run the same electric appliances as electricity from other sources.&lt;ref name="Fritsch 2007"&gt;Fritsch, Al, and Paul Gallimore. Healing Appalachia: Sustainable Living Through Appropriate Technology. Lexington, KY. The UP of Kentucky, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive [[solar water heating]] is another effective method of utilizing solar power. The simplest method is the solar (or a black plastic) bag.  Set between 1 and 5 gallons out in the sun and allow to heat. Perfect for a quick warm shower.&lt;ref name="motherearthnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/2007-10-01/Build-Your-Own-Solar-Water-Heater.aspx|title=How to Build a Passive Solar Water Heater|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘breadbox’ heater can be constructed easily with recycled materials and basic building experience. Consisting of a single or array of black tanks mounted inside a sturdy box insulated on the bottom and sides. The lid, either horizontal or angled to catch the most sun, should be well sealed and of a transparent glazing material (glass, fiberglass, or high temp resistant molded plastic). Cold water enters the tank near the bottom, heats and rises to the top where it is piped back into the home.&lt;ref name="motherearthnews.com"/&gt;

[[Ground source heat pump]]s exploit stable ground temperatures by benefiting from the thermal energy storage capacity of the ground. Typically ground source heat pumps have a high initial cost and are difficult to install by the average homeowner. They use electric motors to transfer heat from the ground with a high level of efficiency. The electricity may come from renewable sources or from external non-renewable sources.

=== Fuel ===
[[Biodiesel]] is an [[alternative fuel]] that can power diesel engines and can be used for domestic heating. Numerous forms of biomass, including soybeans, peanuts, and algae (which has the highest yield), can be used to make biodiesel. Recycled vegetable oil (from restaurants) can also be converted into biodiesel.
	
[[Biogas]] is another alternative fuel, created from the waste product of animals. Though less practical for most homes, a farm environment provides a perfect place to implement the process. By mixing the waste and water in a tank with space left for air, methane produces naturally in the airspace. This methane can be piped out and burned, and used for a cookfire.

The biogaspro digester provides an easily installed digester suitable for small farms or even large homes. Groups of homes can possible group together to use a digester &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biogaspro.co.za|title=Renewable Energy Solutions - Living Lightly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policy==

Policymakers were accustomed to an energy system based on big, centralised projects like nuclear or gas-fired power stations. A change of mindsets and incentives are bringing microgeneration into the mainstream. Planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the retrofitting of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings.

Most of developed countries, including Canada (Alberta), the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Israel&lt;ref name="israel_power_agreement"&gt;[http://www.israel-electric.co.il/Static/WorkFolder/HomeClients/pv-hahachlata-hamelea.pdf State of Israel Public Utilities Authority Decision #216 (Hebrew)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824063407/http://www.israel-electric.co.il/Static/WorkFolder/HomeClients/pv-hahachlata-hamelea.pdf |date=2009-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and USA have laws allowing microgenerated electricity to be sold into the national grid.

===Alberta, Canada===
In January 2009, the Government of Alberta‘s Micro-Generation Regulation came into effect, setting rules that allow Albertans to generate their own environmentally friendly electricity and receive credit for any power they send into the electricity grid.

===Poland===

In December 2014, the Polish government will vote on a bill which calls for microgeneration, as well as large scale wind farms in the [[Baltic Sea]] as a solution to cut back on co2 emissions from the country's coal plants as well as to reduce Polish dependence on Russian gas. Under the terms of the new bill, individuals and small businesses which generate up to 40&amp;nbsp;kW of 'green' energy will receive 100% of market price for any electricity they feed back into the grid, and businesses who set up large-scale offshore wind farms in the Baltic will be eligible for subsidization by the state. Costs of implementing these new policies will be offset by the creation of a new tax on non-sustainable energy use.&lt;ref name="Government_revises_sustainable_energy_bill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/188486,Government-revises-sustainable-energy-bill|title=Government revises sustainable energy bill|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has inconsistent energy generation policies across its 50 states. State energy policies and laws may vary significantly with location. Some states have imposed requirements on utilities that a certain percentage of total power generation be from renewable sources.  For this purpose, renewable sources include wind, hydroelectric, and solar power whether from large or microgeneration projects.  Further, in some areas transferrable "renewable source energy" credits are needed by power companies to meet these mandates. As a result, in some portions of the United States, power companies will pay a portion of the cost of renewable source microgeneration projects in their service areas. These rebates are in addition to any Federal or State renewable-energy income-tax credits that may be applicable.  In other areas, such rebates may differ or may not be available.

===United Kingdom===
The UK Government published its Microgeneration Strategy&lt;ref name="dti_strategy"&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sources/sustainable/microgeneration/strategy/page27594.html UK Department of Trade and Industry Microgeneration Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618153454/http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sources/sustainable/microgeneration/strategy/page27594.html |date=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2006, although it was seen as a disappointment by many commentators.&lt;ref name="bbc_on_micropower"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4858766.stm Home power plan 'disappointment'] [[BBC News]] report on the UK Department of Trade and Industry Microgeneration Strategy&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006]] has been viewed as a positive step.&lt;ref name="micropower_sus"&gt;[http://www.micropower.co.uk/news/newsrelease15.html Sustainable energy groups welcome parliamentary initiative to reduce climate change emissions], article by [http://www.micropower.co.uk micropower] on the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt; To replace earlier schemes, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) launched the [[Low Carbon Buildings Programme]] in April 2006, which provided grants to individuals, communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies. These schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the [[Department for Energy and Climate Change]] (DECC) for clean energy cashback via Feed-In Tariffs &lt;ref name="Summary of Feed_In Tariffs clean energy cashback"&gt;[http://www.feedin-tariffs.com/what-are-feed-in-tariffs/ Clean energy cashback from Feed-In Tariffs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511001753/http://www.feedin-tariffs.com/what-are-feed-in-tariffs/ |date=2010-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for generating electricity from April 2010 and the Renewable Heat Incentive &lt;ref name="Summary of Renewable Heat Incentive clean energy cashback"&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/consultations/rhi/rhi.aspx Renewable Heat Incentive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922074802/http://decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/consultations/rhi/rhi.aspx |date=2010-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for generating renewable heat from 28 November 2011.

Feed-In Tariffs are intended to incentivise small-scale (less than 5MW), low-carbon electricity generation. These feed-in tariffs work alongside the Renewables Obligation (RO), which will remain the primary mechanism to incentivise deployment of large-scale renewable electricity generation. The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in intended to incentivise the generation of heat from renewable sources. They also currently offer up to 21p per kWh from December 2011 in the Tariff for photovoltaics plus another 3p for the Export Tariff - an overall figure which could see a household earning back double what they currently pay for their electricity.&lt;ref name="Feed-in Tarrif figures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/FITs/principles/export/|title=Export tariffs - FI Tariffs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2011, the government announced a sudden cut in the feed-in tariff from 43.3p/kWh to 21p/kWh with the new tariff to apply to all new solar PV installations with an eligibility date on or after 12 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_091/pn11_091.aspx|title=Barker: Boom and bust for solar must be avoided - Announcements |publisher=decc.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent British politicians who have announced they are fitting microgenerating facilities to their homes include the Conservative party leader, [[David Cameron]], and the Labour Science [[minister (government)|Minister]], [[Malcolm Wicks]]. These plans included small domestic sized wind turbines. Cameron, before becoming Prime Minister in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general elections]], had been asked during an interview on BBC One’s [[The Politics Show]] on October 29, 2006,  if he would do the same should he get to [[10 Downing Street]]. ''“If they’d let me, yes,”'' he replied.&lt;ref&gt;The Times (October 30, 2006).  [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article617348.ece Cameron: I'd have a No 10 wind turbine].

In the December 2006 [[Pre-Budget Report]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pre_budget_report/prebud_pbr06/prebud_pbr06_index.cfm Pre-Budget Report 2006, Section 7.31.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201075130/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pre_budget_report/prebud_pbr06/prebud_pbr06_index.cfm |date=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the government announced that the sale of surplus electricity from installations designed for personal use, would not be subject to [[Income Tax]]. Legislation to this effect has been included in the Finance Bill 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Public Sector Information; Finance Act 2007 [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070011_en_1 Chapter 11,  Part 2, Environment].

==In popular culture==
Several movies and TV shows such as [[The Mosquito Coast]], [[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]], [[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]] and [[Beverly Hills Family Robinson]] have done a great deal in raising interest in microgeneration among the general public. Websites such as [[Instructables]] and [[Practical Action]] propose [[Do-it-yourself|DIY]] solutions that can lower the cost of microgeneration, thus increasing its popularity. Specialised magazines such as OtherPower and [[Home Power]] also provide practical advice and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rebelwolf.com/essn/ESSN-Dec2005.pdf OtherPower and Home Power as popular diy microgeneration magazines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Library of Kosovo''' ({{lang-sq|Biblioteka Kombëtare e Kosovës}}; {{lang-sr|Народна библиотека Косова|Narodna biblioteka Kosova}}) is the highest library institution in [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} established by the Assembly and is located in [[Pristina]].

The mission of the library is to collect, preserve, promote and make accessible the documentary and intellectual [[Cultural Heritage of Kosovo|heritage of Kosovo]]. It holds [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]s and holds an archive of national newspapers. The library also provides a number of other services. It is known for its unique history, and the style of the building designed by [[Croatia]]n architect Andrija Mutnjaković, followed by controversies about the outside appearance of it.

== History ==
===Founding===
The history of libraries in Kosovo dates back to the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=BKUK|title=65-vjet të Biblotekës Kombëtare dhe Universitare të Kosovës|url=http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|journal=Bibloletra|year=2009|volume=2|page=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501032049/http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections of the Christian and Muslim religious communities are considered as the oldest archives libraries in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riedlmayer|first=Andras|title=Libraries and archives in Kosova: a postwar report|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/decfeb00/libraries.cfm|work=Fine Arts Library, Harvard University|publisher=Bosnian Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's institutional library was officially founded in December 1944 in the city of [[Prizren]], which at the time was the capital of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=BKUK|title=60 vjet të Biblotekës Kombëtare dhe Universitare të Kosovës|url=http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti1Nr32004.pdf|journal=Bibloletra|year=2004|volume=3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the library was moved to the current building which was built in [[Pristina]], the current capital of Kosovo.

Over the years the National Library's name has changed depending on the political position of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=BKUK|title=65-vjet të Biblotekës Kombëtare dhe Universitare të Kosovës|url=http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|journal=Bibloletra|year=2009|volume=2|page=10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501032049/http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note that the former official names of the National Library of Kosovo are originally in Albanian and can be found in the library's journal [https://web.archive.org/web/20140501032049/http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf Bibloletra]''

===1989–1999===
In 1989, Kosovo's status as an autonomous region of Serbia was revoked, tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanians working in the [[public sector]] lost their jobs, and Albanian students were prohibited from taking courses in the Albanian language. For public and private libraries in Kosovo, this was a time when many library collections were burned and destroyed.

The library was subsequently used to house a large number of refugees from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]] who had fled their countries due to the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. After [[NATO]]'s occupation of Kosovo in June 1999, it was revealed that the [[Army of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] had used the library as a command-and-control centre. The materials inside had been stolen, reading room furniture smashed, and the card catalogue had been dumped in the basement. The library workers were kept out for a week while [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) peacekeeping troops checked the building for any hidden explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riedlmayer|first=Andras|title=Libraries and archives in Kosova: a postwar report|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/decfeb00/libraries.cfm|work=Fine Arts Library, Harvard University|publisher=Bosnian Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to national and international organizations, about 100,000 [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-language books have been sent to the paper mill in [[Lipjan]] for pulping. Among those books were collections of national heritage, which explained the nation's origins and history.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Carsten Frederiksen|first=Frode Bakken|title=Libraries in Kosovo|publisher=IFLA/FAIFE Report|date=April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reorganization===
After the war in Kosovo there was a great will and desire to reconstruct the library buildings and re-establish library services at all levels. This was done with the assistance of a special group of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) and the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Carsten Frederiksen|first=Frode Bakken|title=Libraries in Kosovo|publisher=IFLA/FAIFE Report|date=April 2000|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This special group of experts created different training programs like: Legislation and Administration, Mobile Library, Reconstruction, Book and Reading, Information Technology Professional Training and Development, Cultural Heritage, Children and Youth, Open Access Programme, Initiative Support, Twinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Carsten Frederiksen|first=Frode Bakken|title=Libraries in Kosovo|publisher=IFLA/FAIFE Report|date=April 2000|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the years of reorganization the National Library of Kosovo has been aided by many institutions such as the [[US Embassy]], [[OSCE]], [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]], German Artist Initiatives, [[Raiffeisen Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=BKUK|title=65-vjet të Biblotekës Kombëtare dhe Universitare të Kosovës|url=http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|journal=Bibloletra|year=2009|volume=2|page=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501032049/http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

=== Building ===
[[File:National University Library of Kosovo.jpg|thumb|240px|right| Another outside look of the Library focusing on the domes.]]The most significant part of the current library is its building. There are contradictory opinions about its style, which have resulted in different versions regarding the building. The current building of the National Library of Kosovo was inaugurated on 25 November 1982. It was designed by the Croatian architect Andrija Mutnjaković. Its space consists of 16,500&amp;nbsp;square meters. It is made with zenith windows, with a total 99 domes of different sizes and is entirely covered in a metal fishing net, which have their own particular architectural symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=BKUK|title=65-vjet të Biblotekës Kombëtare dhe Universitare të Kosovës|url=http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|journal=Bibloletra|year=2009|volume=2|page=10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501032049/http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It houses two reading rooms with 300 and 100 seats respectively, a reading room for periodicals, rooms for special collections, cataloguing and research, a 150-seat amphitheatre and a 75-seat meeting hall. It has the capacity to accommodate about two million volumes. The materials are located on two levels below grade and are closed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Carsten Frederiksen|first=Frode Bakken|title=Libraries in Kosovo|publisher=IFLA/FAIFE Report|date=April 2000|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lobby of the library is used for various cultural events. The floor of the hall is a unique work of diverse mosaic marble stone. The largest dome of the library is the main ornament of the hall's high ceiling, thus providing ample natural lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo National Library, Prishtina, Kosovo|url=http://www.strangebuildings.thegrumpyoldlimey.com/2011/08/kosovo-national-library-prishtina.html|work=Strange, Weird, Wonderful and Cool Buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Style and controversy ===
[[File:Dome, National Library Of Kosovo.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Inside view of one of the domes.]]
According to the architect of the National Library of Kosovo the building is meant to represent a style blending Byzantine and Islamic architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Carsten Frederiksen|first=Frode Bakken|title=Libraries in Kosovo|publisher=IFLA/FAIFE Report|date=April 2000|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other sources there are statements from the actual architect that “this project which is linked to the tradition of pre-Romanesque architecture of the Balkans, was being considered among other project for the Sarajevo National Library building”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patricia Kiš|title=Andrija Mutnjaković: Mislili su da se rugam, a ja nisam želio biti prosječan|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/ahitekt-andrija-mutnjakovic--mislili-su-da-se-rugam--a-ja-nisam-zelio-biti-prosjecan/942078/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By others this building is seen as a reaction to the impersonality of International Style and an attempt to combine modern means with regional traditions and rural architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Onup Magazine|title=National Library|url=http://onupmagazine.com/2009/01/national-library/#sthash.maKjhPcR.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also as a Modern-Metabolist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Architecture Map|title=Kosovo National Library|url=http://www.worldarchitecturemap.org/buildings/kosovo-national-library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the official statements of the architect about the style of the National Library of Kosovo there are many other controversies when it comes to the appearance of the building and its meaning.
One of the most famous versions is the one that connects the domes of the building with the national Albanian hat [[Qeleshe|“plisi”]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Qeveria e Kosoves|title=Biblotekat|url=https://www.rks-gov.net/sq-AL/Qytetaret/Edukimi/Pages/Bibliotekat.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was the reason why Serbian politicians reacted very strongly about the appearance of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dnevno|title=The strangest library in the world?|url=http://www.dnevno.ba/ekalendar/zanimljivosti-iz-povijesti/44084-najcudnija-knjiznica-na-svijetu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version is that this project was meant to reconcile the relations between [[Serbians]] and [[Albanians]]. Its domes are a combination of existing Turkish baths in [[Prizren]] and [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchate of Peć]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dnevno|title=The strangest library in the world?|url=http://www.dnevno.ba/ekalendar/zanimljivosti-iz-povijesti/44084-najcudnija-knjiznica-na-svijetu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The National Library is a state institution which reports to the [http://www.mkrs-ks.org/ Ministry of Culture] and it is regulated by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GAZETA ZYRTARE E REPUBLIKËS SË KOSOVËS|title=LIGJ PËR BIBLIOTEKAT|url=http://www.mkrs-ks.org/repository/docs/Ligji_nr._04-L-097_per_Bibliotekat.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital library==

Digitization for the National Library of Kosovo is a project of great importance. During this process, the National Library of Kosovo aims to put online the national heritage and other materials dealing with Kosovo to promote them and to make it easier for natives and individuals from other countries to have access to it. In 2008, with a view to developing a portal resembling the [[American Memory]], Memory ({{lang-sq|Kujtesa}}), the Documentary Centre of Kosovo was established.

Due to the very large number of documents that must digitized, a process that takes a lot of time, the Library has established a sequence of criteria for documents that must be digitized before others and one of the basic criteria is the cultural and historical value of that material. Based on those criteria, these are the documents that have priority in digitization : most requested material which is in poor physical condition, historical books and manuscripts, microfilms and other very required materials.

In general, materials that are most commonly digitized are [[rare books]] (49%), [[photographs]] (44%), [[manuscripts]] (39%), [[monographs]] (35%), [[music]] (30%), newspapers (9%), [[map]]s (1%).

Besides digitizing its own material the National Library of Kosovo provides access to some of the most popular electronic resources in the world and that made possible through the Electronic Library Consortium of Kosovo. For services for electronic resources in different libraries of the world the National Library of Kosovo was supported by Kosovo Foundation for Open Society, and by companies like [[EBSCO]] and [[GALE]] with financial support from the U.S. Embassy in Pristina. While [[Raiffeisen Bank]] Kosovo supported the [[Oxford Music Online]] and the [[OSCE]] Mission in Kosovo supported OXFORD Scholarship Online and [[Oxford Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=BKUK|title=65-vjet të Biblotekës Kombëtare dhe Universitare të Kosovës|url=http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|journal=Bibloletra|year=2009|volume=2|pages=13–17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501032049/http://www.biblioteka-ks.org/Biblioteka_Botime/Viti6Nr22009.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other libraries in Pristina ==
There are many other libraries in Kosovo, such as the Library of the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo]], [[Albanology]] Institute Library Pristina, [[:sq:Biblioteka publike "Hivzi Sulejmani" e Prishtinës (1945-2010)|Hivzi Sulejmani Public Library]], and other school and faculty libraries, which are developed in scientific and educational institutions.

One of the main goals of the National Library of Kosovo is the establishment and reactivation of many new libraries in order to develop the librarianship of [[Kosovo]].

'''Newcastle ScienceFest''' is a 10-day event at venues across [[NewcastleGateshead]], with the principal aim of increasing the North East’s enthusiasm for science and encouraging young people to consider a career in this area.

==Early history==
The first [[Science Festival]] programme in the city ran from 2002 – 2007. In 2008 funding from [[One NorthEast]] was awarded for an additional three festivals (2009–2011). The festival is delivered in partnership with [[Centre for Life]], [[Tyne and Wear Museums]], Newcastle Science City, [[Newcastle University]], [[Newcastle City Council]] and culture10 as part of NewcastleGateshead’s world-class programme of festivals and events.

==Relaunch==
In 2009, the festival was re-launched&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicola Juncar |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/03/07/messy-experiment-to-kick-off-science-festival-72703-23087635/ |title=Newcastle Evening Chronicle on the festival launch |work=[[Newcastle Evening Chronicle]]|date=7 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on Friday 6 March 2009 15:38 |url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/VIDEO-ScienceFest-launched-with-Fountains.5048346.jp |title=Hartlepool Mail on the festival launch |work=[[Hartlepool Mail]] |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrackmagazine.com/index.php?section=1&amp;category=8&amp;page=1463 |title=The Crack Magazine preview the festival |work=[[The Crack Magazine]] |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7892733.stm |title=BBC report on pre-festival publicity |work=[[BBC News]] |date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Newcastle-Geordies-Wear-Skimpy-Clothing-In-Cold-Weather---But-How-Do-They-Do-It-Scientists-Probe/Article/200902315224278 |title=Sky News report on pre-festival publicity |work=[[Sky News]] |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new brand identity and website. There were three key strands of the programme catering for three different audiences; families, adults and schools. It included two family weekend events (7/8 &amp; 14/15 March) and a series of adult events (lectures/science fiction/performances) during the week, as well as activities specifically for schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicola Juncar |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/03/10/pupils-make-jewellery-from-their-own-dna-72703-23107641/ |title=Pupils make jewellery from their own DNA (on a schools workshop) |work=Newcastle Evening Chronicle |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highlight of the week was the first [[Maker Faire]] event in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward |first=Mark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7946971.stm |title=BBC report on Maker Faire |publisher=BBC News |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was held at the [[Centre for Life]] and [[Discovery Museum]] on the 14 and 15 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward |first=Mark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7961760.stm |title=BBC interviews with Makers attending event |publisher=BBC News |date=25 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/7964351.stm |title=BBC wants to hear from Makers after Maker Faire |publisher=BBC News |date=25 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cawley |first=Piers |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/Community-Live-Newcastle-Maker-Faire-March-14-15-2009--/features/112900/0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807055133/http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Community-Live-Newcastle-Maker-Faire-March-14-15-2009-746551.html|archivedate=7 August 2011|title=The H visit Newcastle Maker Faire |publisher=[[H-online.com]] |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/17/2147211 |title=Discussion of Newcastle Maker Faire on slashdot |publisher=[[slashdot]] |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there was no overarching theme for 2009, some events integrated with the national agenda. For example, to celebrate [[Charles Darwin]]’s 200th birthday, the festival commissioned the [[Darwin Brewery]] in Sunderland to develop a commemorative beer called [[Natural Selection]] which was available throughout March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7884792.stm |title=BBC report on Darwin beer |publisher=BBC News |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ScienceFest saw the return of Maker Faire – an event for DIY technology and craft, ScienceFest After Dark – a series of late night, adult only events and events specially focussed on developing science literacy skills.

Headline makers included the world’s fastest [[Rubik’s cube]] solving robot, Power Tool
Drag Racing and the UK’s most advanced [[musical tesla coil]].

Newcastle Science Festival 2010 was attended by 51,000 people, including families,
adults and children, across 120 events at 23 locations over a 10-day period. This
represents an increase from 2009 where 48,500 people attended the event over a similar
10 day period.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The '''Nikola Tesla Museum''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Музеј Николе Тесле, ''Muzej Nikole Tesle'') is dedicated to honoring and displaying the life and work of [[Nikola Tesla]]. The museum is located in the central area of [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. It holds more than 160,000 original documents, over 2,000 books and journals, over 1,200 historical technical exhibits, over 1,500 photographs and photo plates of original, technical objects, instruments and apparatus, and over 1,000 plans and drawings. The Nikola Tesla Archive was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]] Register in 2003 due to its critical role regarding history of [[electrification]] of the world and future technological advancements in this area.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web |title= Nikola Tesla's Archive |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23168&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090312024711/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D23168%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2009-03-12 |date= 2008-05-16 |publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate= 2009-12-10 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Nikola Tesla Museum is housed in a residential [[villa]] built in 1927 according to the designs of Dragiša Brašovan, a distinguished Serbian [[architect]]. The building was used for various purposes until December 5, 1952, when the Nikola Tesla Museum was founded in accordance with the decision of the Government of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Certain items for the museum were shipped from [[New York City]] to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on September 7, 1951, as a result of efforts by Sava Kosanović, Tesla's nephew and closest relative&lt;ref&gt;KGB agent, codename "KOLO", see American Espionage and Project Venona&lt;/ref&gt; and his attorney Philip Wittenberg.

===Exhibitions===
The permanent exhibition was arranged in 1955. From time to time there have been some modifications, but for many years the basic concept has remained the same. Its first part is primarily a memorial exhibition, while the second part is an interactive one, with 3D computer generated models of Tesla's inventions. From time to time, the museum organizes thematic exhibitions of documents, photographs and other material in order to display some periods from Tesla's [[inventing|inventive]] life.

===Reconstruction===
Reconstruction of the Nikola Tesla Museum started on November 3, 2006. The first phase of the project was scheduled to have been complete by the end of 2006. The garden on the roof of the museum was designed to be enclosed by glass windows, which would turn the roof into a computer room. This reconstruction is now complete, and the museum is available to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nikolateslatour.com/blog/2012/09/05/nikola-teslas-birthplace-museum-and-memorial-center-in-smiljan-croatia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928121647/http://www.nikolateslatour.com/blog/2012/09/05/nikola-teslas-birthplace-museum-and-memorial-center-in-smiljan-croatia/ |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Numismatics}}

'''Numismatics''' is the study or collection of [[currency]],  including coins, tokens, paper money, and related objects. While [[numismatist (specialist)|numismatists]] are often characterised as students or collectors of [[coin]]s, the discipline also includes the broader study of [[money]] and other [[payment]] media used to resolve [[debt]]s and the exchange of [[good (economics)|goods]]. Early money used by people is referred to as "Odd and Curious", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating [[currency]] (e.g., [[cigarette]]s in prison). The [[Kyrgyz people]] used [[horse]]s as the principal currency unit and gave small change in [[sheepskin|lambskins]];&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ex.ac.uk/~RDavies/arian/amser/chrono14.html|title= Chronology of Money 1900 — 1919 |accessdate= 2006-08-09|author=Glyn Davies|isbn =978-0-7083-1351-0|year= 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lambskins may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horses are not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as [[Cowry|cowry shells]], [[precious metal]]s, [[Cocoa beans#history|cocoa beans]], [[Rai stones|large stones]], and [[Gemstone|gems]].

Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized, or [[Credit (finance)|credit]] value. ''Numismatic value'' is the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law, which is known as the ''collector value''.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Economic]] and historical studies of money's use and development are an integral part of the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment.

==Etymology==
First attested in English 1829, the word ''numismatics'' comes from the adjective ''numismatic'', meaning "of coins". It was borrowed in 1792 from [[French language|French]] ''numismatiques'', itself a derivation from [[Late Latin]] ''numismatis'', genitive of ''numisma'', a variant of ''nomisma'' meaning "coin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dnomisma nomisma],
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Nomisma is a [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] νόμισμα (''nomisma'') which means "current coin/custom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fmisma νόμισμα],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from [[wikt:νομίζω|νομίζω]] (''nomizō''), "to hold or own as a custom or usage, to use customarily",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dnomi%2Fzw νομίζω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from [[wikt:νόμος|νόμος]] (''nomos''), "usage, custom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fmos2 νόμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately from [[wikt:νέμω|νέμω]] (''nemō''), "I dispense, divide, assign, keep, hold".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dne%2Fmw νέμω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of money==
{{Main|History of money}}
Throughout its history, money itself has been made to be a [[scarcity|scarce]] good, although it does not have to be. Many materials have been used to form money, from naturally scarce [[precious metal]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colnect.com/en/coins/compositions|title=Coin compositions|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cowry shell]]s through [[cigarette]]s to entirely artificial money, called [[fiat money]], such as [[banknote]]s. Many complementary currencies use time as a unit of measure, using mutual credit accounting that keeps the balance of money intact.

Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token – an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today.  However, goods such as [[gold]] or [[silver]] retain many of the essential properties of money, such as [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] and limited supply. However, these goods are not controlled by one single authority.

==History of numismatics==
[[File:Maximinus denarius - transparent background.PNG|left|frame|A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[denarius]], a standardized [[silver coin]].]]
[[Coin collecting]] may have existed in ancient times. Caesar [[Augustus]] gave "coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money" as [[Saturnalia]] gifts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#75 75 on-line text].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petrarch]], who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler,  is credited as the first [[Renaissance]] collector.  Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]] in 1355.

The first book on coins was ''De Asse et Partibus'' (1514) by [[Guillaume Budé]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brigham Young University]] [http://net.lib.byu.edu/aldine/44Bude.html library web page''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725015240/http://net.lib.byu.edu/aldine/44Bude.html |date=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility.  Collectors of coins were Pope [[Boniface VIII]], Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire, [[Louis XIV]] of France, Ferdinand I, Elector [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]] of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and [[Henry IV of France]] to name a few.  Numismatics is called the "Hobby of Kings", due to its most esteemed founders.

Professional societies organised in the 19th century. The [[Royal Numismatic Society]] was founded in 1836 and immediately began publishing the journal that became the ''Numismatic Chronicle''. The [[American Numismatic Society]] was founded in 1858 and began publishing the ''American Journal of Numismatics'' in 1866.

In 1931 the [[British Academy]] launched the [[Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum]] publishing collections of [[Ancient Greek coinage]].  The first volume of [[Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles]] was published in 1958.

In the 20th century coins gained recognition as archaeological objects, scholars such as [[Guido Bruck]] of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna realised their value in providing a temporal context and the difficulty that curators faced when identifying worn coins using classical literature. After [[World War II]] in Germany a project, ''[[Studien zu Fundmünzen der Antike|Fundmünzen der Antike]]'' (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.

In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner [[Adam Eckfeldt]] donated his personal collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-8247-2037-7 | page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William E. Du Bois’ ''Pledges of History...'' (1846) describes the cabinet.

C. Wyllys Betts' ''American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals'' (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.

[[Helen Wang]]'s "A short history of Chinese numismatics in European languages" (2012-2013) gives an outline history of Western countries' understanding of Chinese numismatics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Wang]], "A short history of Chinese numismatics in European languages", in ''Early China'' vols 35-36 (2012-2013), pp. 395-429,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern numismatics===
[[File:Two 20kr gold coins.png|thumb|right|Two 20 kr [[gold]] coins from the [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]].]]
[[File:10 Pesos Mexicano.jpg|thumb]]
Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid-17th century onward, the period of machine-struck coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainecollectibles.com/Collectibles/|title=Collectibles|publisher=Maritime International|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties, [[mint-made errors]], the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the sociopolitical context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.

===Subfields===
{{Main|Exonumia|Notaphily|Scripophily}}
[[Exonumia]] (UK English: Paranumismatica)&lt;ref&gt;The First Dictionary of Paranumismatica: All About Tokens, Checks, Tickets, Passes, Medalets, Counters, Tallies and Weights (ed. Brian Edge), 1991. {{ISBN|978-0951691007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of [[coin]]-like objects such as [[token coin]]s and [[medal]]s, and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes [[elongated coin]]s, encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins, [[wooden nickel]]s, [[credit card]]s, and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been [[legal tender]]), and many [[coin collector]]s are also exonumists.

[[Notaphily]] is the study of [[banknote|paper money]] or banknotes.
It is believed that people have been collecting [[paper money]] for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the ''Serienscheine'' (Series notes) [[Notgeld]]. The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors.
At the same time, some developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Germany]] and [[France]] began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.
[[File:Alexander the great temnos tetradrachm.jpg|alt=Alexander the Great tetradrachm from the Temnos Mint|thumb|287x287px|Alexander the Great tetradrachm from the Temnos Mint circa 188-170 BC]]
[[Scripophily]] is the study and collection of [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|Bonds]]. It is an area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of [[engraving]].  Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.

==Numismatists==
The term '''numismatist''' applies to collectors and coin dealers as well as scholars using coins as source or studying coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/numismatist|title=numismatist|publisher=thefreedictionary|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are [[Walter Breen]], a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King [[Farouk I of Egypt]] was an avid collector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldrushgallery.com/news/gumshoe.html |title=Numismatic "Gumshoe:" On the Trail of King Farouk |first=Carl N. |last=Lester |publisher=Gold Rush Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.

The second group are the coin dealers. Often called professional numismatists, they authenticate or [[Coin grading|grade]] coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.

The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesvillecoins.com/tips/19/an-overview-of-numismatics.aspx|title=An Overview of Numismatics|publisher= Gainesville Coins|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be [[G. Kenneth Jenkins]]. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.

'''Opera management''' is the management of the processes by which [[opera]] is delivered to audiences. A multifaceted task, it involves managing an opera company, primarily the singers and musicians who perform the operas, but in many cases also managing the [[opera house]] in which the company performs. 

Opera is a complex art form involving high fixed costs and requiring complex management. In addition to the singers and musicians who form the core of the company its production requires scenery and costumes and sometimes dancers and non-singing actors. Fixed costs in today's opera organizations—keeping many of the singers and musicians on year-round contracts, and if managing their own theatre, the cost of workers needed to create and maintain the sets and costumes as well as the cost of maintaining and running the building—combined with the costs of individual productions, make opera the most expensive of the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Towse, Ruth (2011).  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eyXQbYAXCBQC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MW7ZT8myMIrE0QX62-n8Aw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "Opera and Ballet"], p. 313 in Ruth Towse (ed.) ''A Handbook of Cultural Economics''. Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|1848448872}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in the 19th century when opera was largely run by individual [[impresario]]s rather than large organisations, opera management as a profession was characterised as "a devouror of the fortunes of the victims it has tempted by its seductions".&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader'' (6 August 1864). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?pg=PA175&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;ei=GULbT8PqK82r8AO-zK3JCw&amp;id=ToBNAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "The Opera Season at Covent Garden"], p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Gye]], who turned the [[Royal Italian Opera]] in Covent Garden into one of London's premiere opera houses in the 19th century and who shaped the careers of many famous singers, described opera management as a "dreadful business".&lt;ref&gt;Dideriksen, Gabriella and Ringel, Matthew (1995). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/746717 "Frederick Gye and 'The Dreadful Business of Opera Management'"], ''19th-Century Music'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (Summer, 1995), pp. 3-30. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venice and the development of opera as a business==
The [[origins of opera|earliest operas]] were privately performed and financed by the noble families who commissioned them, often to mark great court occasions. One such example was [[Marco da Gagliano]]'s ''[[La Flora]]'',  performed in 1628 at the Medici Palace in Florence to celebrate the marriage of [[Margherita de' Medici]] and  [[Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma]]. [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena]], the wife of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo II de' Medici]] and the mother of the bride, took an active role in the planning of the production. She secured the services of the musicians and singers, attended the rehearsals, and according to musicologist Kelley Harness, may well have contributed to the development of the plot as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harness, Kelley Ann (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfj1sn6m_XoC&amp;q=%22La+Flora%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22La%20Flora%22&amp;f=false ''Echoes of Women's Voices: Music, Art, and Female Patronage in Early Modern Florence''], p. 175. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226316599}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Publicly performed operas first appeared in [[Venice]] during the [[Carnival|Carnival season]] of 1637. This was facilitated by the large number of public theatres already present in the city which originally served for the production of plays. They were built by noble families such as the [[Grimani]], [[Nicolò Tron|Tron]],  and [[Vendramin]]. The rebuilt [[Teatro San Cassiano]], sponsored by the Tron family, was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. Performances of ''L'Andromeda'' in 1637 by librettist [[Benedetto Ferrari]] and composer [[Francesco Manelli]] marked the theatre's first commercially produced opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ringer, Mark (2006). ''Opera's First Master: The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi'', pp. 130-131. Amadeus Press. {{ISBN|1574671103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of cases the [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Venetian owners  profited from their theatres by renting them out to others who produced and managed the opera performances. The key figure in the actual production of the operas was the impresario, who assembled the singers, musicians and creative team and made the business and artistic decisions. Sometimes the impresarios were hired by the theatre renters and their backers. On other occasions the impresario was also one of the investors and the renter of the theatre. The ''cassier'' (cashier) was in charge the financial side of the production, including handling the payments and receipts. While the ''cassier'' was sometimes a separate member of the management team, in many instances the impresario also acted as the ''cassier''.&lt;ref&gt;Glixon, Beth Lise and Glixon, Jonathan Emmanuel (2006). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nP5zEo5K7a8C&amp;q=managers#v=snippet&amp;q=managers&amp;f=false ''Inventing the Business of Opera: The Impresario and His World in Seventeenth-Century Venice''], p. 4. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195154169}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous impresarios of the day was [[Marco Faustini]] who managed several Venetian opera houses in the course of his career.

'''Oral and maxillofacial surgery''' ('''OMS''' or '''OMFS''') specializes in treating many diseases, injuries and defects in the head, neck, face, jaws and the hard and soft tissues of the oral (mouth) and maxillofacial (jaws and face) region. It is an internationally [[Legal recognition|recognized]] surgical specialty. In  countries such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand and most of Europe, it is recognized as both a specialty of medicine and dentistry, and a dual degree in medicine and dentistry is compulsory. In other countries including the [[United States]], India, Canada, Brazil, and Sweden, it is a recognized [[Specialty (dentistry)|specialty of dentistry]].

== Regulations ==

In several countries oral and maxillofacial surgery is a speciality recognized by a professional association, as is the case with the [[Dental Council of India]], [[American Dental Association]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], [[Royal College of Dentists of Canada]], [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]] and Brazilian Federal Council of Odontology (CFO).

In other countries oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty exists but under different forms, as the work is sometimes performed by a single or dual qualified specialist depending on each country's regulations and training opportunities available.

== Summary ==

An oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a regional specialist [[surgery|surgeon]] treating the entire [[Craniofacial|craniomaxillofacial complex]]: [[Anatomy|anatomical]] area of the [[mouth]], [[jaw]]s, [[face]], and [[Human skull|skull]], as well as associated structures.

Depending upon the jurisdiction, maxillofacial surgeons may require training in dentistry, [[surgery]], and general [[medicine]]; training and qualification in medicine may be undertaken optionally even if not required.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery is widely recognized as one of the specialties of dentistry. In many countries, however, maxillofacial surgery is a medical specialty requiring both medical and dental degrees, culminating in an appropriate qualification (e.g. [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]], FRCS, in the UK).  All oral and maxillofacial surgeons, however, must obtain a university degree in dentistry before beginning residency training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. In the United States oral and maxillofacial residency programs are either four or six years in duration. Programs that grant the [[Doctor of Medicine|MD degree]] are six years in duration.

They also may choose to undergo further training in a one or two year subspecialty [[Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Fellowship Training]] in the following areas:

* [[Cosmetic surgery#Cosmetic surgery|Cosmetic facial surgery]]
* Cranio-maxillofacial trauma
* [[Craniofacial surgery]]/pediatric maxillofacial surgery/cleft surgery
* [[Head and neck cancer]]{{snd}}[[Microsurgery|microvascular reconstruction]]
* Maxillofacial regeneration (reformation of the facial region by advanced stem cell technique)

The popularity of oral and maxillofacial surgery as a career for persons whose first degree was medicine, not dentistry, seems to be increasing in a few EU countries{{Clarify|date=June 2012|reason="few" or "a few"? Almost opposite meanings}}. However, the public funds spent for 14 years of training are of a major concern for governments. Integrated programs are becoming more available to medical graduates allowing them to complete the dental degree requirement in about three years in order for them to advance to subsequently complete oral and maxillofacial surgical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tambcd.edu/oralsurgery/residency/residency.html |title = Baylor College of Dentistry: OMS Residency Admission Requirements |accessdate = 2 July 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080508100254/http://www.tambcd.edu/oralsurgery/residency/residency.html |archivedate = 8 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anesthesia training ===

In the United States, oral and maxillofacial surgeons are required to undergo five months of intensive general anesthesia training.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} An additional month of pediatric anesthesia training is also required.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The American Society of Anesthesiologists published a ''Statement on the Anesthesia Care Team'' which specifies qualified anesthesia personnel and practitioners as anesthesiologists, anesthesiology fellows, anesthesiology residents,oral and maxillofacial surgery residents, anesthesiologist assistants, and nurse anesthetists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahq.org/~/media/Sites/ASAHQ/Files/Public/Resources/standards-guidelines/statement-on-the-anesthesia-care-team.pdf Statement on the Anesthesia Care Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706043333/http://www.asahq.org/~/media/sites/asahq/files/public/resources/standards-guidelines/statement-on-the-anesthesia-care-team.pdf |date=6 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Australia, New Zealand, and North America ==

Oral and maxillofacial surgery is one of the nine dental specialties recognized by the [[American Dental Association]], [[Royal College of Dentists of Canada]], and the [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]]. Oral and maxillofacial surgery requires four to six years of further formal university training after dental school (i.e., DDS, BDent, DMD or BDS).

In the [[United States]], four-year [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] programs grant a certificate of specialty training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Six-year residency programs grant the specialty certificate in addition to a degree such as a medical degree (e.g., [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]], MBBS, MBChB) or research degree (e.g., MS, MSc, MPhil, MDS, MSD, MDSc, DClinDent, DSc, DMSc, PhD). Both four– and six–year graduates are designated US "Board Eligible" and those who earn "Certification" are Diplomats. Approximately 50% of the training programs in the US and 66%&lt;ref&gt;J. Gigliotti, N. Makhoul: Demographics, training satisfaction, and career plans of Canadian oral and maxillofacial surgery residents. Int. J. Oral Maxillofac. Surg. 2015; 44: 1574–1580.&lt;/ref&gt; of Canadian training programs are "dual-degree".

The typical training program for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is:

* 2–4 years undergraduate study (BS, BA, or equivalent degrees)
* 4 years dental study ([[Dentistry|DMD, BDent, DDS or BDS]])
* 4–6 years [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training{{snd}}Some programs integrate an additional degree such as: a [[master's degree]] (MS, MDS, MSc, MClinDent, MScDent, MDent), [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]] (PhD, DMSc, DClinDent, DSc), or [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] (MBBS, MD, DO, MBChB, MDCM)
* After completion of surgical training most undertake final specialty examinations: US: "Board Certified (ABOMS)", Australia/NZ: FRACDS, or Canada: "FRCDC"
* Some colleges offer membership or fellowships in oral/maxillofacial surgery: MOralSurg RCS, M(OMS) RCPS, FFD RCSI, FEBOS, FACOMS, FFD RCS, FAMS, FCDSHK, FCMFOS (SA)
* Recently both single and dual qualified oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now also obtaining fellowships with the American College of Surgeons ([[American College of Surgeons|FACS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facs.org/member-services/join/fellows |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922051122/https://www.facs.org/member-services/join/fellows |archivedate=22 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Average total length after secondary school: 12–14 years

In addition, graduates of oral and maxillofacial surgery training programs can pursue fellowships, typically 1–2 years in length, in the following areas:

* [[Head and neck cancer]]{{snd}}[[Microsurgery|microvascular reconstruction]]
* [[Cosmetic surgery#Cosmetic surgery|Cosmetic facial surgery]] (facelift, rhinoplasty, etc.)
* [[Craniofacial surgery]] and pediatric maxillofacial surgery (cleft lip and palate repair, surgery for craniosynostosis, etc.)

'''P. Jeevanandham''' (21 August 1907 – 18 January 1963) also called ''Jeeva'', was a social reformer, political leader, litterateur and one of the pioneers of the [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] movements in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jeevanantham-remembered/article5592372.ece Jeevanantham remembered – TAMIL NADU]. The Hindu (19 January 2014). Retrieved on 12 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was not only a socio-political leader, but was also a  cultural theoretician, an excellent orator, journalist and critic; and above all,  a relentless fighter for the deprived. A down-to-earth person with a clean record in public life, Jeevanandham was held in high esteem by ordinary people.

==Early life==
P. Jeevanandham was born in the town of [[Boothapandi]], in the then princely state of [[Travancore]] (which is now in [[Kanyakumari District]] of Tamil Nadu) into an orthodox middle-class family on 21 August 1907. His original name was Sorimuthu.&lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt; He was named this name after his clan god Sorimuthu.

The orthodox and religious background of his family exposed Jeevanandham to literature, devotional songs and the arts, early on  in his life. He  grew up in an era when caste-based rigidity was widely prevalent, and from early on in his life he resented the very idea of  untouchability and could not tolerate his [[Dalit]] friends being denied  entry into  temples and public places and being humiliated.  Even as a schoolboy he became averse to ''Varnasrama Dharma'', a Hindu religious code that stratifies society on caste lines and facilitates the practice of [[untouchability]]. The national movement and [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhi]]’s call to wear [[khadi]] and his stand against untouchability influenced Jeevanandham to join the movement. He began wearing only khadi from then on.

Jeevanandham took his Dalit friends into the streets and public places where, usually, entry was denied to them, which earned him the displeasure of his family and orthodox caste members in his village. His father disapproved his behaviour and asked him to stop all things which were against their caste traditions. Jeevanandham said he would rather leave his home rather than follow discriminatory practices and eventually did so.

==Political life==

===Gandhian and Congress Worker===
Jeevanandham started his political life basing himself on Gandhian ideas. In 1924, he participated in the [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] against upper-caste Hindus, where Dalits were barred from walking on the road leading to the temple at [[Vaikom]]. He participated in a similar protest, demanding entry for Dalits into the [[Suchindram temple]]. When he joined an ashram run by [[V. V. S. Aiyar]] at [[Cheranmadevi]], he found that Dalits and ‘upper-caste’ students were fed in separate halls. He supported Periyar’s protest against this practice and quit the ashram. Later, he took charge of an ashram funded by a philanthropist in ''Siruvayal'' near [[Karaikkudi]]. The ashram life gave him an opportunity to read a lot of books. In this ashram, he got opportunity to meet Gandhi. Jeeva had written a letter to Gandhi disagreeing with his methods.  When Gandhi came to Madras, he had this letter in his pocket and wanted to meet Jeeva.  Rajagopalachari asked Gandhi to name the person he wanted to meet so  that particular person can be called.  Gandhi mentioned that he did not want the person to be called and would like to go to the ashram where Jeeva resided and meet him. When Gandhi went to the Siruvayal ashram and asked for Jeeva a young man of around 25 years appeared before him.  Gandhi asked him if he was the same person who wrote the 'letter' and Jeeva replied in the affirmative. &lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt;

When Periyar ([[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]]), on returning from a visit to the Soviet Union, spoke highly of its achievements and expressed his desire to propagate socialism, Jeevanandham, who was by then familiar with the egalitarian principle, felt elated. His hopes of getting the national movement merged with the Congress Socialist Party were dashed when Periyar began dragging his feet. He, however, remained in the Congress. He was elected as a member of the [[All India Congress Committee]], a prestigious post in those days, and was also a member of the working committee of the State Congress unit. Later, when the Madras Provincial Congress Socialist Party was formed in 1937, Jeevanandham became its first secretary. He joined the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI) two years later along with [[P. Ramamurthi]], another veteran of the movement.

===Communist years (before Indian independence)===
The last 25 years of colonial rule saw the emergence of two movements in [[Tamil Nadu]] – the [[Self-Respect Movement]] (which was a precursor to the [[Dravidian movement]] led by Periyar) and the Communist movement.  Before enrolling himself as the first member of the united CPI in Tamil Nadu, Jeevanandham was an active participant in these two earlier movements.  His patriotism took him to the national movement; his revulsion toward untouchability and caste-based discrimination led him to support the Self-Respect Movement.

After joining the CPI, Jeevanandham and Ramamurthi organized rickshaw-pullers and factory workers on Marxist lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighter all the way|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2522/stories/20081107252208700.htm|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=Frontline|date=7 November 2008|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this they were assisted by leaders such as [[M. R. Venkatraman]] and [[B. Srinivasa Rao]]. They had already organized workers and formed unions in industrial towns such as [[Madurai]] and [[Coimbatore]] when they were functioning as socialists. Jeevanandham was in the forefront of efforts to build a strong labor movement based on [[Marxism]]. His oratory and writings helped him fulfill the task. But these leaders suffered police repression and were imprisoned several times. Jeevanandham visited sensitive areas and kept the workers’ fighting spirit alive. Alongside industrial workers, agricultural laborers and small farmers were also organized in [[Thanjavur]] and other districts. Jeevanandham and Ramamurthi inspired thousands of people through powerful speeches.

Under the colonial rule, Marxist literature and propaganda were banned, and Marxist workers were frequently arrested on one pretext or the other. Jeevanandham was no exception. He even had an externment order against him and had to stay away from the then Madras province for a brief period.

==Political life (after Indian independence)==
After [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]], the ban on the CPI was lifted, and all its leaders were released.

In the [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1952|first general elections]] in post independent India, Jeevanandham won a seat for the [[Legislature of Tamil Nadu|Legislative Assembly]] from the [[Washermanpet (State Assembly Constituency)|Wasermanpet]] constituency in [[Madras]]. P. Ramamurthi, his close associate, who was in jail then, was also elected from the [[Madurai North (State Assembly Constituency)|Madurai]] constituency. After being elected to the Legislative Assembly, he put pressure on the government to initiate action on issues relating to development schemes and reform measures. He also led many struggles, one of which was against the proposal to form ''Dakshina Pradesh'' comprising the four southern states. Despite his loss in the subsequent elections, he continued his party work.&lt;ref name="Cultural"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cultural warrior|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2416/stories/20070824503711900.htm|author=S.Viswanathan|newspaper=Frontline|date=24 August 2007|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tamil nationalism and literary works==
He played a key role in making his native [[Tamil language]] an official language in the state and the judiciary, and a medium of instruction in educational institutions.&lt;ref name="Jeeva"/&gt;

He was a supporter of pure usage of Tamil, which had, to an extent, become corrupted by the influence of [[Sanskrit]] and other languages.  He declared his name to be "Uyirinban", a literal translation of the Sanskrit word ''Jeevanandham''. One of his major influences was the works of the Tamil poet [[Subramania Bharati]], and also Bharati's persona and simple lifestyle. Jeevanandham was the first to take to cultural politics and cited his long struggle for nationalising Subramania Bharati’s songs.
 
He was well-versed in Tamil literature and was a good orator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commemorative stamp on Jeeva released|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/commemorative-stamp-on-jeeva-released/article586671.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=22 August 2010|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeevanandham was the founder of ''Thamara'', a Tamil literary magazine. The Communist Tamil newspaper ''JanaSakthi'' was also begun with his commitment.&lt;ref name="Jeeva"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tributes paid to Jeevanandham|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tributes-paid-to-jeevanandham/article2813011.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=19 January 2012|location=Tiruchi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar encouraged Jeeva to translate [[Bhagat Singh]]’s classic essay "[[Why I am an Atheist]]" in 1933. He translated it into Tamil, which was probably its first-ever translation. It was published by Periyar's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2419/stories/20071005508113100.htm|title=Letters – P.Jeevanandham|author=Chaman Lal|date=5 October 2007|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Jeeva led a busy and hectic life: teaching classes on Marxism for party workers, advising students to equip themselves to meet the nascent republic’s development needs, addressing literary fora on topics such as the greatness of the poet Bharati, explaining the flaws in the government’s language policy at meetings of intellectuals, and addressing factory gate meetings in support of workers on strike. In between, he wrote editorials for the party daily or discussed strategies for resolving industrial disputes.

In 1962, his health suffered a setback. Later in the year he visited the [[Soviet Union]]. He took treatment there and returned by the end of the year. However, his health worsened weeks later. On 18 January 1963, he died at his modest home at [[Tambaram]], near  [[Chennai]].  About two lakh (200,000) people attended his funeral and paid their last respects to one who had toiled all his life for the common man, who symbolised the simplicity of Gandhism and who had a Periyar-like zest for social equality and the Marxist spirit to fight exploitation.

==Trivia==
[[File:Jeevanandam Government Higher Secondary School, Puducherry.JPG|thumbnail|Jeevanandam Government Higher Secondary School, Puducherry]]
* The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation(TNSTC), Erode Division is named the '''Jeeva Transport Corporation''' in modern days.
* The railway station at [[Vyasarpadi]] in [[Chennai]] is named [[Vyasarpadi Jeeva]], as he lived in the area for a period.
* A commemorative stamp on him was issued on 21-August-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Stamps2010.aspx|title=Stamps 2010|publisher=Department of Posts, Indian government|accessdate=30 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814101038/http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Stamps2010.aspx|archivedate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jeevanandam Government Higher Secondary School, Puducherry, is named for him.

==Reputation==
Even his political adversaries respected him. He led a justified and honest life. No one could criticize his personal life.

[[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] leader [[C. N. Annadurai]] saw Jeeva walking down a road, and offered him a ride in his car. Jeeva thanked Annadurai but humbly refused his help.

When Communists were proscribed and subject to arrest, Jeeva took refuge in the home of [[M. R. Radha]], a notable stage and cinema actor. [[Karunanidhi|Kalaignar Karunanidhi]] came to the house, and saw a ''[[Sannyasa|sannyasi]]'' (Hindu renunciate) with a shaved head. He was suspicious of the ''sannyasi'',  trying to remember the well known face. Radha entered the room and asked Karunanidhi whether he could recognize the ''sannyasi''. Later Karunanidhi recognized the ''sannyasi'' as Jeeva.

He and [[C. Rajagopalachari|Rajaji]] were always political rivals but still respected each other.

He and [[K. Kamaraj]] were good allies. On his deathbed, Jeeva told his attendants "Telegram Padma Vathi [his wife]. Call Kamaraj." This shows how close these two leaders were.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2018}}
The '''Pokémon universe''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] construct that exists within the ''[[Pokémon]]'' media franchise, including stories and fictional works produced by [[The Pokémon Company]], [[Nintendo]], [[Game Freak]] and [[Creatures, Inc.]] The concept of the ''Pokémon'' universe, in both the fictional works and the general nonfictional world of ''[[Pokémon]]'', stems from the hobby of [[insect collecting]], a popular pastime which ''Pokémon'' creator [[Satoshi Tajiri]] enjoyed as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html |title=The Ultimate Game Freak: Interview with Satoshi Tajiri |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314021722/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005 | work=Time | date=November 22, 1999 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}, ''TimeAsia'' ([[Waybacked]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Players of the [[Pokémon (video game series)|video games]] are designated as [[Pokémon Trainer]]s, and the two general goals (in most Pokémon games) for such Trainers are: to complete the [[Pokédex]] by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pokémon to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually become the strongest Trainer: the Pokémon Master. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the [[Pokémon (video game series)|video game series]], the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime series]], the [[List of Pokémon manga|manga series]], the [[List of Pokémon films|film series]], and the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]].

==Locations ==
The Pokémon universe takes place in four different locations: the Pokémon world, Deoxys' Unnamed world, Ultra space, and Unknown Dimensions.{{inconsistent|date=October 2018|reason=There are six dimensions including the one Kanto, Johto, etc. are located that are listed here.}}

=== Pokémon World ===
The Pokémon World is the main planet of Pokémon that consists of various landforms and bodies of water and is populated by at least 4,052 people when the populations of every region are combined. The Pokémon World is split into large regions that resemble continents:{{disputed-inline|for=For one thing, Alola and the Sevii Islands are archipelagoes.|date=October 2018}} Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and other small islands. The Pokémon World has areas with different biomes like forests, deserts, jungles, and coastal beaches. Hoenn and Sinnoh boast many dramatic environments ranging from rainforests to deserts. The Pokémon World is mainly green and lush, and many wild Pokémon live in grass.

=== Deoxys' Unnamed World ===
Deoxys' unnamed world is a world that exists in another dimension. It was shown in the Pokémon anime episode "Pokémon Ranger - Deoxys' Crisis! (Part 1)". In this episode, Deoxys, a Pokémon, arrived on the Pokémon world in a meteor whose powerful geomagnetic forces hurt Deoxys and forced it to hide in the Pokémon world. To convince Max to help him, Deoxys takes Max to its dimension. After Ash, Brock, May and Solana fight Deoxys to get Max back, Solana use Miltank's Heal Bell to heal him. Afterward. Deoxys flew away.


=== The Other Dimensions ===
Alternate dimensions in the Pokémon universe were first introduced in the fourth generation of Pokémon. Sinnoh mythology states that Sinnoh's legendary Pokémon can access these alternate dimensions.

==== Unown Dimension ====
The Unown dimension is an alternate space that Unown lives in. This dimension made its debut in ''Spell of the Unknown: Entei''. This dimension appears two more times in episode ''Address Unown!'' and ''The Rise of Darkrai.'' One could transport between Unown Dimension and the real Pokémon Earth through a puzzle box and a portal.

==== Ghost World ====
Also known as the Spirit World, this dimension emits electrical and radio waves and is a shelter of ghost-type Pokémons as well as actual ghosts of Pokémons and people. It first appeared on anime in ''Ghoul Daze!'' and reappeared in ''Scare at the Litwick Mansion.'' The Reaper Cloth, a held item introduced in Generation IV (4), is from the Ghost World.

==== Mirror World ====
Mirror World is a dimension connected to the Reflection Cave that debuted in the Pokémon XY anime episode ''The Cave of Mirrors!''. In this dimension identical to the Pokémon world, humans and Pokémon are physically and characteristically opposite. In the Mirror World, portals to other worlds in the Cave is considered to be a myth. After sunset, people from different dimensions will be trapped in Mirror World forever.

==== Ultra Space ====
Ultra Space is where Ultra Beasts live. It is connected with Pokémon Earth through Ultra Wormholes, which are unstable portals that the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo and Lunala can manipulate and create. It is later revealed to be an interdimensional space that connects to alternate universes and worlds in the Multiverse. Cosmog can create Ultra Wormholes as well, but it will most likely die if forced to use this power. Because of this power, it is theorized by the Aether Foundation and the Dimensional Research Lab to be an Ultra Beast. It made its debut in ''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon''.

==Regions==
There are several regions that have appeared in the various media of the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise. Each of the seven generations of the main series releases focuses on a new region. Moreover, several regions have been introduced in [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] games, and one in the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]], though most of these are still within the same [[fictional universe]]. Usually, the different regions are not accessible from one another via land (or at all within a single game). However, Kanto can be accessed from Johto and vice versa via the sea in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'']], ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'', [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'', and ''SoulSilver'']] versions.

Every region consists of several cities and towns that the player must explore in order to overcome many waiting challenges such as [[Pokémon Gyms|Gyms]], [[Pokémon Contest|Contests]], and [[Pokémon crime syndicates|villainous teams]]. At different locations within each region, the player can find different types of Pokémon, as well as helpful items and characters. Many regions are on separate [[continent]]s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} though many are based on parts of the real-world country of [[Japan]] (and the [[United States]] and [[France]] in the cases of [[Pokémon Black and White#Setting|Unova]] and [[Kalos]], respectively). Most regions feature locations that have some significance to the story and are unique in that they have unique properties and usually involve myths.

===Kanto===
{{See also|Pokémon Red and Blue#Setting}}
The Kanto region is the setting of the first generation of ''Pokémon'' games, [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'', ''Blue'']], and ''[[Pokémon Yellow|Yellow]]'', and their remakes, [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']]. Based on the real-life [[Kantō region]] of Japan, this setting started the precedent of basing the geography and culture of the game's region on a real world setting. This region is also visited in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'']], ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'', [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'', and ''SoulSilver'']].

The antagonists of this region are [[Team Rocket]].

The three starter Pokémon of this region are [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], and [[Squirtle]], setting the trend of each region's starters being the Grass, Fire, and Water types.

===Johto===
{{See also|Pokémon Gold and Silver#Setting}}
The Johto region is the setting of the second generation of ''Pokémon'' games, which includes [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'']], ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'', and their remakes, [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']]. Again based on an area of Japan, this game's geography is based upon the [[Kansai region|Kansai]], [[Tōkai region|Tokai]], and eastern [[Shikoku]] areas of the country. The game setting draws upon the Kansai region's abundance of temples, the architectural design of the Kansai region, and its geographical sights, such as [[Mount Fuji]] and the [[Naruto whirlpools]].

Team Rocket once again feature as the antagonists.

The three starter Pokémon in this region are [[Chikorita]], [[Cyndaquil]], and [[Totodile]].

===Hoenn===
{{See also|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire#Setting}}
The Hoenn region is the setting of the third generation of ''Pokémon'' games, [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'']], and ''[[Pokémon Emerald|Emerald]]'', as well as their remakes [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pokémon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']]. This time being based on the Japanese island of [[Kyushu]]; the real world and game region share an abundance of smaller islands around the main one and a subtropical climate.

This setting also introduced two new teams of antagonists, Team Magma and Team Aqua. Only Team Magma appears as an antagonist in ''Ruby'' and ''Omega Ruby'', and only Team Aqua in ''Sapphire'' and ''Alpha Sapphire''. In ''Emerald'', both teams are antagonists. Like Sinnoh, this region is known to have a large range of various natural environments, such as rainforests and deserts.

The three starter Pokémon in this region are [[Treecko]], [[Torchic]], and [[Mudkip]].

===Sinnoh===

The Sinnoh region is the setting of the fourth generation of ''Pokémon'' games, which encompasses the setting of [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], and ''[[Pokémon Platinum|Platinum]]''. It is based on the northernmost island of Japan, [[Hokkaidō]]. The region was meant to have a "northern" feel, with some routes being entirely covered in snow.

The antagonists of this region are Team Galactic. The game also introduced Arceus, a secret Pokémon who serves as the creator deity of the Pokémon universe. Like Hoenn, this region is known to have a large range of various natural environments such as rainforests and deserts.

The three starter Pokémon in this region are [[Turtwig]], [[Chimchar]], and [[Piplup]].

===Unova===

The Unova region is the setting of the fifth generation of ''Pokémon'' games, which encompasses the setting of [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']] and their sequels [[Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|''Pokémon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']]. For the first time in the main series, the region was based on a region outside Japan, with Unova taking inspiration from the island of [[Manhattan]].

The antagonists, Team Plasma, are loosely based on the [[Knights Templar]], though in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' they have a pirate motif.

The three starter Pokémon in this region are [[Snivy]], [[Tepig]], and [[Oshawott]].

===Kalos===

The Kalos region is the setting of the sixth generation of ''Pokémon'' games, which is where the games [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']] take place. This region is inspired almost entirely by France, with landmarks such as the [[Eiffel Tower]] having their own representations here, along with a French style of music and fashion.

The antagonists of Kalos are Team Flare.

The three starter Pokémon in this region are [[Chespin]], [[Fennekin]], and [[Froakie]].

===Alola===
The Alola region is the setting of the seventh generation of ''Pokémon'' games, [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']]. This region is based on [[Hawaii]], marking the second time a main entry ''Pokémon'' game setting has been inspired by a U.S. state. The name itself is a play on ''[[aloha]]'', the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word for both "hello" and "goodbye".

In ''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'', the antagonists are Team Skull, sporting a punk gang aesthetic. In ''Pokémon Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'', Team Rainbow Rocket are introduced as additional antagonists alongside Team Skull, and they are based on the original Team Rocket from the first Pokémon games. Various villainous team leaders from previous generations in the series also make appearances in this sequel.

The three starter Pokémon in this region are [[Rowlet]], [[Litten (Pokémon)|Litten]], and [[Popplio]].

==Chronology==
{{fiction|section|date=October 2018}}
===Creation===
According to [[Sinnoh]] legends, in the beginning, there was nothing but chaos. Then, at the center of the chaos, an egg appeared, from which hatched [[Arceus]]. Arceus then created [[Dialga]], the embodiment of time, [[Palkia]], the embodiment of space, and [[Giratina]], who was banished to another dimension as the embodiment of antimatter. Arceus then created [[Azelf]], [[Mesprit]] and [[Uxie]]; the spirits of willpower, emotion and knowledge respectively. At this early time, Mew the ancestor of Pokémon, appeared in the universe. After creating the [[Pokémon Earth]], [[Arceus]] went into an eternal sleep.

After Arceus' creation, [[Groudon]], embodiment of the land, [[Kyogre]], embodiment of the sea, and [[Rayquaza]], the sky high Pokémon, were born. They are sometimes unofficially known as "the weather trio", as each of these Pokémon possess weather-changing abilities. The clash of these three Pokémon was said to have created much of the Earth's surface. [[Mountain Coronet]], the mountain that the Sinnoh region surrounds, was created at this point of time as [[Regigigas]] moved landmass to form continents and regions. [[Stark Mountain]] and [[Heatran]] were also created at this time.

Many years after, the prehistoric era began and the first prehistoric Pokémon came into being. The games state that scientists proved that prehistoric Pokémon roamed the land, as [[Fossil]]s and other archaeological remains have been found to contain the DNA of Pokémon. It is possible that the Mew population on the planet may have decreased at this stage, as they slowly gave way to other Pokémon species.

=== Evolution ===
According to myths of Sinnoh, Pokémon and people were originally the same species. This theory has not been proven, but it has reappeared many times in Pokémon. Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon, and the first human recording was in the Stone Age, millions of years before the modern era. There is also scientific evidence that Pokémon are a single species, and the different creatures are subspecies, explaining their ability to interbreed.

&lt;!--



This section clearly is not referring to the game mechanic where Pokémon change form from battling trainers or players trading their Pokémon with others but about ancestry and genetics.



--&gt;

=== Modern History ===
In modern history, the temperature in Sinnoh has dropped dramatically. Team Galactic summons Dialga, Palkia and Giratina to create a portal to the Distortion World, a timespace dimension indicated by the Time-Space Axis in Michina Town.

'''Progressors''' in [[science fiction]] are people of an advanced space-faring civilization who facilitate progress of less advanced civilizations. It comes from a perspective very much the opposite of what motivates [[Star Trek]]'s famous [[Prime Directive]].

The term ''progressor'' was coined by [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky]] for their [[Noon Universe]] ([[1961 in literature|1961]]-[[1985 in literature|1985]]), the term was mentioned in ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'' ([[1964 in literature|1964]]), and later it (as well as a similar term ''regressor'') was also used by [[Sergey Lukyanenko]] in the duology ''[[The Stars Are Cold Toys]]'' ([[1997 in literature|1997]]), although with a somewhat different meaning. [[Doris Lessing]] explores the same themes in her ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series ([[1979 in literature|1979]]-[[1983 in literature|1983]]), but she calls it [[forced evolution]]. A similar concept is the basis of [[Iain M. Banks]]' [[Culture series]] (1987-2012); the organization carrying out the work is named ''[[Special Circumstances]]''. [[David Brin]]'s [[Uplift Universe]] novels ([[1980 in literature|1980]]-[[1998 in literature|1998]]) focus on the closely related phenomenon of [[biological uplift]].

The aims of the time traveling society in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The End of Eternity]]'', which is constantly interfering with, changing and "improving" history, are in many ways similar.

==Noon Universe Progressors==
Strugatsky's progressors are agents of the [[Earth (Noon Universe)#Institute of Experimental History|Institute of Experimental History]] (IEH), in some cases indirectly controlled by two  [[Earth (Noon Universe)#COMCON|Committees for Contacts with Other Civilizations]] (COMCONs). They are working only with [[Humans (Noon Universe)|human]] civilizations, apparently, not daring to "progress" non-human races, like [[Leoniders]] or [[Headies]], with whom Earth prefers to keep a full scaled diplomatic contact. Aware of a possible [[xenophobia]], progressors usually employ stealth and secrecy to work [[undercover]], allowing only a few of the brightest and most trustworthy individuals on a planet to know their true background.

The idea of progressorism is to "straighten the history", i.e. to facilitate the way of primitive civilizations to [[Strugatsky#Noon Universe|Noon Universe]]-like condition and is based on the fictional ''theory of Historical Consequences'', which determines "what is good or bad, right or not in history". Progressors diminish casualties, inflicted by historical processes or inevitable crises. However, they don't hesitate to kill in order to survive (or to achieve other goals). This contradicts the usual [[mindset]] of the Noon Universe, according to which every "bearer of reason" is a priori ethically equivalent to oneself. It's why most humans don't like progressors. &lt;!--[[Maxim Kammerer]], who was one of the first progressors, admits in [[Beetle in the Anthill]], that he doesn't like progressors himself. But progressorism seems to be the only option for the Earth to deal with those civilizations.--&gt;

In ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'', collaborators of the Institute (such as don Rumata) are merely observers/historians gathering material for the theory of Historical Consequences, and saving scientists and poets is their personal activity. True progressors appear not earlier than in ''[[Prisoners of Power|Inhabited Island]]'' and ''[[Beetle in an Anthill]]''.

[[Wanderers (Noon Universe)|Wanderers]] seem to "progress" some civilizations (including [[Earth (Noon Universe)|Earth]]), too, being ahead of humans in every aspect, from secrecy to efficiency. However, [[Leonid Gorbovsky]] thinks of this possibility as a ridiculous one:

:''In the whole universe only our humankind practices progressorism, because our history is like that, because we weep over our past... We can't change it and we strive at least to help others, since we didn't manage to help ourselves in time... That's where our Progressorism comes from! And the Wanderers, even if their past did resemble ours, are so far from it now that they don't even remember it.''

===Progressor Projects in the 22nd Century===
The middle of the 22nd century was a boom for IEH and progressors. Here are some of their most famous projects.

* '''Saula Project'''. Never actually described in any book, this project was presumably initiated in 2141 AD, right after the discovery of [[Saula (fictional planet)|Saula]] and the reactivation of IEH.
* '''Arkanar Project'''. Despite the fact that [[Arkanar]] was discovered back in 2134, a full scaled progressor operation was started only in 2141. Because at that point the planet already entered the [[Renaissance]] stage, progressors' actions generally consisted of protecting and rescuing (if necessary) scientists and artists persecuted by [[reactionary]] governments. Apart from that, Arkanar was the planet where the ''Basic Theory of Feudalism'' was tested and polished. The ''Arkanar Project'' has been known for causing severe [[psychological trauma]]s to IEH agents working on it. Most infamous incident on Arkanar is known as "[[Arkanar#Arkanar Massacre|Arkanar Massacre]]".  (The concept of Arkanar massacre was invented not by Strugatsky's, but by another author, Sergey Pereslegin, who continued their story.)
* '''Giganda Project'''. Like Arkanar, [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Giganda|Giganda]] was discovered (in 2136) long before an official progressor operation on it was launched (in 2143). By the 2153 AD progressors managed to stop the war, which was started, probably, long before Earth's explorers even landed on the planet. [[Minor personalities of the Noon Universe#Yashmaa, Kornei|Korney Yashmaa]], one of the "[[Stepchildren (Noon Universe)|Stepchildren]]" participated in ''Giganda Project'' in 2177.
* '''Saraksh Project'''. After its discovery in 2148, [[Saraksh]] immediately became subject to a progressor project which four years later was personally headed by the chief of COMCON-2, [[Rudolf Sikorski]]. For nine years progressors tried to ease the tension between rivaling states on the planet, but their efforts were ruined by unknowing [[Maxim Kammerer]] in 2157. The ''"Kammerer Crisis"'' was another serious failure of IEH.
** '''"Headies in the Space"'''. A Saraksh sub-project, it was initiated after a full scaled diplomatic contact with [[Headies]] was established. A group of progressors led by [[Lev Abalkin]] (a Headies-expert and one of the "Stepchildren") shared the space-travelling technologies with the kynoid race and helped them to establish a permanent embassy on Earth. The project commenced in the skies over [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Pandora|Pandora]].
* '''Ark Project'''. Initiated in 2161, right after the discovery of [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Pant|Pant]], this operation was intended to transport all Pantians to another planet which would not be in danger of a stellar catastrophe. The initial choice was [[Ark (Noon Universe)|Ark]], but after the discovery of a sentient alien race on it progressors had to find another target planet. At this point the project got a second goal: to establish a contact with [[Ark Megaforms]]. It isn't stated anywhere in the books how (and if) the ''Ark Project'' was ever completed.
* '''Operation "Dead World"'''. The goal of this operation (initiated in 2162) was to rescue the remnant population of [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Hope|Hope]] from their homeworld which was devastated by a global ecological catastrophe. However, the people of Hope fiercely rejected any help from progressors, apparently, believing them to be Wanderers' agents. Lev Abalkin and his Headie companion, [[Minor personalities of the Noon Universe#Schyokn-Itrch|Schyokn-Itrch]], participated in this operation in 2162.

After 2162 the public opinion has, apparently, forced ''Institute of Experimental History'' to stop initiating new projects.

==Lukyanenko's Progressors==
Unlike Strugatky's progressors who were selfless knights of [[altruism]] and science, Lukyanenko's ones are mere an instrument of power employed by the government of one of the most technologically advanced civilizations in the universe described in ''[[The Stars Are Cold Toys]]'' and ''[[Star Shadow]]''. This civilization (called ''Geometers (Геометры)'', because of their love for order: e.g. they even reshaped the two continents of their home planet to resemble a [[circle]] and a [[Square (geometry)|square]]) bears a striking resemblance to the [[Earth (Noon Universe)|Earth]] of Noon Universe. In both, upbringing of a person is fulfilled by teachers not parents. But while Teachers of the Noon Universe help to develop the brightest sides of a personality and to form morally brought up person, Mentors of Geometers tend to meet the needs of society — forming good mannered people, unable to violate any rules of the society at all. The author himself commented that he wasn't really sure that a system described by Strugatsky brothers could function properly and presented his own vision of it.

Geometers were obsessed with an idea of building an interstellar brotherhood of all kinds of races (in other words, a form of [[imperialism]] — a doctrine not common in [[Noon Universe]]). But while it's impossible to change the ideology of an advanced society by force, Geometers use ''regressors'' to exterminate technology of the planet to the level, at which inhabitants will easily accept ideas of Friendship. This is where ''progressors'' came in: they raise the technological and social level, while bringing up races in the "true" way.

The '''Proto-Samic language''' is the hypothetical, [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] common ancestor of the [[Sami languages]]. It is a descendant of the [[Proto-Uralic language]].

==Homeland and expansion==
Although the current Sami languages are spoken much further to the north and west, Proto-Samic was likely spoken in the area of modern-day Southwestern Finland around the first few centuries CE. Local (in [[Sápmi]]) ancestors of the modern [[Sami people]] likely still spoke non-Uralic, [[Neolithic Europe#Language|"Paleoeuropean"]] languages at this point (see [[Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate]]). This situation can be traced in [[toponymy|placenames]] as well as through the analysis of loanwords from Germanic, Baltic and Finnic. Evidence also can be found for the existence of language varieties closely related to but likely distinct from Samic proper having been spoken further east, with a limit around [[Lake Beloye (Vologda Oblast)|Lake Beloye]].

Separation of the main branches (West Samic and East Samic) is also likely to have occurred in southern Finland, with these later independently spreading north into Sápmi. The exact routes of this are not clear: it is possible Western Sami entered Scandinavia across [[Kvarken]] rather than via land. Concurrently, [[Finnic languages]] that would eventually end up becoming modern-day Finnish and Karelian were being adopted in the southern end of the Proto-Samic area, likely in connection with the introduction of agriculture, a process that continued until the 19th century, leading to the extirpation of original Samic languages in [[Karelia]] and all but northernmost Finland.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The Proto-Samic consonant inventory is mostly faithfully retained from Proto-Uralic, and is considerably smaller than what is typically found in modern Sami languages. There were 16 contrastive consonants, most of which could however occur both short and [[geminate]]:

Stop and affricate consonants were split in three main allophones with respect to [[phonation]]:
* Plain voiceless {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[ts]}} etc, occurred word-initially, adjacent to other voiceless consonants, and in the strong grade of single intervocalic consonants
* Lax voiceless {{IPA|[b̥]}}, {{IPA|[d̥]}}, {{IPA|[d̥z̥]}} etc, occurred between voiced sounds
* [[Preaspiration|Preaspirated]] {{IPA|[ʰpː]}}, {{IPA|[ʰtː]}}, {{IPA|[ʰtsː]}} etc, occurred in geminates

The [[spirant]] {{UPA|*δ}} also had two allophones, voiceless {{IPA|[θ]}} occurring word-initially and syllable-finally, and voiced {{IPA|[ð]}} elsewhere.

====Consonant gradation====

A detailed system of [[allophony]] is reconstructible, known as '''[[consonant gradation]]'''. Gradation applied to all intervocalic single consonants as well as all consonant clusters. This is unlike gradation in the related [[Proto-Finnic]] and [[Finnic languages|its descendants]], where it applied only to a subset. The conditioning factor was the same, however: the '''weak grade''' occurred if the following syllable was [[closed syllable|closed]], the '''strong grade''' if it was [[open syllable|open]]. This difference was originally probably realized as [[length (phonetics)|length]]:

* A single consonant was short in the weak grade, e.g. {{IPA|[s]}}, half-long in the strong grade {{IPA|[sˑ]}}
* A geminate consonant was long {{IPA|[sː]}} in the weak grade, overlong {{IPA|[sːː]}} in the strong grade
* A consonant cluster had a short 1st member in the weak grade, e.g. {{IPA|[sm]}}, a half-long one in the strong grade, {{IPA|[sˑm]}}

Gradation only applied after a stressed syllable; after an unstressed syllable all medial consonants appeared in the weak grade.

In sources on Proto-Samic reconstruction, gradation is often assumed but not indicated graphically. In this article, when it is relevant and necessary to show the distinction, the weak grade is denoted with an inverted breve below the consonant(s): ''s'' : ''s̯'', ''č'' : ''č̯'', ''tt'' : ''t̯t̯'', ''lk'' : ''l̯k̯''.&lt;!-- The regular breve above is sometimes used, but not in this article because it would be difficult to read with letters that also have an acute or caron. --&gt;

After the phonematization of gradation due to loss of word-final sounds, Samic varieties could be left with as many as four different contrastive degrees of consonant length. This has only been attested in some dialects of [[Ume Sami language|Ume Sami]]. Most other Samic varieties phonemically merged the weak grade of geminates with the strong grade of single consonants, leaving only three lengths. In some Samic languages, other sound developments have left only two or three degrees occurring elsewhere.

===Vowels===
An asymmetric system of four short and five long vowel segments can be reconstructed.

| colspan="2" | {{UPA|ā}} {{IPA|[aː]}}
|}
|}

* The four [[diphthong]]s {{UPA|*ie *ea *oa *uo}} only occurred in stressed syllables, in [[complementary distribution]] with the two long vowels {{UPA|*ē *ō}} occurring in unstressed syllables.
* {{UPA|*ā}} did not generally occur in the last syllable of a word.

===Prosody===

Stress was not phonemic in Proto-Samic. The first syllable of a word invariably received primary stress. Non-initial syllables of a word received secondary stress, according to a [[trochaic]] pattern of alternating secondarily-stressed and unstressed syllables. Odd-numbered syllables (counting from the start) were stressed, while even-numbered syllables were unstressed. The last syllable of a word was never stressed. Thus, a word could end in either a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (if the last syllable was even-numbered) or a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (if the last syllable was odd-numbered). This gave the following pattern, which could be extended indefinitely (P = primary stress, S = secondary stress, _ = no stress):
* P
* P _
* P _ _
* P _ S _
* P _ S _ _
* P _ S _ S _
* etc.

Because the four diphthongs could only occur in stressed syllables, this stress pattern often led to alternations between vowels in different forms of the same word. More crucially, it led to alternations in inflectional endings between different words, depending on whether the second-last syllable of that word was stressed or not.

This alternation survives in many Samic languages in the form of distinct inflectional classes, with words with a stressed second-last syllable following the so-called "even" or "two-syllable" inflection, and words with an unstressed second-last syllable following the "odd" or "three-syllable" inflection. Weakening and simplification of non-final consonants after unstressed syllables contributed further to the alternation, leading to differences that are sometimes quite striking. For example:

| ''vaˊstteˊžem''
|}

In compounds, which consisted of a combination of several root words, each word retained the stress pattern that it had in isolation, so that that stress remained lexically significant (i.e. could theoretically distinguish compounds from non-compounds). The first syllable of the first part of a compound had the strongest stress, with progressively weaker secondary stress for the first syllables of the remaining parts.

Several of the singular cases do not have a clear counterpart in the plural, or have different formations ancestral to different Sami languages. For example, what would later become the accusative plural developed out of the partitive plural form, while the inessive plural is the original essive plural form. The comitative plural was in origin a periphrastic construction consisting of the genitive plural with the noun ''*kuojmē'' "companion". It is likely that the case system was still partially in development during the late Proto-Samic period, and developed in subtly different ways in the various descendants.

In most Samic languages, the case system has been simplified:
* The partitive has been lost in most western languages.
* In several languages the genitive and accusative singular have coincided, and in Northern Sami this led to an analogical merger in the plural. Southern and Pite Sami still keep the two cases separate.
* A sound change *sn &gt; *st that occurred in the history of several Sami languages caused a merging of the inessive and elative singular, creating a single "locative" case. Several languages merged the plural cases analogically, but some languages chose the former inessive plural form, while others chose the elative plural.

* The [[conditional mood]] had the mood marker ''*-kćē-'' (cognate to the [[Estonian grammar|Estonian]] conditional marker ''-ks-''), to which past tense endings were attached. In Western Samic, a new conditional mood was innovated, consisting of the connegative form of the verb joined to a past-tense form of the copula ''*leatēk''.
* The [[potential mood]] had the mood marker ''*-ńćë-'' (cognate to the [[Finnish grammar|Finnish]] conditional marker ''-isi-''). It received present-tense endings.

The following non-finite forms were also present:
* Infinitive ''*-tēk'', identical with the Finnic ending ''*-dak''.
* Verbal noun ''*-mē'', identical with the Finnic verbal noun suffix ''*-ma''.
* Present participle ''*-jē'', originally an agent noun suffix, cognate to the Finnic agent noun suffix ''*-ja''.
* Past participle ''*-më'' or extended ''*-mëńćë''. The extended form is identical with the Finnish verbal noun/"fourth infinitive" suffix ''*-minen'' ~ ''*-mice-''.

==Lexicon==
The vocabulary reconstructible for Proto-Samic has been catalogued by Lehtiranta (1989), who records approximately 1500 word roots&lt;!--indexed up to 1479; excluding pronoun roots--&gt;, for which either a pre-Samic ancestry is assured, or whose distribution across the Sami languages reaches at least from Lule Sami to Skolt Sami. Within this sample, loanwords from the Finnic and Scandinavian languages already constitute major subsets, numbering slightly over 150 and 100, respectively.

==Development==

===From Proto-Uralic===

* {{UPA|*a}} followed by {{UPA|*i}} &gt; {{UPA|*o}} followed by {{UPA|*a}}.
* {{UPA|*ï}} &gt; {{UPA|*a}}, a change shared with the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Mordvinic languages]]. This change [[Counterfeeding order|counterfeeds]] the previous one.
* {{UPA|*ü}} &gt; {{UPA|*i}}.
* Loss of [[vowel harmony]] (if it existed). In non-initial syllables, front and back harmonic allophones collapsed into one: {{UPA|*ï}} &gt; {{UPA|*i}} and {{UPA|*ä}} &gt; {{UPA|*a}}.
* {{UPA|*δ́}} &gt; {{UPA|*δ}}, a development also shared with Finnic and Mordvinic.
* {{UPA|*č, *š}} &gt; {{UPA|*c, *s}}
* Vowels are lengthened before {{UPA|*x}}.{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|p=190}}
* {{UPA|*ś, *x}} &gt; {{UPA|*ć, *k}} before a vowel. {{UPA|*x}} is lost elsewhere.
* {{UPA|*ns}} &gt; {{UPA|*ss}}
* {{UPA|*sj}} &gt; {{UPA|*šš}}
* {{UPA|*kj, *kl, *kń}} &gt; {{UPA|*vj, *vl, *vń}}

This approximate point of Pre-Samic marks the introduction of the oldest Western Indo-European loanwords from Baltic and Germanic. Loans were also acquired from its southern relative Finnic, substituting the early Finnic sound {{UPA|*š}} with Samic {{UPA|*ś}}. Likely contemporary to these were the oldest loanwords adapted from [[Substrate language|extinct Paleo-European languages]] during the northwestward expansion of Pre-Samic. Prime suspects for words of this origin include replacements of Uralic core vocabulary, or words that display consonant clusters that cannot derive from either PU or any known Indo-European source. A number of the later type can be found in the Finnic languages as well.

Examples:
* PU {{UPA|''*śečä''}} &gt; preS {{UPA|''*ćeca''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*ćeacē''}} 'uncle'
* PU {{UPA|''*δ́ümä''}} &gt; preS {{UPA|''*δima''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*δëmē''}} 'glue'
* PU {{UPA|''*kïnta''}} &gt; preS {{UPA|''*kanto(j)''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*kuontōj''}} 'tree stump'
* PU {{UPA|''*mexi-''}} &gt; preS {{UPA|''*mēki-''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*miekë-''}} 'to sell'
* Baltic {{UPA|''*šalna''}} → preS {{UPA|''*salna''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*suolnē''}} 'frost'
* Germanic {{UPA|''*raudaz''}} 'red' → preS {{UPA|''*rawta''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*ruovtē''}} 'iron'
* Germanic {{UPA|''*hansa-''}} → preS {{UPA|''*kansa''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*kuossē''}} 'guest'
* Finnic {{UPA|''*pošja''}} → preS {{UPA|''*pośja''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*poaśśē''}} 'rear'
* substrate? → preS {{UPA|''*keðka''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*keaðkē''}} 'rock', in place of Uralic {{UPA|''*kiwi''}}
* substrate? → preS {{UPA|''*mori''}} or {{UPA|''*mari''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*muorë''}} "wood", in place of Uralic {{UPA|''*puwï''}} or {{UPA|''*puxï''}}
* substrate? → preS {{UPA|''*ašŋVn''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*vuosŋōn''}} 'perch' (cf. Finnish ''ahven'')
* substrate? → preS {{UPA|''*šewšim''}} &gt; PS {{UPA|''*sëvsëm''}} 'feather' (cf. Finnish ''höyhen'')

Later consonant changes mostly involved the genesis of the consonant gradation system, but also the simplification of various consonant clusters, chiefly in loanwords.
* Geminate fricatives {{UPA|*ss, *śś}} were introduced in certain loanwords.
* {{UPA|*ŋ}} was denasalized before a [[heterorganic]] [[obstruent consonant|obstruent]].
** PU {{UPA|*joŋsə}} → PS {{UPA|*juoksë}} 'bow'
** PU {{UPA|*oŋtə}} → PS {{UPA|*vuovtë}} 'cavity'

====Vowel shift====
A fairly late but major development within Samic was a complete upheaval of the vowel system, which has been compared in scope to the [[Great Vowel Shift]] of English.

The previous changes left a system consisting of {{UPA|*i *e *ä *a *o *u}} in the first syllable in Pre-Samic, and probably at least long {{UPA|*ī *ē *ū}}. In unstressed syllables, only {{UPA|*i *a *o}} were distinguished. The source of {{UPA|*o}} is unclear, although it is frequently also found in Finnic.

The table below shows the main correspondences:

|-
| i
| ë
|-

| ē, i (...j), ā (...ë)
|-

| ō, u (...ë)
|}
|}

The processes that added up to this shift can be outlined as follows:

# Lowering: {{UPA|*i *u}} &gt; {{UPA|*ɪ *ʊ}}, including unstressed {{UPA|*i}}.{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|pp=181–182}} 
# Raising: {{UPA|*e}} &gt; {{UPA|*ɪ}} before a following {{UPA|*ɪ}}. There are also irregular examples with {{UPA|*o}} &gt; {{UPA|*ʊ}} (for example ''*kolmi'' 'three' &gt; ''*kʊlmi'' &gt; Proto-Samic ''*kolmë'' &gt; Northern Sami ''golbma'').
# All non-close vowels are lengthened: {{UPA|*e *ä *a *o}} &gt; {{UPA|*ē *ǟ *ā *ō}}. If earlier long non-close vowels existed, they were merged with their short counterparts by this time.

At this point, the vowel system consisted of only two short vowels {{UPA|*ɪ *ʊ}} in initial syllables, alongside the full complement of long vowels {{UPA|*ī *ē *ǟ *ā *ō *ū}}. In non-initial syllables, the vowels were {{IPA|*ɪ *ā *ō}}. After this, several [[metaphony|metaphonic]] changes then occurred that rearranged the distribution of long vowels in stressed syllables.

* {{UPA|*ē *ǟ *ō}} &gt; {{UPA|*ɛ̄ *ā *ɔ̄}} before {{UPA|*ā}} and {{UPA|*ō}}. This may indicate that second-syllable {{UPA|*ō}} was a relatively open vowel such as {{IPA|[ɔː]}}.{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|p=181}}
* {{UPA|*ǟ *ā}} &gt; {{UPA|*ē *ō}} before {{UPA|*ɪ}}.
* {{UPA|*ā}} &gt; {{UPA|*ō}} also elsewhere.
{{harvcoltxt|Sammallahti|1998|pp=182–183}} suggests the following four phases:
# Lowering of mid vowels before {{UPA|*ā}} and {{UPA|*ō}}.
# Raising of open vowels before {{UPA|*ɪ}}, merging with the un-lowered mid vowels.
# Raising of remaining {{UPA|*ā}}.
# Backing of remaining {{UPA|*ǟ}}. &lt;!--including monosyllables; add citation--&gt;

The inventory of long vowels in stressed syllables now featured seven members: {{UPA|*ī *ē *ɛ̄ *ā *ɔ̄ *ō *ū}}. However, in native vocabulary {{UPA|*ē *ɛ̄}} remained in complementary distribution: the closed-mid vowel only occurred before following {{UPA|*ɪ}}, the open-mid vowel only before following {{UPA|*ā}}, {{UPA|*ō}}.

Further changes then shifted the sound values of the unstressed syllables that had conditioned the above shift:
# {{UPA|*āj}} &gt; {{UPA|*īj}}, regardless of following vowels.
# {{UPA|*ā}} &gt; {{UPA|*ē}}, unless followed by {{UPA|*ɪ}} in a third or later syllable.
# {{UPA|*ō}} &gt; {{UPA|*u}} before {{UPA|*ɪ}}.&lt;!-- Sammallahti dates these changes as later than shortening of ī ū; I do not know if we should mark these new unstressed close vowels as long.--&gt;

Lastly, a number of unconditional shifts adjusted the sound values of the vowel phonemes.
# {{UPA|*ē *ɛ̄ *ɔ̄ *ō}} &gt; {{UPA|*ie *ea *oa *uo}}, in initial syllables. Word initially, {{UPA|*ie *uo}} &gt; {{UPA|*jie *vuo}}.
# {{UPA|*ɪ *ʊ}} &gt; {{UPA|*ë *o}}. There likely was an intermediate {{UPA|*e}} for the first of these.{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|pp=185–186}}
# {{UPA|*ī *ū}} &gt; {{UPA|*i *u}}.

To what extent the two last changes should be dated to Proto-Samic proper is unclear. Although all Sami languages show these changes in at least some words, in [[Southern Sami]] and [[Ume Sami]] earlier {{UPA|*ī}}, {{UPA|*ɪ}}, {{UPA|*ʊ}}, {{UPA|*ū}} are regularly reflected as ''ij'', ''i'', ''u'', ''uv'' in stressed [[open syllable]]s. It is possible that these are [[archaism]]s, and shortening and lowering occurred only after the initial division of Proto-Samic into dialects.{{sfn|Itkonen|1939|pp=63-64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Tálos|first=Endre|year=1987|chapter=On the vowels of Proto-Uralic|editor-last=Rédei|editor-first=Károly|title=Studien zur Phonologie und Morphonologie der uralischen Sprachen|series=Studia Uralica|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects of the vowel shift can be illustrated by the following comparison between Northern Sami, and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], known for retaining vowel values very close to Proto-Uralic. All word pairs correspond to each other regularly:

===Towards the modern Sami languages===
The main division among the Sami languages is the split between eastern and western Samic.

Changes that appear across the Eastern-Western divide are:
* Denasalisation of clusters of nasal plus homorganic consonant to geminate voiced or partially voiced stops (all except Akkala, Kildin and Ter Sami). This appears to have originally been a Western Samic innovation that then spread to Inari and Skolt Sami, as it was still productive in those languages after the borrowing of certain words that escaped the process in Western Samic. For example, Finnish ''anteeksi'' was borrowed into Northern Sami as ''ándagassii'' after the change, thus with a newly-introduced nasal, while Inari Sami has ''addâgâs'', borrowed before the change and thus lacking the nasal.
* Preaspiration of single stops and affricates (all except Akkala, Kildin and Ter Sami).
* Development of the rare phoneme ''*θ'' to ''*t'' word-initially. Southern Sami and Ume Sami have ''*h'' instead.
* Deaffrication of ''*c'' and ''*č'' before another consonant. This change occurred in a large area in the middle of the Sami area, with the outliers Southern, Akkala, Kildin, Ter and partly also Skolt Sami preserving the original affricates.

====Western Samic====
Innovations common to the Western Samic languages:
* Pre-stopped or pre-glottalised nasals develop from original geminate nasals (not in Sea Sami).
* Vocalisation of ''*š'' to ''*j'' before a stop (not in Sea Sami).
* Metathesis and fortition of ''*ŋv'' to ''*vk''.
* Assimilation of ''*ŋm'' to ''*mm'', which then becomes pre-stopped/pre-glottalised.
* Merging of clusters of stop plus homorganic nasal with single nasals.

The Southern West Samic languages consist of [[Southern Sami]] and [[Ume Sami]], and have a number of further innovations:{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|pp=7–8}}
* Lengthening of short syllables, either by lengthening stressed {{UPA|*i *u}} to /ij uv/ in open syllables, or geminating single consonants after other short vowels.
* Stressed {{UPA|*ë *o}} are raised to /i u/ in open syllables (in Ume Sami only if the next vowel is not {{UPA|*ë}}).
* Reduction of consonant gradation. It is only partly present in Ume Sami, and entirely lost in Southern Sami.

The Northern West Samic languages consist of [[Pite Sami]], [[Lule Sami]] and Northern Sami. They have one important common innovation:
* Pre-stopped or pre-glottalised nasals develop also from strong-grade single nasals (not in Sea Sami).

Pite Sami and Lule Sami form their own smaller subgroup of shared innovations, which might be termed Northwestern West Samic:{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|p=8}}
* 2nd syllable {{UPA|*ë}} is assimilated to /o/ after 1st syllable /o/.
* The distinction between single and geminate stops ({{UPA|*p *pp}} etc.) is neutralized after the liquids /l/, /r/.

Northern Sami by itself has its own unique changes:
* Change of *p to *k in clusters before a stop or sibilant.
* Merging of accusative and genitive cases.
* Merging of the inessive into the elative to form a common locative case, with the ending used depending on dialect.
* Loss of the past tense of the negative verb, in favour of a construction using the present tense of the negative verb with the past participle (like Finnish).

====Eastern Samic====
The Eastern Samic languages have the following innovations:
* Contraction of syllables before ''*nč''.
* Development of ''ŋ'' to ''v'' before another labial sonorant.
* Merging of clusters of stop plus homorganic nasal with geminate nasals.

The Mainland East Samic languages, [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]], [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] and [[Akkala Sami]], share further innovations:{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|p=26}}
* Gemination of {{UPA|*s *ś *c *ć *k}} even in the weak grade.
* Merging of unstressed {{UPA|*u}} with {{UPA|*ɔ̄}}.

Skolt and Akkala Sami moreover share:
* Loss of final unstressed vowels.
* Merging of {{UPA|*ɔ̄}} with {{UPA|*ā}}.
* Development of stressed {{UPA|*i *u}} to /e o/ under certain conditions.

Peninsular East (Kola) Samic, consisting of [[Kildin Sami]] and [[Ter Sami]], share:{{sfn|Sammallahti|1998|p=26}}
* Loss of {{UPA|*t}} after a consonant between unstressed syllables.

Reflexes in parentheses are retentions found in certain subdialects. In particular, in the coastal dialects of [[North Sami]] (known as Sea Sami), several archaisms have been attested, including a lack of pre-stopping of geminate nasals, a lack of {{UPA|*ś}}-vocalization, and a reflex /e/ of {{UPA|*ë}} in certain positions. These likely indicate an earlier Eastern Samic [[substratum]].&lt;!--so why DOES it qualify as West Samic then?--&gt;

====Umlaut====

In the history of Proto-Samic, some sound changes were triggered or prevented by the nature of the vowel in the next syllable. Such changes continued to occur in the modern Sami languages, but differently in each. Due to the similarity with [[Germanic umlaut]], these phenomena are termed "umlaut" as well.

The following gives a comparative overview of each possible Proto-Samic vowel in the first syllable, with the outcomes that are found in each language for each second-syllable vowel.

* In Ume Sami, ''eä'' appears before a quantity 3 consonant, ''iä'' before a quantity 1 or 2 consonant. Some dialects have a pattern more like Pite Sami, with ''ua'' or ''uä'' before a quantity 3 consonant, and ''uo'' or ''uö'' before a quantity 1 or 2 consonant.
* In Pite Sami, ''ä'' and ''ua'' or ''uä'' appear before a quantity 3 consonant, ''ie'' and ''uo'' before a quantity 1 or 2 consonant.
* In Lule Sami, original ''*ie'' does not undergo umlaut by regular sound change, but almost all ''e''-stems have acquired umlaut by analogy with original ''*ea'', as the two vowels fall together before original ''*ē''.

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, the common verbal response to another person's [[sneeze]] is "[[bless you]]", or, less commonly in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], "Gesundheit", the [[German language|German]] word for health (and the response to sneezing in German-speaking countries).  There are several proposed [[Bless you#Origins and legends|bless-you origins]] for use in the context of sneezing.

In non-English-speaking cultures, words referencing good [[health]] or a long [[life]] are often used instead of "bless you," though some also use references to God.

In some Asian cultures such as Korean and Japanese cultures, the practice of responding to another person's sneeze does not exist.

[[Rock music]] played a role in [[Subversion|subverting]] the [[political system|political order]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state|satellites]]. The attraction of the unique form of music served to undermine Soviet authority by humanizing the West, helped [[political alienation|alienate]] a generation from the political system, and sparked a youth revolution. This contribution was achieved not only through the use of words or images, but through the structure of the music itself. Furthermore, the music was spread as part of a broad [[public diplomacy]] effort, commercial ventures, and through the efforts of the populace in the [[Eastern Bloc]].

==History and background==

===1950s===
[[File:Stilyagi group.jpg|thumb|left|A group of actors dressed as stilyagi]]
The [[stilyaga|stilyagi]], the first youth [[counterculture]] movement in the Soviet Union, emerged in the 1950s.  The stilyagi, meaning stylish in Russian, listened to the music and copied the western fashion trends.  Unlike later youth movements, the regime made no attempt to infiltrate and channel the movement toward their own ends, opting instead for public oppression. The stilyagi virtually disappeared by the early 1960s because many restrictions on the flow of information were relaxed, showing that the styles the stilyagi drew inspiration from were outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Troitsky | first1 = Artemy | title = Back in the USSR: The True Story of Rock in Russia | year = 1987 | pages = 13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ryback | first1 = Timothy | title = Rock Around the Bloc: A History of Rock Music in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, 1954-1988 | year = 1990 | pages = 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students]] took place in Moscow in 1957, permitting [[jazz]] and western forms of dance for one of the first times in the Soviet Union.  Although there was some hope that this was an indication of relaxation of restrictions, by the end of the 1950s, [[Eastern Bloc]] countries began arresting stilyagi and rock fans.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, partially in response to these events, NATO published a report speculating on the intentional use of rock music for subversive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
[[The Beatles]] sparked the love of rock in the Soviet youth and its popularity spread in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their impact on fashion was one of the more obvious external signs of their popularity.  "Collarless Beatles jackets, known as 'Bitlovka', were assembled from cast-offs; clumsy army boots were refashioned in Beatles style." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8232235.stm | title = How the Beatles rocked the Eastern Bloc | accessdate = 2012-04-03 | last = Woodhead | first = Leslie | date = 2009-09-04 | work = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to their influence in fashion, they also helped drive the expansion of music in the [[black market]].  Illicit music albums were created by recording copies onto discarded X-ray emulsion plates.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The music itself was acquired either by smuggling copies from the west, or recording it from western radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people= Leif, Mark (Director) | date=2010-09-01 | title=Rockin' the Wall | medium=Motion picture | location=USA | publisher=Rockin' the Wall Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter became easier and more common after United States president [[Lyndon Baines Johnson|Lydon Johnson]] made international broadcasting a priority in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippie]] culture emerged in the late 60s and early 70s.  Although very similar in terms of aesthetic to their western cousins, Soviet hippies were more passive.  The Soviet hippie movement did not develop the same radical social and political sensibilities as did the [[New Left]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 30–36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere in the eastern bloc, however, rockers and hippies were quite politically active and in the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968 numerous concerts were held in support of greater liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Цветы гастроли по стадионам.jpg|thumb|A typical 70s Soviet VIA, [[Tsvety]]]]
The major development for rock behind the [[Iron Curtain]] in the 1970s was original songs written in the authors' native language. Bands like [[Illés (band)|Illés]] in [[Hungary]], the [[Plastic People of the Universe]] in Czechoslovakia, and [[Mashina Vremeni|Time Machine]] in the Soviet Union adapted their native languages to rock. They managed to enjoy a steady following, unlike similar attempts by other bands in the 1960s, although they were mostly underground.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstream was dominated by [[VIA music|VIAs]] (vocal instrument ensembles) which were officially sanctioned rock and pop groups whose lyrics were vetted and whose music was considerably tamer than the underground groups.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[GDR|East German]] government even established a bureau for rock, indicating their desire to gain control of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Seventies were mainly a doldrums for Soviet rock fans, resistance to official policy would still erupt from time to time elsewhere in the bloc, particularly East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in places where rock's suppression did not produce violent reactions, like [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and the Soviet Union itself, the underground continued to flourish, creating a "second culture", which would have dramatic effects in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 142–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===

[[File:Kino1986leningrad.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soviet Post-punk band [[Kino (band)|Kino]]]]
In 1980, the [[Tbilisi Rock Festival]] was held.  The festival was significant because the bands that generated the most "buzz" were not official VIA groups but underground acts like [[Aquarium (band)|Aquarium]].&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 57-60.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the 80s progressed, more authentic and "street" oriented groups would gain popularity.  [[Mike Naumenko]] upset the status quo of even the underground with frank lyrics about life in the Soviet Union; he even addressed taboo subjects such as sex in songs like "Outskirts Blues" and "Ode to the Bathroom".&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 63–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  A result of this greater enthusiasm for a genuine native rock scene was a burgeoning home-made album movement.  Bands would simply make their own albums; many artists would record copies by using personal reel to reel machines.  The finished products were often complete with album art and liner notes, bringing a greater level of quality and sophistication to amateur recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-eighties, under pressure from the [[Composers' Union]] and out of concern for the negative effects of rock, the underground and rock music were effectively outlawed.  Clubs were closed, rock journalists were censored, popular underground bands were criticized in the press, and official bands were forced to play songs written by the Composers' Union.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 95-101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc, [[Punk rock|punk]] was beginning to take hold due to dissatisfaction with political and economic situation for the youth in Czechoslovakia and East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 199-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, with the election of [[Gorbachev]] and the inauguration of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]], official attitudes toward rock music became much more permissive.  At the 12th International Festival of Youth and Students, foreign bands were allowed to play.  They ranged from English rock bands, to Finnish punks, to a reggae group that ritually smoked ganja in red square.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;  All these changes inspired the new slang word of the day tusovka - "meaning something's happening, some kind of mess, some activity."&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Rock Lab Festival took place in 1986, the tusovka spirit was on display with [[Zvuki Mu]] front man Peter Mamonov singing lyrics like:

{{quote|text=I'm dirty, I'm exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;My neck's so thin.&lt;br/&gt;Your hand won't tremble&lt;br/&gt;When you wring it off.&lt;br/&gt;I'm so bad and nasty.&lt;br/&gt;I'm worse than you are.&lt;br/&gt;I'm the most unwanted.&lt;br/&gt;I'm trash, I'm pure dirt.&lt;br/&gt;BUT I CAN FLY!&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the [[Chernobyl disaster]], a benefit concert was organized.  When government bureaucrats attempted to enforce compliance with a series of regulations and paperwork, the artists and planners simply ignored their requests.  There was no official reprimand, confiscation of instruments, or violence from the police in response, something unthinkable even a few years prior.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;  More signs of dissent occurred; at a festival in Petersburg shortly after, the band Televisor stirred the crowd with a song entitled 'Get Out Of Control':

{{quote|text= We were watched form the days of kindergarten&lt;br/&gt;Some nice men and kind women&lt;br/&gt;Beat us up.  They chose the most painful places&lt;br/&gt;And treated us like animals on the farm.&lt;br/&gt;So we grew up like a disciplined herd.&lt;br/&gt;We sing what they want and live how they want.&lt;br/&gt;And we look at them downside up as if we're trapped.&lt;br/&gt;We just watch how they hit us.&lt;br/&gt;Get out of control.&lt;br/&gt;Get out of control.&lt;br/&gt;And sing what you want.&lt;br/&gt;And not just what is allowed.&lt;br/&gt;We have a right to yell.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Collapse of the Berlin Wall===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0719-38, Bruce Springsteen, Konzert in der DDR.jpg|thumb|upright|Bruce Springsteen in concert, East Germany]]
All over the Eastern Bloc, resistance to rock was being worn down.  In 1987, [[David Bowie]], [[Genesis_(band)|Genesis]], and the [[Eurythmics]] played in [[West Berlin]].  [[Radio in the American Sector]] announced the lineup and time well before hand and the concert planners pointed the speakers over [[Berlin wall|the wall]] so that [[East Berlin]]ers would be ready and could enjoy the concert.  When East German security forces tried to disband the crowd of fans assembled by the wall, the fans promptly rioted, chanting "tear down the wall!"  In 1988, a similar situation erupted when [[Michael Jackson]] performed in West Berlin, and the security forces, while trying to disperse the fans, even attacked western camera crews that were filming the scene.  In an attempt to improve their image, the East German government invited [[Bruce Springsteen]] to play in July.  No more violence erupted, but the crowd enthusiastically sang to "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the USA]]", while clutching small hand-painted American flags; something which the official press neglected to mention.  Additionally, Springsteen said: "I am not for or against any government.  I have come here to play rock and roll for you East Berliners in the hope that one day all barriers can be torn down", showing both his understanding of the restrictions East Germans faced and avoiding the impression that he was playing in support of the East German government.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 208-210.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few months after that concert, [[Erich Honecker]], the leader of East Germany, resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: East Germany leader ousted|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/18/newsid_2450000/2450783.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Berlin Wall itself [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|collapsed]] before the year ended.

==Rock's social and political effects==

===Soviet inflexibility===

Thomas Nichols, in "Winning the World," holds that the ideological pronouncements of the Soviet State required that virtually all actions be seen in terms of political import.  For example, [[KGB]] documents show that the intelligence agency interpreted [[vigil]]s for [[John Lennon]] in 1980 as protests against the regime.  The song [[In the Navy]] by the [[Village People]] was even described by the Soviet press as supporting [[militarism]], an inaccurate claim seeing as the lyrics are a series of thinly veiled references to homosexual behavior.  This extreme rigidity in ideology made the Soviet system especially weak in terms of adapting to social changes, and very open to human rights critiques and ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Nichols | first1 = Thomas | title = Winning the World: Lessons for America's Future from the Cold War | publisher = Praeger | year = 2002 | pages = 39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viral spread===

[[Artemy Troitsky]] contends that rock music inspired the same sort of youth revolution that occurred in the west, but the Soviet system could not adapt to the resulting social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his book on the Soviet rock movement, Back in the USSR, he describes rock as a virus invading a host body.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also gives accounts of Soviet leadership and bureaucrats describing rock as a form of infection or a virus, supporting his [[Viral phenomenon|virus]] metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main route for "infection" from "alien influences," in his view, came from the problem of permeable borders.  The system could never effectively block out all outside influence, nor could it adapt to the ones that came through.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of the Beatles===

[[Leslie Woodhead]], in the 2009 documentary "How the Beatles Rocked the Kremlin," argues that rock music, and the Beatles in particular, alienated the youth against the leadership of the Soviet bloc governments.  Artemy Troistky, who appeared in the documentary, asserted that the Beatles' appeal reached religious heights.  Woodhead supported this assertion by showcasing fan testimony about the Beatles' ubiquitous popularity and the extent to which it still permeates Russian popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= Woodhead, Leslie |date= 2009-11-08 |title= How the Beatles Rocked the Kremlin |url= http://www.thirteen.org/beatles/ |medium= Television production |publisher= [[WNET|WNET.org]] |location= New York, NY |accessdate= 2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western radio===

The debate over the role of rock in the US public diplomacy effort began almost as soon as it became popular, and lasted through the Reagan administration.&lt;ref&gt;Rockin the Wall.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Rock music was blasted to through the Iron Curtain through government-subsidized Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, and we interviewed the legal counsel for [[VOA]] who described the debates inside the Reagan administration about the appropriateness of sending "degenerate" rock music eastward.  But even the advisory boards came to understand that it was the structure of rock, as much as the lyrics, that counted." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hnn.us/articles/133951.html | title = Power Chords of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-60s President Johnson expressed his desire to build cultural and economic bridges with the Soviet Union.  This drove intensified radio broadcasts by the [[VOA]], [[BBC]], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE]], and [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] into the Iron Curtain, especially musical programming.  All of this was viewed by the Soviets as an overt political [[subversion]] campaign.  Nevertheless, the Soviet-bloc responded by increasing domestic broadcasts of pop and rock, or big beat as they called it.  The results of this saturation of the airwaves with popular music was revealed in a 1966 RFE study of requests from behind the Iron Curtain.  The study showed that the taste in music among teenagers from the east and west were largely identical.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although American funding and support for such broadcasting varied, their broadcasting remained popular. KGB memos asserted that, at one point, 80% of Soviet youth listed to western broadcasts. In addition to the basic popularity of western broadcasts and whatever role that played in undermining the Soviets politically, by the mid 1980's the Soviets were spending more than three billion dollars to [[radio jamming|jam]] or block RFE and Radio Liberty broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Václav Havel attributed this continuous appeal to the inherent rebelliousness of rock music, at least at the time.

===The underground and the black market===
[[File:Rock on Bones2.jpg|thumb|"Rock on the bones"]]
[[Magnitizdat]] were DIY recordings that were the audio counterpart to the written Samizdat.  Many of the early DIY recordings were made from plastic [[X-ray| X-ray plates]] &lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8232235.stm | title = How the Beatles rocked the Eastern Bloc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rock fans and [[black marketeers]] would smuggle [[gramophone record|records]] in from the west and would steal discarded X-Ray emulsion plates from dumpsters and garbage cans at hospitals.  They would then bring their X-Ray plates and records into small recording studios, which were designed so that Soviet soldiers could record audio messages for family back home.  Because the X-ray plates were flexible, they could be rolled and hidden in a sleeve which aided in the concealment and transport of the record.&lt;ref&gt;How the Beatles rocked the Kremlin&lt;/ref&gt;  The recordings would still bear images of human skeletons, so they were referred to as "bones," "ribs," or ''[[flexi disc|roentgenizdat]]''.  This practice began in the 50s, but proliferated in the 60s especially as [[Beatlemania]] spread.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

It didn't take long before Soviet youth wanted to form bands to emulate the [[Fab Four]], but the lack of instruments was a serious impediment to the formation of rock bands. Soviet youths had to improvise.  They did so by creating their own guitars by sawing old tables into the shape of a guitar. Creating [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]]s and [[amplifier|amps]] was a problem until an inspired young electrical engineer discovered that they could be created from [[handset|phone receivers]] and [[loudspeakers]], respectively. The only readily available sources for these items were public telephone booths and speakers used for propaganda broadcasts, so young rockers would vandalize both for parts.&lt;ref&gt;How The Beatles Rocked the Kremlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early to mid sixties, the subculture was mostly ignored by the authorities.  That is not to stay that fans could display their love for rock openly, but it wasn't actively persecuted until later.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these new bands would imitate the [[Beatles]] as best they could with their improvised instruments, and even clothing fashioned after Beatles stage costumes.&lt;ref&gt;How the Beatles Rocked the Kremlin&lt;/ref&gt;  They would play anywhere they could; cafes, front stoops, basements, dormitories; anywhere they could convince someone to let them.&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How the Beatles Rocked the Kremlin.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the bands became more sophisticated and popular, rock scenes began to develop.  How the authorities would react depended greatly upon the area and the time period.  From the late 60s on, long haired men often would have their offending manes cut and bands would be denied official status, financial support, press coverage, and permission to play in bigger venues. In their place VIA's (the Russian acronym for vocal/instrumental ensemble), officially sanctioned bands were established to play state approved music and lyrics with less "teeth." VIA's would avoid controversial topics in their lyrics, musical styles, or anything deemed "degenerate".&lt;ref&gt;Troitsky, p. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth revolution and political disobedience===

Despite the attempts to stifle the native rock movement, the [[underground music|underground]] survived and managed to create a different culture that many would flee to.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, p. 142-148.&lt;/ref&gt;   Identification with this [[subculture]] would make one less susceptible to Soviet propaganda and ideology and less likely to view the West as a threat.  "The kids lost their interest in all Soviet unshakeable dogmas and ideals, and stopped thinking of an English-speaking person as an enemy.  That's when the Communists lost two generations of young people. That was an incredible impact." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1028603.stm | title = Beatles 'brought down Communism | accessdate = 2012-04-03 | date = 2000-11-17 | work = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even if the individual did not enjoy rock for political reasons, because the political system was opposed to it, merely listening to music was an act of disobedience.  By extension, active participation in the underground made one an active agent against the regime, as far as the leadership was concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8232235.stm | title = How the Beatles rocked the Eastern Bloc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the more dedicated songwriters would go to great lengths to conceal their dissent, which was described in ''Rockin' the Wall'': "The trick was, [ [[Leslie Mandoki]] ] noted in the film, to write a "rat tail."  The rat tail was a song that ostensibly was about Ronald Reagan or the United States or capitalism—and would therefore clear censors—but which was obvious to all the kids to be a criticism of the Soviet system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hnn.us/articles/133951.html | title = Power Chords of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability of the Communist regimes to eradicate, replace, or assimilate the influence of rock music probably did much to ensure that the populace would turn against the [[totalitarian]] system.&lt;ref&gt;How The Beatles Rocked the Kremlin&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Satan's Slave''''' (also known as '''''Evil Heritage''''') is a 1976 British [[Independent film|independent]] [[supernatural horror film]] written by [[David McGillivray (screenwriter)|David McGillivray]] and directed by [[Norman J. Warren]]. It stars [[Candace Glendenning]] as a young woman who, after surviving a car accident in which her parents are seemingly killed, is taken in by her uncle and cousin ([[Michael Gough]] and [[Martin Potter (actor)|Martin Potter]]), unaware that they are both [[necromancer]]s who intend to sacrifice her to resurrect the spirit of a supernaturally-gifted ancestor.

The film, a production of Warren's newly-formed company Monumental Pictures, was funded by producers Les Young and Richard Crafter with their own money and shot almost entirely on location in [[Pirbright]], Surrey and [[Shepherd's Bush]], London in late 1975. The following year, re-shoots were undertaken to film additional material and more violent, alternative versions of existing scenes with the aim of increasing the film's appeal to audiences in the [[Far East]].

In the UK, ''Satan's Slave'' was originally released as a [[B movie]]. Critical reception of the film has been mixed, with aspects such as the acting, script and plot attracting a range of responses.

==Plot==
Catherine Yorke, a young woman from London, receives a bracelet from her boyfriend, John, for her upcoming birthday. She then leaves the city with her parents, Malcolm and Elizabeth, to join her father's brother, Alexander, for a week at his home in the country. At the turn into Alexander's estate, Malcolm suddenly falls ill at the wheel of the family car and crashes it into a tree. Although the vehicle is only lightly damaged, when Catherine steps outside it mysteriously explodes, seemingly killing her parents.

Alexander, assisted by his son Stephen and secretary Frances, takes the distraught Catherine into the house and gives her a sedative. On waking, Catherine finds that the driveway has been cleared of wreckage and is told that the police have concluded their investigation into her parents' deaths. The funeral is conducted later that day in the grounds of the estate. After the ceremony, Catherine finds an old gravestone inscribed with the name of Camilla Yorke, a young woman said to have died at the age of 20 – the age that Catherine will soon reach.

Over the next few days, as she continues to be hosted by Alexander, Catherine experiences disturbing visions of women being branded, flogged and sacrificed in Satanic rituals. She finds herself drawn to Stephen, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Meanwhile, with the aid of the bracelet that he has stolen from Catherine, Alexander uses [[dark magic]] to compel John to kill himself by jumping from the roof of a tower block.

Frances tells Catherine that Camilla, an ancestor of the Yorke family, possessed supernatural abilities. Now Alexander, a believer in [[necromancy]], intends to resurrect Camilla's spirit to increase his own power. Having murdered several women, including his own wife, to test his theories, he has determined that this can be achieved only through the sacrifice of Catherine, Camilla's direct descendant, when she turns 20 – Camilla's age at the time of her death. Frances also warns Catherine not to trust Stephen: having witnessed his mother's sacrifice as a young boy he has grown up to become a murderer like his father.

When he discovers Frances' betrayal, Stephen stabs her to death and locks Catherine in her bedroom. On the morning of her birthday, Catherine is led into the nearby woods to be sacrificed by Alexander and his [[cult]] but escapes after running a nail file through Stephen's eye. At the entrance to the estate she runs into her father, who claims that both he and her mother survived the car accident. She is taken back to the house, where Alexander, no longer wearing his ritual robes, claims that her recent experiences were merely hallucinations brought on by the sedative. However, his deception is uncovered when Catherine pulls back a curtain to find Stephen's corpse. Alexander praises Catherine's brutality and hails her as a true descendant of Camilla. It is then revealed that Catherine's father, not her uncle, is the head of the cult.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2009"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Locks, Adam |title=Satan Chic: An Interview with Cult British Horror Director Norman J.

==Themes==
Critic Adam Locks notes that ''Satan's Slave'' features plot devices typical of horror films of the 1970s, such as settings that represent "nowhere places" in which characters become lost. He argues that the Yorkes' car journey has an effect similar to time travel, writing that it serves as a "re-programming for the audience with memories and associations disconnected from the modern and the urban ... In psychogeographical terms of the relationship between the individual and space, there is the clichéd yet interesting idea of the road leading to nowhere."&lt;ref name="Locks, 2010"/&gt;

Locks also compares ''Satan's Slave'', along with other Warren films, to the 1960s TV series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' for the way in which it conveys an "underlying disquiet" about its setting: "Behind the façade of mundane England, threatening figures or forces – be they crooks in ''The Avengers'' or [[Satanist]]s in ''Satan's Slave'' ... – plan to disrupt the everyday world."  He writes that through this sense of unease "the familiarity of '[[Englishness]]' is transformed and warped."&lt;ref name="Locks, 2010"/&gt;

Leon Hunt, author of ''British Low Culture: from Safari Suits to Sexploitation'', regards the conclusion to ''Satan's Slave'' as representative of a trend towards "downbeat" endings in "generation-gap" British horror films during the 1970s, contrasting this with the "angry", "anti-authoritarian" style of [[Michael Reeves]]' films of the 1960s. He observes that ''Satan's Slave'' ends with Catherine trapped by members of her own family and about to be "consumed", commenting: "The battle is over and 'youth' has lost."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=British Low Culture: from Safari Suits to Sexploitation |author=Hunt, Leon |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London, UK/New York City, New York |year=1998 |isbn=9781136189432 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locks describes Alexander as an "atavistic amalgamation of various icons of British gentlemen" – among them the "[[chivalrous]] knight", whose moral code he inverts through the planned sacrifice of his niece and the actual sacrifice of his wife.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2010"/&gt; Warren believes that both the character and his house are influenced by the style of contemporary [[Hammer horror]] films.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bayley"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Norman J.

==Production==
After making ''[[Her Private Hell]]'' (1968) and ''[[Loving Feeling]]'' (1969), [[Norman J. Warren]] had been in negotiations to direct films for [[Amicus Productions]] and [[American International Pictures]].&lt;ref name="UnsworthInterview"&gt;{{Cite web |title=An Evil Heritage – Norman J. Warren talks ''Satan's Slave'' |url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/feature-articles/16295-satans-slave-feature |author=Unsworth, Martin |date=14 November 2016 |work=[[Starburst (magazine)|starburstmagazine.com]] |publisher=Starburst Magazine Ltd |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115220242/http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/feature-articles/16295-satans-slave-feature |archivedate=15 January 2017 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these deals fell through, Warren and Les Young, who had served as [[camera operator]] on the earlier films, agreed to make a film of their own.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2009"/&gt;

''Satan's Slave'' is Warren's horror debut as well as the first release of Monumental Pictures, an independent film production company that Warren formed with Young, Young's wife Moira and another camera operator, Richard Crafter.&lt;ref name="AYNiB"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=Wyatt, David |title=All You Need is Blood – The Making of Satan's Slave |medium=DVD documentary |publisher=Monumental Pictures |id=ODNF389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSMSS"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=[[Norman J.

Ultimately Crafter and Les Young funded the production with their own money: the former by selling his shares in the retailer [[Mothercare]], the latter by selling his car and mortgaging his home and film equipment rental company, Crystal Film Productions.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AYNiB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title="Satan's Slave" DVD liner notes |author=Warren, Norman J. |publisher=Odeon Entertainment/Euro London |id=ODNF389 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As labour union rules prohibited him from officially performing more than one role in the production, Warren was credited only as director.&lt;ref name="UnsworthInterview"/&gt; He gives the total budget as either £30,000 or £35,000, about half of which took the form of [[Deferral|deferred]] payments.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=Warren, Norman J.; [[David McGillivray (screenwriter)|McGillivray, David]] |year=2013 |title="Satan's Slave" DVD audio commentary |publisher=Odeon Entertainment/Euro London |id=ODNF389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=Perry, Darren (producer/director); McCarthy, Paul (presenter) |year=1999 |title=Evil Heritage: Independent Film-Making and the Films of Norman J. Warren |medium=DVD documentary |publisher=Stonevision Entertainment |id=SVD 5001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was devised by Warren and the Youngs and expanded by screenwriter [[David McGillivray (screenwriter)|David McGillivray]], whom Warren had first met while editing ''Her Private Hell''.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2009"/&gt; McGillivray completed the script in nine days.&lt;ref name="AYNiB"/&gt; Warren did not want the script to end with a revelation that the events of the film had been a nightmare as he considered [[dream sequence]]s to be clichéd.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; Though reluctant to edit the film, believing that this would result in a creative conflict of interest with his directorial responsibilities, Warren ultimately accepted the dual role as he "so much wanted this film to happen".&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt;

===Casting===
Warren says that [[Candace Glendenning]], whom he had seen in films such as ''[[Tower of Evil]]'' (1972), was "always [his] first choice" to play Catherine.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt; Due to the character's complexity, the role of Stephen was harder to cast.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt; [[Martin Potter (actor)|Martin Potter]], who had recently played the title role in the TV serial ''[[The Legend of Robin Hood]]'', was hired after first choice actor [[Michael Gothard]] withdrew at a late stage of [[pre-production]].&lt;ref name="UnsworthInterview"/&gt; Potter researched psychopathic behaviour to better understand his part.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt;

Although the production could not afford to pay [[Michael Gough]]'s usual fee, the actor accepted the role of Uncle Alexander after reading McGillivray's script and hearing Warren's personal vision for the film.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt; His participation was conditional on the crew scheduling the filming around his theatre commitments.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt; Gough was paid £300 ({{Inflation|UK|300|1975|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) for his appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Report: London Film Memorabilia Convention – Celebrating Films of the 1960s and 1970s |url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/7760-REPORT-London-Film-Memorabilia-Convention-Hammer-Horror-Film-Day.html |author=Smith, Adrian |date=9 November 2013 |work=[[Cinema Retro|cinemaretro.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704201449/http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?%2Farchives%2F7760-REPORT-London-Film-Memorabilia-Convention-Hammer-Horror-Film-Day.html |archivedate=4 July 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Bree (actor)|James Bree]] and Celia Hewitt were cast through [[Spotlight (company)|Spotlight]]. [[Michael Craze]] had worked with Warren before, having appeared in his short film ''Fragment'' (1965).&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt;

===Filming===
The film was largely shot in and around the country house of the Baron and Baroness DeVeuce in Pirbright, Surrey over three weeks in December 1975.&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; The house had previously appeared in [[Tigon Film Distributors Ltd.|Tigon]]'s ''[[Virgin Witch]]'' (1971) and would also be used as a shooting location for Warren's later film, ''[[Terror (1978 film)|Terror]]'' (1978). Warren remembers the challenges that the production was facing due to the low budget and how [[production designer]] Hayden Pearce found the DeVeuce house: "Most places were not suitable or the people were not interested. And because we didn't have any money, we needed a house that also had furniture in it. Hayden was ringing everyone he knew in connection to art departments and someone suggested the mock-Tudor house in Pirbright, and we couldn't believe our luck. Not only did it look great outside but everything in there was genuine - there were wall-to-wall paintings and it was fully dressed."&lt;ref name="UnsworthInterview"/&gt; The estate surrounding the property contained an [[electrical substation]] that the crew were allowed to use as a power source, eliminating the need for generators.&lt;ref name="UnsworthInterview"/&gt; A nearby cottage served as the location for the Yorkes' London home.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt;

Due to budget limitations both Gough and Potter supplied their own wardrobe.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; Gough, who could not be provided with hotel accommodation, stayed with a friend in Barnes, London throughout the filming.&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; Warren remembers: "We would pick him up each day at around 5.45 a.m. ... He would work with us all day, often until midnight, and then we would drive him back to his friend's house, stopping on the way to buy fish and chips." He adds that "even with the incredibly long hours we worked each day, [Gough] never had a word of complaint."&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; Various members of the crew, including the producers, appear in the film as hooded cultists.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; Moira Young took over the role of the woman who is sacrificed in the opening scene when the actress who had been cast failed to attend on the night of filming.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt;

While filming on a hill near an Army base, the production found itself surrounded by soldiers conducting a training exercise.&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; Due to the noise from the base's [[shooting range]], the production schedule was revised to avoid filming outdoors on the days when it was in use.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; For the scene in which the Yorkes' car explodes, the crew were given permission to film on the base; the Army then used the wreckage for target practice before disposing of it.&lt;ref name="UnsworthInterview"/&gt;

Scenes set inside John's flat were filmed at the home of one of the crew.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; The character's suicide was shot at a block of flats in [[Shepherd's Bush]], with producer Les Young serving as the [[stunt double]] for Michael Craze.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; To create a first-person "falling" effect, a camera was tied to a [[bungee cord]] and then dropped from the roof of the 23-storey building.&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; The car crash stunt was also performed by Young.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; 

===Post-production===
[[Principal photography]] was completed shortly before Christmas 1975.&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; Warren then edited the film at home.&lt;ref name="Locks, 2009"/&gt; While preparing the first cut, Warren and his colleagues decided that the film contained an overabundance of dialogue and shortened or removed certain scenes that they considered redundant. These included a [[dream sequence]] involving Catherine and a scene set after the funeral in which the Yorkes bond over tea and Alexander and Stephen learn of the existence of Catherine's boyfriend.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt; According to Warren, "the main problem with [''Satan's Slave''] was that the plot was very complicated, and actually rather boring. So we just cut out complete scenes where people were explaining things. And a lot of the film doesn't make sense because of those cuts. But it was less complicated, and no one ever questioned the plot."&lt;ref name="Bayley"/&gt;

To boost distribution prospects in the Far East, it was also decided to re-edit the film to include larger amounts of gore and nudity.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; This involved shooting a more explicit version of an early scene in the film, in which Stephen attempts to rape and then murders a young woman, Janice (played by Gloria Walker). Warren considers this version, in which Stephen ties his victim to a bed and threatens to cut off her nipples with scissors, "very unpleasant" and expresses his preference for the original.&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; Additional scenes written by Warren and filmed during the [[re-shoot]]s include Catherine's vision of a [[Puritan]] priest (played by McGillivray) overseeing the torture of a young woman, which was filmed in the grounds of a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt; McGillivray also has a speaking role in the film as the priest who conducts the funeral of Catherine's parents. Various [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] shots were also filmed by Crystal Film Productions.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt;

The score, composed by [[John Scott (composer)|John Scott]], was recorded in a single session with seven instrumentalists – the largest ensemble that the budget would allow.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=Warren, Norman J.

The film's title was changed from ''Evil Heritage'' to ''Satan's Slave'' during [[post-production]] after distributors [[Brent Walker]] suggested that the latter was "more commercial".&lt;ref name="DVDNotes"/&gt; 

==Release and reception==
''Satan's Slave'' was released in December 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/satans_slave_evil_heritage |title=''Satan's Slave'' (''Evil Heritage'') (1976) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127165036/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/satans_slave_evil_heritage |archivedate=27 November 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, it was distributed as the B movie in a double feature with ''Thriller'', an [[American International Pictures]] release.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt; It was also paired with ''[[Ruby (1977 film)|Ruby]]''.&lt;ref name="CSMSS"/&gt; ''Satan's Slave'' was commercially successful and was re-released five times during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; Its box office revenue was used to fund Warren's subsequent film, ''Terror''.&lt;ref name="Bayley"/&gt;

===Critical response===
In a contemporary review for ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', Michael Grossbard described ''Satan's Slave'' as "basically an archaic [[second feature]]" that "looks ...  like the sort of subject likely to turn up on Sunday afternoon children's television, with its kids-in-trouble/blame-the-older-generation theme." He considered the plot "well constructed and written" and the performances "never below standard, though it would be nice to see Michael Gough in more demanding parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |magazine=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |title=''Satan's Slave'' |date=January 1977 |last=Grossbard |first=Michael |editor1-last=Combs |editor1-first=Richard |publisher=British Film Institute |location=London, UK |page=10 |volume=44 |issue=516 |oclc=2594020 |issn=0027-0407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Satan's Slave'' continues to divide critical opinion. ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine calls the film a "vile shocker ... full of unappetising gore effects".&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' considers it an "absolute stinker", criticising its dialogue and "dragged-out" theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=''Satan's Slave'', directed by Norman J.

Jo Botting of the [[British Film Institute]] website [[Screenonline]] opines that while the plot is "slightly old hat", the film's closing [[plot twist]]s make for a "satisfying" ending. She argues that ''Satan's Slave'' "brought a new realism to horror, with its settings in high-rise urban blocks and with suburban ordinariness hiding Satanic rituals."&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; [[Dennis Schwartz]] of the [[Online Film Critics Society]] rates ''Satan's Slave'' "C+", remarking that the film is "directed with high production values but with little else that rocks". He considers the film overall to be "clichéd", the script "weak", the dialogue "abominable" and the final plot twist unsurprising as it was "given away in the opening act".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=''Satan's Slave'' (''Evil Heritage''): A Nutty Stab at Devil Worship in GB |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/satansslave.html |author=[[Dennis Schwartz|Schwartz, Dennis]] |date=3 May 2015 |work=homepages.sover.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918212024/http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/satansslave.html |archivedate=18 September 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the film for the website [[DVD Talk]] in 2004, Bill Gibron described Gough's character as a "grey Sunday drag of a villain" and ''Satan's Slave'' in general as a "near-immobile mess", adding: "With an ending that repeats, laps and then doubles back on itself, and an overall atmosphere of dismal dissatisfaction, the only suggestive thing about this movie is its titillating title."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Horrible Horrors Vol 1 |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13029/horrible-horrors-vol-1/ |author=Gibron, Bill |date=31 October 2004 |work=[[DVD Talk]] |publisher=[[Internet Brands]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127023746/https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13029/horrible-horrors-vol-1/ |archivedate=27 November 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another review published in 2012, he gave the film three out of five stars, judging the script "silly" and the atmosphere "often wasted" but praising the performances of Gough and Candace Glendenning. He commented: "... if you can get past the endless conversations, [the] lack of real suspense, the flawed feeling of familiarity and the dearth of any or all plot twists toward the end ... then – by all means – saddle up and strap in".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/53999/satans-slave/ |title=''Satan's Slave'': Katarina's Nightmare Theater|author=Gibron, Bill |date=12 May 2012 |work=DVD Talk |publisher=Internet Brands |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928213434/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/53999/satans-slave/ |archivedate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Jane, also of DVD Talk, suggests that ''Satan's Slave'' is "plagued by some rather obvious pacing problems" and is less atmospheric and suspenseful than Hammer horror; however, he believes that the film "has its moments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38750/gorehouse-greats-collection-the/ |title=The Gorehouse Greats Collection|author=Jane, Ian |date=25 August 2009 |work=DVD Talk |publisher=Internet Brands |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130110401/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38750/gorehouse-greats-collection-the/ |archivedate=30 November 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AllMovie]] considers the film a "standard effort".&lt;ref name="AllMovie"/&gt; Awarding two stars out of five, Fred Beldin comments that ''Satan's Slave'' "delivers extra gore and skin to keep the attention from wandering off a well-trodden road ... There's no mystery for the viewer, because director Warren isn't shy about introducing the male lead with a scene in which he rapes and murders a flirty blonde." He argues that the film is "more watchable" than Warren's later horror films, concluding that ''Satan's Slave'' provides a "generous allowance of uncomfortable moments for those seeking sick thrills".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=''Satan's Slave'' (1976) – Norman J.

Octavio Ramos of [[AXS (company)|axs.com]] criticises the film's "wooden" acting and argues that the story and [[characterisation]] "lack dynamic punch". Ramos also believes the film to be [[misogynistic]], "given that the bulk of the more graphic attacks are aimed at women." On the other hand, he commends the script's ideas as well as the presentation of certain scenes, such as the build-up to John's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Movie Review: ''Satan's Slave'' |url=http://www.axs.com/uk/movie-review-satan-s-slave-98609 |author=Ramos, Octavio |date=20 May 2013 |work=[[AXS (company)|axs.com]] |publisher=[[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930184246/http://www.axs.com/uk/movie-review-satan-s-slave-98609 |archivedate=30 September 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate review of the film's soundtrack, Unsworth gives a rating of nine out of ten, describing John Scott's score as "a stunning piece of work, melding some erratic styles perfectly and creating a genuine atmosphere of dread with each listen".&lt;ref name="UnsworthReview"/&gt;

The '''Singapore Tourism Board''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''STB'''; [[Malay Language|Malay]]: ''Lembaga Pelancongan Singapura''; {{zh|c=新加坡旅游局}}) is a [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory board]] under the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]] of [[Singapore]], tasked to promote the country's [[tourism]] industry.

==History==
[[Image:Tourism Court.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tourism Court at Orchard Spring Lane, the headquarters of Singapore Tourism Board]]
[[Image:Stborchard-ext.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Singapore Visitors Centre along [[Orchard Road]], providing tourism information for tourists in Singapore.]]

The board was first established in 1964 and was called the '''Singapore Tourist Promotion Board''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''STPB'''; {{zh|c=新加坡旅游促进局}}). In that year, there were 91,000 visitors. The primary task of STPB was to coordinate the efforts of hotels, airlines and travel agents to develop the fledgling tourism industry of the country.

Later, STPB began to initiate new marketing ideas to promote Singapore's image abroad. The board created the [[Merlion]], a symbol based on a Singapore mythical legend, that became an icon of the Singapore destination. The board has also been providing travel agent licensing and tourist guide training.

STPB actively promoted the development of infrastructure, including the building of hotels and tourist attractions such as the [[Jurong Bird Park]] and [[Sentosa]] which is now a popular resort island for both tourists and local visitors. The board also markets the city as a convention venue and organises events to attract visitors.

In the 1980s, several historic and culturally significant areas such as [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] and [[Kampong Glam]] were earmarked for preservation. These places express Singapore's cultural diversity and became popular tourist destinations. The [[Singapore River]] underwent a major cleanup program and the areas along the river were developed for restaurants and other tourist amenities.

The board was renamed as Singapore Tourism Board in 1997.

==Mission==
[[File:Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park and its surrounds.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial Panorama of Merlion Park and its surrounds]]
The board now oversees all aspects of tourism, including resource allocation and long-term strategic planning. It establishes offices around the globe to actively market the Singapore destination.

In the short term, the Singapore government has allocated S$905 million to STB for tourism developments until 2017. A third of this amount will be used to assist the industry to build manpower competencies through education and skills-upgrading initiatives, particularly in key areas such as conference management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new breed of MICE|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/article/a-new-breed-of-mice/|publisher=TTGmice|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231340/http://www.ttgmice.com/article/a-new-breed-of-mice/|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
Singapore tourism industry has grown rapidly since STPB was set up. In 2004, there were 8 million visitors. On 11 January 2005, Minister for Trade and Industry unveiled the Singapore Tourism Board’s (STB) bold targets to doubling visitor arrivals to 17 million by 2015, see details here [https://web.archive.org/web/20091208053609/http://app.stb.gov.sg/asp/abo/abo08.asp Tourism 2015.]

In March 2010, the STB projected a 20-30% increase in visitor arrivals for the year. 2010 would see the much awaited opening of both the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa.&lt;ref&gt;Channel News Asia- STB forecasts 20-30% jump in visitor arrivals this year [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1041748/1/.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with other key events such as the FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. These offerings were expected to enhance Singapore’s status as a dynamic global city and increase visitor arrivals. The changes in Singapore's landscape would also continue beyond 2010. New developments such as the International Cruise Terminal, Gardens by the Bay and Changi Motor Sports Hub are expected to be unveiled in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;

==Branding==
On 24 August 2017, STB and Economic Development Board (EDB) unveiled a unified brand, Singapore – [[Passion Made Possible]], to market Singapore internationally for tourism and business purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stb.gov.sg/news-and-publications/lists/newsroom/dispform.aspx?ID=713|title=Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Economic Development Board launch Passion Made Possible Brand for Singapore|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new brand aims to provide the opportunity and platform for Singaporeans and residents to showcase their enterprising and persevering spirit to the world, and serve as a unifying brand for Singapore on the international front. The brand will be adopted by other statutory boards and agencies under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and incorporated into their marketing campaigns and tradeshows when reaching out to international audiences.

[[File:Tembetá en cerámica moche.jpg|thumb|[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] ceramic effigy vessel featuring a man with a tembetá. Museo de Historia natural de [[Valparaiso]], Chile]]
A '''tembetá''' ([[Guaraní language]]: ''tembé'': lip, ''Ita'': stone.) or '''barbote''' ([[Argentina]]) is a metal or stone rod placed in lower lip piercings by members of some [[indigenous peoples in South America]]. It has been used since the [[Neolithic]] period by different human groups for [[body modification]], spiritual protection, and indication of [[sexual maturity]].

== Pre-Columbian use ==
According to the first studies of Jorge Fernández, tembetás originated in [[Brazilian Highlands|Planalto]], [[Brazil]]. Their use expanded as far south as [[El Quisco]], [[Chile]], and they were adopted by indigenous groups such as the [[Guarani people|Guarani]], [[Tupi people|Tupi]], and [[Chiriguano]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041126161505/http://www.rionegro.com.ar/arch200201/s20j13.html "Los aritos eran gritos de guerra en las comunidades indígenas."] ''Sociedad Rio Negro.'' 20 Jan 2002. Retrieved 17 March 2012. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociological importance ==
The tembetá played a part in [[initiation]] ceremonies, signifying the entry of young men into adult life. After these ceremonies, the men could marry and acquire the responsibilities of an adult male.

== Corporal use and skill of placement ==
The tembetá is a male adornment in the lower lip. Several men and candidates would meet and drink [[chicha]], a fermented beverage made from maize, to dull the pain. A specialist would perforate the lip with a thick wooden needle. The tembetá would be inserted, and the person would wear it for the remainder of his life.

Participants would ask during the ceremony that the tembetá protect its owner from death. To this end, it was placed near the mouth, a potential entry of damaging forces. Indeed, it was a very important amulet, more than an adornment.

[[Molle culture]] used the adornment, made of rock, preferably of beautiful colors. It consists of a thin curved plate  molded to the gums. In the centre was a button, either cylindrical or sharply-pointed, that penetrated the lip 5 to 7&amp;nbsp;cm.

== Geographical distribution ==
The tembetá is a cultural feature of very wide distribution. It has been used by peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Americas and often it had, apart from it decorative value, a social meaning. Another variant was a pipe of stone, often [[talc]], in the shape of letter "T". These pipe-shaped tembetás could be used in rites to smoke herbs with [[hallucinogenic]] properties.

=== Guarani people ===
The tembetá, called "labrete",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museobarbero.org.py/visita_guiada.htm The Indigenous Manufacture Across Some Objects Of The Collections Of The Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221153903/http://www.museobarbero.org.py/visita_guiada.htm |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was used by the tribes of the [[Guarani people|Guarani]]. According to archaeological findings, the Guarani tembetá was made of [[quartz]] in the shape of a "T", 10&amp;nbsp;cm in length. The working of the quartz was done by a [[shaman]]. Quartz correlates to ''ita-verá'' (brilliant stone) of the mythical one ''Tupá Overasú'', and of the great one ''Tupá of the Storm''.

=== In Chile ===
The tembetá was used in several pre-Columbian cultures in Chile. The principal one was the Molle culture, which brought the tembetá from the Planalto of Brazil. Cultures derived from the Molle were the [[Diaguita]], [[Llolleo culture|Llolleo]], and [[Bato (culture)|Bato]].

In the Llolleo culture the tembetá was of cardinal importance, but among the [[Bato culture|Bato]], it was more on the level of a personal adornment, without any spiritual connotations.

== Social differentiation ==
The tembetá offers protection against the negative action of the "owners of the nature"; it is the ritual adornment of the "souls that travel towards the land of beyond".{{cn|date=March 2012}} Many neolithic tribes of the Amazon demonstrated a deep scorn for peoples that did not use the tembetá.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

"'''The Juniper Tree'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|collected]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/grimms/47junipertree.html The Juniper-Tree]", ''Household Tales''&lt;/ref&gt; In some English language editions the story is called '''The Almond Tree'''. The text in the Grimm collection is in [[Low German]] and was originally written down by the painter Philipp Otto Runge.

It was believed until the early 1870s that the Brothers Grimm re-adapted various oral recountings and [[fable]]s heard from local peasants and townspeople in order to write their well-known fairy tales.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joosen |first1=Vanessa |title=Back to Ölenberg: An Intertextual Dialogue between Fairy-Tale Retellings and the Sociohistorical Study of the Grimm Tales |journal=Marvels &amp; Tales |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=99–115 |year=2010 |url=https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/marvels/vol24/iss1/6 |jstor=41389029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, various critics including Vanessa Joosen argue that this assumption is false, based on an overwhelming amount of disputing evidence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Literary critic Walter Scherf, argued that the Grimm brothers were inspired by the painter [[Philipp Otto Runge]]'s original adaptation of ''The Juniper Tree,'' originally written as ''The Almond Tree''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/chl.0.0399 |title=Family Conflicts and Emancipation in Fairy Tales |journal=Children's Literature |volume=3 |pages=77–93 |year=1974 |last1=Scherf |first1=Walter }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grimms themselves wrote in the appendix to the 1812 first edition of the KHM that the text was supplied by Philipp Otto Runge.

The story contains themes of [[child abuse]], [[murder]], [[cannibalism]] and [[Christian symbolism|biblical symbolism]] and is one of the Brothers Grimm's darker and more mature fairy tales.

''The Juniper Tree'' is tale number 47 and [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 720: "my mother slew me, my father ate me".  Another such tale is the English ''[[The Rose-Tree]]'', although it reverses the sexes from ''The Juniper Tree''; ''The Juniper Tree'' follows the more common pattern of having the dead child be the boy.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 209 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A wealthy and pious couple pray every day for God to grant them a child. One winter, under the juniper tree in the courtyard, the wife peeled an apple. She cuts her finger and drops of blood fall onto the snow. This leads her to wish for a child to be as white as snow and as red as blood. Six months later, the wife becomes gravely ill from eating juniper berries and asks her husband to bury her beneath the juniper tree if she dies. A month later, she gives birth to a baby boy as white as snow and as red as blood. She dies of happiness. Keeping his promise, the husband buries her beneath the juniper tree. He eventually remarries a woman, with whom he has a daughter named Marlinchen (in some versions Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie).

The new wife loves Marlinchen but despises her stepson. She abuses him every day, claiming that she wishes Marlinchen to inherit her stepfather’s wealth instead of her stepson. One afternoon after school, the stepmother plans to lure her stepson into an empty room containing a chest of apples. Marlinchen sees the chest and asks for an apple, which the stepmother gracefully offers. However, when the boy enters the room and reaches down the chest for an apple, the stepmother slams the lid onto his neck, decapitating him. The stepmother bounds his head with the rest of his body with a bandage and props his body onto a chair ouitside, with an apple on his lap. Marlinchen, unaware of the situation, asks her stepbrother for an apple. Hearing no response, she is forced by her mother to box him in the ear, causing his head to roll onto the ground. Marlinchen profusely cries throughout the day whilst the stepmother dismembers the stepson’s body and cooks him into a "blood-soup" (Black Puddings Sauer/Suur) for dinner. She later deceives her husband by telling him that his son stayed at mothers great uncle’s house. The husband unwittingly eats the "blood-soup" (Black puddings/Sauer/Suur) during dinner and proclaims it to be delicious. Marlinchen gathers the bones from the dinner and buries them beneath the juniper tree with a handkerchief.

Suddenly, a mist emerges from the juniper tree and a beautiful bird flies out. The bird visits the local townspeople and sings about its brutal murder in the hands of its stepmother. Captivated by its lullaby, a goldsmith, a shoemaker and a miller offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone in return for the bird singing its song again. The bird returns home and gives the husband a gold chain whilst giving Marlinchen a pair of red shoes. Meanwhile, the stepmother complains about the “raging fires within her arteries”, revealed to be the real cause of her anger and hatred towards her stepson. She goes outside for relief but the bird drops the millstone onto her head, killing her instantly. Surrounded by smoke and flames, the son, revealed to be the bird, emerges and reunites with his family. They celebrate and head inside for lunch, and live happily ever after.

None of the characters in ''The Juniper Tree'' have names except for Marlinchen. Instead, they are referred to by their relationship to one another or by their occupation. They are listed below in order of importance.

Arguably the protagonist of the story, he is the child of the father and the father's first wife who is also Marlinchen's stepbrother (or in other versions, her half-brother). He was often afraid to return home from school since he would routinely be cruelly abused and beaten by his stepmother, making him cry to sleep every night. Eventually, he is decapitated by his stepmother and his flesh is dismembered, his blood drained and his body and blood are cooked into "Black Puddings/Blood-Soup. The boy eventually reincarnates into a beautiful bird and kills the stepmother in revenge and reverts to his original human self by the end of the story.

=== The Stepmother ===
Perceived as the antagonist of the story, she is the second wife of the father and the mother of Marlinchen. She is a disturbed and insane individual who is often clouded with evil thoughts and she often blames this on the "raging fires in her veins". However, she attempts to rationalize her evil nature by stating that her stepson would inherit his father's wealth instead of Marlinchen. In some versions, it is mentioned that evil spirits often influenced the stepmother in committing evil deeds against her stepson and she is often thought to be possessed by the [[Devil]] himself.

=== Marlinchen ===
In some versions she is called Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie. She is the son's stepsister. She is treated kindly by the stepmother in comparison to her stepbrother. She often cares for her stepbrother in spite of the abuse. When she discovers her stepbrother's corpse, Marlinchen initially presumes that he is ignoring her requests of giving her an apple and under the instruction of her stepmother, she boxes him in the ear. She becomes horrified of causing her stepbrother's head to fall off and cries frantically many times throughout the story, especially when the stepmother cooks the stepson into a stew. She eventually buries the bones of her stepbrother beneath the juniper tree. Marlinchen is a [[static character]] throughout the story but becomes more emotional and tearful, especially after the murder of her stepbrother.

=== The Father ===
The son's father, the stepmother's husband, the husband of the first wife and Marlinchen's stepfather. He is a wealthy and pious man but he is often absent at home, which probably explains why the stepmother could get away with her abuse towards his son. He was also unaware that the blood-soup/black pudding he consumed was actually made from his son's blood and body. The father is a static character in this work.

=== The Goldsmith, the Shoemaker and the Miller ===
Three residents of an unnamed town that is located near the house where the main characters reside. They are captivated by the bird's lullaby who sings about a horrific fate similar to the one suffered by the son. As a reward, for the bird singing its song again they offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone respectively in return. Considered minor characters in this work.

=== The First Wife ===
The son's biological mother and the original wife of the father. Like her husband, she is wealthy and pious and often prays in hopes of getting a child. She dies at the beginning of the story after being extremely ecstatic over the sight of her newborn son and is buried beneath the juniper tree.

==Motifs==
There are many themes, such as cannibalism, death, and food, that play an important role in the short story, ''The Juniper Tree.'' These overall themes are listed below.

=== Cannibalism ===
Some argue that ''The Juniper Tree'' draws cues from the short story ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]''. Following the death of the main character, the mother (in an attempt to cover up his death) literally "chopped him in pieces, put him into the pan and... [cooked him up in blood-soup/black puddings].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The husband then eats the blood-soup/black pudding, saying how “delicious [the] food is," and even asks for the wife to "give [him] some more.” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Parallel between food and death ===
It is quite clear by the end of the tale that food is associated with death. At the beginning of the short story, the girl is cutting an apple when she cuts her fingers and "blood [falls to] the snow."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An apple later is even referred to as ushering in the Devil when the little boy comes home and the Devil figuratively makes the mother say to him, "My son, wilt thou have an apple?”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; You could even look to the son as a source of death when he is turned into stew. Finally, a millstone is used to kill the mother. A millstone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/millstone|title=millstone - definition of millstone in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool typically used to grind corn.

=== Guardianship ===
Critics suggest that the character of the mother in "The Juniper Tree" is used to represent a guardian spirit. This theme of guardianship is shown throughout other Grimm fairy tales such as [[Cinderella]], [[Sleeping Beauty|Briar Rose]], and [[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]]. In all of these stories, there is some object (normally represented through nature) that watches after the main character. In the case of "Briar Rose," "the briar hedge is the symbol of nature guarding her rose: the princess who sleeps inside the castle." &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3813902 |jstor=3813902 |title=A Literary Approach to the Brothers Grimm |journal=Journal of the Folklore Institute |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=180–196 |last1=David |first1=Alfred |last2=David |first2=Mary Elizabeth |year=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gift giving ===
When the son becomes a bird, he requests gifts such as a gold chain from a goldsmith and a pair of shoes for his sister. In addition, he asks for a millstone from a group of millers, which he drops on the wife's head leading to her swift death. Critics argue that while the chain may represent power (to leave the wife), the shoes may also allude to freedom.

=== Song ===
Song is a symbolic motif in that it served as a vessel to expose the son's wrongful death. The bird sang this song to different townspeople in order to get gifts that he will later bestow on his sister and father after they heard the bird sing as well. This song fueled the personification of a bird, which naturally does not have the ability to communicate words to humans.

The song went like this:

'''Lyrics'''

"My mother she killed me,

My father he ate me,

My sister, little Marlinchen,

Gathered together all my bones,

Tied them in a silken handkerchief,

Laid them beneath the juniper-tree,

Kywitt, kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Child abuse ===
Child abuse is a prevalent theme shown through the stepmother constantly abusing her stepson and eventually murdering him. This theme, along with cruel oppression, is a recurring theme in the works of the Brothers Grimm. such as [[The Frog Prince]] and [[Rapunzel]]. Critic Jack Zipes suggests that the theme of child abuse leads to a more adult centered story. This veers away from the more accepted thought that fairy tales are meant for children.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_19_on_20161207074816"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=2000 |title=The Contamination of the Fairy Tale, or The Changing Nature of the Grimms' Fairy Tales |jstor=43308420 |journal=Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=77–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personification of the Devil===
The devil makes an appearance in many Grimms' tales, often in “various disguises.”&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CARSCH|first=HENRY|date=1968-01-01|title=THE ROLE OF THE DEVIL IN GRIMMS' TALES: AN EXPLORATION OF THE CONTENT AND FUNCTION OF POPULAR TALES|jstor=40969921|journal=Social Research|volume=35|issue=3|pages=466–499}}&lt;/ref&gt; He takes many identities including anything from a “little man,” to an “old goat.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The stepmother's deep disgust and violent tendencies towards the stepson play right into the mindset that she may be an offshoot of the devil himself. The stepmother offering the stepson an apple before brutally killing him and manipulating her daughter's innocence to cover up the murder is also a direct allusion to the [[Fall of man|biblical temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden]].  Near the end, the stepmother experiences "raging fires" within her veins, symbolising the weight of her sins and possibly the [[damnation]] of her soul. It is even described at one point during the story that the Devil (who is referred as the Evil One in most adaptions) has [[Demonic possession|gone into her mind]] before her villainous breakdown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
Religion plays a major symbolic role in the story. Devotion to God was often associated with purity and innocence, as shown through the boy's biological parents and presumably, the boy himself and Marlinchen. The boy reincarnating into the bird and killing the stepmother with the millstone out of revenge can also symbolize the [[Holy Spirit]], who is often depicted as a white [[dove]], executing divine judgement upon the wicked. The story also takes place "well on two thousand years ago" placing it firmly in Biblical times. In most English language translations, the dish/cooking method that is described in the text is translated as "stew" or as in Margaret Hunt's 1884 translation as "black puddings." What is important here is that the body and the blood of the boy are cooked and consumed by the father. What is missing in most English language translations in the word "stew" is that the blood of the boy is also cooked and eaten. The symoblism in relation to the Eucharist - eating the body and drinking the blood of Christ - then become unmistakeable.

=== Reincarnation ===
"In fairy tales the cycle of human life is intimately related to the cycle of nature." &lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; 
Particularly seen in the Grimm Brother's "The Juniper Tree," reincarnation plays a major role in the tale. The audience first sees reincarnation when the first wife asks to be buried under the juniper tree. Although the mother never truly comes back to life, her spirit appears to have supernatural influence over the juniper tree, which allows her son to be physically reincarnated, as a bird and as his originally physical form, at the end of the story.

== Theory of Grimm ==
Each Grimm tale follows a predetermined and categorical format. Every tale is based on the idea that each character is born with fault.  For example, if a child is “loved by his parents, he is hated by a brother or sister.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Marthe|last2=Powell|first2=Wyley L.|date=1969-01-01|title=The Grimm Brothers|jstor=2929635|journal=Yale French Studies|issue=43|pages=44–56|doi=10.2307/2929635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could include a child “surrounded by affection.” Using the Grimm theory, the child then must be “pursued by an offense committed prior to his birth, generally by one of his family.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is this format that pushes a "coming of character moment" where the main character (in order to survive) “set[s] out on a road strew with pitfalls, pursued by an evil willpower, as if distance itself could not take him away from the fatality of [his or her] family."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transformative bodies in Grimm ===
Continuous throughout each of the Grimm tales are the reappearance of transformative bodies. Critic Jeana Jorgensen, argues that there is a connection between the physical transformation of characters and their genders.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.13110/marvelstales.28.1.0127 |url=https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/marvels/vol28/iss1/9 |title=Quantifying the Grimm Corpus: Transgressive and Transformative Bodies in the Grimms' Fairy Tales |journal=Marvels &amp; Tales |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=127 |date=2014-05-21 |last1=Jorgensen |first1=Jeana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing a connection between beauty ideals consistently being a major factor in female character development to Grimm, while transformations playing a significant role in the development of mostly male characters. She concludes that female characters are usually described with a focus on their physical attributes such as small, petite, wicked, beautiful, and ugly compared to the adjectives used in male transformations that overall relate strictly to age and size. Specifically, in ''The Juniper Tree'', Jorgensen uses Miriam’s depiction of sorrow as a representation of the fact that in several of Grimm’s tales "suffering is written on women’s bodies in a way that naturalizes their pain and almost leads us to expect women to cry in fairy tales." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Fantasy and magic in Grimm ===
For the Grimm Brother's audience "the fantasy and magic of the story can be interpreted as instruments to establish or restore social and economic justice."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/376915 |jstor=376915 |title=The Fairy Tale: An Introduction to Literature and the Creative Process |journal=College English |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=31–45 |last1=Markman |first1=Roberta Hoffman |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta Markman believes that this is the case among all of the Grimm fairy tales because the creative process' "transformative power[s]" can change social norms. As a result, literature and other creative art forms have the power to change someone's personal attitude regarding their economic and social situations. This is especially prevalent in Grimm fairy tales where normally the character's social and economic situation is poor at best. For example, in the Grimm's [[Cinderella]], Cinderella's social situation is contingent upon her servitude to her stepmother. As an audience member, when one reads this they are reminded of how good their social situation is in comparison.

=== Family conflict in Grimm ===
There is an apparent parallel between Grimm’s ''The Juniper Tree'' and his previous works, familial drama. Critic Walter Scherf in a study of the introductions of children’s literature, noted that out of 176 texts, 169 of them started with a basic family conflict.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Similar to the plot in Juniper Tree, in Grimm’s ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', the children live with their stepmother who does not like them, and makes a plan to get rid of them. She states that in the morning she and her husband will take the children into the thickest part of the forest and leave them there, with the intention that they won’t be able to find their way back, and end up starving to death.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Lore and Randall Jerrell. “Hansel and Gretel”. ''The Juniper Tree and Other Tales from Grimm''. 2nd ed, Douglas and McIntyre, 2003, pp. 154-170.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the Stepmother in ''The Juniper Tree'' who wanted her daughter to inherit everything from the Father, killing the Son in order to guarantee this possibility.

== Original translation and background ==
It is important to remember that the Juniper tree is not only the title of the collection, but also a piece of prose within the book. More importantly, the collection of short stories were not written by the Grimm brothers, but instead collected from “various sources… many of which were the original authors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blind|first=Karl|date=1888-01-01|title=A GRIMM'S TALE IN A SHETLAND FOLKLORE VERSION|jstor=24708733|journal=The Archaeological Review|volume=1|issue=5|pages=346–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there are twenty-seven short stories spanning three hundred and thirty-three pages. The Grimm brothers also used illustrations to add to the overall work. According to Grimm, the "illustrations [used are] delicate in detail, imaginative in concept, and truly beautiful."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Commentary ==
Academic discourse is an important part of understanding any sort of text. The Brothers Grimm's "Juniper Tree" is no different. Listed below, in alphabetical order, are some examples of commentary written by academic scholars regarding this fairy tale. This represents their individual opinions regarding ''The Juniper Tree''.

=== Alfred and Mary Elizabeth David === 
In Alfred and Elizabeth David's essay, they interpret "The Juniper Tree" as "folk literature for inspiration." They believe that the nature and native culture presented in most Grimm fairy tale inspires other artists in their literary endeavors &lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In "The Juniper Tree," this theme of nature is present. The Grimm Brothers use the juniper tree as a life source for the mother and the son. The use of nature as a life source inspired other literary work such as "Briar Rose".

=== Maria Tatar === 
Many folklorists interpret evil stepmothers as stemming from actual competition between a woman and her stepchildren for resources.  In this tale, the motive is made explicit:  the stepmother wants her daughter to inherit everything.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 161, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[millstone]] in the story would have had biblical connotations for the readers of the Grimms' days, especially as the verse Luke 17:2 says that anyone who causes a child to sin would be better off being thrown into the sea with a millstone about his neck; both refer to a millstone as a punishment for those who harm the young and innocent.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''Off with Their Heads!'' p. 213 {{ISBN|0-691-06943-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biblical connotation could be the offering of the apple from the stepmother, possessed by the devil, to the son, which parallels the devil, disguised as a serpent, offering the forbidden fruit (traditionally an apple) to Eve.

=== J. R .R Tolkien === 
In his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] cited ''The Juniper Tree'' as an example of the evils of censorship for children; many versions in his day omitted the stew, and Tolkien thought children should not be spared it, unless they were spared the whole fairy tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Maria Raffaella |last1=Benvenuto |chapter=German Folktale: ''Deutsche Mythologie'' |page=236 |chapterurl={{Google books|B0loOBA3ejIC|page=236|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Michael D. C. |editor1-last=Drout |title=J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415969420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
Throughout the centuries, the Grimm Brothers fairy tales have been retold and adapted by an abundance of sources. The story was adapted:

*For the comic book ''[[Grimm Fairy Tales (comics)|Grimm Fairy Tales]]'' as issue 17. The story goes: a woman kills her stepson in order to prevent him from eloping with her daughter, then buries his body underneath the juniper tree in their yard. The next day, a bird on the branch of the tree tells the daughter the truth, and out of grief, she hangs herself from the tree. The story is told to a woman named Patricia, who was contemplating having her drug-addict stepson Bryan killed because of the horrible example he set for her daughter, Carolyn. But, in a sense of twisted irony, her daughter dies anyway from a drug overdose.
*By [[Barbara Comyns Carr]] in her novel, ''The Juniper Tree'', published by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] in 1985. In Comyns Carr's adaptation the stepmother is a sympathetic character and the son's death an accident. Whereas in Grimm's fairy tale it is Marlene (the daughter) who buries the bones of the son, Comyns Carr makes Marlene ignorant of the death and has the stepmother, desperate to prevent her husband from finding out and in the throes of a nervous breakdown, bury the little boy under the juniper tree. At the end of the adaptation, the stepmother does not die but is treated and begins a new life. ''The Juniper Tree'' was Barbara Comyns Carr's first novel after an 18-year hiatus in her work and was described in ''[[The Financial Times]]'', at the time of publication, as "delicate, tough, quick-moving .... haunting".&lt;ref&gt;Comyns Carr, Barbara: ''The Juniper Tree'', Adapted from a children's fairy story of the same name by the Brother's Grimm, which is far too macabre for adult reading. Published by Methuen, 1985. {{ISBN|0-413-59180-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As ''[[The Juniper Tree (opera)|The Juniper Tree]]'', an opera in two acts by [[Philip Glass]] &amp; [[Robert Moran]], (1985); libretto by Arthur Yorinks.
*As the 1990 Icelandic film ''[[The Juniper Tree (film)|The Juniper Tree]]'', based on the Grimm Brothers' tale, starring Björk as a visionary young girl whose mother has been put to death as a witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138545/ | title=The Juniper Tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the story "The Crabapple Tree", by [[Robert Coover]], appearing in the January 12, 2015, issue of ''[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/crabapple-tree | title=The Crabapple Tree| journal=The New Yorker| date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*English folk singer Emily Portman sings a version of the story called "Stick Stock".
*The book ''The Grimm Conclusion'' (by Adam Gidwitz) was based on this fairy tale.
*For a collection of fairy tales created by Lore Segal and Maurice Sendak entitled ''The Juniper Tree''.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_19_on_20161207074816"/&gt;
*[[Lorrie Moore]] published a short story entitled "The Juniper Tree," dedicated to the late [[Nietzchka Keene]], director of the film ''[[The Juniper Tree (film)|The Juniper Tree]]''. In the story, a red-haired playwright (apparently based on Keene) appears on the night after her death to visit her friends.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Yorker'', January 17, 2005, collected in Moore's ''Bark: Stories'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The People in the Trees''''' is the 2013 [[debut novel]] of author [[Hanya Yanagihara]]. Yanagihara stated that her novel was in part inspired by [[Daniel Carleton Gajdusek]] who was revered in the scientific community before being accused of [[child molestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking with Hanya Yanagihara About Her Debut Novel, The People in the Trees|url=http://www.vogue.com/872937/talking-with-hanya-yanagihara-about-her-debut-novel-the-people-in-the-trees/|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanagihara based the physical look and shape of Ivu'ivu on [[Angra dos Reis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Stephenie|title=HANYA YANAGIHARA The strange truths of travel and fiction|url=http://bookpage.com/interviews/15513-hanya-yanagihara#.VjA4sLerR7o|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the late 1990s Dr. Ronald Kubodera, a colleague of [[Nobel Laureate]] Dr. Abraham Norton Perina, mourns Norton's downfall after being convicted of [[incest|sexually abusing his own children]]. Kubodera encourages Norton to write his memoirs from his prison isolation and marks them with footnotes.

Norton writes of his childhood in the small town of Lindon, Indiana, where his interest in science was piqued by his paternal aunt Sybil, a doctor. While attending medical school Norton attracts the attention of Gregory Smythe, and is hired to work in his lab. Norton is eventually invited to Smythe's home for dinner where Smythe cries in front of him. Repulsed by Smythe, Norton quits the lab. Shortly before graduation however Norton is approached to be the medical doctor on an anthropological mission to U'ivu led by a man named Paul Tallent. Norton realizes that Smythe recommended him in order to send him as far away as possible from him. Despite the fact that the mission is considered career suicide, Norton accepts.

Norton meets Tallent for the first time before they leave from [[Hawaii]] to U'ivu and finds him beautiful and enigmatic. When they arrive in U'ivu they meet the other member of the team, a woman named Esme Duff whom Norton immediately dislikes. Tallent leads Norton and Esme to a smaller island that is part of U'ivu called Ivu'ivu. There they meet three hunter guides who lead them deep into the jungle of the island where eventually Tallent reveals to Norton that there is a legend among the U'ivu people about a [[Uncontacted peoples|lost tribe]] that has been gifted with eternal life but also deep stupidity and that their guides have actually seen one of these people. Shortly after they discover a woman who is devoid of language, completely nude and seems unable to function as a regular human being. The explorers dub the woman Eve and quickly discover a tribe of other people like her whom they dub "Dreamers" all of whom have varyingly poor grasp of language. Through some of the more lucid dreamers Tallent discovers that though they all have a mark of a turtle on them, which indicates they are 60, they are actually all well over 100 years old.

Shortly after discovering the Dreamers the explorers also discover a group of Ivu'ivu's who had lost contact with the U'ivuians. They are allowed to observe the village as long as they do not bring the Dreamers in contact with them. While there Norton observes the villagers engaging in the ritualistic rape of a young ten-year-old boy. While Esme finds the ritual disturbing Norton decides that it is not rape or abuse but simply a cultural difference. Later on he has a sexual encounter with the boy who was raped.

He and the group also observe the chief of the village engaging in a ritual to celebrate his 60th year where he eats a turtle. Norton quickly realizes that there is a link between eating the turtle and the seeming immortality and brain damage exhibited by the dreamers. After interviewing one of the dreamers he is taken to a small pond where the turtles comes from and later, against Tallent's advice, returns and kills one of the turtles to bring back its flesh for experiments in America. He and Tallent also bring back four of the Dreamers for further observation.

Back in America, working at [[Stanford]], Norton feeds the turtle to mice and realizes that their life cycle can be extended 6 times that of regular mice. He publishes his paper at first to derision and eventually to acclaim. Tallent warns him that his paper has condemned the people of U'ivu and this eventually proves true; the turtles of Ivu'ivu are eventually hunted to extinction by pharmaceutical companies and the island itself destroyed, eventually U'ivu is colonized as well. Norton continues to visit the island and begins to adopt local abandoned children in great numbers. In 1980 he sees a decrepit man he believes was the boy he had the sexual encounter with when he first came to Ivu'ivu who foists his son on Norton. Norton takes the boy home and names him Victor.

As Victor grows older he and Norton develop an increasingly contentious relationship. Norton claims that on Christmas Victor locked Norton out of his home leaving him to die after which Norton locked Victor in the basement for a few days. When Victor is a teenager he goes to Norton's brother, Owen, and tells him that Norton [[rape]]d him, causing a rift between the brothers and leading to Norton's imprisonment.

In December 2000, Dr. Kubodera writes that he and Norton have escaped from his parole officer. He confesses to feeling guilty for having omitted a portion of Norton's memoirs and includes it as a post-script. The omitted portion reveals that Norton raped not only Victor but many of his other adopted sons.

'''''The Water Knife''''' is a 2015 [[Science fiction novel|science fiction novel]] by [[Paolo Bacigalupi]]. It is Bacigalupi's sixth novel, and is based on his short story, ''[[Paolo Bacigalupi#Short_stories|The Tamarisk Hunters]]''; first published in the environmental journal ''[[High Country News]]''. It takes place in the near future, where drought brought on by climate change has devastated the [[Southwestern United States]].&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-paolo-bacigalupi-20150524-story.html|title=Review Amid a real drought, thriller 'Water Knife' cuts to the quick|last=Hamilton|first=Denise|date=21 May 2015|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Set at an undetermined point in the near future, the American Southwest has been ravaged by drought, brought on by rising heat and extreme water shortages due to the debilitating effects of [[climate change]].  The [[Colorado River]] and its tributaries, which are an essential source of water for the region, has decreased to a mere trickle. In Nevada, Arizona, and California, corrupt [[Business magnate|business magnates]] control the severely depleted water supply, and routinely battle in armed conflicts for dwindling portions of the river.

Angel Velasquez, a detective, assassin and spy “cuts” water for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, controlled by his boss Catherine Case. Angel's job, as a "water knife", is to infiltrate and sabotage the water supplies of competing states, and to make sure that Case can keep her luxuriant [[Arcology|arcology]] developments thriving in Las Vegas. Case wants to ensure that the rich stay wet, while the poor get nothing but dust. 

When reports of a game-changing water source arise in Phoenix, Angel is sent south to investigate in his customized [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]]. Upon arrving in the blistering heat of Arizona, he encounters Lucy Monroe, an award winning journalist harboring her own agenda and secrets, and Maria Villarosa, a young refugee from Texas, surviving on her instincts and shrewdness. The three find themselves being manipulated in a corrupt game, larger and dirtier than any of them could have ever imagined.

Angel soon discovers that California is trying to monopolize the tiny current of the river, and with Phoenix on the verge of collapsing into chaos and violence, the bodies begin to stack up. As time starts to run out for the three, they discover their only hope for survival rests in one another hands. But when water is such a precious commodity in the desert region, and where partnerships can change in the blink of an eye, the only thing for certain is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.

==Central characters==
*Angel Velasquez was born in Mexico and fled the country with his father after gang members murdered his mother and sister. After being released from prison by Catherine Case, Angel must now work for her as a "water knife"; a hired henchman, assassin and spy who sneaks into the water boards of Nevada’s rival states, California and Arizona, sabotaging and destroying their water supplies. 
*Lucy Monroe is a Pulitzer winning journalist who has stayed in Phoenix longer than she intended to, making a dangerous living reporting on the water wars. She can’t seem to abandon the chaos that surrounds her, hoping for that one big story. She knows far more about Phoenix's water secrets than she admits.
*Maria Villarosa is a young Texas refugee and orphan, doing her best to survive just one more day. She is trying to get enough money together to leave the drought stricken region, and has dreams of escaping to the north where water still falls from the sky.

==Reception==
[[Hugo Award]] winner Jason Heller said "Bacigalupi plays on a grand scale, but he does so with a keen eye for detail, from the designer dust masks worn by the rich to the construction printers used on an industrial scale (like giant 3-D printers), for the building of Southern Nevada Water Authority super resorts. His big triumph, though, is never forgetting that ''The Water Knife'' is a thriller at its pounding heart. Even amid reams of deeply researched information about the economy, geology, history and politics of water rights and usage in the United States, he keeps the plot taut and the dialogue slashing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/28/408295800/the-water-knife-cuts-deep|title='The Water Knife' Cuts Deep|last=Heller|first=Jason|date=28 May 2015|publisher=NPR|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''The Washington Post'', [[Héctor Tobar]] writes that "Bacigalupi is a grim, efficient and polished narrator" and creates a "twisted fictional landscape" that is a "vision of the near-future that borrows heavily from the strangeness and conflicts of the present". Tobar also states that some of the inventions used in the novel reek of stereotypes: "Mexico, for example, has devolved into a series of political entities called the Cartel States...but a powerful journalist named Lucy Monroe and a refugee from Texas named María Villarosa provide feminine wiles and a much-needed antidote to the book’s relentless bursts of testosterone-driven prose". Overall, Tobar suggests that fans of Bacigalupi's previous novel, ''[[The Windup Girl]]'', will surely "enjoy losing themselves in these nearly 400 pages of climate sci-fi, or cli-fi, as it’s now called".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/imagining-a-thirsty-future-in-paolo-bacigalupis-the-water-knife/2015/05/28/40689c74-fa60-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html|title=Imagining a thirsty future in Paolo Bacigalupi’s ‘The Water Knife’|last=Tobar|first=Héctor|date=28 May 2015|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Denver Post]]'' called the novel a "blockbuster" writing that the characters in the book are "dragged together by fate, make bargains with each other and with themselves, and sometimes manage to rise to the level of anti-hero...there’s a little more techno-jargon, there are explosions and helicopters, breathless action and genuine suspense...this is a rich and, yes, gritty world from a smart author who knows the American Southwest well and knows readers better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_28254530/water-knife-review-waters-fighting-over|title=Book review: "The Water Knife," by Paolo Bacigalupi|last=Burdick|first=Dave|publisher=''The Denver Post''|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denise Hamilton]] postulated that the book brought to mind the movie [[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]], saying that while "one is set in the past and the other in a dystopian future, both are [[Neo-noir|neo-noir]] tales with jaded antiheroes and ruthless kingpins who wield water as lethal weapons to control life - and mete out death". Hamilton further opines that "Bacigalupi's use of water as sacred currency" evokes the novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and the "violence and slang" may also bring to mind the film, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Still though, Hamilton argues that the book is not a [[Pastiche|pastiche]] either; "Bacigalupi weaves an engrossing tale all his own, crackling with edgy style...and he makes water politics sexy, laying down the jargon and technical details early, then hurrying back to the action-filled streets...the ultimate villains here aren't the hired assassins or lowly water engineers but the faceless corporate owners who play God, deciding if entire regions live or die".&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In British English, valedictions have largely been replaced by the use of "Yours [[sincerity|sincerely]]" or "Yours faithfully". "Yours sincerely" is typically employed in English when the recipient is addressed by name (e.g. "Dear John") and is known to the sender to some degree, whereas "Yours faithfully" is used when the recipient is not addressed by name (i.e. the recipient is addressed by a phrase such as "Dear Sir/Madam") or when the recipient is not known personally by the sender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Yours faithfully or Yours sincerely?|url = http://www.dailywritingtips.com/yours-faithfully-or-yours-sincerely/|website = www.dailywritingtips.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business usage===

===Diplomatic usage===
A diplomatic ''[[note verbale]]'' always ends with an elaborate valediction, most commonly "[Sender] avails itself of this opportunity to renew to [recipient] the assurances of its highest consideration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translationjournal.net/journal/10dipl.htm|title=Diplomatic Translation|author=|date=|website=translationjournal.net|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valedictions in e-mail===
Valedictions in formal [[e-mail]] are similar to valedictions in letters; on the whole, they are variations of "regards" and "yours".&lt;ref name="netmanners.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netmanners.com/email-etiquette/email-sign-off-considerations/ |website=netmanners.com|author=Kallos, Judith |title=Email Sign-off Considerations|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a wide range of popular valedictions are used in casual e-mail but very rarely in letters.&lt;ref name="netmanners.com"/&gt;

===Other forms===
*"Yours Aye" is a Scottish expression meaning "Yours Always", still commonly used as a valediction to end written correspondence in the Royal Navy and British Army, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/modern_times/article4034543.ece "Walking down the street, opening doors and wearing hats at weddings"], ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally used by sailors or people working in a maritime context. It is commonly used in the Royal Australian Navy as a sign-off in written communication such as emails. 
*"Yours, etc." is used historically for abbreviated endings. It can be found in older newspaper letters to the editor, and often in US legal correspondence. "&amp;c." may be seen as an alternative abbreviation of [[et cetera]].
*"Yours hopefully" is occasionally used in letters of respect or complaint.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===United States military usage===
Current regulations of the [[United States Department of Defense]], the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the [[U.S. Air Force]], the [[U.S. Army]], and the [[U.S. Navy]] call for two complimentary closings for letters: "Respectfully yours" and "Sincerely". "Respectfully yours" is reserved for the President, except the Army includes the President's spouse, and for the President-elect. "Sincerely" is used in all other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Department of Defense |title=Manual for Written Material: Correspondence Management|publisher= DoDM 5110.04-M-V1|date= October 26, 2010 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/511004m_v1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joint Chiefs of Staff|title=Joint Staff Guide, DOM/SJS, JS Guide 5711|date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=EDITORIAL GUIDANCE AND ACCEPTED USAGE FOR JOINT STAFF CORRESPONDENCE, Enclosure K, K-1 to K-10|url= http://www.dtic.mil/cjcs_directives/jdata/unlimit/g571101.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Army Regulation 25–50, Preparing and Managing Correspondence |date=6 July 2015 |url= http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r25_50.pdf |access-date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  |date=March 2010 |title=SECNAV Manual M-216.5 APPENDIX B, CIVILIAN MODELS OF ADDRESS, B1-B10  |url=http://www.sc.edu/nrotc/content/Documents/SECNAVINST%205216.5.pdf |access-date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=AIR FORCE HANDBOOK 33-337, "Communications and Information" THE TONGUE AND QUILL |pages= 197-213  |date=27 May 2015 |url= http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_cio_a6/publication/afh33-337/afh33-337.pdf |access-date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY CORRESPONDENCE MANUAL|url=http://navybmr.com/study%20material/SECNAV%20M-5216.5%20(2015).pdf|publisher=US Department of the Navy|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more informal (but still professional) correspondence among military service members, "Very respectfully" is used. This is often abbreviated as "V/R."{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Commander of the Navy]]'s school in the military's "[[Mustang University]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Officer Training Command: Home of the Navy OCS |url= http://www.ocs.navy.mil/staff/welcome.asp|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated his preference, in 2014, that the older "Very respectfully" be used in letters to someone senior in pay-grade or positional authority. However, the Commander acknowledged that current regulations call for "Sincerely" and told students they were free to follow that practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LDO CWO Documents|work=The Mustang Lariat (LDO AND CWO Officer Community Managers Newsletter)|date=July 2014|author= USN|url= http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/ldo_cwo/Documents/June%202014%20Lariat.pdf |accessdate= October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bengali==
in written form, valediction is very important in Bengali. When writing official letters, general customs are:
* Apnar ekanto baddogoto ( আপনার একান্ত বাধ্যগত) , literally means 'Yours Sincerely'. 
* Apnar sushastho ebong dhirgayu kamona korchi (আপনার সুস্বাস্থ্য এবং দীর্ঘায়ু কামনা করছি),  With you a healthy and long life

In oral form, various forms are used
*[[Khuda Hafiz|Khoda Hafez]] ( খোদা হাফেজ) , literally means 'May God be your Guardian', came from [[Persian language|Persian]]. 
*[[Allah Hafez]] ( আল্লাহ হাফেজ) , literally means 'May Allah be your Guardian', came from [[Persian language|Persian]]. 
*[[Namaskar]] ( নমস্কার) , used only by [[Indian Bengali]]. 
 

==Chinese==
Valedictions in Chinese are highly variable and reflect the relative social status of the sender and recipient.  Salutation (問候語) is traditionally placed after valediction (申悃語) ''and'' the closing of the main body of the letter, as opposed to its typical location in English.  Traditional valediction include:
*To social seniors: 肅此上達 (prostrating [to you], delivering up)、敬此馳稟 (respectfully, speedily reporting)、耑肅奉稟 (especially prostrating, respectfully reporting)、肅此 (prostrating [to you])、敬此 (respectfully)、謹此 (reverently)。
*To social equals: 耑此奉達 (especially, respectfully delivering)、匆此布臆 ([apologetically] quickly, relaying [my] estimations)、特此奉聞 (especially relaying [for your] information)、草此奉達 ([apologetically] simply, respectfully delivering)、草此 (simply)、耑此 (especially)。
*For replications especially: 耑肅敬覆、耑此奉覆、肅函奉覆、耑此敬覆、匆此布覆。
*For congratulations or commemoration: 敬申賀悃、肅表賀忱、用申賀意。
*To or from mourning persons: 恭陳唁意、肅此上慰、敬申哀悃。
*For expression of gratitude: 肅誌謝忱、敬此鳴謝、耑鳴謝悃。

==French==
Standard [[French language]] valedictions tend to be much more complex than standard English ones, more akin to older English valedictions. They show a fair degree of variation, for example:

:''Veuillez agréer, Madame, Monsieur, l'expression de mes sentiments distingués'' 
:"Please accept, &lt;!-- "agréer" is a higher way of saying "accept" or "receive" - w:fr:Leafcat --&gt; Madam, Sir, the expression of my distinguished sentiments."

Or:

:''Veuillez recevoir, Madame, mes sincères salutations.'' 
:"Please receive, Madam, my sincere salutations."

Or:

:''Je vous prie de croire, Monsieur, à mes sentiments les meilleurs.'' 
:"I beg you to believe, Sir, in my best sentiments."

In the latter case of a formula beginning with the first person, the valediction is often enhanced with a participial phrase concluding the sense of the letter (since traditionally it is not considered appropriate to begin a paragraph with the first person singular ''je'' in a letter):

:''Espérant recevoir une réponse favorable, je vous prie d'agréer, Madame…''("Hoping for a favourable answer, I beg you to allow, Madam…")

A number of rules concern the use of these formulae:
* the title used in the salutation of the letter must be reproduced in the valediction; so a letter addressing ''Madame la députée'' would conclude, ''Veuillez, Madame la députée''.
* the wording ''recevoir l'assurance'' should be used in a letter from a hierarchical superior to an inferior, whereas the wording ''agréer l'expression'' should be used in a letter from a hierarchical inferior to a superior, and not conversely.
* in a letter from a man to a woman or from a woman to a man, the writer must not send ''sentiments'' if they are not close family relatives (i.e. mother and son, father and daughter, brother and sister, or possibly close cousins).

Such formulae may be used even in more friendly letters, often with the adjective ''cher'' or ''chère'' for the recipient. Letters to dignitaries may use even more grandiose styles, such as:

:''Daignez, Monsieur le Premier ministre, agréer l'expression de ma considération très distinguée.''
:"Deign, Mr. Prime Minister, to allow the expression of my most distinguished consideration."

or more commonly:

:''Veuillez agréer, Monsieur le Premier ministre, l'expression de ma très haute considération.''
:"Please accept, Mr. Prime Minister, the expression of my highest consideration."

According to French typographic rules&lt;!-- w:fr: links not working here, and I don't have time to check how to make a footnote. See http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_des_majuscules_en_fran%C3%A7ais#Cas_particuliers --&gt;, the proper capitalization for the official title is "Premier ministre" although people who mimic English titles or fear that they might appear disrespectful often use more capitals than the rules commend.

:''Veuillez agréer, Madame l'Ambassadeur, l'expression de mes salutations les plus respectueuses.''
:"Please allow, Madam Ambassador, the expression of my most respectful salutations."

Another French typographic rule states that when addressing someone, styles like ''Monsieur'', ''Madame'', ''Mademoiselle'', should never be abbreviated, even if followed by a title (hence, writing ''M. le Premier Ministre'' or ''Mme l'Ambassadeur'' would be considered clumsy).

Much shorter styles may be used in brief notes (''Sincères salutations''), and informal letters (such as between intimates) may use expressions such as (with approximate English equivalents – not literal translations):

* ''Amicalement'' ("In friendship")
* ''Amitiés'' ("Your friend")
* ''À bientôt'' ("See you soon")
* ''Au plaisir de vous revoir'' ("Hope to see you again soon")
* ''Bien amicalement'' ("In Good Friendship")
* ''Bien à vous'' ("Sincerely yours")
* ''Cordialement'' ("Cordially")
* ''Meilleures salutations'' ("Best Salutations")
* ''Salutations distinguées'' ("With Distinguished Salutations")

Unlike in English, when the letter writer has a title that is unique in his or her organization, it is placed before, not after, the name:

:''Veuillez recevoir, Monsieur, mes sincères salutations.''
:''La vice-présidente des ressources humaines,''
:
:''A.B.''

==German==
Valedictions in German, while a lot less complex than those in French, are similarly flexible. The highly formal form ''Hochachtungsvoll'' (lit. "highly respectfully") has been practically obsolete for many years and is very rarely used in modern German, except for highly formal correspondence from authorities or in letters with a highly negative connotation where "friendliness" would not be appropriate.

The standard business valediction is ''Mit freundlichen Grüßen'' (lit. "with friendly regards") and is equivalent to ''Yours sincerely'' or ''Yours faithfully'' in English. A more seldom used variant of this is ''Mit freundlichem Gruß'', which is as above but in the singular form. Other semi-formal alternatives include (roughly in descending order of formality) ''Mit besten Grüßen'' (lit. "with best regards"), ''Beste Grüße'', ''Mit herzlichen Grüßen'' (lit. "with cordial regards"), ''Viele Grüße'' (lit. "many regards"), ''Schöne Grüße'' (lit. "nice regards").

German valedictions also offer the possibility of adding your location, e.g. ''Mit freundlichen Grüßen aus Berlin'' to added effect. While this is no less formal, it does have a more "relaxed" feel to it.  Other less formal location-centric variations are also possible, such as ''Viele Grüße aus dem sonnigen Barcelona'' (lit. "many regards from sunny Barcelona").

These valedictions are also often adapted to specific professions, states or political views. For example, it is common to use ''Mit solidarischen Grüßen'' ("with regards in solidarity") among socialist and communist groups, ''Mit gewerkschaftlichen Grüßen'' (lit. "with union regards") or ''Mit kollegialen Grüßen'' (lit. "with cooperative regards") among labour union members, ''Mit kameradschaftlichen Grüßen'' (lit. "with comradely regards") among military personnel, ''Mit sportlichen Grüßen'' ("with sporting regards") among sportspeople, and ''Mit gebärdenfreundlichen Grüßen'' ("with friendly regards in sign language") among persons hard of hearing.

More familiar valedictions in German follow the same formula. ''Alles Liebe'' or ''(Viele) liebe Grüße'' are common in German for friends or family. Friends or close colleagues among each other may use simply ''Gruß''.

It is possible in informal and rapid e-mail communication to sometimes use abbreviations of the forms, unlike in English. In this way, ''Mit freundlichen Grüßen'' may be shortened to ''MfG'' and ''Liebe Grüße'' may be shortened to ''LG''. A popular form in Germany in recent years, ''hdl'' (''habe dich lieb'', lit. "am fond of you") and ''hdgdl'' (''habe dich ganz doll lieb'', lit. "am very fond of you", for somewhere between "I like you" and "I love you") has found increased usage in SMS text messaging and e-mails in more intimate relationships.

Judges have deemed that [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|Section 86a]] of the German Criminal Code forbids the use of ''Mit deutschem Gruß'' (lit. "with German regards"), as it has [[Nazism|National Socialist]] overtones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungsschutz-mv.de/cms2/Verfassungsschutz_prod/Verfassungsschutz/content_downloads/Broschueren/broschuere_rechtsextremistische_subkulturen_stand_juni_20081226.pdf ''Rechtsextremistische Subkulturen''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719112331/http://www.verfassungsschutz-mv.de/cms2/Verfassungsschutz_prod/Verfassungsschutz/content_downloads/Broschueren/broschuere_rechtsextremistische_subkulturen_stand_juni_20081226.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew==
Formal letters in Hebrew often end with "b'chavod (rav*)" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: &lt;big&gt;בכבוד *רב&lt;/big&gt;, [[Literal translation|lit]]: with (great*) honor) or somewhat less formal "bivracha" (Hebrew:&lt;big&gt; בברכה&lt;/big&gt;, lit: with blessing). The informal ones may use "kol toov" (Hebrew:&lt;big&gt; כל טוב&lt;/big&gt;, lit: all the best). For an intimate, you might end a letter or email with "mitga'ageah" (m) or "mitga'aga'at" (f) -- missing you.  Jews in the United States often use "B'shalom" or "shalom" (Hebrew:&lt;big&gt; בשלום&lt;/big&gt;, lit: in peace) within Jewish circles, for example, from a Rabbi to his congregation.  This is an American Jewish usage, rarely heard from native speakers of Hebrew.  "B'shalom" is incorrect, as it is religiously tantamount to wishing death on someone.  Indeed, the Talmud says: "In bidding farewell to the living one should not say, 'Go with peace' [lech b'shalom], but 'Go to peace' [lech l'shalom], because [King] David said to [his son] Absalom, 'Go with peace', and he went and was hanged; whereas Jethro said to Moses, 'Go to peace', and he went and succeeded." [Talmud, Moed Katan 29a]

==Hungarian==
* Maradok tisztelettel: Very formal and now dated, means "I respectfully remain (your servant)".
* Tisztelettel: Very formal, means "With regards". This is the equivalent of the English "Yours sincerely/faithfully/truly".
* Üdvözlettel: Somewhat formal, assumes existing relationship. Often used between colleagues. It literally means "Greetings".
* Üdv: An abbreviated and informal form of "Üdvözlettel". Very frequently used in e-mails among colleagues.
* Puszi: Informal and somewhat intimate, means "kiss on the cheek". Often used within family and among friends, between or toward women.
* Csók: Intimate, it means "kiss (on the mouth)". Mostly used between couples.


Hungarian valedictions are extendable, which makes a number of variations on the above expressions possible, such as "Őszinte tisztelettel" ("With sincere appreciation") or "Szívélyes üdvözlettel" ("With cordial regards").

==Japanese==
* ''Keigu'' (敬具 - Sincerely)
* ''Haikei'' (拝啓 - Respectfully)
* ''Kashiko'' (かしこ - With great humility)

==Russian==

* ''С (глубоким) уважением'' ((Very) respectfully yours) - most often used
* ''С (наи)лучшими пожеланиями'' (Best regards) - allowed between long-time partners, otherwise sounds condescending
* ''Искренне Ваш'' (Sincerely yours) - a bit affectionate, e.g. a younger colleague addressing a senior one
* ''Ваш'' (yours)
* ''Ваш покорный слуга'' (Your obedient servant) - ironical; the least possible degree of formality between people not being close friends or socially equal
* ''Примите заверения в моём самом искреннем уважении и почтении'' (Please accept the assurances of my sincerest regards and respect) - diplomatic etiquette
* ''До скорой встречи'' (See you soon) - informal

* ''Saygılarımla'' (''yours sincerely'', or ''kind/best regards'')
* ''Saygılar'' (''respectfully yours'', or ''regards'')

==Portuguese==
Formal valedictions should end with a comma followed by a paragraph where the valedictor's name (and optionally his status) is identified. Depending on the occasion, different degrees of formality are adequate, ranging from highly formal (e.g. solemn occasions) to totally informal (e.g. a conversation among friends). Some formal valedictions can be used at different formality degrees, but almost never in informal situations.
