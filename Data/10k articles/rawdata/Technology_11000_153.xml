[[AEDC]] '''Aerodynamic and Propulsion Test Unit''' (APTU) is a blowdown [[hypersonic wind tunnel]] driven by a combustion air heater (CAH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/news/story.asp?id%3D123160209 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731022104/http://www.arnold.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123160209 |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The facility is owned by the [[United States Air Force]] and operated by [[Aerospace Testing Alliance]].

== History ==
The AEDC Aerodynamic and Propulsion Test Unit started out as a vitiated air heater (VAH) conducting over 275 experiments for the development of many different aerodynamic and aerothermal systems.  Upgrades to the facility started in 2002 in order to provide ground-test capability for supersonic and hypersonic systems up to flight speeds of Mach 8.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Capabilities==
The facility was designed to provide ground-based simulations of supersonic and hypersonic flight conditions.  The combustion air heater can provide total pressures from 200 psia to 2,800 psia (13.6 atm to 190.5 atm) and a  total temperatures from 1,200°R to 4,700°R (667 K to 2,611 K). Five nozzles ranging from  Mach 3.2 to Mach 7.1 are currently available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080625-010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226032848/http://www.arnold.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080625-010.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SRA11 albedometer.jpg|alt=|thumb|Typical albedometer consisting of two pyranometers, model SRA01.]]
An '''albedometer''' is an instrument used to measure the [[Albedo|albedo (reflecting radiation)]] of a surface. An albedometer is  mostly used to measure the [[reflectance]] of earths surface. Often it consists of two pyranometers: one facing up towards the sky and one facing down towards the surface. From the ratio of incoming and reflecting radiation the albedo can be calculated.
  
==Measurement principle==
The measurement of surface albedo of earths surface happens by using two pyranometers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hukseflux.com/product/sra20-albedometer|title=Measurement instructions for albedo|last=|first=|date=|website=Hukseflux|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The upfacing pyranometer measures the incoming global solar radiation. The downward facing pyranometer measures the reflected global solar radiation. The ratio of the reflected to the global radiation is the solar albedo and depends on the properties of the surface and the directional distribution of the incoming solar radiation. Typical values range from 4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Sushobhan|last2=Roesler|first2=Jeffery|date=March 2016|title=Aging albedo model for asphalt pavement surfaces|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.019|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=117|pages=169–175|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.019|issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt; for asphalt to 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/albedo.html|title=Thermodynamics: Albedo {{!}} National Snow and Ice Data Center|website=nsidc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; for fresh snow.

'''Analog television''' or '''analogue television''' is the original [[television]] technology that uses [[analog signal]]s to transmit video and audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/tech-guidance/tv_tech_platform_code.pdf|title=Television Technical Performance Code|date=December 2006|publisher=Ofcom&amp;nbsp;– office of Communications|accessdate=24 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704163159/http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/tech-guidance/tv_tech_platform_code.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analog television broadcast, the brightness, colors and sound are represented by rapid variations of either the [[amplitude]], [[frequency]] or phase of the signal.

[[Analog signal]]s vary over a continuous range of possible values which means that electronic noise and interference becomes reproduced by the receiver.  Thus with analog, a moderately weak signal becomes snowy and subject to interference. In contrast, a moderately weak digital signal and a very strong digital signal transmit equal picture quality. Analog television may be [[wireless]] or can be distributed over a cable network using [[cable converter]]s.

All [[broadcast television system]]s used analog signals before the arrival of [[digital television]] (DTV). Motivated by the lower bandwidth requirements of compressed digital signals, since the 2000s a [[digital television transition]] is proceeding in most countries of the world, with different deadlines for cessation of analog broadcasts.

==Development==
{{main article|History of television}}

The earliest systems of analog television were [[mechanical television]] systems, which used spinning disks with patterns of holes punched into the disc to scan an image. A similar disk reconstructed the image at the receiver. Synchronization of the receiver disc rotation was handled through sync pulses broadcast with the image information. However these mechanical systems were slow, the images were dim and flickered severely, and the image resolution very low. Camera systems used similar spinning discs and required intensely bright illumination of the subject for the light detector to work.

Analog television did not really begin as an industry until the development of the [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT), which uses a focused electron beam to trace lines across a [[phosphor]] coated surface. The electron beam could be swept across the screen much faster than any mechanical disc system, allowing for more closely spaced scan lines and much higher image resolution. Also far less maintenance was required of an all-electronic system compared to a spinning disc system. All-electronic systems became popular with households after the [[World War II|Second World War]].

===Standards===
{{Further information|Broadcast television system}}

Broadcasters of analog television encode their signal using different systems.  The official systems of transmission are named: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, K1, L, M and N.  These systems determine the number of scan lines, frame rate, channel width, video bandwidth, video-audio separation, and so on.

The colors in those systems are encoded with one of three color coding schemes: [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/conGlossary.252|title=TV Technology PAL|work=Publication date unknown|publisher=Thinkbox|accessdate=24 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205214352/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/conGlossary.252| archivedate= 5 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then use [[RF modulation]] to modulate this signal onto a [[very high frequency]] (VHF) or [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF) carrier. Each frame of a television image is composed of lines drawn on the screen. The lines are of varying brightness; the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image. The next sequential frame is displayed, allowing the depiction of motion. The analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information, so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal.

The first [[commercial television]] systems were [[black-and-white]]; the beginning of [[color television]] was in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blcolortelevision.htm|title=Color Television History|work=Publication date unknown|publisher=About.com|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A practical television system needs to take [[luma (video)|luminance]], [[chrominance]] (in a color system), synchronization (horizontal and vertical), and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] signals, and broadcast them over a radio transmission. The transmission system must include a means of [[television channel]] selection.

Analog [[broadcast television systems]] come in a variety of frame rates and resolutions. Further differences exist in the frequency and modulation of the audio carrier. The monochrome combinations still existing in the 1950s are standardized by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) as capital letters A through N. When color television was introduced, the hue and saturation information was added to the monochrome signals in a way that black and white televisions ignore. In this way backwards compatibility was achieved. That concept is true for all analog television standards.

There were three standards for the way the additional color information can be encoded and transmitted. The first was the American NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) color television system. The European/Australian PAL (Phase Alternation Line rate) and the French-former Soviet Union SECAM (Séquentiel Couleur Avec Mémoire) standard were developed later and attempt to cure certain defects of the NTSC system. PAL's color encoding is similar to the NTSC systems. SECAM, though, uses a different modulation approach than PAL or NTSC.

In principle, all three color encoding systems can be combined with any scan line/frame rate combination. Therefore, in order to describe a given signal completely, it's necessary to quote the color system and the broadcast standard as a capital letter. For example, the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Korea use NTSC-M (many of these transitioned or transitioning to digital), Japan uses NTSC-J (discontinued in 2012, when Japan transitioned to digital (ISDB)), the UK uses PAL-I (discontinued in 2012, when UK transitioned to digital (DVB-T)), France uses SECAM-L (discontinued in 2011, when France transitioned to digital (DVB-T)), much of Western Europe and Australia use PAL-B/G  (Many of these transitioned or transitioning to DVB-T as digital television standards), most of Eastern Europe uses SECAM-D/K or PAL-D/K and so on.

However, not all of these possible combinations actually exist. NTSC is currently only used with system M, even though there were experiments with NTSC-A (405 line) in the UK and NTSC-N (625 line) in part of South America. PAL is used with a variety of 625-line standards (B,G,D,K,I,N) but also with the North American 525-line standard, accordingly named [[PAL-M]]. Likewise, SECAM is used with a variety of 625-line standards.

For this reason many people refer to any 625/25 type signal as "PAL" and to any 525/30 signal as "NTSC", even when referring to digital signals; for example, on [[DVD-Video]], which does not contain any analog color encoding, and thus no PAL or NTSC signals at all. Even though this usage is common, it is misleading, as that is not the original meaning of the terms PAL/SECAM/NTSC.

Although a number of different broadcast television systems were in use worldwide, the same principles of operation apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.paradiso-design.net/TVsystems_worldwide.html|title=Color subcarrier frequency and TV Standards/TV Systems|work=Publication dates 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 last updated 2005/12/15|publisher=Paradiso Design|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, over-the-air [[broadcast television]] of [[analog audio]] and [[analog video]] signals has been discontinued, to allow the re-use of the television broadcast [[radio spectrum]] for other services such as [[datacasting]] and [[subchannel]]s.

===Displaying an image===
A [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) television displays an image by scanning a beam of [[electrons]] across the screen in a pattern of horizontal lines known as a [[raster scan|raster]]. At the end of each line the beam returns to the start of the next line; the end of the last line is a link that returns to the top of the screen. As it passes each point the intensity of the beam is varied, varying the [[luminance]] of that point. A [[color television]] system is identical except that an additional signal known as [[chrominance]] controls the color of the spot.

Raster scanning is shown in a slightly simplified form below.

[[File:Raster-scan.svg|center]]

When analog television was developed, no affordable technology for storing any video signals existed; the luminance signal has to be generated and transmitted at the same time at which it is displayed on the CRT. It is therefore essential to keep the raster scanning in the camera (or other device for producing the signal) in exact [[synchronization]] with the scanning in the television.

The physics of the CRT require that a finite time interval be allowed for the spot to move back to the start of the next line (''horizontal retrace'') or the start of the screen (''vertical retrace''). The timing of the luminance signal must allow for this.

[[File:TV screen close-up.jpg|thumb|right|Close up image of analog color screen]]

The human eye has a characteristic called [[Phi phenomenon]]. Quickly displaying successive scan images will allow the apparent [[illusion]] of smooth motion. Flickering of the image can be partially solved using a long persistence phosphor coating on the CRT, so that successive images fade slowly. However, slow phosphor has the negative side-effect of causing image smearing and blurring when there is a large amount of rapid on-screen motion occurring.

The maximum [[frame rate]] depends on the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the electronics and the transmission system, and the number of horizontal scan lines in the image. A frame rate of 25 or 30 [[hertz]] is a satisfactory compromise, while the process of [[interlacing]] two [[video field]]s of the picture per [[film frame|frame]] is used to build the image. This process doubles the apparent number of video frames per second and further reduces flicker and other defects in transmission.

===Other types of display screens===
[[Plasma display|Plasma screens]] and [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] screens have been used in analog [[television set]]s. These types of display screens use lower voltages than older CRT displays. Many dual system [[television receiver]]s, equipped to receive both [[analog transmission]]s and [[digital transmission]]s have analog [[tuner (television)|tuner]] receiving capability and must use a [[television antenna]].

==Receiving signals==
The television system for each country will specify a number of television channels within the UHF or VHF frequency ranges. A channel actually consists of two signals: the picture information is transmitted using [[amplitude modulation]] on one frequency, and the sound is transmitted with [[frequency modulation]] at a frequency at a fixed offset (typically 4.5 to 6&amp;nbsp;MHz) from the picture signal.

The channel frequencies chosen represent a compromise between allowing enough [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for video (and hence satisfactory picture resolution), and allowing enough channels to be packed into the available frequency band. In practice a technique called [[vestigial sideband]] is used to reduce the channel spacing, which would be nearly twice the video bandwidth if pure AM was used.

Signal reception is invariably done via a [[superheterodyne receiver]]: the first stage is a ''tuner'' which selects a television channel and frequency-shifts it to a fixed [[intermediate frequency]] (IF). The signal [[amplifier]] performs amplification to the IF stages from the microvolt range to fractions of a volt.

===Extracting the sound===
At this point the IF signal consists of a video [[carrier signal]] at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A [[demodulator]] recovers the video signal. Also at the output of the same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22&amp;nbsp;MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as ''intercarrier sound'', and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the sound [[carrier frequency]] does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.

So the FM sound carrier is then demodulated, amplified, and used to drive a loudspeaker. Until the advent of the [[NICAM]] and [[Multichannel television sound|MTS]] systems, television sound transmissions were invariably monophonic.

===Structure of a video signal===
The video carrier is demodulated to give a [[composite video]] signal; this contains luminance, chrominance and synchronization signals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tek.com/Measurement/App_Notes/25_7075/eng/25W_7075_3.pdf?wt=480&amp;wtwi=2217&amp;wtla=EN&amp;wtty=TI&amp;wtsty=Primer&amp;wtpt=DETAILS&amp;wtlit=25W-7075-3&amp;wtcat=signal+generators&amp;wtti=PAL+Video+Measurements|title=Pal systems&amp;nbsp;– Television measurements|work=Publication date September 1999|publisher=Tektronics Incorporated|accessdate=25 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718081158/http://www.tek.com/Measurement/App_Notes/25_7075/eng/25W_7075_3.pdf?wt=480&amp;wtwi=2217&amp;wtla=EN&amp;wtty=TI&amp;wtsty=Primer&amp;wtpt=DETAILS&amp;wtlit=25W-7075-3&amp;wtcat=signal+generators&amp;wtti=PAL+Video+Measurements|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is identical to the video signal format used by analog video devices such as [[VCRs]] or [[closed-circuit television|CCTV cameras]]. Note that the RF signal modulation is inverted compared to the conventional AM: the minimum video signal level corresponds to maximum carrier amplitude, and vice versa. To ensure good linearity (fidelity), consistent with affordable manufacturing costs of transmitters and receivers, the video carrier is never shut off altogether. When intercarrier sound was invented later in 1948, not completely shutting off the carrier had the side effect of allowing intercarrier sound to be economically implemented.

[[File:Video-line.svg|center|alt=Diagram showing video signal amplitude against time.]]

Each line of the displayed image is transmitted using a signal as shown above. The same basic format (with minor differences mainly related to timing and the encoding of color) is used for PAL, [[NTSC]] and SECAM television systems. A monochrome signal is identical to a color one, with the exception that the elements shown in color in the diagram (the color burst, and the chrominance signal) are not present.

[[File:Videosignal porch.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Portion of a PAL video signal. From left to right: end of a video [[scan line]], front porch, horizontal [[sync pulse]], [[back porch]] with [[color burst]], and beginning of next line]]
The ''front porch'' is a brief (about 1.5 [[microsecond]]) period inserted between the end of each transmitted line of picture and the leading edge of the next line [[sync pulse]]. Its purpose was to allow [[voltage]] levels to stabilise in older televisions, preventing interference between picture lines. The ''front porch'' is the first component of the [[horizontal blanking interval]] which also contains the horizontal sync pulse and the ''back porch''.&lt;ref name="tveng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="analogtv" /&gt;

The ''back porch'' is the portion of each scan line between the end (rising edge) of the horizontal sync pulse and the start of active video. It is used to restore the black level (300 mV) reference in analog video. In signal processing terms, it compensates for the [[fall time]] and [[settling time]] following the sync pulse.&lt;ref name="tveng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="analogtv" /&gt;

In color television systems such as PAL and NTSC, this period also includes the [[colorburst]] signal. In the SECAM system it contains the reference subcarrier for each consecutive color difference signal in order to set the zero-color reference.

In some professional systems, particularly [[satellite link]]s between locations, the audio is embedded within the back porch of the video signal, to save the cost of renting a second channel.

===Monochrome video signal extraction===
The luminance component of a composite video signal varies between 0&amp;nbsp;V and approximately 0.7&amp;nbsp;V above the "black" level. In the NTSC system, there is a ''blanking'' signal level used during the front porch and back porch, and a ''black'' signal level 75&amp;nbsp;mV above it; in PAL and SECAM these are identical.

In a monochrome receiver the luminance signal is amplified to drive the [[control grid]] in the [[electron gun]] of the CRT. This changes the intensity of the electron beam and therefore the brightness of the spot being scanned. Brightness and contrast controls determine the DC shift and amplification, respectively.

===Color video signal extraction===
[[File:Burnt-in timecode.jpg|thumb|right|Color bar generator test signal]]
A color signal conveys picture information for each of the red, green, and blue components of an image (see the article on [[color space]] for more information). However, these are not simply transmitted as three separate signals, because: such a signal would not be compatible with monochrome receivers (an important consideration when color broadcasting was first introduced). It would also occupy three times the bandwidth of existing television, requiring a decrease in the number of television channels available. Furthermore, typical problems with signal transmission (such as differing received signal levels between different colors) would produce unpleasant side effects.

Instead, the RGB signals are converted into [[YUV]] form, where the Y signal represents the lightness and darkness (luminance) of the colors in the image. Because the rendering of colors in this way is the goal of both black and white (monochrome) film and black and white (monochrome) television systems, the Y signal is ideal for transmission as the luminance signal. This ensures a monochrome receiver will display a correct picture in black and white, where a given color is reproduced by a shade of gray that correctly reflects how light or dark the original color is.

The U and V signals are "color difference" signals. The U signal is the difference between the B signal and the Y signal, also known as B minus Y (B-Y), and the V signal is the difference between the R signal and the Y signal, also known as R minus Y (R-Y). The U signal then represents how "purplish-blue" or its complementary color "yellowish-green" the color is, and the V signal how "purplish-red" or its complementary "greenish-cyan" it is. The advantage of this scheme is that the U and V signals are zero when the picture has no color content. Since the human eye is more sensitive to errors in luminance than in color, the U and V signals can be transmitted in a relatively [[lossy compression|lossy]] (specifically: bandwidth-limited) way with acceptable results.

In the receiver, a single demodulator can extract an additive combination of U plus V. An example is the X demodulator used in the X/Z demodulation system. In that same system, a second demodulator, the Z demodulator, also extracts an additive combination of U plus V, but in a different ratio. The X and Z color difference signals are further matrixed into three color difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y). The combinations of usually two, but sometimes three demodulators were:

{{ordered list
| list-style-type=lower-alpha
| (I) / (Q), (as used in the 1954 RCA CTC-2 and the 1985 RCA "Colortrak" series, and the 1954 Arvin, and some professional color monitors in the 1990s),
| (R-Y) / (Q), as used in the 1955 RCA 21 inch color receiver,
| (R-Y) / (B-Y), used in the first color receiver on the market (Westinghouse, not RCA),
| (R-Y) / (G-Y), (as used in the RCA Victor CTC-4 chassis),
| (R-Y) / (B-Y) / (G-Y),
| (X) / (Z), as used in many receivers of the late '50s and throughout the '60s.
}}

In the end, further matrixing of the above color-difference signals c through f yielded the three color-difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y).

The R,G,B signals in the receiver needed for the display device (CRT, Plasma display or LCD display) are electronically derived by matrixing as follows: R is the additive combination of (R-Y) with Y, G is the additive combination of (G-Y) with Y, and B is the additive combination of (B-Y) with Y. All of this is accomplished electronically. It can be seen that in the combining process, the low resolution portion of the Y signals cancel out, leaving R,G, and B signals able to render a low-resolution image in full color. However, the higher resolution portions of the Y signals do not cancel out, and so are equally present in R, G, and B, producing the higher definition (higher resolution) image detail in monochrome, although it appears to the human eye as a full-color and full resolution picture.

[[File:Waveform monitor.jpg|thumb|left|Color signals mixed with video signal (two horizontal lines in sequence)]]

In the NTSC and PAL color systems, U and V are transmitted by using [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] of a subcarrier. This kind of modulation applies two independent signals to one subcarrier, with the idea that both signals will be recovered independently at the receive end. Before transmission, the subcarrier itself, is removed from the active (visible) portion of the video, and moved, in the form of a burst, to the horizontal blanking portion, which is not directly visible on screen. (More about the burst below.)

For NTSC, the subcarrier is a 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz sine wave. For the PAL system it is a 4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz sine wave. After the above-mentioned quadrature amplitude modulation of the subcarrier, subcarrier sidebands are produced, and the subcarrier itself is filtered out of the visible portion of the video, since it is the subcarrier sidebands that carry all of the U and V information, and the subcarrier itself carries no information.

The resulting subcarrier sidebands is also known as "chroma" or "chrominance". Physically, this chrominance signal is a 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz(NTSC) or 4.43&amp;nbsp;MHz(PAL) sine wave which, in response to changing U and V values, changes phase as compared to the subcarrier, and also changes amplitude.

As it turns out, the chroma amplitude (when considered together with the Y signal) represents the approximate saturation of a color, and the chroma phase against the subcarrier as reference, approximately represents the hue of the color. For particular test colors found in the test color bar pattern, exact amplitudes and phases are sometimes defined for test and trouble shooting purposes only.

Although, in response to changing U and V values, the chroma sinewave changes phase with respect to the subcarrier, it's not correct to say that the subcarrier is simply "phase modulated". That is because a single sine wave U test signal with QAM produces only one pair of sidebands, whereas real phase modulation under the same test conditions would produce multiple sets of sidebands occupying more frequency spectrum.

In NTSC, the chrominance sine wave has the same average frequency as the subcarrier frequency. But a spectrum analyzer instrument shows that, for transmitted chrominance, the frequency component at the subcarrier frequency is actually zero energy, verifying that the subcarrier was indeed removed before transmission.

These sideband frequencies are within the luminance signal band, which is why they are called "subcarrier" sidebands instead of simply "carrier" sidebands. Their exact frequencies were chosen such that (for NTSC), they are midway between two harmonics of the frame repetition rate, thus ensuring that the majority of the power of the luminance signal does not overlap with the power of the chrominance signal.

In the British PAL (D) system, the actual chrominance center frequency, with equal lower and upper sidebands, is 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz, a direct multiple of the scan rate frequency. This frequency was chosen to minimize the chrominance beat interference pattern that would be visible in areas of high color saturation in the transmitted picture.

At certain times, the chrominance signal represents only the U signal, and 70 nanoseconds (NTSC) later, the chrominance signal represents only the V signal. (This is the nature of the quadrature amplitude modulation process that created the chrominance signal.) About 70 nanoseconds later still, -U, and another 70 nanoseconds, -V.

So to extract U, a synchronous demodulator is utilized, which uses the subcarrier to briefly gate (sample) the chroma every 280 nanoseconds, so that the output is only a train of discrete pulses, each having an amplitude that is the same as the original U signal at the corresponding time. In effect, these pulses are discrete-time analog samples of the U signal. The pulses are then low-pass filtered so that the original analog continuous-time U signal is recovered. For V, a 90 degree shifted subcarrier briefly gates the chroma signal every 280 nanoseconds, and the rest of the process is identical to that used for the U signal.

Gating at any other time than those times mentioned above will yield an additive mixture of any two of U, V, -U, or -V. One of these "off-axis" (that is, off the U and V axis) gating methods is called I/Q demodulation. Another much more popular "off-axis" scheme was the X/Z demodulation system. Further matrixing recovered the original U and V signals. This scheme was actually the most popular demodulator scheme throughout the 60's.

The above process uses the subcarrier. But as previously mentioned, it was deleted before transmission, and only the chroma is transmitted. Therefore, the receiver must reconstitute the subcarrier. For this purpose, a short burst of subcarrier, known as the color burst, is transmitted during the back porch (re-trace blanking period) of each scan line. A subcarrier oscillator in the receiver locks onto this signal (see phase-locked loop) to achieve a phase reference, resulting in the oscillator producing the reconstituted subcarrier.

(A second use of the burst in more expensive or newer receiver models is a reference to an AGC system to compensate for chroma gain imperfections in reception.)
[[File:Hanoverbars without PAL delay.png|thumb|right|[[Test card]] showing "[[Hanover bars]]" (color banding phase effect) in Pal S (simple) signal mode of transmission.]]

NTSC uses this process unmodified. Unfortunately, this often results in poor color reproduction due to phase errors in the received signal, caused sometimes by multipath, but mostly by poor implementation at the studio end. With the advent of solid state receivers, cable TV, and digital studio equipment for conversion to an over-the-air analog signal, these NTSC problems have been largely fixed, leaving operator error at the studio end as the sole color rendition weakness of the NTSC system. In any case, the PAL D (delay) system mostly corrects these kind of errors by reversing the phase of the signal on each successive line, and the averaging the results over pairs of lines. This process is achieved by the use of a 1H (where H = horizontal scan frequency) duration delay line. (A typical circuit used with this device converts the low frequency color signal to [[ultrasound]] and back again). Phase shift errors between successive lines are therefore cancelled out and the wanted signal amplitude is increased when the two in-phase ([[coincident]]) signals are re-combined.

NTSC is more spectrum efficient than PAL, giving more picture detail for a given bandwidth. This is because sophisticated comb filters in receivers are more effective with NTSC's 4 field color phase cadence compared to PAL's 8 field cadence. However, in the end, the larger channel width of most PAL systems in Europe still give their PAL systems the edge in transmitting more picture detail.

In the [[SECAM]] television system, U and V are transmitted on ''alternate'' lines, using simple [[frequency modulation]] of two different color subcarriers.

In some analog color CRT displays, starting in 1956, the brightness control signal ([[luminance]]) is fed to the [[cathode]] connections of the electron guns, and the color difference signals ([[chrominance]] signals) are fed to the control grids connections. This simple CRT matrix mixing technique was replaced in later [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] designs of signal processing with the original matrixing method used in the 1954 and 1955 color TV receivers.

==Synchronization==
Synchronizing pulses added to the video signal at the end of every [[scan line]] and video frame ensure that the sweep oscillators in the receiver remain locked in step with the transmitted signal, so that the image can be reconstructed on the receiver screen.&lt;ref name="tveng"&gt;

A ''sync separator'' circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync. (see section below&amp;nbsp;– Other technical information, for extra detail.)

===Horizontal synchronization===
The horizontal synchronization pulse (''horizontal sync'', or ''HSync''), separates the [[scan line]]s. The horizontal sync signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. The rest of the scan line follows, with the signal ranging from 0.3&amp;nbsp;V (black) to 1&amp;nbsp;V (white), until the next horizontal or [[#Vertical_synchronization|vertical synchronization pulse]].

The format of the horizontal sync pulse varies. In the 525-line [[NTSC]] system it is a 4.85&amp;nbsp;[[microsecond|µs]]-long pulse at 0&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]]. In the 625-line [[PAL]] system the pulse is 4.7&amp;nbsp;µs synchronization pulse at 0&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]] . This is lower than the amplitude of any video signal (''blacker than black'') so it can be detected by the level-sensitive "sync stripper" circuit of the receiver.

===Vertical synchronization===
{{For|the graphic option provided by video games|Frame rate|Refresh rate}}
Vertical synchronization (also called vertical sync or VSync) separates the video fields. In PAL and NTSC, the vertical sync pulse occurs within the [[vertical blanking interval]]. The vertical sync pulses are made by prolonging the length of HSYNC pulses through almost the entire length of the scan line.

The ''vertical sync'' signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).

The format of such a signal in 525-line [[NTSC]] is:
* pre-equalizing pulses (6 to start scanning odd lines, 5 to start scanning even lines)
* long-sync pulses (5 pulses)
* post-equalizing pulses (5 to start scanning odd lines, 4 to start scanning even lines)

Each pre- or post- equalizing pulse consists in half a [[scan line]] of black signal: 2&amp;nbsp;µs at 0&amp;nbsp;V, followed by 30&amp;nbsp;µs at 0.3&amp;nbsp;V.

Each long sync pulse consists in an equalizing pulse with timings inverted: 30&amp;nbsp;µs at 0&amp;nbsp;V, followed by 2&amp;nbsp;µs at 0.3&amp;nbsp;V.

In video production and computer graphics, changes to the image are often kept in step with the vertical synchronization pulse to avoid visible discontinuity of the image. Since the [[frame buffer]] of a [[computer graphics]] display imitates the dynamics of a cathode-ray display, if it is updated with a new image while the image is being transmitted to the display, the display shows a mishmash of both frames, producing a [[page tearing]] [[digital artifact|artifact]] partway down the image.

Vertical synchronization eliminates this by timing frame buffer fills to coincide with the [[vertical blanking interval]], thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as video games and [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the vertical blanking interval. This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. [[Triple buffering]] reduces this latency significantly.

Two timing intervals are defined&amp;nbsp;– the ''front porch'' between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the ''back porch'' after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the ''horizontal blanking'' (or ''retrace'') ''interval'' and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.

===Horizontal hold and vertical hold===
The lack of precision timing components in early television receivers meant that the timebase circuits occasionally needed manual adjustment.
If their free-run frequencies were too far from the actual line and field rates, the circuits would not be able to follow the incoming sync signals.
Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.

The adjustment took the form of ''horizontal hold'' and ''vertical hold'' controls, usually on the front panel along with other common controls. These adjusted the free-run frequencies of the corresponding timebase oscillators.

By the early 1980s the efficacy of the synchronization circuits, plus the inherent stability of the sets' oscillators, had been improved to the point where these controls were no longer necessary.

===Components of a television system===
A typical analog monochrome [[television receiver]] is based around the block diagram shown below:

[[File:TV-block-diagram.svg|center|alt=block diagram of a television receiver showing tuner, intermediate frequency amplifier. A demodulator separates sound from video. Video is directed to the CRT and to the synchronizing circuits.]]

===Sync separator===

Image synchronization is achieved by transmitting negative-going pulses; in a composite video signal of 1 volt amplitude, these are approximately 0.3&amp;nbsp;V below the "[[black level]]". The ''horizontal sync'' signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. Two timing intervals are defined&amp;nbsp;– the ''front porch'' between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the ''back porch'' after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the ''horizontal blanking'' (or ''retrace'') ''interval'' and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.

The ''vertical sync'' signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).

In the television receiver, a ''sync separator'' circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync.

Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.

Counting sync pulses, a [[video line selector]] picks a selected line from a TV signal, used for [[teletext]], [[on-screen display]]s, [[station identification]] logos as well as in the industry when cameras were used as a sensor.

===Timebase circuits===
{{Further information|Oscilloscope}}
In an analog receiver with a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display sync pulses are fed to horizontal and vertical ''timebase'' circuits (commonly called "sweep circuits" in the United States), each consisting of an oscillator and an amplifier. These generate modified [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] and [[parabola]] current waveforms to scan the electron beam in a [[linear]] way. The waveform shapes are necessary to make up for the distance variations from the electron beam source and the screen surface. The oscillators are designed to free-run at frequencies very close to the field and line rates, but the sync pulses cause them to reset at the beginning of each scan line or field, resulting in the necessary synchronization of the beam sweep with the originating signal. The output waveforms from the timebase amplifiers are fed to the horizontal and vertical ''deflection coils'' wrapped around the CRT tube. These coils produce [[magnetic field]]s proportional to the changing current, and these deflect the electron beam across the screen.

In the 1950s, the power for these circuits was derived directly from the mains supply.
A simple circuit consisted of a [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] voltage dropper [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and a [[rectifier]] [[valve]] ([[Vacuum tube|tube]]) or [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]. This avoided the cost of a large high voltage mains supply (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) [[transformer]]. This type of circuit was used for thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) technology. It was inefficient and produced a lot of heat which led to premature failures in the circuitry.

In the 1960s, [[semiconductor]] technology was introduced into timebase circuits. During the late 1960s in the UK, [[Synchronization (alternating current)|synchronous]] (with the scan line rate) power generation was introduced into [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] receiver designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldtellys.co.uk/otpsupps.html|title=TACKLING THE POWER SUPPLY|work=Publication date&amp;nbsp;– unknown|publisher=Old Tellys.co.uk|accessdate=24 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303043022/http://www.oldtellys.co.uk/otpsupps.html|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These had very complex circuits in which faults were difficult to trace, but had very efficient use of power.

In the early 1970s [[Alternating current|AC]] mains (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), and line timebase (15,625&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[thyristor]] based switching circuits were introduced. In the UK use of the simple (50&amp;nbsp;Hz) types of power circuits were discontinued. The reason for design changes arose from the electricity supply contamination problems arising from [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkemc.co.uk/conferences/emcYork2003/potm/2004-01_SMPS-and-SELC.pdf|title=An Investigation Into the EMC Emissions From Switched Mode Power Supplies and Similar Switched Electronic Load Contollers Operating at Various Loading Conditions&amp;nbsp;– Page 2,line 3|work=Publication date&amp;nbsp;– January 2001|publisher=York EMC.co.uk|accessdate=24 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315084947/http://www.yorkemc.co.uk/conferences/emcYork2003/potm/2004-01_SMPS-and-SELC.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supply loading issues due to energy being taken from only the positive half cycle of the mains supply waveform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkemc.co.uk/conferences/emcYork2003/potm/2004-01_SMPS-and-SELC.pdf|title=Review of Primary Frequency Control Requirements on the GB Power System Against a Background of Increase in Renewable Generation&amp;nbsp;– Impact of railway electrification systems on other electrical systems and civil infrastructures within and outside the railway environment.-section 3.2,page 15|work=October 2006|publisher=Bura.Brunel.ac.uk|accessdate=24 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315084947/http://www.yorkemc.co.uk/conferences/emcYork2003/potm/2004-01_SMPS-and-SELC.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CRT flyback power supply===
{{Further information|High voltage}}
{{See also|Power supply}}
Most of the receiver's circuitry (at least in [[transistor]]- or [[integrated circuit|IC]]-based designs) operates from a comparatively low-voltage [[direct-current|DC]] power supply. However, the [[anode]] connection for a [[cathode-ray tube]] requires a very high voltage (typically 10–30&amp;nbsp;kV) for correct operation.

This voltage is not directly produced by the main [[power supply]] circuitry; instead the receiver makes use of the circuitry used for horizontal scanning. [[Direct current]] (DC), is switched though the line output transformer, and [[alternating current]] (AC) is induced into the scan coils. At the end of each horizontal scan line the [[magnetic field]], which has built up in both transformer and scan coils by the current, is a source of latent electromagnetic energy. This stored collapsing magnetic field energy can be captured. The reverse flow, short duration, (about 10% of the line scan time) current from both the line output transformer and the horizontal scan coil is discharged again into the [[transformer|primary winding]] of the [[flyback transformer]] by the use of a rectifier which blocks this negative reverse [[electromotive force|emf]]. A small value [[capacitor]] is connected across the scan switching device. This tunes the circuit [[inductance]]s to [[resonate]] at a much higher [[frequency]]. This slows down (lengthens) the flyback time from the extremely rapid decay rate that would result if they were electrically isolated during this short period. One of the secondary windings on the flyback transformer then feeds this brief high voltage pulse to a [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]] design [[voltage multiplier]]. This produces the required [[extra high tension|EHT]] supply. A [[flyback converter]] is a power supply circuit operating on similar principles.

A typical modern design incorporates the flyback transformer and rectifier circuitry into a single unit with a captive output lead, (known as a diode split line output transformer or an Integrated High Voltage Transformer (IHVT)),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miniwatt.info/mullard_tn77.pdf|title=Technical note 77&amp;nbsp;– Diode Split for E.H.T. generation|work=Publication date&amp;nbsp;– 1976|publisher=Mullard|accessdate=24 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224854/http://www.miniwatt.info/mullard_tn77.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all high-voltage parts are enclosed. Earlier designs used a separate line output transformer and a well insulated high voltage multiplier unit. The high frequency (15&amp;nbsp;kHz or so) of the horizontal scanning allows reasonably small components to be used.

==Transition to digital==
{{main article|Digital television transition|Digital television}}

The first country to make a wholesale [[digital television transition|switch]] to digital over-the-air (terrestrial television) broadcasting was Luxembourg in 2006, followed later in 2006 by the Netherlands; in 2007 by Finland, Andorra, Sweden and Switzerland; in 2008 by Belgium (Flanders) and Germany; in 2009 by the United States (high power stations), southern Canada, the Isle of Man, Norway, and Denmark. In 2010, Belgium (Wallonia), Spain, Wales, Latvia, Estonia, the Channel Islands, San Marino, Croatia and Slovenia; in 2011 Israel, Austria, Monaco, Cyprus, Japan (excluding [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], and [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] prefectures), Malta and France; in 2012 the Czech Republic, Arab World, Taiwan, Portugal, Japan (including Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima prefectures), Serbia, Italy, Canada, Mauritius, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Gibraltar, and South Korea; in 2013, the Republic of Macedonia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Australia, and New Zealand, completed the transition. The United Kingdom made the transition to digital television between 2008 and 2012, with the exception of [[Barrow-in-Furness]], which made the switch over in 2007. The first digital TV-only area in the United Kingdom was Ferryside in [[Carmarthenshire]].

The [[Digital television transition in the United States]] for high-powered transmission was completed on 12 June 2009, the date that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) set.  Almost two million households could no longer watch television because they had not prepared for the transition.  The switchover had been delayed by the [[DTV Delay Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephanie Condon

Class A low-power stations were required to convert to digital by 21 September 2015 and all others were required to convert to digital before 13 July 2021. In broadcasting, whatever happens in the United States also influences southern Canada and northern Mexico because those areas are covered by television stations in the U.S.

In Japan, the switch to digital began in northeastern [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] on 24 July 2010 and ended in 43 of the country's 47 prefectures (including the rest of Ishikawa) on 24 July 2011, but in [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], and [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] prefectures, the conversion was delayed to 31 March 2012, due to complications from the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|its related nuclear accidents]]. 

In Canada, most of the larger cities turned off analog broadcasts on 31 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/bdt14.htm

China is scheduled to end analog broadcasting between 2015 and 2018, due to the large size of the country.

Brazil switched to digital television on 2 December 2007 in its major cities. It is now estimated that Brazil will end analog broadcasting in 2023.

In Malaysia, the Malaysian Communications &amp; Multimedia Commission (MCMC) advertised for tender bids to be submitted in the third quarter of 2009 for the 470 through 742&amp;nbsp;MHz [[UHF]] allocation, to enable Malaysia's broadcast system to move into DTV. The new [[broadcast band]] allocation would result in Malaysia's having to build an infrastructure for all broadcasters, using a single [[Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial transmission]]/television broadcast (DTTB) channel.{{fact|date=November 2017}} Large portions of Malaysia are covered by television broadcasts from Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and Indonesia (from Borneo and Batam).

In Singapore, digital television under DVB-T2 began on 16 December 2013. The switchover has been delayed many times until 31 December 2018.

In the Philippines, the [[National Telecommunications Commission]] required all broadcasting companies to end analog broadcasting on December 31, 2015 at 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. Due to delay of the release of the implementing rules and regulations for digital television broadcast, the target date was moved to 2020. Full digital broadcast is expected in 2021.

'''Autometric Inc.''' was a company spun out of [[Paramount Pictures]] to work with early [[satellite imagery]].

Early successes at Autometric included the invention of the [[Chromatron]] which was subsequently sold to Sony and used prior to developing the [[Trinitron]].

The company created [[image analysis]] products for representing imagery of the earth, cataloging, and [[image analysis]]. Autometric developed early orthophotographic hardware and methodology. The company was acquired by Raytheon and transitioned its product focus to military and intelligence projects. It was called Autometric Operation of Raytheon. In a few years, Autometric split off from Raytheon becoming independent. After a series of management blunders and near bankruptcies, Boeing Inc. purchased the company at the end of 2000 as part of the Future Imagery Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/02/business/fi-36490 Boeing Agrees to Acquire Autometric]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-to-acquire-autometric Boeing to acquire Autometric Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Future Imagery Architecture became the most spectacular and expensive failure in the 50-year history of American spy satellite projects. Since the F.I.A. debacle, the National Reconnaissance Office has banned Boeing from bidding on new spy satellite contracts. Autometric's nominally successful products, before they were shelved by Boeing, included Wings Mission Rehearsal, Edge Whole Earth, Spatial Query Server and DataMaster. Due to high turnover, most of the technology made its way to Google and other companies in the form of disgruntled technical talent.

Wings and Edge were direct predecessors to Google Earth.  Bob Cowling, the Director of Product Engineering at Autometric, was the primary developer of Wings. Wings was a mission rehearsal product draping imagery over terrain.  With advances learned from that experience, Bob built a globe which led to the formation of Edge Whole Earth.  Edge was used to develop graphics for National Geographic, CBS Evening News, and the motion picture "Shadow Conspiracy."

The success of Edge led to several smaller spin offs, including [[Edge Development Option]].  Many of the engineers working on [[Edge Development Option]], went to work for [[Keyhole, Inc.]] helping to create what is now [[Google Earth]].

'''Ayrton shunt''' or '''universal shunt''' is a high-resistance [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] used in [[galvanometer]]s to increase their range{{sfn|Basic Electrical Engg: Prin &amp; Appl|2009|p=826}} without changing the [[damping]].{{sfn|Graf|1999|p=50}}
The circuit is named after its inventor [[William E. Ayrton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ayrton%20shunt|title=Ayrton shunt|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multirange [[ammeters]] that use this technique are more accurate than those using a make-before-break switch.{{sfn|Herman|2013|p=201}} Also it will eliminate the possibility of having a meter without a shunt which is a serious concern in make-before-break switches.{{sfn|Bakshi|Bakshi|2009|p=3-41}}

The selector switch changes the amount of resistance in parallel with R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (meter resistance). The voltage drop across parallel branches is always equal. When all resistances are placed in parallel with R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; maximum sensitivity of ammeter is reached.{{sfn|Bakshi|Bakshi|2009|p=3-41}}

Ayrton shunt is rarely used for currents above 10 [[amperes]].{{sfn|Herman|2010|p=276}}

A '''barn raising''', also historically called a '''raising bee''' or '''rearing''' in the U.K., is a collective action of a community, in which a [[Barn (building)|barn]] for one of the members is built or rebuilt collectively by members of the community. Barn raising was particularly common in 18th- and 19th-century rural [[North America]]. A barn was a necessary structure for any farmer, for example for storage of cereals and hay and keeping of animals. Yet a barn was also a large and costly structure, the assembly of which required more labor than a typical family could provide. Barn raising addressed the need by enlisting members of the community, unpaid, to assist in the building of their neighbors' barns. Because each member was entitled to recruit others for help, the favor would eventually return to each participant.

The tradition of "barn raising" continues, more or less unchanged, in some [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite|Old Order Mennonite]] communities, particularly in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Pennsylvania]], and some rural parts of [[Canada]]. The practice continues outside of these religious communities, albeit less frequently than in the 19th century. Most frames today are raised using a crane and small crew.

== Description ==
[[Image:Barn raising in Lansing.jpg|left|thumb|A barn raising north of [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]] in the 20th century]]
A large amount of preparation is done before the one to two days a barn raising requires. Lumber and hardware are laid in, plans are made, ground is cleared, and tradesmen are hired.  Materials are purchased or traded for by the family who will own the barn once it is complete.

Generally, participation is mandatory for community members. These participants are not paid. All able-bodied members of the community are expected to attend. Failure to attend a barn raising without the best of reasons leads to [[censure]] within the community. Some specialists brought in from other communities for direction or joinery may be paid, however.

One or more people with prior experience or with specific skills are chosen to lead the project. Older people who have participated in many barn raisings are crew chiefs. On the whole, the affair is well organized. At most barn raisings, the community members have raised barns before and approach the task with experience both in the individual tasks and the necessary organization. Young people participating physically for the first time have watched many barn raisings and know what is expected of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|periodical=Common Ground|publisher=CG Publications|issue=Summer 2008|title=Up from the ashes|author=Gib and Joyce Yoder|ISSN=1059-664X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only certain specialists are permitted to work on the more critical jobs, such as the joinery and dowling of the beams. ([[Post and beam construction]] is the traditional method of construction in barn raisings.) There is competition for these jobs, and they are sought after. Workers are differentiated by age and gender: men construct the barn, women provide water and food, the youngest children watch, and older boys are assigned to fetch parts and tools.

Most barn raisings were accomplished in June and July when the mostly agrarian society members had time between planting season and harvest season. Timber for the framing was mostly produced in the winter by the farmer and his crew hewing logs to the correct shape with axes or felling the trees and bringing them to a sawmill.

An ancient tradition is to place a bough, wreath and/or flag at the high point of the frame after the last piece is in place. This celebration is called [[topping out]] and historically the master carpenter may also make a speech and a toast.

== Social framework ==
In earlier American rural life, communities raised barns because many hands were required.  In areas that were sparsely settled or on the edge of the frontier, it was not possible to hire carpenters or other tradesmen to build a barn. The harsher winters gave more urgency to the matter of barn construction than was present in the relatively milder climate in much of Europe. Similar conditions have given rise to similar institutions, such as the Finnish one of '[[talkoot]]'.

Barn raisings occurred in a social framework with a good deal of interdependence.  Members of rural communities often shared family bonds going back generations. They traded with each other, buying and selling land, labor, seed, cattle, and the like. They worshipped and celebrated together, because cities were too far away to visit with any frequency by horse and wagon. Despite traditions of independence, self-sufficiency, and refusal to incur debt to one another, community barn raisings were a part of life.

== Contrast with church construction ==
[[Church (building)|Churches]] were considered as important to communities of the 18th and 19th centuries as barns.  In like fashion, they were often constructed using unpaid community labor.  There were important differences.  Churches were not constructed with the same degree of urgency, and were most often built of native stone in some regions — a more durable material than the wood of which barns were made, and more time-consuming to lay.  Barns, once completed, belonged to an individual family, while churches belonged to the community.

== Decline ==
Barn raising as a method of providing construction labor had become rare by the close of the 19th century.  By that time, most frontier communities already had barns and those that did not were constructing them using hired labor.  Mennonite and Amish communities carried on the tradition, however, and continue to do so to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|periodical=Common Ground|publisher=CG Publications|issue=Summer 2008|title=From the ground and up|author=Ruth Dunmire|ISSN=1059-664X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group construction by volunteers enjoyed something of a resurgence during the 1970s, when houses, sheds, and barn-shaped structures were constructed for a variety of purposes. Echoes of the tradition can still be found in other community building projects, such as house building and renovation carried out by [[Habitat for Humanity]].

The earliest camcorders were tape-based, recording [[analog signal]]s onto videotape cassettes. In 2006, digital recording became the norm, with tape replaced by storage media such as mini-HD, microDVD, internal [[flash memory]] and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s.&lt;ref name="camcorderinfo1"&gt;http://www.camcorderinfo.com/2011-CES-Camcorders.htm{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent devices capable of recording video are [[camera phone]]s and [[digital camera]]s primarily intended for still pictures; the term "camcorder" may be used to describe a portable, self-contained device, with video capture and recording its primary function, often having advanced functions over more common cameras.

== History ==
[[File:Sony SL-F1 camera.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.10|alt=Large video camera outdoors on tripod|Prior to the camcorder, a portable recorder and camera would be required.

[[File:Sony Betamovie BMC-100P.jpg|thumb|Sony Betamovie BMC-100P is the first consumer camcorder.  Released in 1983 for the Betamax format. It has no playback functionality and is only capable of recording]] [[Professional video camera|Video cameras]] originally designed for [[television]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]] were large and heavy, mounted on special pedestals and wired to remote recorders in separate rooms. As technology improved, [[Filming location|out-of-studio]] video recording was possible with compact video cameras and portable [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]]; a detachable recording unit could be carried to a shooting location. Although the camera itself was compact, the need for a separate recorder made on-location shooting a two-person job.&lt;ref name="totalrewind2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.totalrewind.org/cameras/C_SFP3.htm | title = Separate camera and recorder; First VHS-C camcorder | accessdate = 2007-09-14 | date = 2007-09-14 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081016045848/http://www.totalrewind.org/cameras/C_SFP3.htm | archivedate = 2008-10-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized [[videocassette recorder]]s were introduced by [[JVC]] ([[VHS]]) and [[Sony]] ([[U-matic]], with [[Betamax]]) releasing a model for mobile work. Portable recorders meant that recorded video footage could be aired on the early-evening news, since it was no longer necessary to develop film.

In 1983, Sony released the first camcorder, the [[Betacam]] system, for professional use.&lt;ref name="michigan"&gt;David Buckingham, Rebekah Willett, Maria Pini (2011), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KA13kssIGmEC&amp;pg=PA9 ''Home Truths? Video Production and Domestic Life'', page 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510233339/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KA13kssIGmEC&amp;pg=PA9 |date=2018-05-10 }}, [[University of Michigan Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; A key component was a single camera-recorder unit, eliminating a cable between the camera and recorder and increasing the camera operator's freedom. The Betacam used the same cassette format ({{convert|0.5|in|cm|1|disp=or}} tape) as the Betamax, but with a different, incompatible recording format. It became standard equipment for [[News media#Broadcasting|broadcast news]].&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt;

Sony released the first consumer camcorder in 1983, the [[Betamovie]] BMC-100P.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt; It used a Betamax cassette and rested on the operator's shoulder, due to a design not permitting a single-handed grip. That year, JVC released the first [[VHS-C]] camcorder.&lt;ref name="totalrewind2007"/&gt; Kodak announced a new camcorder format in 1984, the [[8 mm video format]].&lt;ref&gt;Amit Dhir (2004), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dswWzEZuMRQC&amp;pg=PA263 ''The Digital Consumer Technology Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to Devices, Standards, Future Directions, and Programmable Logic Solutions'', page 263] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407054405/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dswWzEZuMRQC&amp;pg=PA263 |date=2018-04-07 }}, [[Elsevier]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sony introduced its compact 8 mm [[Video8]] format in 1985. That year, [[Panasonic M5|Panasonic]], [[RCA]] and [[Hitachi]] began producing camcorders using a full-size VHS cassette with a three-hour capacity. These shoulder-mount camcorders were used by [[videophile]]s, industrial [[videographer]]s and college TV studios. Full-size Super-VHS (S-VHS) camcorders were released in 1987, providing an inexpensive way to collect news segments or other [[Videography|videographies]]. Sony upgraded Video8, releasing the Hi8 in competition with S-VHS.

Digital technology emerged with the Sony [[D1 (Sony)|D1]], a device which recorded [[Uncompressed video|uncompressed]] data and required a large amount of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] for its time. In 1992 [[Ampex]] introduced [[DCT (videocassette format)|DCT]], the first digital video format with [[data compression]] using the [[discrete cosine transform]] algorithm present in most commercial digital video formats. In 1995 Sony, JVC, Panasonic and other video-camera manufacturers launched [[DV]], which became a ''[[de facto]]'' standard for home video production, independent filmmaking and [[citizen journalism]]. That year, [[Ikegami Tsushinki|Ikegami]] introduced [[Editcam]] (the first tapeless video recording system).

Camcorders using DVD media were popular at the turn of the 21st century due to the convenience of being able to drop a disc into the family [[DVD player]]; however, DVD capability, due to the limitations of the format, is largely limited to consumer-level equipment targeted at people who are not likely to spend any great amount of effort [[video editing]] their video footage.
{{Clear}}
===High definition (HD)===

Panasonic launched DVCPRO HD in 2000, expanding the DV [[Video codec|codec]] to support high definition (HD). The format was intended for professional camcorders, and used full-size DVCPRO cassettes. In 2003 Sony, JVC, Canon and Sharp introduced [[HDV]] as the first affordable HD video format, due to its use of inexpensive [[MiniDV#Magnetic tape|MiniDV cassettes]].

===Tapeless===

Sony introduced the [[XDCAM]] tapeless video format in 2003, introducing the [[Professional Disc|Professional Disc (PFD)]]. Panasonic followed in 2004 with its [[P2 (storage media)|P2]] [[Solid-state drive|solid state]] [[memory card]]s as a recording medium for DVCPRO-HD video. In 2006 Panasonic and Sony introduced [[AVCHD]] as an inexpensive, tapeless, high-definition video format. AVCHD camcorders are produced by Sony, Panasonic, Canon, JVC and Hitachi. 

===3D===

In 2010, after the success of [[James Cameron]]'s 2009 [[3D film]] ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', full 1080p HD [[3D camcorder]]s entered the market. With the proliferation of [[Computer file|file]]-based digital formats, the relationship between [[Data storage device|recording media]] and recording format has declined; video can be recorded onto different media. With tapeless formats, recording media are storage for digital files.
[[File:JVC KYD291.JPG|thumb|250px|alt=TV-quality camcorder in a room|Professional-grade digital camcorder]]

In 2011 Panasonic released a camcorder capable of shooting in [[3D film|3D]], the HDC-SDT750. It is a 2D camcorder which can shoot in HD; 3D is achieved by a detachable conversion lens. Sony released a 3D camcorder, the HDR-TD10. The Sony's 3D lens is built in, but it can shoot 2D video. Panasonic has also released 2D camcorders with an optional 3D conversion lens. The HDC-SD90, HDC-SD900, HDC-TM900 and HDC-HS900 are sold as "3D-ready": 2D camcorders, with optional 3D capability at a later date.

===4K Ultra HD===

In CES (January) 2014, Sony announced the first consumer/low-end professional ("[[prosumer]]") camcorder Sony FDR-AX100 with a 1" 20.9MP sensor able to shoot 4K video in 3840x2160 pixels 30fps or 24fps in the [[XAVC|XAVC-S]] format; in standard HD the camcorder can also deliver 60fps. When using the traditional format AVCHD, the camcorder supports 5.1 surround sound from its built-in microphone, this is however not supported in the XAVC-S format. The camera also has a 3-step ND filter switch for maintaining a shallow depth of field or a softer appearance to motion. For one hour video shooting in 4K the camera needs about 32 GB to accommodate a data transfer rate of 50 Mbit/s. The camera's MSRP in the US is USD $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/camcorders/1304812/sony-fdr-ax100-review-hands-on-with-first-consumer-4k-camcorder |title=Sony FDR-AX100 review - Hands on with first consumer 4K camcorder |author=Seth Barton |date=January 9, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113015242/http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/camcorders/1304812/sony-fdr-ax100-review-hands-on-with-first-consumer-4k-camcorder |archivedate=January 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014 [[Sony]] released the FDR-AX100 which represents the next generation of camcorders. It is capable of shooting in 4K resolution. It currently has a price tag of £1,699 and 4K camcorders are not expected to come into the mainstream market for at least another eight to ten years as most current Blu-ray players are not capable of playing 4K video. Virtually all mainstream TVs are not 4K ready either with the only 4K TVs available being very expensive at £2,500 or over. The only means of archiving 4K video is the 100 GB [[Blu-ray Disc]] XL but the discs are very expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/handycam-camcorders/fdr-ax100e|accessdate=March 17, 2014|title=4K Camcorder - Portable Video Camera - FDR-AX100 - Sony UK|publisher=Sony UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317204103/http://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/handycam-camcorders/fdr-ax100e|archivedate=March 17, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2015, consumer UHD (3840x2160) camcorders below USD $1000 have become available. Sony released the FDRAX33, and Panasonic has released the HC-WX970K and the HC-VX870.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

In September 2014 Panasonic announced and claimed 4K Ultra HD Camcorder HC-X1000E as the first conventional camcorder design that can capture up to 60fps at 150 Mbit/s or alternatively standard HD recording at up to 200 Mbit/s in ALL-I mode with MP4, MOV and AVCHD formats all offered depending on the resolution and frame rate. With use 1/2.3" small sensor as commonly is used by [[bridge camera]]s, the camcorder has 20x optical zoom in a compact body with dual XLR audio inputs, Internal ND filters and separate control rings for focus, iris and zoom. In HD capture, the camcorder get benefit to reduce noises of small sensor by in-camera downscaling of the 4K image to HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsshooter.com/2014/09/03/bh-give-first-look-at-panasonic-hc-x1000-4k-camcorder/ |title=B+H give first look at Panasonic HC-X1000 4K Camcorder |author=Dan Chung |accessdate=December 27, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227181631/http://www.newsshooter.com/2014/09/03/bh-give-first-look-at-panasonic-hc-x1000-4k-camcorder/ |archivedate=December 27, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2017, the only major manufacturer to announce new consumer camcorders at CES ([[Consumer Electronic Show]]) in Las Vegas was [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] with its entry-level HD models. [[Panasonic]] only announced details regarding their Mirrorless [[Micro Four Thirds]] Digital Camera called the LUMIX GH5, capable of shooting 4K in 60p. This is the first time in decades that Panasonic &amp; Sony haven't announced new traditional camcorders at CES, &amp; instead carried over 2016's models, such as Sony's FDR-AX53. This is due to there being far less demand in the market for traditional camcorders as more &amp; more consumers prefer to record video with their 4K-capable [[smartphones]], [[DSLR]]s, and [[action camera]]s from [[GoPro]], [[Xiaomi]], [[Sony]], [[Nikon]], and many others.

== {{anchor|Overview}}Components ==
Camcorders have three major components: lens, imager and recorder. The lens gathers light, focusing it on the imager.  The imager (usually a  [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS sensor]]; earlier models used [[vidicon]] tubes) converts incident light into an electrical signal. The recorder converts the electrical signal to video, encoding it in a storable form. The lens and imager comprise the "camera" section.

=== Lens ===
The lens is the first component of the light path. Camcorder optics generally have one or more of the following controls:
* [[Aperture]] (or iris): Regulates [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] and controls [[depth of field]]
* [[Zoom lens|Zoom]]: Controls [[focal length]] and [[angle of view]]
* [[Shutter speed]]: Regulates exposure to maintain desired motion portrayal
* [[Gain (electronics)|Gain]]: [[Amplifier|Amplifies]] signal strength in low-light conditions
* [[Neutral density filter]]: Regulates exposure intensity

In consumer units these adjustments are often automatically controlled by the camcorder, but can be adjusted manually if desired. Professional-grade units offer user control of all major optical functions.

=== Imager ===
The imager converts light into an electrical signal. The camera lens projects an image onto the imager surface, exposing the photosensitive array to light. This light exposure is converted into an electrical charge. At the end of the timed exposure, the imager converts the accumulated charge into a continuous analog voltage at the imager's output terminals. After the conversion is complete, the photosites reset to start the exposure of the next video frame.

=== Recorder ===
The recorder writes the video signal onto a recording medium, such as magnetic videotape. Since the record function involves many signal-processing steps, some distortion and noise historically appeared on the stored video; playback of the stored signal did not have the exact characteristics and detail as a live video feed. All camcorders have a recorder-controlling section, allowing the user to switch the recorder into playback mode for reviewing recorded footage, and an image-control section controlling exposure, focus and [[color balance]].

The image recorded need not be limited to what appeared in the viewfinder. For documenting events (as in law enforcement), the field of view overlays the time and date of the recording along the top and bottom of the image.

Camcorders are often classified by their [[Data storage device|storage device]]; [[VHS]], [[VHS-C]], [[Betamax]], [[Video8]] are examples of late 20th century [[videotape]]-based camcorders which record video in [[analog (signal)|analog]] form. [[Digital video]] camcorder formats include [[Digital8]], [[MiniDV]], [[DVD]], [[hard disk drive]], [[direct to disk recording]] and solid-state, semiconductor [[flash memory]]. While all these formats record video in [[Digital data|digital]] form, Digital8, MiniDV, DVD and hard-disk drives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camcorderinfo.com/News/Sony-reveals-Spring-Handycam-lineup-including-CX760V-XR260V-and-CX190.htm|title=Sony reveals Spring Handycam lineup, including CX760V, XR260V, and CX190|last1=Snow|first1=Christopher|date=January 9, 2012|website=Reviewed.com Camcorders|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have no longer been manufactured in consumer camcorders since 2006.

In the earliest analog camcorders the imaging device is [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] technology, in which the charge of a light-sensitive target was directly proportional to the amount of light striking it; the [[Vidicon]] is an example of such an imaging tube. Newer analog, and digital camcorders use a solid-state [[charge-coupled device|charge-coupled]] imaging device (CCD) or a [[CMOS imager]]. Both are analog detectors, using photodiodes to pass a current proportional to the light striking them. The current is then digitised before being electronically [[Image scanner|scanned]] and fed to the imager's output. The main difference between the two devices is how the scanning is done. In the CCD the diodes are sampled simultaneously, and the scan passes the digitised data from one register to the next. In CMOS devices, the diodes are sampled directly by the scanning logic.

Digital video storage retains higher-quality video than analog storage, especially on the prosumer and strictly consumer levels. [[MiniDV]] storage allows full-resolution video (720x576 for [[PAL]], 720x480 for [[NTSC]]), unlike analog consumer-video standards. Digital video does not experience [[color bleeding (computer graphics)|colour bleeding]], jitter, or fade.

Unlike analog formats, digital formats do not experience [[generation loss]] during [[Dubbing (transferring)|dubbing]]; however, they are more prone to complete loss. Although digital information can theoretically be stored indefinitely without deterioration, some digital formats (like [[MiniDV]]) place tracks only about 10 [[micrometers]] apart (compared with 19–58 μm for [[VHS]]). A digital recording is more vulnerable to wrinkles or stretches in the tape which could erase data, but [[Video tracking|tracking]] and error-correction code on the tape compensates for most defects. On analog media, similar damage registers as "noise" in the video, leaving a deteriorated (but watchable) video. DVDs may develop [[Disc rot|DVD rot]], losing large chunks of data. An analog recording may be "usable" after its storage media deteriorates severely, but&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videointerchange.com/tape.htm#Videotape%20Life%20Expectancy|title=Videotape Life Expectancy|website=Video Tape Discussion|accessdate=October 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130205161529/http://www.videointerchange.com/tape.htm#Videotape%20Life%20Expectancy|archivedate=February 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; slight media degradation in digital recordings may trigger an "all or nothing" failure; the digital recording will be unplayable without extensive restoration.

=== {{anchor|Modern recording media}}Recording media ===
Older digital camcorders record video onto tape digitally, [[microdrive]]s, hard drives, and small [[DVD-RAM]] or [[DVD-R]]s. Newer machines since 2006 record video onto [[flash memory]] devices and internal [[solid-state drive]]s in [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]] or [[MPEG-4]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camcorderinfo.com/News/Sony-Launches-Six-New-Entry-Level-Camcorders-for-2013.htm|title=Sony Launches Six New Entry-Level Camcorders for 2013|last1=McCabe|first1=Liam F.|date=January 7, 2013|website=Reviewed.com Camcorders|accessdate=October 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these [[codec]]s use [[Inter frame|inter-frame]] compression, frame-specific editing requires frame regeneration, additional processing and may lose picture information. Codecs storing each frame individually, easing frame-specific scene editing, are common in professional use.

Other digital consumer camcorders record in [[DV]] or [[HDV]] format on tape, transferring content over [[FireWire]] or [[USB 2.0]] to a computer where large files (for DV, 1GB for 4 to 4.6 minutes in [[PAL]]/[[NTSC]] resolutions) can be [[non-linear editing system|edited]], converted and recorded back to tape. The transfer is done in [[Real-time computing|real time]], so the transfer of a 60-minute tape requires one hour to transfer and about 13GB of disk space for the raw footage (plus space for [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] files and other media).

==== Tapeless ====
A '''tapeless camcorder''' is a [[camcorder]] that does not use [[video tape]] for the [[digital recording]] of [[video production]]s as 20th century ones did. Tapeless camcorders record video as digital [[computer file]]s onto [[data storage device]]s such as [[optical disc]]s, [[hard disk drive]]s and solid-state [[flash memory]] cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=David|title=Beware the tapeless camcorder|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/technology/20iht-20pogue.7578238.html?%2360;!--Undefined%20dynamic%20function%20data_sanitationlib::sanitize_string:1%20called--=&amp;%2362;=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=September 20, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129083508/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/technology/20iht-20pogue.7578238.html?%2360;!--Undefined%20dynamic%20function%20data_sanitationlib::sanitize_string:1%20called--=&amp;%2362;=&amp;pagewanted=all|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inexpensive [[pocket video camera]]s use flash [[memory card]]s, while some more expensive camcorders use [[solid-state drive]]s or SSD; similar flash technology is used on semi-pro and high-end [[professional video camera]]s for ultrafast transfer of [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) content.

Most consumer-level tapeless camcorders use [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]] or its derivatives as [[video coding]] formats.  They are normally capable of still-image capture to [[JPEG]] format additionally.

Consumer-grade tapeless camcorders include a [[USB]] port to transfer video onto a computer. Professional models include other options like [[Serial digital interface]] (SDI) or [[HDMI]]. Some tapeless camcorders are equipped with a [[Firewire]] (IEEE-1394) port to ensure compatibility with [[magnetic tape]]-based [[DV]] and [[HDV]] formats.

=== Consumer market ===
Since the consumer market favors ease of use, portability and price, most consumer-grade camcorders emphasize handling and automation over audio and video performance. Most devices with camcorder capability are [[camera phone]]s or [[compact digital camera]]s, in which video is a secondary capability. Some pocket cameras, mobile phones and camcorders are shock-, dust- and waterproof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=4777&amp;review=kodak+playsport+zx5 |title=Kodak PlaySport Zx5 Review |date=July 19, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117113606/http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=4777&amp;review=kodak+playsport+zx5 |archivedate=January 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This market has followed an evolutionary path driven by miniaturization and cost reduction enabled by progress in design and manufacture. Miniaturization reduces the imager's ability to gather light; designers have balanced improvements in sensor sensitivity with size reduction, shrinking the camera imager and optics while maintaining relatively noise-free video in daylight. Indoor or dim-light shooting is generally noisy, and in such conditions artificial lighting is recommended. Mechanical controls cannot shrink below a certain size, and manual camera operation has given way to camera-controlled automation for every shooting parameter (including focus, aperture, shutter speed and color balance). The few models with manual override are menu-driven. Outputs include USB 2.0, Composite and S-Video and IEEE 1394/Firewire (for MiniDV models).

The high end of the consumer market emphasizes user control and advanced shooting modes. More-expensive consumer camcorders offer manual exposure control, HDMI output and external audio input, progressive-scan [[frame rate]]s (24fps, 25fps, 30fps) and higher-quality lenses than basic models. To maximize low-light capability, color reproduction and frame resolution, multi-CCD/CMOS camcorders mimic the 3-element imager design of professional equipment. Field tests have shown that most consumer camcorders (regardless of price) produce noisy video in low light.

Before the 21st century, [[video editing]] required two recorders and a [[desktop video]] workstation to control them. A typical home [[personal computer]] can hold several hours of standard-definition video, and is fast enough to edit footage without additional upgrades. Most consumer camcorders are sold with basic [[video editing software]], so users can create their own DVDs or share edited footage online.

Since 2006, nearly all camcorders sold are digital. Tape-based (MiniDV/HDV) camcorders are no longer popular, since tapeless models (with an SD card or internal SSD) cost almost the same but offer greater convenience; video captured on an SD card can be transferred to a computer faster than digital tape. None of the consumer-class camcorders announced at the 2006 International [[Consumer Electronics Show]] recorded on tape.&lt;ref name="camcorderinfo1"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Other devices with video-capture capability}}Other devices ===
Video-capture capability is not confined to camcorders. [[Mobile phone|Cellphones]], [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital single-lens reflex]] and compact [[Digital camera|digicams]], [[laptops]] and personal media players offer video-capture capability, but most multipurpose devices offer less video-capture functionality than an equivalent camcorder. Most lack manual adjustments, audio input, [[autofocus]] and zoom. Few capture in standard TV-video formats (480p60, 720p60, 1080i30), recording in either non-TV resolutions (320x240, 640x480) or slower frame rates (15 or 30 fps).

A multipurpose device used as a camcorder offers inferior handling, audio and video performance, which limits its utility for extended or adverse shooting situations. The [[camera phone]] developed video capability during the early 21st century, reducing sales of low-end camcorders.

DSLR cameras with [[high-definition video]] were also introduced early in the 21st century. Although they still have the handling and usability deficiencies of other multipurpose devices, [[HDSLR]] video offers the shallow [[depth-of-field]] and [[interchangeable lens]]es lacking in consumer camcorders. [[Professional video camera]]s with these capabilities are more expensive than the most expensive video-capable DSLR. In video applications where the DSLR's operational deficiencies can be mitigated, DSLRs such as the [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II|Canon 5D Mark II]] provide depth-of-field and optical-perspective control.

Combo-cameras combine full-feature still cameras and camcorders in a single unit. The Sanyo [[Xacti]] HD1 was the first such unit, combining the features of a 5.1 megapixel still camera with a 720p video recorder with improved handling and utility. Canon and Sony have introduced camcorders with still-photo performance approaching that of a digicam, and Panasonic has introduced a DSLR body with video features approaching that of a camcorder. [[Hitachi]] has introduced the DZHV 584E/EW, with 1080p resolution and a touch screen.

===Flip Video===
{{Main|Flip Video|Flip Video Mino}}
The Flip Video was a series of tapeless camcorders introduced by Pure Digital Technologies in 2006. Slightly larger than a [[smartphone]], the Flip Video was a basic camcorder with record, zoom, playback and browse buttons and a USB jack for uploading video. The original models recorded at a 640x480-pixel resolution; later models featured HD recording at 1280x720 pixels. The Mino was a smaller Flip Video, with the same features as the standard model. The Mino was the smallest of all camcorders, slightly wider than a [[MiniDV]] cassette and smaller than most smartphones on the market. In fact the Mino was small enough to fit inside the shell of a [[VHS]] cassette. Later HD models featured larger screens. In 2011, the Flip Video (more recently manufactured by Cisco) was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-20053337-266.html|title=Why Cisco killed the Flip mini camcorder|last1=Reardon|first1=Marguerite|date=April 13, 2011|website=CNET|accessdate=October 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025175749/http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-20053337-266.html|archivedate=October 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Camcorder with built-in projector}}Built-in projector===
In 2011, [[Sony]] launched its HDR-PJ range of HD camcorders: the HDR-PJ10, 30 and 50. Known as Handycams, they were the first camcorders to incorporate a small [[image projector]] on the side of the unit. This feature allows a group of viewers to watch video without a television, a full-size projector or a computer. These camcorders were a huge success and Sony subsequently released further models in this range. Sony's current 2014 line up comprises the HDR-PJ240, HDR-PJ330 (entry level models), HDR-PJ530 (mid-range model) and the HDR-PJ810 (top of the range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/1237482618998 |title=Handycam HD camcorder with built in projector: Sony |date=November 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405141910/http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/1237482618998 |archivedate=April 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifications vary by model.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/handycam-camcorders/features/projector-camcorders  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117060739/http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/handycam-camcorders/features/projector-camcorders |date=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Media ===
[[File:Sony BVW-D600P Betacam SP.jpg|thumb|Professional TV camcorder (90's era)]]
[[File:Camcorder in use - SA.jpg|thumb|alt=Small camcorder being operated with one hand|Operating a Panasonic VDRM70 DVD camcorder with one hand]]
Camcorders are used by nearly all electronic media, from electronic-news organizations to current-affairs TV productions. In remote locations, camcorders are useful for initial video acquisition; the video is subsequently transmitted electronically to a studio or production center for broadcast. Scheduled events (such as press conferences), where a video infrastructure is readily available or can be deployed in advance, are still covered by studio-type video cameras "tethered" to production trucks.

=== Home video ===
Camcorders often cover weddings, birthdays, graduations, children's growth and other personal events. The rise of the consumer camcorder during the mid- to late 1980s led to the creation of TV shows such as ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', which showcases homemade video footage.

=== Politics ===
Political [[protest]]ers use camcorders to film what they believe unjust. [[Animal rights]] protesters who break into [[factory farming|factory farms]] and [[animal testing]] labs use camcorders to film the conditions in which the animals are living. Anti-hunting protesters film [[fox hunting|fox hunts]]. People investigating political crimes use [[surveillance]] cameras for evidence-gathering. Activist videos often appear on [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]].

[[Police]] use camcorders to film [[riot]]s, protests and crowds at sporting events. The film can be used to spot troublemakers, who can then be prosecuted. In countries such as the [[United States]], the use of compact [[dashcam]]s in police cars allows the police to retain a record of activity in front of the car (such as interaction with a stopped motorist).

=== {{anchor|Entertainment and movies}}Entertainment ===
Camcorders are used in the production of low-budget TV shows if the production crew does not have access to more expensive equipment. Movies have been shot entirely on consumer camcorder equipment (such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity (film series)|Paranormal Activity]]''). Academic filmmaking programs have also switched from [[16mm]] film to digital video in early 2010s, due to the reduced expense and ease of editing of digital media and the increasing scarcity of film stock and equipment. Some camcorder manufacturers cater to this market; [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Panasonic]] support [[24p]] (24 fps, progressive scan—the same frame rate as cinema film) video in some high-end models for easy film conversion.

=== Education ===
Schools in the developed world increasingly use [[digital media]] and [[digital education]]. Students use camcorders to record video diaries, make short films and develop [[multi-media]] projects across subject boundaries. Teacher evaluation involves a teacher's classroom lessons being recorded for review by officials, especially for questions of teacher [[tenure]].

Student camcorder-created material and other [[digital technology]] are used in new-teacher preparation courses. The  [[University of Oxford]] Department of Education [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] programme and [[NYU]]'s [[Steinhardt School]]'s Department of Teaching and Learning MAT programme are examples.

The [[USC Rossier School of Education]] goes further, insisting that all students purchase their own camcorder (or similar) as a prerequisite to their MAT education programs (many of which are delivered online). These programs employ a modified version of [[Adobe Connect]] to deliver the courses. Recordings of MAT student work are posted on USC's [[web portal]] for evaluation by [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] as if they were present in class. Camcorders have allowed USC to decentralize its teacher preparation from [[Southern California]] to most American states and abroad; this has increased the number of teachers it can train.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1143">The '''Canadian Telework Association''' ('''CTA''') is an organization promoting [[telework]] and [[telecommuting]] in [[Canada]]. It was founded in 1997, and since then, it has grown to include over 1000 members, most of which are individuals, corporations, and academic institutions. The association does not accept funding or donations and does not charge fees for membership.

The founder of this association has since retired and the websites have been closed.

[[File:Clifton nanolitre osmometer setup.jpg|right|thumb|''Clifton nanolitre osmometer setup'']] A '''Clifton nanolitre osmometer''' is a device that allows the determination of the [[melting point|melting]] and [[freezing point]] of an [[aqueous]] [[solution]] using a sample size of only nanolitres. The device consists of a controller box, a cooling stage, and a sample holder. Additionally, various [[micrometer syringes]], [[immersion oil]]s and [[microscope]]s are required for its use.

Cooling of the stage is achieved with the use of [[Thermoelectric effect|Peltier devices]] inside the cooling stage.

The Clifton nanolitre [[osmometer]] is especially well suited for determining the [[antifreeze activity]] or [[thermal hysteresis]] of a solution, which is a difference in the melting and freezing point of a solution. This phenomenon arises when biological [[antifreeze protein]]s are present in a solution. Solutions that do not contain [[antifreeze protein]]s generally have identical freezing and melting points.

==Operation==
[[File:Clifton nanolitre osmometer cooling stage.jpg|right|thumb|''The cooling stage'']]
A melting and freezing point determination consists of the following steps:
* '''Calibration'''
** The device should be calibrated with solutions of known [[osmolarity]], typically a 2-point calibration is used.

[[File:Close-up of a Clifton nanolitre osmometer sample holder.jpg|right|thumb|''The sample holder with 7 "wells"'']]
* '''Loading'''
** Each of the wells in the sample holder are filled with a "heavy" immersion oil.
** A small amount (generally 1-2nL) of solution is [[pipette]]d or blown into the oil in the wells using a [[micrometer syringe]] or a pulled capillary tube.
* '''Deep Freeze'''
** The stage is cooled to a temperature of around -40 degrees [[Celsius]] (-40&amp;nbsp;°F) very quickly (~20 seconds), which causes the samples in the sample wells to flash-freeze.

[[File:Close-up of a Clifton nanolitre osmometer controller showing the controls and readout.jpg|right|thumb|''The Clifton controls and readout'']]
* '''Determinations'''
** The samples are allowed to melt relatively slowly, under the control of the osmometer controller. The temperature of the sample ([[solution]]) at the point when the last ice crystal disappears is called the '''[[melting point]]'''
** The samples are refrozen using the '''deep freeze''', and once again melted towards a single ice crystal. When only a single, very small ice crystal remains the samples are cooled in a controlled manner using the nanoliter control box. The temperature of the solution at the point when the ice crystal grows is called the '''[[freezing point]]'''.

==Uses for the Clifton nanolitre osmometer==
[[Image:Scientist using Clifton osmometer.JPG|right|thumb|''A [[scientist]] using the Clifton'']]
* Determination of the [[osmolarity]] (saltiness) of very small volumes of aqueous solutions
** Tears
** Biological samples
** Plant fluids
* Determination of the [[antifreeze activity]] or [[thermal hysteresis]] in a solution.
** Fluids from polar fishes.
** Fluids from overwintering insects.
** Fluids from cold-hardy plants
** Any fluid that contains [[antifreeze protein]]s

'''Comité Européen des groupements de constructeurs du machinisme agricole''' (CEMA aisbl) is the European association representing the [[agricultural machinery industry]] in Europe.

==Introduction==
It was established during the first General Assembly in London on 10 July 1959.&lt;ref name="Einhundert Jahre für die Landtechnik-Industrie"&gt;, Dr. Friedhelm Meier, Einhundert Jahre für die Landtechnik-Industrie, Landtechnik-Vereinigung, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The secretariat was then based in Paris and stayed there until it moved to Brussels in 2006. This was mainly done to be closer to European decision-making. In Brussels it has currently an office near the European Quartier.&lt;ref name="CEMA website"&gt;[http://www.cema-agri.org], CEMA website.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation is listed in the Transparency Register of the European Commission.&lt;ref name="CEMA in Transparency Register"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=489575310490-58], CEMA in Transparency Register.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CEMA - the voice of the Agricultural Machinery Industry in Europe==
The main activities of CEMA consist of providing advice and services to the national member associations on various relevant topics for the [[agricultural machinery industry]]. Examples of those topics are tractor type approval, harmonisation of road requirements and engine emissions. Furthermore, it provides a common European industry view on those topics. The interests of the agricultural machinery industry are defended and promoted towards the European Institutions.
Several events are organised by CEMA. E.g. every other year CEMA organises a two-day summit in Brussels in corporation with CECE, the Committee for European Construction Equipment.  The last Summit in 2013 was held under the theme: "Towards a competitive industrial production for Europe".&lt;ref name="CEMA CECE summit"&gt;[http://www.cece-cema-summit.eu], CEMA CECE summit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
CEMA is a network of national organisations that come together every year with industry at the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="CEMA website" /&gt; Every other year, the CEMA Board is elected and that Board chooses a Technical Board. Specific technical topics are dealt with in Project Teams (PTs) consisting of representatives of national associations and industry. The coordination and contact with other organisations is mainly taken care of by the Secretariat in Brussels. The current president of CEMA is Richard Markwell.&lt;ref name="CEMA website" /&gt;

[[Image:Cottonelle.jpg|thumb|Cottonelle toilet paper]]
'''Cottonelle''' is a brand of [[toilet paper]] produced by [[Kimberly-Clark]]. The company has made several different toilet paper types such as regular, Cottonelle Double, (Two-ply) Cottonelle Ultra, Cottonelle Aloe &amp; E, Cottonelle Kids, and Cottonelle Extra Strength, and are currently sold in the United States and Australia under the [[Kleenex]] brand.

Cottonelle's mascot was originally a woman. At the time, the commercials usually consisted of how soft the roll was by showing a cotton ball and comparing it to the product itself.

In early 2008, Cottonelle devised an extensive advertising campaign featuring a large "Comfort Haven Bus" decorated to resemble a dog. According to Ad Rants, the bus would travel cross-country to "offer visitors access to "relaxation stations" where people can see first-hand—and hopefully in privacy—how soft and comforting Cottonelle can be."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Durst, Leigh [http://www.mpdailyfix.com/2008/04/cottonelle_on_crack_literally.html Cottonelle On Crack (Literally!)] MarketingProfs Daily Fix (April 16, 2008). Retrieved on 2-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Cottonelle featured a program called Puppy Points. On a package of Cottonelle toilet paper would be a label with a certain amount of points. The label had to be cut off and saved. The Cottonelle website, showed a list of Cottonelle related items that you could receive in exchange for puppy points, including a Cottonelle bath robe, a Cottonelle picture frame, hand bag, slippers, etc. On July 31, 2008, puppy points were discontinued and could no longer be redeemed for merchandise.

Cottonelle is marketed as [[Andrex]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KIMBERLY-CLARK+COMBINES+BRANDS+TO+CREATE+KLEENEX+COTTONELLE+BATHROOM...-a018037211|title=Kimberly-Clark Combines Brands to Create Kleenex Cottonelle Bathroom Tissue|publisher=The Free Library|accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cottonelle was introduced in Canada shortly after its 1972 introduction in the United States. Due to corporate changes in Canada, during 2004 [[Scott Paper Limited]] (which became [[Kruger Products]]) transitioned the highly recognisable Canadian branding to the new name of Cashmere.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rukavina, ''ruk.ca'', January 16, 2006, "[http://ruk.ca/content/annals-us-brands-canada]", October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Did You Know Gaming?''''' (abbreviated '''DYKG'''&lt;ref name="gamingbolt"/&gt;) is a [[video game]]–focused [[blog]] which launched in May 2012. The site features video content focusing on video game related trivia and facts,&lt;ref name="gamingbolt"/&gt; hosted on video game entertainment website NormalBoots.com, covering various franchises.&lt;ref name="screwattack nb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.screwattack.com/news/normalboots-returns |title=NormalBoots Returns! |publisher=[[ScrewAttack]] |author=caboose_-1 |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2014-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129022449/http://www.screwattack.com/news/normalboots-returns |archivedate=2014-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''Did You Know Gaming?'' opened a second channel, called '''''DidYouKnowGaming? 2'''''.

==History==
The site launched on May 14, 2012, by Shane Gill who came up with the idea for a trivia focused website based on gaming after being inspired by a number of [[Facebook]] trivia groups. By July 2012, the official Facebook page had reached nearly 20,000 fans in under eight weeks.&lt;ref name="gamingbolt"/&gt; As of November 2018, the official YouTube channel has currently over 2,200,000 subscribers and over 440 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DYKGaming/about|title=Did You Know Gaming? – About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[YouTube]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2014, Did You Know Gaming partnered with a relaunched ''Normal Boots'', a collaborative website for hosting gaming themed content created by [[Jon Jafari]] and Austin Hargrave. A spin-off series' has also been created on the channel "The Film Theorists" called ''Did You Know Movies''.&lt;ref name="screwattack nb"/&gt;

On July 7, 2017, Did You Know Gaming? announced a new channel, featuring content created by Dazz, creator of The VG Resource websites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spriters-resource.com/about/|title=About Us - The Spriters Resource|website=www.spriters-resource.com|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Region Locked series, alongside Greg who also works on Region Locked. The channel features a more off-the-cuff style primarily focused around providing additional content to compliment the main channel. The channel hosted its own version of two of the channels main shows, "Did You Know Gaming? Extra" and "Region Locked Light".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeCFik7Bl4JeEKHveT1cR1A|title=DidYouKnowGaming? 2|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2017, the second channel has over 160,000 subscribers and more than 7.3 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeCFik7Bl4JeEKHveT1cR1A/about|title=Did You Know Gaming? 2 - About|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 2017, they announced that Region Locked Light would be cancelled and that Did You Know Gaming? Extra would be moved to the main channel. They, as of the date, had almost no plans for the channel. One of their ideas was using the channel to promote smaller trivia and gaming channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyXvX5dXhDw&amp;t=14s|title=Important Announcement - Did You Know Gaming extra|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14663">The '''Engineering, Science, and Management War Training''' program ('''ESMWT''') was one of the largest and most productive educational activities in America's history. It was perhaps only second to the [[G.I. Bill]] (officially the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944) in its scope and productivity.

Sometimes referred to as an "experiment in streamlined higher education", this government-sponsored program provided, without charge, college-grade courses for large numbers of Americans to fill urgently needed technical and scientific civilian positions just prior to and during World War II. College-grade was officially defined as "work of an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students."

With successive designations of Engineering Defense Training (EDT), Engineering, Science, and Management Defense Training (ESMDT), and ESMWT, the program was operated by the U.S. Office of Education from October 1940 through June 1945, with 227 colleges and universities providing about 68,000 courses for close to 1,800,000 students at a total cost of some $60 million ($940 million today's dollars).&lt;ref&gt;Cardozier, V. R.; ''Colleges and Universities in World War II,'' Praeger Publishers, 1993, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In mid-1940, before America officially entered World War II, it was brought to the attention of [[U.S. Congress]] that the civilian effort supporting the expected conflict would require far more engineers than were then available or could be produced through normal programs at colleges and universities. As part of the budget preparation, Congress tasked [[John W. Studebaker]], then [[U.S. Commissioner of Education]] and head of the [[Office of Education]] (predecessor of the [[United States Department of Education]]), to develop a program to help alleviate this crisis.

Studebaker asked Andrey A. Potter, Dean of Engineering at [[Purdue University]], to assist in developing this program and in  preparing a proposal to Congress.  A National Advisory Committee – composed of academic leaders and industry officials – first met on September 20–21, 1940. On October 9, a bill authoring the Engineering Defense Training (EDT) program with initial funding of $9 million (equivalent to $138 million in 2008) was passed by Congress and quickly signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

The bill authorized the Office of Education to contract with engineering schools throughout the U.S. to offer "intensive courses of college grade, designed to meet the shortage of engineers in activities essential to national defense."  Roy A. Seaton, Dean of Engineering at [[Kansas State College]], was appointed to direct the program.  Twenty-two regional advisors, each a prominent engineering educator, served without pay as coordinators. 

Courses under the EDT program began on December 9, 1940.  During the remainder of the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1941, about 120,800 individuals enrolled in 2,260 courses offered by 144 institutions.  

In July 1941, the Labor-Federal Security Appropriations Act, authorized the addition of chemistry, physics, and production-related courses to form an integrated ESMDT program. Funding was increased to $17.5 million ($270 million equivalent in 2008), and Dean George W. Case from the University of New Hampshire, replaced Seaton as the program director. During the next year, enrollment increased to nearly 450,000 men and women in about 7,800 courses offered by 196 colleges and universities. 

After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] (December 7, 1941) and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, the War-Time Commission was formed within the Department of Education to be responsible for this and other special training activities. The program was again renamed, becoming ESMWT, and continued as such through June 1945.  The annual enrollment in ESMWT averaged nearly 600,000 in some 13,000 courses.  Ultimately, 215 colleges and universities participated, with the offerings given in more than 1,000 towns and cities.

==Courses and academic credit==

The primary objective of the program was to prepare persons for professional positions in defense activities. The authorization required the courses to be of "an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students", distinguishing them from offerings of trade or technical schools. They were limited to engineering, physics, chemistry, and management subjects directly needed in defense activities

It is noted that many of the ESMWT courses, although of "college grade" at that time, might not be recognized as such in engineering and science programs today. At most colleges and universities in the early 1940s, engineering education greatly emphasized practical applications as opposed to theoretical analysis. It was somewhat the same in many undergraduate physics and chemistry programs.

Although there might be progressively higher-level courses in a subject, each ESMWT course was to be complete in itself and designed to convey some stated, applicable knowledge set. While prerequisites were listed for courses, these were mainly to indicate the background needed to understand the subject matter, and the pursuit of a course was not limited to persons having these prerequisites.

The participating colleges and universities were fully responsible for determining the local needs and developing courses to meet these needs. The relationship of these courses to the regular courses in a degree program was also under the responsibility of the offering institution.

Regular faculty members taught most of the courses. Although requiring considerable preparation, this was welcome work for most professors; between the draft and volunteering, college enrollment was a small fraction of normal. Some courses required instructors to have a highly specialized knowledge, and practitioners from industry were then used.

The matter of granting academic course credit for the special courses was an issue from the beginning. The Office of Education recommended against academic credit, reasioning that since the courses were paid by the government, this might "constitute a Federal subsidy to the participating college", a forbidden practice in that day. It was recommended, however, that knowledge of a subject gained through these courses be recognized, by examination or otherwise, for students in regular college programs, allowing them to excused from that subject, with or without credit.  

The Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), then the accrediting body for engineering programs and predecessor of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET), also had reservations concerning academic credit. Following much debate, it was left to each school to make any credit-related decisions and, in the end, most decided against directly granting academic credit, primarily citing the imbalance of applications over theory in most ESMWT courses.

After being prepared by the offering institution, course outlines, schedules, and other information were submitted to the ESMWT Washington staff for approval, and the cognizant school was required to permanently maintain the same type of records on presented courses as those kept in regular academic programs.

==Students and recognition==

By law, admission to ESMWT courses was open to students without regard to age, sex, or race. With this, and without enforcement of prerequisites, there was a great diversity of students in the various offerings. It was not uncommon to find students in their early teens using the ESMWT program to accelerate their entry into engineering and science jobs. On the other end of the age spectrum, many of the students were in mid-life, preparing for a change of work field or refreshing their earlier education.

Perhaps the greatest diversity was in the number of female students. Prior to the 1940s, there were few women working in industry science and even less in engineering. The entry of women into defense jobs is well known through "[[Rosie the Riveter]]", but those in wartime engineering and related work are not often recognized; however, thousands entered professional work after being prepared through this program.

Under the initial EDT, women constituted less than 1 percent. With the addition of science and management courses, there were about 9 percent under ESMDT. After the start of the war and ESMWT, the numbers participating in the program increased to 22 percent. Many engineering schools that had earlier been all-male, first accepted women when they began the program. Conversely, a number of previously female colleges – including [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Skidmore College]], and [[Wellesley College]] – participated in the program and had their first male students. (Some of these schools later reverted to all-female).

Throughout the program, about 75 percent of the enrollments were in engineering subjects. After a series of courses in a particular subject area, many of the students, especially those having an earlier background in science and/or mathematics, were placed in regular engineering positions with industry or government agencies. These were sometimes referred to as "instant engineers." A 1950 survey of practicing engineers found that there were many more than the sum of those in 1940 plus those graduating from engineering colleges in the 1940-50 decade; much of this difference was attributed to persons who gained this classification through the ESMWT program.

Many schools considered graduation from ESMWT courses to have great significance. As an example, at [[North Carolina State University]] the Chancellor often personally awarded certificates to the graduates. 
 
The Office of Education requirements were that students of any race would be admitted to ESMDT courses. Unfortunately, African-Americans were not well represented either in the participating institutions or as students. [[Howard University]] did have a relatively large program for the District of Columbia area; this was led by Herman R. Branson of the Physics Department who had a distinguished post-war career in academia.

==Noteworthy offerings==

From June 23 to August 29, 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2010-12-04| title=Mauchly Papers at Penn Library | url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/mauchly/img/course.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; electrical engineering student [[J. Presper Eckert]] assisted in teaching a 10-week ESMDT course in electronics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]]. The course had 30 students, 16 of whom held Ph.D. degrees. Among the students was [[John W. Mauchly]]. Eckert and Mauchly then teamed in developing the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer ([[ENIAC]]), America's first large-scale digital computer.

Courses in industrial chemistry and metallurgy were in great demand. Harry J. Sweeney, then Chief Metallurgist for the giant [[Republic Steel]], stated, "I don’t know what we would have done without the ESMDT courses; about 75 percent of our new professionals were trained through this program."

Aircraft played a vital role in World War II. During 1940, [[Cornell University]] started courses in aircraft structures and stress analysis at [[Buffalo, New York]], for [[Bell Aircraft]] and [[Curtis Wright]]. One of these, starting December 9, was the first EDT-sponsored course in the U.S. By the end of the first year, more than 800 students were attending these classes.

In 1941, the [[University of Texas]] started a series of ESMDT courses in aeronautical engineering. These were so successful that the next year a full Department of Aeronautical Engineering was formed. For the aircraft industries of Los Angeles, Maurice J. Zucrow of [[University of California, Los Angeles]], taught ESMWT courses on [[jet propulsion]] and [[gas turbines]], introducing hundreds of aeronautical engineers to this critical technology of post-war propulsion.

Across the nation, some of the most attended courses were in electronics and radio communications. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], [[Tufts College]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Boston University]], and [[Boston College]] joined forces to offer the ESMDT/ESMWT program; Dean Edward L. Moreland of MIT served as the coordinator. Much of it was in support of the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at MIT where microwave radar was being developed and the electronics firms in the northeast area.

[[Rutgers University]] was one of the few participants that included labor-management courses in its ESMWT offerings. These brought workers to the Rutgers campus in unprecedented numbers. The coordinator, Norman C. Miller stated, "The spirit of patriotism, sacrifice, and co-operation that imbued both labor and management in service to the war effort was clearly evident in these courses." This effort carried into the post-war era with the establishment of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Rutgers,

'''Flattop''' is a benchmark [[critical assembly]] that is used to study the nuclear characteristics of [[uranium-233]], [[uranium-235]], and [[plutonium-239]] in spherical geometries surrounded by a relatively thick [[natural uranium]] reflector.

Flattop assemblies are used to measure [[neutron activation]] and [[reactivity coefficients]]. Since the neutron energies gradually decrease in the reflector, experiments may be run in various energy spectra based on the location in which they are placed.&lt;ref name=malefant&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malenfant|first=R. E.|title=Los Alamos Critical Assemblies Facility|journal=Los Alamos National Laboratory|date=June 1981|volume=LA-872-MS|doi=10.2172/6463833|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6463833|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifications ==
Flattop is a natural-uranium-reflected, benchmarked, fixed-geometry critical assembly machine that can accommodate plutonium or uranium cores. The fast neutron spectrum is used to provide benchmarked neutronic measurements in spherical geometry with different fissile driver materials. Key missions for Flattop include fundamental reactor physics studies, sample irradiation for radiochemical research, actinide minimum critical mass studies, detector calibration, and training. The U-233 core is no longer usable because of its high [[gamma-ray]] activity.&lt;ref name="malefant" /&gt;

The experiment was originally located at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loaiza|first=David|last2=Gehman|first2=Daniel|date=2006|title=End of an Era for the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility: History of critical assemblies and experiments (1946–2004)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306454906001939|journal=Annals of Nuclear Energy|volume=33|issue=17–18|pages=1339–1359|doi=10.1016/j.anucene.2006.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; located at the Los Alamos Pajarito Site, otherwise known as Technical Area 18.  In 2005 the Pajarito Site started to shut down and nuclear material was moved to the National Criticality Experiments Research Center (NCERC) which is located at the [[Nevada National Security Site]].  However, NCERC continues to be operated by the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The core capabilities at NCERC include Flattop along with three other critical assemblies, Comet, Planet, and Godiva-IV and a significant inventory of nuclear material items available for experimental use. NCERC critical operations commenced in 2011 and continue to be operational today.&lt;ref name="ncerc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=David K.|author2=Myers|title=National Criticality Experiments Research Center: Capability and Status|journal=Institute of Nuclear Materials Management 53rd Annual Meeting|date=16 July 2012|issue=LA-UR-12-22906|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?query_id=1&amp;page=0&amp;osti_id=1046008|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Space power research ==
{{main|kilopower}}
In 2012, Flattop was used for key demonstration of the use of nuclear power for space applications.  The Demonstration Using Flattop Fission, or DUFF,&lt;ref name="DUFF"/&gt; test was planned by Los Alamos National Laboratory to use Flattop as a nuclear heat source. A team from the [[NASA Glenn Research Center]] in partnership with the LANL reactor design team designed, built, and tested a heat pipe and power conversion system to couple to Flattop with the end goal of demonstrating electrical power production using technology applicable to space application.&lt;ref name="DUFF"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gibson |first=Marc A. |first2=Maxwell H. |last2=Briggs |first3=James L. |last3=Sanzi |first4=Michael H. |last4=Brace |title=Heat Pipe Powered Stirling Conversion for the Demonstration Using Flattop Fission (DUFF) Test |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140011536.pdf |agency=Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space (NETS-2013), [[NASA]] |publisher=[[American Nuclear Society]] |location=Albuquerque |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controls==
Flattop consists of a hemispherical fixed reflector and two movable quarter-spheres of reflector that can close down on the central core. One movable reflector is controlled by hydraulic pressure, while the other is actuated by a motor.&lt;ref name=malefant /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2094">The '''Gnits standards''' are a collection of [[standardization|standard]]s and recommendations for programming, maintaining, and distributing [[software]].  They are published by a group of [[GNU project]] maintainers who call themselves "Gnits", which is short for "'''GNU nit-pickers'''".  As such, they represent advice, not [[Free Software Foundation]] or [[GNU]] policy, but parts of the Gnits' standards have seen widespread adoption among [[free software]] programmers in general.

The Gnits standards are extensions to, refinements of, and annotations for the [[GNU Standards]].  However, they are in no way normative in GNU; GNU maintainers are not required to follow them. Nevertheless, maintainers and programmers often find in Gnits standards good ideas on the way to follow GNU Standards themselves, as well as tentative, non-official explanations about why some GNU standards were decided the way they are.  There are very few discrepancies between Gnits and GNU standards, and they are always well noted as such.

The standards address aspects of [[software architecture]], program behaviour, [[human–computer interaction]], [[C (computer language)|C]] programming, [[software documentation|documentation]], and [[software release]]s.

As of 2008, the Gnits standards carry a notice that they are moribund and no longer actively maintained, and points readers to the manuals of [[Gnulib]], [[Autoconf]], and [[Automake]], which are said to cover many of the same topics.

In [[percussion]], '''grip''' refers to the manner in which the player holds the [[percussion mallet]] or mallets, whether [[drum stick]]s or other mallets.

For some instruments, such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]s and large [[gong]]s, only one mallet or beater is normally used, held either in one hand, or in both hands for larger beaters; For others such as [[snare drum]]s often two beaters are used, one in each hand. More rarely, more than one beater may be held in one hand, for example when [[vibraphone#Four-mallet style|four mallets]] are used on a [[vibraphone]], or when a [[kit drummer]] performs a cymbal roll by holding two [[soft stick]]s in one hand while keeping a rhythm with the other.

==Matched or unmatched==

When two identical beaters are used, one in each hand, there are two main varieties of grip:
* Unmatched grips, known as [[traditional grip]]s because of their association with traditional snare drum and drum kit playing, in which the right and left hands grip the beaters in different ways, often one underhand and one overhand. 
* [[Matched grip]]s in which the hands hold the beaters in similar but [[mirror image]] fashion.

===Traditional grip===
{{main|Traditional grip}}
Traditional grip was developed to conveniently play a [[snare drum]] while marching, and was documented and popularised by [[Sanford A. Moeller]] in ''[[The Art of Snare Drumming]]'' (1925). It was the standard grip for kit drummers in the first half of the twentieth century and remains popular, and the standard grip for most snare drummers.

===Matched grip===
{{main|Matched grip}}
Matched grip is used for most percussion instruments when two beaters are used.

There are three main varieties, distinguished by the means of moving the beaters and the angle of the palms to facilitate this action:
* French grip, in which the beaters are moved mainly by the fingers.
* German grip, in which the beaters are moved mainly by the wrists.
* American grip, partway between French and German, using both wrists and fingers.

==Usage==
Single-beater grips are common for:
* [[Gongs]].
* [[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]].
* [[Bass drum]].

Unmatched grips are common for:
* [[Snare drum]].
* [[Drum kit]].
* Korean [[janggu]] drum (using dissimilar beaters).

Matched grips are common for:
* Snare drum.
* Drum kit.
* [[Glockenspiel]], [[Xylophone]] and [[Vibraphone]].
* [[Tenor drum]].
* Bass drum.
* [[Tympani]].

In [[computer science]], the [[Actor model]], first published in 1973, is a mathematical model of [[concurrent computation]].

==Event orderings versus global state==
A fundamental challenge in defining the Actor model is that it did not provide for global states so that a computational step could not be defined as going from one global state to the next global state as had been done in all previous models of computation.

In 1963 in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] introduced situation variables in logic in the Situational Calculus. In McCarthy and Hayes 1969, a situation is defined as "the complete state of the universe at an instant of time." In this respect, the situations of McCarthy are not suitable for use in the Actor model since it has no global states.

From the definition of an Actor, it can be seen that numerous events take place: local decisions, creating Actors, sending messages, receiving messages, and designating how to respond to the next message received. Partial orderings on such events have been axiomatized in the Actor model and their relationship to physics explored (see [[Actor model theory]]).

==Relationship to physics==
According to Hewitt (2006), the Actor model is based on physics in contrast with other models of computation that were based on mathematical logic, set theory, algebra, ''etc.'' Physics influenced the Actor model in many ways, especially [[quantum indeterminacy|quantum physics]] and [[Theory of relativity|relativistic physics]]. One issue is what can be observed about Actor systems. The question does not have an obvious answer because it poses both theoretical and observational challenges similar to those that had arisen in constructing the foundations of quantum physics. In concrete terms for Actor systems, typically we cannot observe the details by which the arrival order of messages for an Actor is determined (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]). Attempting to do so affects the results and can even push the indeterminacy elsewhere. ''e.g.'', see [[metastability in electronics]]. Instead of observing the insides of arbitration processes of Actor computations, we await the outcomes.

==Models prior to the Actor model==
The Actor model builds on previous models of computation.

===Lambda calculus===
The [[lambda calculus]] of [[Alonzo Church]] can be viewed as the earliest [[message passing]] [[programming language]] (see Hewitt, Bishop, and Steiger 1973; [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|Abelson and Sussman 1985]]).  For example, the lambda expression below implements a tree data structure when supplied with parameters for a &lt;tt&gt;leftSubTree&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;rightSubTree&lt;/tt&gt;.  When such a tree is given a parameter message &lt;tt&gt;"getLeft"&lt;/tt&gt;, it returns &lt;tt&gt;leftSubTree&lt;/tt&gt; and likewise when given the message &lt;tt&gt;"getRight"&lt;/tt&gt; it returns &lt;tt&gt;rightSubTree&lt;/tt&gt;.

  λ(leftSubTree,rightSubTree)
    λ(message)
      ''if'' (message == "getLeft") ''then'' leftSubTree
      ''else if'' (message == "getRight") ''then'' rightSubTree

However, the semantics of the lambda calculus were expressed using [[mathematical logic|variable substitution]] in which the values of parameters were substituted into the body of an invoked lambda expression.  The substitution model is unsuitable for concurrency because it does not allow the capability of [[sharing]] of changing resources.  Inspired by the lambda calculus, the [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the programming language [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] made use of a data structure called an environment so that the values of parameters did not have to be substituted into the body of an invoked lambda expression.  This allowed for sharing of the [[Side-effect (computer science)|effects]] of updating shared data structures but did not provide for concurrency.

===Simula===
[[SIMULA|Simula 67]] pioneered using message passing for computation, motivated by discrete event simulation applications. These applications had become large and unmodular in previous simulation languages.  At each time step, a large central program would have to go through and update the state of each simulation object that changed depending on the state of whichever simulation objects it interacted with on that step.  [[Kristen Nygaard]] and [[Ole-Johan Dahl]] developed the idea (first described in an IFIP workshop in 1967) of having [[Method (computer science)|methods]] on each [[Object (computer science)|object]] that would update its own local state based on messages from other objects.  In addition they introduced a [[Class (computer science)|class structure]] for objects with [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].  Their innovations considerably improved the modularity of programs.

However, Simula used [[coroutine]] control structure instead of true concurrency.

===Smalltalk=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Smalltalk]] --&gt;
[[Alan Kay]] was influenced by message passing in the pattern-directed invocation of [[Planner programming language|Planner]] in developing [[Smalltalk]]-71.  Hewitt was intrigued by Smalltalk-71 but was put off by the complexity of communication that included invocations with many fields including ''global'', ''sender'', ''receiver'', ''reply-style'', ''status'', ''reply'', ''operator selector'', ''etc.''

In 1972 Kay visited MIT and discussed some of his ideas for Smalltalk-72 building on the [[Logo programming language|Logo]] work of [[Seymour Papert]] and the "little person" model of computation used for teaching children to program.   However, the message passing of Smalltalk-72 was quite complex.  Code in the language was viewed by the interpreter as simply a stream of tokens.  As [[Dan Ingalls]] later described it:

:''The first (token) encountered (in a program) was looked up in the dynamic context, to determine the receiver of the subsequent message. The name lookup began with the class dictionary of the current activation. Failing there, it moved to the sender of that activation and so on up the sender chain.  When a binding was finally found for the token, its value became the receiver of a new message, and the interpreter activated the code for that object's class.''

Thus the message-passing model in Smalltalk-72 was closely tied to a particular machine model and programming-language syntax that did not lend itself to concurrency. Also, although the system was bootstrapped on itself, the language constructs were not formally defined as objects that respond to '''Eval''' messages (see discussion below). This led some to believe that a new mathematical model of concurrent computation based on message passing should be simpler than Smalltalk-72.

Subsequent versions of the Smalltalk language largely followed the path of using the virtual [[Method (computer science)|methods]] of Simula in the message-passing structure of programs.  However Smalltalk-72 made primitives such as integers, floating point numbers, ''etc.'' into [[Object (computer science)|objects]].  The authors of Simula had considered making such primitives into objects but refrained largely for efficiency reasons.  [[Java (programming language)|Java]] at first used the expedient of having both primitive and object versions of integers, floating point numbers, ''etc.'' The [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language (and later versions of Java, starting with Java 1.5) adopted the less elegant solution of using ''[[Boxing (computer science)|boxing]]'' and ''unboxing'', a variant of which had been used earlier in some [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] implementations.

The Smalltalk system went on to become very influential, innovating in bitmap displays, personal computing, the class browser interface, and many other ways. For details see Kay's ''The Early History of Smalltalk''.&lt;ref name="kay1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Kay|title=The Early History of Smalltalk|url=http://www.smalltalk.org/downloads/papers/SmalltalkHistoryHOPL.pdf|format=PDF|journal=ACM SIGPLAN|volume=28|issue=3|date=March 1993|pages=69–75|doi=10.1145/155360.155364|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205105015/http://www.smalltalk.org/downloads/papers/SmalltalkHistoryHOPL.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, the Actor efforts at MIT remained focused on developing the science and engineering of higher level concurrency.  (See the paper by Jean-Pierre Briot for ideas that were developed later on how to incorporate some kinds of Actor concurrency into later versions of Smalltalk.)

===Petri nets===
Prior to the development of the Actor model, [[Petri net]]s were widely used to model nondeterministic computation. However, they were widely acknowledged to have an important limitation:  they modeled control flow but not data flow.  Consequently, they were not readily composable, thereby limiting their modularity.  Hewitt pointed out another difficulty with Petri nets:  simultaneous action.  ''I.e.'', the atomic step of computation in Petri nets is a transition in which  tokens ''simultaneously'' disappear from the input places of a transition and appear in the output places.  The physical basis of using a primitive with this kind of simultaneity seemed questionable to him. Despite these apparent difficulties, Petri nets continue to be a popular approach to modelling concurrency, and are still the subject of active research.

===Threads, locks, and buffers (channels)===
Prior to the Actor model, concurrency was defined in low-level machine terms of [[Thread (computer science)|threads]], [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] and [[Buffer (computer science)|buffers]]([[Channel (programming)|channels]]).  It certainly is the case that implementations of the Actor model typically make use of these hardware capabilities.  However, there is no reason that the model could not be implemented directly in hardware without exposing any hardware threads and locks.  Also, there is no necessary relationship between the number of Actors, threads, and locks that might be involved in a computation.  Implementations of the Actor model are free to make use of threads and locks in any way that is compatible with the laws for Actors.

==Abstracting away implementation details==
An important challenge in defining the Actor model was to abstract away implementation details.

For example, consider the following question: "Does each Actor have a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] in which its communications are stored until received by the Actor to be processed?" [[Carl Hewitt]] argued against including such queues as an integral part of the Actor model. One consideration was that such queues could themselves be modeled as Actors that received messages to &lt;tt&gt;enqueue&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;dequeue&lt;/tt&gt; the communications. Another consideration was that some Actors would not use such queues in their actual implementation. ''E.g.,'' an Actor might have a network of [[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiters]] instead. Of course, there is a mathematical abstraction which is the ''sequence'' of communications that have been received by an Actor. But this sequence emerged only as the Actor operated. In fact the ordering of this sequence can be indeterminate (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]).

Another example of abstracting away implementation detail was the question of [[Interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]: "Should interpretation be an integral part of the Actor model?" The idea of interpretation is that an Actor would be defined by how its program script processed &lt;tt&gt;eval&lt;/tt&gt; messages. (In this way Actors would be defined in a manner analogous to [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] which was "defined" by a meta-circular interpreter procedure named &lt;tt&gt;eval&lt;/tt&gt; written in Lisp.) Hewitt argued against making interpretation integral to the Actor model. One consideration was that to process the &lt;tt&gt;eval&lt;/tt&gt; messages, the program script of an Actor would itself have a program script (which in turn would have ...)! Another consideration was that some Actors would not use interpretation in their actual interpretation. ''E.g.,'' an Actor might be implemented in hardware instead. Of course there is nothing wrong with interpretation ''per se''. Also implementing interpreters using &lt;tt&gt;eval&lt;/tt&gt; messages is more modular and extensible than the monolithic interpreter approach of Lisp.

==Operational model==
Nevertheless, progress developing the model was steady. In 1975, Irene Greif published the first [[Operational semantics|operational]] model in her dissertation.

==Scheme==
[[Gerald Jay Sussman|Gerald Sussman]] and [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.|Guy Steele]] then took an interest in Actors and published a paper on their [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] interpreter in which they concluded "we discovered that the 'actors' and the [[lambda calculus|lambda expressions]] were identical in implementation." According to Hewitt, the lambda calculus is capable of expressing some kinds of parallelism but, in general, ''not'' the concurrency expressed in the Actor model. On the other hand, the Actor model is capable of expressing all of the parallelism in the lambda calculus.

==Laws for Actors==
Two years after Greif published her operational model, [[Carl Hewitt]] and [[Henry Baker (computer scientist)|Henry Baker]] published the Laws for Actors.

==Proof of continuity of computable functions==
Using the laws of the Actor model, Hewitt and Baker proved that any Actor that behaves like a function is [[Scott continuity|continuous]] in the sense defined by [[Dana Scott]] (see [[denotational semantics]]).

==Specifications and proofs==
Aki Yonezawa published his specification and verification techniques for Actors. Russ Atkinson and [[Carl Hewitt]] published a paper on specification and proof techniques for serializers providing an efficient solution to [[encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulating]] shared resources for [[concurrency control]].

==Mathematical characterization using domain theory==
Finally eight years after the first Actor publication, Will Clinger (building on the work of [[Irene Greif]] 1975, [[Gordon Plotkin]] 1976, Michael Smyth 1978, [[Henry Baker (computer scientist)|Henry Baker]] 1978, Francez, [[C. A. R. Hoare|Hoare]], Lehmann, and de Roever 1979, and [[Edward Arthur Milne|Milne]] and [[John Milnor|Milnor]] 1979) published the first satisfactory mathematical [[denotational semantics|denotational]] model incorporating [[unbounded nondeterminism]] using [[domain theory]] in his dissertation in 1981 (see [[Denotational semantics of the Actor model#Clinger's Model|Clinger's model]]). Subsequently, Hewitt [2006] augmented the diagrams with arrival times to construct a [[Denotational semantics of the Actor model#The Timed Diagrams Model|technically simpler denotational model]] that is easier to understand. See [[History of denotational semantics]].

The '''International Association of Public Transport''' ('''UITP''', from the {{lang-fr|'''L’Union internationale des transports publics'''}}) is a non-profit advocacy organization for [[public transport]] authorities and operators, policy decision-makers, scientific institutes and the public transport supply and service industry. The association was founded on August 17, 1885 by [[King Leopold II]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] to support the Belgian tram and steel industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[European Conference of Ministers of Transport]] |year=2006 |title=Improving Access to Public Transport: Guidelines for Transport Personnel |publisher=[[OECD Publishing]] |page=2 |isbn=9789282113295}}&lt;/ref&gt; UITP supports a holistic approach to urban mobility and advocates for public transport development and sustainable mobility.

==Organization==

UITP represents an international network of 1,600 member companies located in 96 countries and covers all modes of public transport – [[Rapid transit|metro]],&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uitp.org/sites/default/files/cck-focus-papers-files/errac_metrolr_tramsystemsineurope.pdf |title=Metro, light rail and tram systems in Europe |publisher=The European Rail Research Advisory Council and UITP (L’Union internationale des transports publics) |format=pdf |page=4 |year=2009 |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[light rail]],&lt;ref name="LR&amp;tram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uitp.org/sites/default/files/cck-focus-papers-files/errac_metrolr_tramsystemsineurope.pdf |title=Metro, light rail and tram systems in Europe |publisher=The European Rail Research Advisory Council and UITP (L’Union internationale des transports publics) |format=pdf |page=18 |year=2009 |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uitp.org/sites/default/files/cck-focus-papers-files/01%20LIGHT%20RAIL%20FOR%20LIVEABLE%20CITIES.pdf |title=Light Rail for Liveable Cities |publisher=UITP (L’Union internationale des transports publics) |format=pdf |year=June 2001 |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Commuter rail|regional and suburban railways]], [[bus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uitp.org/bright-future-store-bus |title=A bright future in store for the bus |publisher=UITP (L’Union internationale des transports publics)|date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[waterborne transport]].&lt;ref name="water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uitp.org/sites/default/files/cck-focus-papers-files/fp_waterborne-en.pdf |title=Waterborne transport, a unique contribution to enhancing mobility for cities on water |publisher=UITP (L’Union internationale des transports publics) |format=pdf |pages=1–2 |year=May 2012 |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also represents collective transport in a broader sense.

UITP's network counts one main and EU office in [[Brussels]] and fifteen regional and liaison offices worldwide ([[Abidjan]], Astana, [[Bangalore]], Casablanca, [[Dubai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Istanbul]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Moscow]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Rome]], [[São Paulo]], Shenzhen, Singapore and [[Tehran]]).

[[File:KarottenZwiebeln 266.JPG|thumb|[[Companion planting]] of carrots and onions]]

The traditional '''kitchen garden''', also known as a '''potager''' (in French, ''jardin potager'') or in Scotland a '''kailyaird''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scots language|Scots]] "kailyaird" or "kailyard", means a small cabbage patch (see [[kale]]) or kitchen garden, usually adjacent to a cottage.--Cuddon, J. A. (1977) ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. London: André Deutsch; p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; is a space separate from the rest of the residential garden – the [[ornamental plant]]s and [[lawn]] areas. Most vegetable gardens are still miniature versions of old family farm plots, but the kitchen garden is different not only in its [[History of gardening|history]], but also its [[Garden design|design]]. 

The kitchen garden may serve as the central feature of an ornamental, all-season [[landscape]], or it may be little more than a humble [[vegetable]] plot. It is a source of [[herb]]s, vegetables and [[fruit]]s, but it is often also a structured garden space with a design based on repetitive geometric patterns. 

The kitchen garden has year-round visual appeal and can incorporate permanent [[Perennial plant|perennials]] or woody [[shrub]] plantings around (or among) the [[Annual plant|annuals]].

==Potager garden==
A potager is a [[French language|French]] term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. The historical design precedent is from the [[Gardens of the French Renaissance]] and Baroque [[Garden à la française]] eras. Often flowers ([[List of edible flowers|edible]] and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty.&lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Titmarsh|first1=Alan|title=Grow your veggies in style!

A '''vegetable garden''' (also known as a '''vegetable patch''' or '''vegetable plot''') is a garden that exists to grow vegetables and other plants useful for human consumption,&lt;ref name="Komar"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Komar|first1=Stephen|title=Some tips as you prepare your spring vegetable garden|url=http://www.njherald.com/20170507/some-tips-as-you-prepare-your-spring-vegetable-garden#|accessdate=9 May 2017|work=New Jersey Herald|publisher=njherald.com|date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning a vegetable garden|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/beginners-guide/vegetable-basics/planning-a-vegetable-garden|publisher=rhs.org.uk|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to a [[flower garden]] that exists for [[aesthetic]] purposes. It is a small-scale form of [[vegetable growing]]. A vegetable garden typically includes a [[compost heap]], and several plots or divided areas of land, intended to grow one or two types of plant in each plot. Plots may also be divided into rows with an assortment of vegetables grown in the different rows. It is usually located to the rear of a property in the [[back garden]] or back yard.&lt;ref name="Komar"/&gt; Many families have home kitchen and vegetable gardens that they use to produce food. In [[World War II]], many people had a "[[victory garden]]" which provided food and thus freed resources for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pack, Charles Lathrop |title=War Gardens Victorious |publisher=J. B. Lippincott |date=1919 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With worsening economic conditions and increased interest in organic and sustainable living, many people are turning to vegetable gardening as a supplement to their family's [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Food grown in the back yard consumes little if any fuel for shipping or maintenance, and the grower can be sure of what exactly was used to grow it. [[Organic horticulture]], or organic gardening, has become increasingly popular for the modern home gardener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckland|first1=Toby|title=The beginner's guide to starting a veg garden|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/how-to-grow/the-beginners-guide-to-starting-a-veg-garden/|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herb garden==
{{see also|List of culinary herbs and spices|Herb farm}}

The '''herb garden''' is often a separate space in the garden, devoted to growing a specific group of plants known as [[herb]]s. These gardens may be informal patches of plants, or they may be carefully designed, even to the point of arranging and clipping the plants to form specific patterns, as in a [[knot garden]].

Herb gardens may be purely functional or they may include a blend of functional and ornamental plants. The herbs are usually used to flavour food in [[cooking]], though they may also be used in other ways, such as discouraging pests, providing pleasant scents, or serving medicinal purposes (such as a [[physic garden]]), among others.

A kitchen garden can be created by planting different herbs in pots or containers, with the added benefit of mobility. Although not all herbs thrive in pots or containers, some herbs do better than others. Mint, a fragrant yet invasive herb, is an example of an herb that is advisable to keep in a container or it will take over the whole garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vegetablegardenhub.com/mint-and-the-home-vegetable-garden |title=Mint and the Home Vegetable Garden |publisher=VegetableGardenHub.com |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Culinary herbs in temperate climates are to a large extent still the same as in the medieval period. Herbs often have multiple uses. For example, mint may be used for cooking, tea, and pest control. Among the many uses of herbs are:{{cn|date=June 2017}}

* Annual culinary herbs: [[basil]], [[dill]], [[summer savory]]
* Perennial culinary herbs: [[Mentha|mint]], [[rosemary]], [[thyme]], [[tarragon]], [[Salvia officinalis|sage]]
* Herbs used for potpourri: [[lavender]], [[lemon verbena]]
* Herbs used for tea: [[Mentha|mint]], [[lemon verbena]], [[chamomile]], [[thyme]], [[Monarda|bergamot]], [[Hibiscus tea|hibiscus]]
* Herbs used for other purposes: [[stevia]] for sweetening, [[feverfew]] for pest control in the garden.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;

===Witches' garden===
A '''witches' garden''' is an [[herb garden]] specifically designed and used for the cultivation of herbs, for culinary, medicinal and/or spiritual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Basil E. Eleftheriou {{google books|MDg0OAzyXD0C|Witches' Garden |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbal baths, the making of incense, tied in bundles for rituals or prayers, or placed in charms are just some of the ways herbs can be used for spiritual purposes.

Herb gardens developed from the general gardens of the [[classical antiquity|ancient classical world]], which were used for growing vegetables, flowers, fruits and medicines. For centuries "wise women" and "healers" understood the uses of herbs for the purposes of healing and magic. During the medieval period, [[Religious orders|monks and nuns]] acquired this medical knowledge and grew the necessary herbs in specialised gardens.&lt;ref name="Essence"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Castro |first1=Lauren |title=Essence of Life in a Bloom: The Magic of Flowers |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/essence-of-life-in-a-bloom-the-magic-of-flowers_us_5908e6d3e4b084f59b49fd87 |date=5 February 2017 |publisher=Huffingtonpost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical plants in a witches' garden are: [[rosemary]], [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[parsley]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[catnip]], [[henbane]], [[marjoram]], [[thyme]], [[rue]], [[angelica]], [[Bay leaf|bay]], [[oregano]], [[dill]], [[aloe]], [[arnica]], [[chives]], and [[basil]].&lt;ref name="Essence"/&gt; Basil is especially common in these gardens as a strong protection herb. It is said, "Where basil grows, no evil goes!" and "Where basil is, no evil lives!"&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt; John Davidson and Dueep J. Singh {{google books|76qNBAAAQBAJ|A Beginner’s Guide to Raised Bed Gardening - Gardening Tips and Techniques ...|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JSC-1A lunar simulant.agr.jpg|thumb|About 5 mL of JSC-1A]]
A '''lunar regolith simulant''' is a terrestrial material synthesized in order to approximate the chemical, mechanical, or engineering properties of, and the mineralogy and particle size distributions of, lunar [[regolith]].&lt;ref name=McKayEtAl1 /&gt; Lunar regolith simulants are used by researchers who wish to research the materials handling, excavation, transportation, and uses of lunar regolith. Samples of actual lunar regolith are too scarce, and too small, for such research.

==Early Simulants==
In the run-up to the [[Apollo program]], crushed terrestrial rocks were first used to simulate the anticipated soils that astronauts would encounter on the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salisbury |first1=John |title=Studies of the Characteristics of Probable Lunar Surface Materials |journal=Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (U.S.) Special reports |date=1964 |volume=20 |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/102198352}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the properties of these early simulants were substantially different from actual lunar soil, and the issues associated with the pervasive, fine-grained sharp dust grains on the Moon came as a surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gaier |first1=James |title=The Effects of Lunar Dust on EVA Systems During the Apollo Missions |journal=NASA Technical Reports |date=2005 |issue=2005-213610 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/TM-2005-213610.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Later Simulants==
After Apollo and particularly during the development of the [[Constellation program]], there was a large proliferation of lunar simulants produced by different organizations and researchers. Many of these were given three-letter acronyms to distinguish them (e.g., MLS-1, JSC-1), and numbers to designate subsequent versions. These simulants were broadly divided into highlands or mare soils, and were usually produced by crushing and sieving analogous terrestrial rocks (anorthosite for highlands, basalt for mare). Returned Apollo and Luna samples were used as reference materials in order to target specific properties such as elemental chemistry or particle size distribution. Many of these simulants were criticized by prominent lunar scientist Larry Taylor for a lack of quality control and wasted money on features like nanophase iron that had no documented purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Lawrence |last2=Pieters |first2=Carle |last3=Britt |first3=Daniel |title=Evaluations of lunar regolith simulants |journal=Planetary and Space Science |date=2016 |volume=126 |doi=10.1016/j.pss.2016.04.005 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003206331630023X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JSC-1 and -1A===
'''JSC-1''' ('''Johnson Space Center Number One''') was a lunar regolith simulant that was developed in 1994 by [[NASA]] and the [[Johnson Space Center]]. Its developers intended it to approximate the [[lunar soil]] of the [[lunar mare|maria]].  It was sourced from a [[basalt]]ic ash with a high glass content.&lt;ref name=McKayEtAl1&gt;{{cite conference|booktitle=Engineering, Construction, and Operations in Space IV; Proceedings of the 4th International Conference, Albuquerque, New Mexico, February 26&amp;ndash;March 3, 1994|volume=2|editor1=Rodney G. Galloway |editor2=Stanley Lokaj |location=New York|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]|isbn=0872629376|pages=857&amp;ndash;866|year=1994|title=JSC-1: A new lunar soil simulant|author1=David S. McKay |author2=James L. Carter |author3=Walter W. Boles |author4=Carlton C. Allen |author5=Judith H. Allton  |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/strategies/jsc_lunar_simulant.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, NASA contracted with Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) for a second batch of simulant in three grades:&lt;ref&gt;http://isru.msfc.nasa.gov/lib/workshops/2009/03_JSC-1A_Lunar_RegSimulant_Update_BGustafson.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* JSC-1AF, fine, 27&amp;nbsp;µm average size
* JSC-1A, a reproduction of JSC 1, less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm size
* JSC-1AC, coarse, a distribution of sizes &lt; 5&amp;nbsp;mm

NASA received 14 metric tons of JSC-1A, and one ton each of AF and AC in 2006. Another 15 tons of JSC-1A and 100 kg of JSC-1F were produced by ORBITEC for commercial sale, but ORBITEC is no longer selling simulants and was acquired by the Sierra Nevada Corporation. An 8-ton sand box of commercial JSC‐1A is available for daily rental from the [http://sservi.nasa.gov/ NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI)].

JSC-1A can [[geopolymer]]ize in an alkaline solutions resulting in a hard, rock-like, material.&lt;ref&gt;Montes, Broussard, Gongre, Simicevic, Mejia, Tham, Allouche, Davis; Evaluation of lunar regolith geopolymer binder as a radioactive shielding material for space exploration applications, Adv. Space Res. 56:1212–1221 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexiadis2016&gt;Alexiadis, Alberini, Meyer; Geopolymers from lunar and Martian soil simulants, Adv. Space Res. (2017) 59:490–495, {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests show that the maximum [[Compressive strength|compressive]] and [[flexural strength]] of the 'lunar' geopolymer is comparable to that of conventional cements.&lt;ref name=Alexiadis2016 /&gt; 
[[File:Lunar Martial Geopolymers.jpg|thumb|Geopolymers from lunar (JSC-1A) and Martian ([[Martian regolith simulant|JSC MARS-1A]]) dust simulants produced at the [[University of Birmingham]]&lt;ref name=Alexiadis2016 /&gt;]]

JSC-1 and JSC-1A are now no longer available outside of NASA centers.

===NU-LHT and OB-1===
Two lunar highlands simulants, the NU-LHT (lunar highlands type) series and OB-1 (olivine-bytownite) were developed and produced in anticipation of the Constellation activities. Both of these simulants are sourced mostly from rare [[anorthosite]] deposits on the Earth. For NU-LHT the anorthosite came from the Stillwater complex, and for OB-1 it came from the Shawmere Anorthosite in Ontario. Neither of these simulants were widely distributed.

==Recent Simulants==

Most of the previously developed lunar simulants are no longer being produced or distributed outside of NASA. Multiple companies have tried to sell regolith simulants for profit, including Zybek Advanced Products, ORBITEC, and [[Deep Space Industries]]. None of these efforts have seen much success. NASA is unable to sell simulants, or distribute unlimited amounts for free; however, NASA can award set amounts of simulant to grant winners.  

Several lunar simulants have been developed recently and are either being sold commercially or are available for rent inside large regolith bins. These include the [http://sciences.ucf.edu/class/simulant_lunarhighlands/ Lunar Highlands Simulant (LHS-1)] and [http://sciences.ucf.edu/class/simulant_lunarmare/ Lunar Mare Simulant (LMS-1)] produced and distributed by the not-for-profit [https://sciences.ucf.edu/class/exolithlab/ Exolith Lab] run out of the [[University of Central Florida]], and a series of simulants produced by [https://www.offplanetresearch.com Off Planet Research] that are available for rent.

'''Manufacturing Grocers' Employees' Federation of Australia''' (M.G.U.) was an Australian trade union existing between 1906 and 1988. The union was first established as the '''Federated Candle, Soap, Soda &amp; Starch Employees' Union of Australia''', before changing its name in 1914.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Bruce A. created 20 April 2001, last modified 6 August 2010. [http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0592b.htm "Trade Union Entry: Manufacturing Grocers Employees Federation of Australia"]. [[Australian Trade Union Archives]]. Retrieved 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The union represented workers employed in manufacturing grocers' sundries and non-edible grocery products, particularly in the southern states of South Australia and Victoria. In 1988 the union amalgamated with the [[Federated Millers and Mill Employees' Union]] to form the [[Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Employees' Association of Australia]], which in turn merged with a number of unions to form the [[National Union of Workers]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

== Activities ==

The Manufacturing Grocers' Union undertook a wide variety of activities to pursue the interests of its members. The union made representations to government and the public in favour of protectionist measures to ensure the competitiveness of products manufactured in Australia with international imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2303115 |title=PROTECTION OF MATCH INDUSTRY WANTED. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=8 September 1932 |accessdate=13 September 2011 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M.G.U. also publicised the poor working conditions of its members, including problems such as noise, dust and physical fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29115467 |title=INDUSTRIAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tasmania |date=7 October 1925 |accessdate=13 September 2011 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian trade union leader and later politician [[Theo Nicholls]] served as part-time secretary of the union in South Australia, and was active in its organisation.&lt;ref name=Millar&gt;{{cite book |last1= Millar|first1= Ann|title= The Biography of the Australian Senate |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9UKL7t8BAGYC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=wool%20basil%20workers&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q=wool%20basil%20workers&amp;f=false |accessdate= 9 November 2011|volume= 3 |year= 2010|publisher= University of New South Wales Press|location=Sydney|isbn= 978-0-86840-996-2 |page= |pages= 185–188|chapter= South Australian Senators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial disputes ==

The Manufacturing Grocers' Union underwent several bitter industrial disputes during its history, including a number of strikes. The first major strike the union was involved in was in April 1916, when the M.G.U., along with a number of other unions, participated in a [[sympathy strike]] with the [[Storemen and Packers' Union]] over the dismissal of several men at a [[Parsons' Brothers]] factory in Melbourne. The strike lasted for several months and led to shortages of several products in Victoria, due to blockade of goods by the employers. The strike eventually collapsed in June 1916, with all strikers returning to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2093435 |title=GROCERY STRIKE FAILS. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=3 June 1916 |accessdate=13 September 2011 |page=20 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manufacturing Grocers' Union held another major strike in 1948 at the match factories of Bryant and May, in Richmond, Melbourne, over an increase in the required daily output of matches. The dispute was resolved when all parties agreed to allow the [[Commonwealth Statistician]] determine a fair daily output per worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22705371 |title=Match strike settled. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=16 November 1948 |accessdate=13 September 2011 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demarcation disputes ==

The Manufacturing Grocers' Union made efforts to establish a branch of the union in New South Wales, the most populous state of Australia, but this attempt was thwarted by the [[Australian Workers' Union]], who represented the relevant workers at the time.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

== Amalgamation ==

In 1988 the Manufacturing Grocers' Union amalgamated with the Federated Millers and Mill Employees' Union, another small union representing workers in food processing. The resulting body, the Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Employees' Association of Australasia, was short-lived and subsequently amalgamated with the [[National Union of Storeworkers, Packers, Rubber and Allied Workers]] to form the [[National Union of Workers]].

'''Non-recurring engineering''' ('''NRE''') refers to the one-time cost to [[research]], [[design]], [[research and development|develop]] and [[physical test|test]] a new product or product enhancement. When [[budget]]ing for a new product, NRE must be considered to analyze if a new product will be [[profit (accounting)|profitable]]. Even though a company will pay for NRE on a project only once, NRE costs can be prohibitively high and the product will need to sell well enough to produce a return on the initial investment. NRE is unlike [[cost-of-production theory of value|production costs]], which must be paid constantly to maintain production of a product. It is a form of [[fixed cost]] in [[economics]] terms. Once a system is designed any number of units can be manufactured without increasing NRE cost.

In a project-type (manufacturing) company, large parts (possibly all) of the project represent NRE. In this case the NRE costs are likely to be included in the first project's costs, this can also be called [[research and development]] (R&amp;D). If the firm cannot recover these costs, it must consider funding part of these from [[reserve (accounting)|reserves]], possibly take a project loss, in the hope that the investment can be recovered from further profit on future projects.

The concept of full product NRE as described above may lead readers to believe that NRE expenses are necessarily high. However, Focused NRE wherein small amounts of NRE money can yield large returns by making existing product changes is an option to consider as well. A small adjustment to an existing assembly may be considered, in order to use a less expensive or improved subcomponent or to replace a subcomponent which is no longer available. In the world of embedded firmware, NRE may be invested in code development to fix problems or to add features where the costs to implement are a very small percentages of an immediate return. Chrysler found such a way to repair a transmission problem by investing trivial NRE dollars into computer firmware to fix a mechanical problem to save some tens of millions of dollars in mechanical repairs to transmissions in the field. 

Mastery of NRE concepts as financial investments are a most excellent loss control tool and must be considered a key part of manufacturing profit enhancement.

The '''OpenPOWER Foundation''' is a collaboration around [[Power Architecture]] products initiated by [[IBM]] and announced as the "OpenPOWER Consortium" on August 6, 2013.&lt;ref name="IBMpress"&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/41684.wss Google, IBM, Mellanox, NVIDIA, Tyan Announce Development Group for Data Centers]&lt;/ref&gt; IBM is opening up technology surrounding their Power Architecture offerings, such as processor specifications, firmware and software with a liberal license, and will be using a collaborative development model with their partners.&lt;ref name="TheReg130806"&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/06/ibm_opens_up_power_chips_armstyle_to_take_on_chipzilla/ IBM opens up Power chips, ARM-style, to take on Chipzilla]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBMSmarterPlanet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2013/08/open-and-collaborative-development-is-the-future-of-cloud-computing.html |title=Open and Collaborative Development is the Future of Cloud Computing |work=IBM's A Smarter Planet blog |first=Tom |last=Rosamilia |date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal stated is to enable the server vendor ecosystem to build their own customized server, networking and storage hardware for future [[data center]]s and [[cloud computing]].&lt;ref name="ZDNet130806"&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/ibms-openpower-consortium-with-nvidia-google-aims-to-advance-datacenter-7000019052/ IBM's OpenPower consortium with Nvidia, Google aims to advance datacenter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Power.org]] is still the governing body around the [[Power Architecture]] [[instruction set architecture|instruction set]] but specific implementations are now free to use under a liberal license granted by IBM. Processors based on IBM's [[Intellectual property|IP]] can now be fabricated on any foundry and mixed with other hardware products of the integrator's choice.

IBM is using the word open to describe this project in three ways:&lt;ref name="IBMSmarterPlanet" /&gt;

# They are licensing the microprocessor technology ''openly'' to its partners. They are sharing the blueprints to their hardware and software to their partners, so they can hire IBM or other companies to manufacture processors or other related chips.
# They will collaborate openly in an ''open-collaboration'' business model where participants share technologies and innovations with each other.
# Advantages via [[open-source software]] such as the [[Linux]] operating system.

In [[computer architecture]], '''register renaming''' is a technique that eliminates the false [[Data dependency|data dependencies]] arising from the reuse of [[processor register|architectural registers]] by successive [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] that do not have any real data dependencies between them. The elimination of these false data dependencies reveals more [[instruction-level parallelism]] in an instruction stream, which can be exploited by various and complementary techniques such as [[superscalar]] and [[Out-of-order execution|out-of-order]] execution for better [[Computer performance|performance]].

== Problem definition ==
In a [[register machine]], programs are composed of instructions which operate on values.  The instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another.  A typical instruction might say, add X and Y and put the result in Z.  In this instruction, X, Y, and Z are the names of storage locations.

In order to have a compact instruction encoding, most processor instruction sets have a small set of special locations which can be directly named. For example, the x86 instruction set architecture has 8 integer registers, x86-64 has 16, many RISCs have 32, and IA-64 has 128.  In smaller processors, the names of these locations correspond directly to elements of a [[register file]].

Different instructions may take different amounts of time; for example, a processor may be able to execute hundreds of instructions while a single load from the main memory is in progress. Shorter instructions executed while the load is outstanding will finish first, thus the instructions are finishing out of the original program order. [[Out-of-order execution]] has been used in most recent high-performance CPUs to achieve some of their speed gains.

Consider this piece of code running on an out-of-order CPU:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! # !! Instruction
|-
! 1
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = M[1024]&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 2
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = R1 + 2&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 3
| &lt;code&gt;M[1032] = R1&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 4
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = M[2048]&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 5
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = R1 + 4&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 6
| &lt;code&gt;M[2056] = R1&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Instructions 4, 5, and 6 are independent of instructions 1, 2, and 3, but the processor cannot finish 4 until 3 is done, otherwise instruction 3 would write the wrong value.  This restriction can be eliminated by changing the names of some of the registers:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! # !! Instruction !! rowspan="4" | !! # !! Instruction
|-
! 1
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = M[1024]&lt;/code&gt;
! 4
| &lt;code&gt;R2 = M[2048]&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 2
| &lt;code&gt;R1 = R1 + 2&lt;/code&gt;
! 5
| &lt;code&gt;R2 = R2 + 4&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! 3
| &lt;code&gt;M[1032] = R1&lt;/code&gt;
! 6
| &lt;code&gt;M[2056] = R2&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Now instructions 4, 5, and 6 can be executed in parallel with instructions 1, 2, and 3, so that the program can be executed faster.

When possible, the compiler would detect the distinct instructions and try to assign them to a different register. However, there is a finite number of register names that can be used in the assembly code. Many high performance CPUs have more physical registers than may be named directly in the instruction set, so they rename registers in hardware to achieve additional parallelism.

==Data hazards==
{{main|Data hazard}}

When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either by reading it (as an input) or by writing to it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can lead to three kinds of [[data hazard]]s:
* ''Read-after-write'' (RAW){{snd}} a read from a register or memory location must return the value placed there by the last write in program order, not some other write.  This is referred to as a ''true dependency'' or ''flow dependency'', and requires the instructions to execute in program order.
* ''Write-after-write'' (WAW){{snd}} successive writes to a particular register or memory location must leave that location containing the result of the second write.  This can be resolved by ''squashing'' (synonyms: cancelling, annulling, mooting) the first write if necessary. WAW dependencies are also known as ''output dependencies''.
* ''Write-after-read'' (WAR){{snd}} a read from a register or memory location must return the last prior value written to that location, and not one written programmatically after the read.  This is a sort of ''false dependency'' that can be resolved by renaming. WAR dependencies are also known as ''anti-dependencies''.

Instead of delaying the write until all reads are completed, two copies of the location can be maintained, the old value and the new value.  Reads that precede, in program order, the write of the new value can be provided with the old value, even while other reads that follow the write are provided with the new value.  The false dependency is broken and additional opportunities for out-of-order execution are created.  When all reads that need the old value have been satisfied, it can be discarded.  This is the essential concept behind register renaming.

Anything that is read and written can be renamed.  While the general-purpose and floating-point registers are discussed the most, flag and status registers or even individual status bits are commonly renamed as well.

Memory locations can also be renamed, although it is not commonly done to the extent practiced in register renaming.  The [[Transmeta Crusoe]] processor's gated store buffer is a form of memory renaming.

If programs refrained from reusing registers immediately, there would be no need for register renaming. Some instruction sets (e.g., [[IA-64]]) specify very large numbers of registers for specifically this reason.  However, there are limitations to this approach:
* It is very difficult for the compiler to avoid reusing registers without large code size increases.  In loops, for instance, successive iterations would have to use different registers, which requires replicating the code in a process called [[loop unrolling]].
* Large numbers of registers require more bits for specifying a register as an operand in an instruction, resulting in increased code size.
* Many instruction sets historically specified smaller numbers of registers and cannot be changed while still retaining backwards compatibility. 

Code size increases are important because when the program code is larger, the instruction cache misses more often and the processor stalls waiting for new instructions.

==Architectural vs physical registers==

Machine language programs specify reads and writes to a limited set of registers specified by the [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA). For instance, the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] ISA specifies 32 integer registers, each 64 bits wide, and 32 floating-point registers, each 64 bits wide.  These are the ''architectural'' registers.  Programs written for processors running the Alpha instruction set will specify operations reading and writing those 64 registers.  If a programmer stops the program in a debugger, they can observe the contents of these 64 registers (and a few status registers) to determine the progress of the machine.

One particular processor which implements this ISA, the [[Alpha 21264]], has 80 integer and 72 floating-point ''physical'' registers. There are, on an Alpha 21264 chip, 80 physically separate locations which can store the results of integer operations, and 72 locations which can store the results of floating point operations. (In fact, there are even more locations than that, but those extra locations are not germane to the register renaming operation.)

The following text describes two styles of register renaming, which are distinguished by the circuit which holds the data ready for an execution unit.

In all renaming schemes, the machine converts the architectural registers referenced in the instruction stream into tags. Where the architectural registers might be specified by 3 to 5 bits, the tags are usually a 6 to 8 bit number. The rename file must have a read port for every input of every instruction renamed every cycle, and a write port for every output of every instruction renamed every cycle.  Because the size of a register file generally grows as the square of the number of ports, the rename file is usually physically large and consumes significant power.

In the ''tag-indexed register file'' style, there is one large register file for data values, containing one register for every tag. For example, if the machine has 80 physical registers, then it would use 7 bit tags. 48 of the possible tag values in this case are unused.

In this style, when an instruction is issued to an execution unit, the tags of the source registers are sent to the physical register file, where the values corresponding to those tags are read and sent to the execution unit.

In the ''reservation station'' style, there are many small associative register files, usually one at the inputs to each execution unit. Each operand of each instruction in an issue queue has a place for a value in one of these register files.

In this style, when an instruction is issued to an execution unit, the register file entries corresponding to the issue queue entry are read and forwarded to the execution unit.

;Architectural Register File or Retirement Register File (RRF): The committed register state of the machine. RAM indexed by logical register number. Typically written into as results are retired or committed out of a reorder buffer.
;Future File: The most speculative register state of the machine. RAM indexed by logical register number.
;Active Register File: The Intel P6 group's term for Future File.
;History Buffer: Typically used in combination with a future file. Contains the "old" values of registers that have been overwritten.  If the producer is still in flight it may be RAM indexed by history buffer number. After a branch misprediction must use results from the history buffer—either they are copied, or the future file lookup is disabled and the history buffer is [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) indexed by logical register number.
;Reorder Buffer (ROB): A structure that is sequentially (circularly) indexed on a per-operation basis, for instructions in flight. It differs from a history buffer because the reorder buffer typically comes after the future file (if it exists) and before the architectural register file.

Reorder buffers can be data-less or data-ful.

In Willamette's ROB, the ROB entries point to registers in the physical register file (PRF), and also contain other book keeping.  This was also the first Out of Order design done by Andy Glew, at Illinois with HaRRM.

P6's ROB, the ROB entries contain data; there is no separate PRF.  Data values from the ROB are copied from the ROB to the RRF at retirement.

One small detail: if there is temporal locality in ROB entries (i.e., if instructions close together in the von Neumann instruction sequence write back close together in time, it may be possible to perform write combining on ROB entries and so have fewer ports than a separate ROB/PRF would).  It is not clear if it makes a difference, since a PRF should be banked.

ROBs usually don't have associative logic, and certainly none of the ROBs designed by Andy Glew have CAMs.  [[Keith Diefendorff]] insisted that ROBs have complex associative logic for many years.  The first ROB proposal may have had CAMs.

== {{Anchor|REGISTER-FILE}}Details: tag-indexed register file ==
&lt;!--[[Image:register renaming:tag indexed scheme.png|{{deletable image-caption}}]]--&gt;

This is the renaming style used in the MIPS [[R10000]], the [[Alpha 21264]], and in the FP section of the [[AMD]] [[Athlon]].

In the renaming stage, every architectural register referenced (for read or write) is looked up in an architecturally-indexed '''remap file'''.  This file returns a tag and a ready bit.  The tag is non-ready if there is a queued instruction which will write to it that has not yet executed.  For read operands, this tag takes the place of the architectural register in the instruction.  For every register write, a new tag is pulled from a free tag FIFO, and a new mapping is written into the remap file, so that future instructions reading the architectural register will refer to this new tag.  The tag is marked as unready, because the instruction has not yet executed.  The previous physical register allocated for that architectural register is saved with the instruction in the [[reorder buffer]], which is a FIFO that holds the instructions in program order between the decode and graduation stages.

The instructions are then placed in various '''issue queues'''. As instructions are executed, the tags for their results are broadcast, and the issue queues match these tags against the tags of their non-ready source operands. A match means that the operand is ready. The remap file also matches these tags, so that it can mark the corresponding physical registers as ready. When all the operands of an instruction in an issue queue are ready, that instruction is ready to issue. The issue queues pick ready instructions to send to the various functional units each cycle. Non-ready instructions stay in the issue queues. This unordered removal of instructions from the issue queues can make them large and power-consuming.

Issued instructions read from a tag-indexed physical register file (bypassing just-broadcast operands) and then execute.  Execution results are written to tag-indexed physical register file, as well as broadcast to the bypass network preceding each functional unit.  Graduation puts the previous tag for the written architectural register into the free queue so that it can be reused for a newly decoded instruction.

An exception or branch misprediction causes the remap file to back up to the remap state at last valid instruction via combination of state snapshots and cycling through the previous tags in the in-order pre-graduation queue.  Since this mechanism is required, and since it can recover any remap state (not just the state before the instruction currently being graduated), branch mispredictions can be handled before the branch reaches graduation, potentially hiding the branch misprediction latency.

==Details: reservation stations==
{{Main|Reservation station}}
&lt;!--[[Image:register renaming:reservation station scheme.png|{{deletable image-caption}}]]--&gt;

This is the style used in the integer section of the AMD K7 and K8 designs.

In the renaming stage, every architectural register referenced for reads is looked up in both the architecturally-indexed '''future file''' and the rename file. The future file read gives the value of that register, if there is no outstanding instruction yet to write to it (i.e., it's ready). When the instruction is placed in an issue queue, the values read from the future file are written into the corresponding entries in the reservation stations.  Register writes in the instruction cause a new, non-ready tag to be written into the rename file.  The tag number is usually serially allocated in instruction order—no free tag FIFO is necessary.

Just as with the tag-indexed scheme, the issue queues wait for non-ready operands to see matching tag broadcasts.  Unlike the tag-indexed scheme, matching tags cause the corresponding broadcast value to be written into the issue queue entry's reservation station.

Issued instructions read their arguments from the reservation station, bypass just-broadcast operands, and then execute.  As mentioned earlier, the reservation station register files are usually small, with perhaps eight entries.

Execution results are written to the [[re-order buffer|reorder buffer]], to the reservation stations (if the issue queue entry has a matching tag), and to the future file if this is the last instruction to target that architectural register (in which case register is marked ready).

Graduation copies the value from the reorder buffer into the architectural register file.  The sole use of the architectural register file is to recover from exceptions and branch mispredictions.

Exceptions and branch mispredictions, recognised at graduation, cause the architectural file to be copied to the future file, and all registers marked as ready in the rename file.  There is usually no way to reconstruct the state of the future file for some instruction intermediate between decode and graduation, so there is usually no way to do early recovery from branch mispredictions.

==Comparison between the schemes==
In both schemes, instructions are inserted in-order into the issue queues, but are removed out-of-order.  If the queues do not collapse empty slots, then they will either have many unused entries, or require some sort of variable priority encoding for when multiple instructions are simultaneously ready to go.  Queues that collapse holes have simpler priority encoding, but require simple but large circuitry to advance instructions through the queue.

Reservation stations have better latency from rename to execute, because the rename stage finds the register values directly, rather than finding the physical register number, and then using that to find the value.  This latency shows up as a component of the branch misprediction latency.

Reservation stations also have better latency from instruction issue to execution, because each local register file is smaller than the large central file of the tag-indexed scheme.  Tag generation and exception processing are also simpler in the reservation station scheme, as discussed below.

The physical register files used by reservation stations usually collapse unused entries in parallel with the issue queue they serve, which makes these register files larger in aggregate, and consume more power, and more complicated than the simpler register files used in a tag-indexed scheme.  Worse yet, every entry in each reservation station can be written by every result bus, so that a reservation-station machine with, e.g., 8 issue queue entries per functional unit will typically have 9 times as many bypass networks as an equivalent tag-indexed machine.  Consequently, result forwarding consumes much more power and area than in a tag-indexed design.

Furthermore, the reservation station scheme has four places (Future File, Reservation Station, Reorder Buffer and Architectural File) where a result value can be stored, whereas the tag-indexed scheme has just one (the physical register file).  Because the results from the functional units, broadcast to all these storage locations, must reach a much larger number of locations in the machine than in the tag-indexed scheme, this function consumes more power, area, and time. Still, in machines equipped with very accurate branch prediction schemes and if execute latencies are a major concern, reservation stations can work remarkably well.

==History==

The [[IBM System/360 Model 91]] was an early machine that supported out-of-order execution of instructions; it used the [[Tomasulo algorithm]], which uses register renaming.

The [[POWER1]] is the first [[microprocessor]] that used register renaming and out-of-order execution in 1990.

The original [[R10000]] design had neither collapsing issue queues nor variable priority encoding, and suffered starvation problems as a result—the oldest instruction in the queue would sometimes not be issued until both instruction decode stopped completely for lack of rename registers, and every other instruction had been issued.  Later revisions of the design starting with the [[R10000#R12000|R12000]] used a partially variable priority encoder to mitigate this problem.

Early out-of-order machines did not separate the renaming and ROB/PRF storage functions.  For that matter, some of the earliest, such as Sohi's RUU or the Metaflow DCAF, combined scheduling, renaming, and storage all in the same structure.

Most modern machines do renaming by RAM indexing a map table with the logical register number. E.g., P6 did this; future files do this, and have data storage in the same structure.

However, earlier machines used [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) in the renamer. E.g., the HPSM RAT, or Register Alias Table, essentially used a CAM on the logical register number in combination with different versions of the register.

In many ways, the story of out-of-order microarchitecture has been how these CAMs have been progressively eliminated. Small CAMs are useful; large CAMs are impractical.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6 microarchitecture]] was the first microarchitecture by Intel to implement both out-of-order execution and register renaming. The P6 microarchitecture was used in Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium M, Core, and Core 2 microprocessors. The [[Cyrix 6x86|Cyrix M1]], released on October 2, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fermimn.gov.it/inform/materiali/evarchi/cyrix.dir/6x86.htm|title=Cyrix 6x86 Processor}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first x86 processor to use register renaming and out-of-order execution. Other x86 processors (such as [[NexGen]] Nx686 and [[AMD K5]]) released in 1996 also featured register renaming and out-of-order execution of RISC [[Micro-operation|μ-operations]] (rather than native x86 instructions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpushack.com/CIC/announce/1995/NexGenNx686PressRelease.html |title=NexGen Nx686 }}, {{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PITtFPwTaWwC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=PC Mag Dec 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13502">'''HIV Resistance Response Database Initiative (RDI)''' is a [[not-for-profit]] organisation established in 2002 with the mission of improving the clinical management of [[HIV]] infection through the application of [[bioinformatics]] to HIV [[drug resistance]] and treatment outcome data. The RDI has the following specific goals:

# To be an independent repository of HIV resistance and treatment outcome data
# To use bioinformatics to explore the relationships between resistance, other clinical and laboratory factors and HIV treatment outcome
# To develop and make freely available a system to predict treatment response, as an aid to optimising and individualising the clinical management of HIV infection

The RDI consists of a small executive group based in the UK, an international advisory group of leading [[HIV/AIDS]] scientists and clinicians, and an extensive global network of collaborators and data contributors.

==Background==
[[Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]] is the [[virus]] that causes [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] ([[AIDS]]), a condition in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening [[opportunistic infections]].

There are approximately 25 HIV ‘[[antiretroviral]]’ drugs that have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection, from six different classes, based on the point in the HIV life-cycle at which they act.

They are used in combination; typically 3 or more drugs from 2 or more different classes, a form of therapy known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or [[HAART]]. The aim of therapy is suppression of the virus to very low, ideally undetectable, levels in the blood this prevents the virus from depleting the [[immune cells]] that it preferentially attacks ([[CD4]] cells) and prevents or delays illness and death.

Despite the expanding availability of these drugs and the impact of their use, treatments continue to fail, often due to the development of resistance.  During drug therapy, low-level virus replication still occurs, particularly when a patient misses a dose. HIV makes errors in copying its genetic material and, if a [[mutation]] makes the virus resistant to one or more of the drugs, it may begin to replicate more successfully in the presence of that drug and undermine the effect of the treatment. If this happens then the treatment needs to be changed to re-establish control over the virus.

In well-resourced healthcare settings, when treatment fails a resistance test may be run to predict to which drugs the patient’s virus is resistant.  The type of test in most common use is the [[genotype]] test, which detects mutations in the viral [[genetic code]]. This information is then typically interpreted using rules equating individual mutations with resistance against individual drugs. However, there are many different interpretation systems available that do not always agree, the systems only provide categorical results (resistant, sensitive or intermediate) and they do not necessarily relate well to how a patient will respond to a combination of drugs in the clinic.

==RDI Overview==
The RDI was established in 2002 to pioneer a new approach: to develop [[computational models]] using the genotype and a wide range of other clinically relevant data collected from thousands of patients treated with HAART all over the world and to use these models to predict how an individual patient will respond to different combinations of drugs.  The RDI’s goal was to make available a free treatment-response prediction tool over the Internet.

Key to the success of this approach is the collection of large amounts of data with which to train the models and the use of data from as wide and heterogeneous range of sources as possible to maximise the generalisability of the models’ predictions. In order to achieve this, the RDI set out to involve as many clinics worldwide as possible and to be the single repository for the data required, in an attempt to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and competition.

As of October 2013, the RDI has collected data from approximately 110,000 patients from dozens of clinics in more than 30 countries. It is probably the largest database of its kind in the world.  The data includes demographic information for the patient, and multiple determinations of the amount of virus in the patient’s bloodstream, CD4 cells counts (a white blood cell critical to the function of the [[immune system]] that HIV targets and destroys), genetic code of the patients virus, and details of the drugs that have been used to treat the patient.

The RDI has used these data to conduct extensive research in order to develop the most accurate system possible for the prediction of treatment response. This research involved the development and comparison of different computational modelling methods including [[artificial neural networks]], [[support vector machines]], [[random forests]] and logistical regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dechao|year=2009|title=A comparison of three computational modelling methods for the prediction of virological response to combination HIV therapy|journal=[[Artificial Intelligence in Medicine]]|issue=1|pages=6374|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2009.05.002|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predictions of the RDI’s models have historically [[correlated]] well with the actual changes in virus load of patients in the clinic, typically achieving a correlation co-efficient of 0.8 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larder|first=Brendan|year=2007|title=The development of artificial neural networks to predict virological response to combination HIV therapy|journal=[[Antiviral Therapy (journal)|Antiviral Therapy]]|issue=12|pages=15–24|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV-TRePS==
In October 2010, following clinical testing in two multinational studies, the RDI made its experimental HIV Treatment Response Prediction System, HIV-TRePS available over the Internet. In January 2011, two clinical studies were published indicating that use of the HIV-TRePS system could lead to clinical and economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larder|first=Brendan|year=2011|title=Clinical Evaluation of the Potential Utility of Computational Modeling as an HIV Treatment Selection Tool by Physicians with Considerable HIV Experience|journal=AIDS Patient Care and STDs|issue=1|pages=29–36|doi=10.1089/apc.2010.0254|volume=25|pmc=3030912}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The studies, conducted by expert HIV physicians in the USA, Canada and Italy, showed that use of the system was associated with changes of treatment decision to combinations involving fewer drugs overall, which were predicted to result in better virological responses, suggesting that use of the system could potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall number and cost of drugs used.

Recent models have predicted whether a combination treatment will reduce the level of virus in the patient’s bloodstream to undetectable levels with an accuracy of approximately 80%, significantly better than just using a genotype with rules-based interpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revell|first=Andrew|year=2011|title=The development of an expert system to predict virological response to HIV therapy as part of an online treatment support tool|journal=[[AIDS (journal)|AIDS]]|issue=15|pages=1855–1863|doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e328349a9c2|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As clinics in resource-limited settings are often unable to afford genotyping, the RDI has developed models that predicted treatment response without the need for a genotype, with only a small loss of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revell|first=Andrew|year=2010|title=Modelling response to HIV therapy without a genotype: an argument for viral load monitoring in resource-limited settings|journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]]|issue=4|pages=605–607|doi=10.1093/jac/dkq032|volume=65|pmc=2837552}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the RDI made these models available as part of the HIV-TRePS system.  This version is aimed particularly at resource-limited settings where genotyping is often not routinely available. The most recent of these models, trained with the largest dataset so far, achieved 80% accuracy, which is comparable to models that use a genotype in their predictions and significantly more accurate than genotyping with rules-based interpretation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revell|first=Andrew|year=2013|author2=Wang, D |author3=Wood R |title=Computational models can predict response to HIV therapy without a genotype and may reduce treatment failure in different resource-limited settings|journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]]|doi=10.1093/jac/dkt041|display-authors=etal|pmc=3654223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larder|first=Brendan|author2=Revell AD |author3=Hamers R |author4=Tempelman H |year=2013|title=Accurate prediction of response to HIV therapy without a genotype a potential tool for therapy optimisation in resource-limited settings|journal=[[Antiviral Therapy (journal)|Antiviral Therapy]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV-TRePS is now in use in 70 countries as a tool to predict virological response to therapy and avoid treatment failure.

The system has been expanded to enable physicians to include their local drug costs in the modelling.  A recent study of data from an Indian cohort demonstrated that the system was able to identify combinations of three locally available drugs with a higher probability of success than the regimen prescribed in the clinic, including those cases where the treatment used in the clinic failed. Moreover, in all these cases some of the alternatives were less costly than the regimen used in the clinic, suggesting that the system could be not only help avoid treatment failure but also reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revell|first=Andrew|year=2013|author2=Alvarez-Uria G |author3=Wang D |author4=Pozniak A |author5=Montaner JSG |author6=Lane HC |author7=Larder BA |title=Potential Impact of a Free Online HIV Treatment Response Prediction System for Reducing Virological Failures and Drug Costs after Antiretroviral Therapy Failure in a Resource-Limited Setting|journal=BioMed Research International|doi=10.1155/2013/579741|volume=2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Respirator|respiratory protective devices (RPD)]] can protect workers only if their protective properties are adequate to the conditions in the [[workplace]]. Therefore, specialists have developed criteria for the selection of proper, adequate respirators, including the '''Assigned Protection Factors''' (APF) - the decrease of the concentration of harmful substances in the inhaled air, which (is expected) to be provided with timely and proper use of a certified respirator of certain types (''design'') by taught and trained [[Workforce|workers]] (after individual selection with a tight-fitting mask and [[Respirator fit test|fit testing]]), when the [[Employment|employer]] performs an effective respiratory protective device programme.

=== The different methods of protection from air pollution and their effectiveness === 
The imperfection of [[Technology|technological processes]], [[Machine (mechanical)|machines]] and other equipment can lead to air contamination with harmful substances in the [[workplace]]. Protecting of the workers' health in this situation may be achieved with different ways, listed below in order of decreasing of their effectiveness:

This is one of the most reliable RPD type, its APF = 1000]]
If the use of these methods is impossible, or if their use did not reduce the concentration of harmful substances to [[Permissible exposure limit|a safe value]], workers must use respirators. These respirators must be sufficiently effective, and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace. However, it is the [[Hierarchy of hazard control|least effective method of protection]]; and the reasons for the decrease of their efficiency often are: non-usage of the respirators in the contaminated atmosphere; leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and face; and [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators#Replacement|delayed replacement of gas cartridges]].

=== The effectiveness of respirators with different designs ===
Different terms may be used to describe the protective properties of respirators:
* '''Penetration''' = (the concentration of harmful substances under mask) / (concentration outside the mask);
* '''Efficiency''' = &lt;big&gt;'''('''&lt;/big&gt; (concentration outside the mask) - (the concentration of harmful substances under mask) &lt;big&gt;''')'''&lt;/big&gt; / (concentration outside the mask) = 1 - Penetration;
* '''Protection Factor''' (PF) = (the concentration of harmful substances on the outside of the mask) / (concentration under mask) = 1 / Penetration.
The term "Protection Factor PF" has been used in the U.S., and the term "Penetration" was used in the soviet literature from the 1960s.

In the first half of the 20th century, experts carried out measurements protective properties of respirators in the laboratories. They used different control substances ([[argon]],&lt;ref name="Griffin-1970" /&gt; halogenated hydrocarbon vapour,&lt;ref name="Hounam-1964" /&gt; [[aerosol]]s of [[sodium chloride]] and oil mist,&lt;ref name="Городинский-1979" /&gt; [[fluorophore]]s,&lt;ref name="Burgess-1961" /&gt; [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|dioctyl phthalate]],&lt;ref name="30-CFR-14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyatt-1972" /&gt; and others, and they measured their concentrations under the mask, and outside masks (simultaneously). The ratio of the measured concentrations is an indicator of the protective properties of different types of respirators. These measurements showed that if the efficiency of [[Cartridges and canisters of air-purifying respirators|filters]] is enough high, then the gaps between the mask and the face become the main way of penetration of air contaminations under the mask. 
[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace PF]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters. In-facepiece dust concentration is changed dozens of times in a matter of minutes due to changes of the size of the gaps between the mask and face. Source&lt;ref name="Grinshpun-2005" /&gt;]]
The shape and size of these gaps is not constant, and depends on many factors (the degree of fit the mask to the face - by shape and size; the correct donning the mask; the mask slippage on the face during the work due to execution of different movements; the design of the mask). The respirator's PF may change dozens of times during of several minutes; and the two average PF (''that were measured for the same worker in one day; for example - before and after the lunch break'') can differ by more than 12 000 times.&lt;ref name="Zhuang-2003" /&gt;

Experts believed that the measurement of protection factors in the laboratory allows them to correctly evaluate, predict the RPD efficiency in the workplace conditions. But after the detection of cases of excessive harmful exposure on employees who used high quality respirators with [[HEPA]] particle filters in the [[Nuclear power|nuclear industry]] of the USA, the experts changed their opinion.&lt;ref name="Patty-1985" /&gt; [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Studies have been carried out to measure the protection factors for the various types of respirators - not only in the laboratories, but also at the workplaces]].&lt;ref name="Kirillov-2014" /&gt; Dozens of such field studies have shown that the performance of serviceable respiratory protective equipment at the workplaces may be significantly less than in laboratory conditions. Therefore, the usage of laboratory results to assess the real efficiency is incorrect; and can lead to a wrong choice of such respirators that can not reliably protect workers.

=== Terminology to describe the different PF, and methods for APF development ===
The experts used the results of measurements at the laboratories and [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|at the workplaces]] to develop more completely terminology for description of the respirators' performance;&lt;ref name="Letter-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Letter-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Letter-2+" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Letter-3" /&gt; and this terminology has been applied officially,&lt;ref name="NIOSH-2004" /&gt; and in the preparation of research results for publication.&lt;ref name="Letter-4" /&gt; Specialists began to use different terms to describe the protection factors, which were measured at workplaces with continuous use of respirators; and measured in the workplace when the workers used of respirators intermittently; measured not in the workplace while [[Respirator fit test|fit testing]]; measured in the laboratories under the simulation workplace's conditions; and for the protection factors, that can be expected (''in most cases'') when the workers properly used the respirators at the workplace.

A significant difference between respirator performance in the laboratories compared to [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|the efficiency at the workplaces]] not allowed to use the laboratory results to predict the degree of protection offered in practice. And instability of respirators' protective properties (for the same RPD design, and in the same usage conditions) prevented evaluate their efficiency. For solving these problems, scientists Donald Campbell and Steven Lenhart suggested to use the results of measurements of Workplace PF values for development of Assigned (''expected in practice'') PF values (APF) - as the '''lower''' [[Confidence interval|95% confidence interval]] of WPF values.&lt;ref name="Lenhart-1984" /&gt; The results of measurements of WPF has been used in the development of APF by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] (for the recommended standard, that is not mandatory).&lt;ref name="Nelson-1996" /&gt; The same was made during the development of the APF&lt;ref name="FedRegAPF" /&gt; by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] (in the development of the standard,&lt;ref name="Standard-US" /&gt; that is mandatory for the employer).

=== Development of APF values for the various respirator types ===
Results of measurements of WPF in the US and the UK became the basis for the development of APF for UK standard&lt;ref name="BS-4275" /&gt; and for English version of EU standard.&lt;ref name="DIN-EN-529" /&gt;
In some cases, there was no information on the effectiveness for respirators of specific design (type) in the workplace. This is due to the fact that the measurement of workplace PF is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of respirators experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of respirators, which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air Respirators (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of [[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered Air Purifying Respirators]] (PAPRs), if they have the same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.&lt;ref name="Nelson-1996" /&gt;

== Correction of Assigned PF values ==
Measurement of workplace protection factors surprisingly revealed the low efficiency of some designs of respirators, and that results have led to a sharp tightening of the requirements for application limits for respirators of such designs.
[[File:Фильтрующий респиратор с принудительной подачей воздуха под капюшон.JPG|thumb|150px|PAPR with hood. APF decreased from 1000 to 25 after PF studies in the workplaces]]
* PAPR with helmets or hoods
Measuring WPF of [[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered Air Purifying Respirators]] (PAPR) with helmets (that is not tight-fitted to the face) showed that the ingress of harmful substances in the inhaled air can be very high&lt;ref name="Myers-1984" /&gt; (PF = 28 and 42 for two models). It was a surprise, since earlier studies in the laboratory showed that the flow of clean filtered air from the inside to the outside of the helmet prevents ingress of harmful substances under the helmet (PF &gt; 1000). Additional studies&lt;ref name="Myers-1986" /&gt; have confirmed the result of the first study: the minimum values of the workplace protection factors of 2 models of respirators were 31 and 23; and leakage of unfiltered air achieved 16% in some cases in [[wind tunnel]] at 2&amp;nbsp;m/s air velocity&lt;ref name="Cecala-1981" /&gt;

Therefore, the use of such RPD types was limited 25 PEL in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Standard-US" /&gt; and 40 OEL in the UK.&lt;ref name="BS-4275" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DIN-EN-529" /&gt; 
[[File:Workplace Protection Factors of full face masks.jpg|thumb|200px|Results of respirator Workplace Protection Factors (WPF) measurement. Source&lt;ref name="Tannahill-1990" /&gt;]]
[[File:Полнолицевая маска с фильтрами.jpg|thumb|150px|Negative pressure full face mask. APF decreased from 900 to 40 after PF studies in the workplace]]
* Negative pressure full face masks 
Measurement of protection factors of negative pressure full face masks with high-efficiency filters in the laboratory revealed a risk of decrease in protective properties to a small values.&lt;ref name="Hyatt-1976" /&gt; Therefore, the use of such respirators has been limited to the values 50 or 100 PEL in the United States. However, the experts in the UK believed that the quality of their masks is higher than American masks, and were allowed to use up to 900 OEL. But the study&lt;ref name="Tannahill-1990" /&gt; showed that the value of the protection factor of &gt; 900 has been achieved in practice infrequently. Minimum protection factors of 3 different models of full facepiece respirators were 11, 18 and 26. So, the new standards&lt;ref name="BS-4275" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DIN-EN-529" /&gt; limit usage of these respirators up to 40 OEL in UK (after this study).

[[File:Полумаска MSA.jpg|thumb|150px|Negative pressure full face masks, possible APF decreased from 100 to 10]]
* Negative pressure half mask respirators (after fit testing)
[[Respirator fit test|Fit testing]] of tight-fitting masks of negative-pressure respirators became widely used in US industry in 1980-s. At the beginning, it was thought that the half-mask fit quite well to the worker's face, if during a fit test the protection factor (fit factor) is not less than 10 (later, experts began to use [[Factor of safety|"safety factor"]] = 10 during the fit test; threshold fit factor become 10 × 10 = 100). The widespread use of fit testing in the industry gives professionals optimism, and they allowed to the employers restrict the use of half mask respirators in accordance with the values of worker's personal fit factor (the maximum concentration of pollutants = personal Fit Factor × PEL), but not more than 100 × PEL. However, scientific studies have shown that although such test increases the effectiveness of protection, the risk of leakage of large amounts of unfiltered air is maintained. Furthermore, the studies have shown that non-filtered air under the mask is not uniformly mixed with the filtered air, which leads to large errors in the measurement of the in-facepiece concentration of contaminants, and subsequent calculations of fit factors - the latter is often much smaller than the "measured" value. So, specialists recommend not allowed usage negative pressure half mask respirators then harmful substances' concentrations exceeds 10 PEL.&lt;ref name="Bollinger-1988" /&gt; Therefore, OSHA standards require to restrict using of half-mask negative-pressure respirators up to 10 PEL after obtaining fit factor greater than or equal to 100 during the mask selection for the worker (they used a [[Factor of safety|safety factor]] = 10).

''US particle filters N95 are similar to P2; and P100 ([[HEPA]]) are similar to P3; filtering materials in US N95 filtering facepieces are similar to FFP2.''

The difference of the APF for air purifying negative pressure full-facepiece masks are not large. The difference between PAPR with helmets a few more. But measurements showed that the [[Respirators testing in the workplaces|real effectiveness of RPD (at the workplace conditions)]] is strongly dependent on the conditions of their use, not only from the design, and this partly explains the difference in APF values. The APF for negative pressure half mask respirators are twofold. But this difference cannot be considered separately from recommendations for use of respirators. The use of half-face masks in the US is limited to 10 PEL for the "worst case" - work in the polluted atmosphere of 8 hours per day, 40 hours a week. But British experts took into account large experience of the use of negative pressure air purifying RPDs, and they concluded that to achieve continuous wear respirator 8 hours a day is impossible (because of the negative impact on the health of workers). For this reason,  they recommend to the employer to give the job to the workers so that they work in the polluted atmosphere not during entire shift, but only a part of the shift. The remaining time the employee needs to work in a non-polluted atmosphere (without the respirator). The fact that the employee is in a non-polluted atmosphere some part of working time provide additional protection of his health, and therefore, the requirements to the efficiency of the respirator may be less stringent.

The development of the Assigned PF in the United States and Britain were based on measurements of the effectiveness of respirators in the workplace (after statistical processing). Also used opinions of experts, based on the similarity of the respirators with different designs (for example, powered air purifying filtering respirators (PAPR), and a similar supplied air respirators SAR) - provided that the mode and the quantity of air supply, and the facepieces (masks) were the same. Experts in the two countries often used the results of the same studies of WPF (because of their limited number). For example, British standard&lt;ref name="BS-4275" /&gt; had been developed with usage of results of 1897 WPF measurements during 31 studies; and 23 of this 31 studies had been conducted in United States.

Therefore, the values of the assigned PF in the US and in the UK are evidence-based; and they are very similar to each other.

== The values of the APF in EU and other countries ==
Studies of respirator's performance was carried out not very often, and almost all of these studies were conducted in USA (and UK). It is possible that the lack of information about the RPD efficiency in the workplaces, was the reason behind developing these assigned PF in several European countries, whose values differ significantly from the evidence-based values of APFs in the US and UK.

Most European countries (except UK) did not conduct very complex and expensive studies on the effectiveness of respirators in the workplaces, or spent very little of such research. Therefore, it may be that some countries do not take full account of results of foreign researches (that showed a significant difference between the effectiveness of respirators in a laboratory environment; and in applying them in the workplaces). For example, after the study&lt;ref name="Tannahill-1990" /&gt; in 1990, the APF value of negative pressure full face masks was reduced from 900 to 40 (1997)&lt;ref name="BS-4275" /&gt; in UK. But in other countries, similar research was not carried out; and a similar decrease did not occur.

The study&lt;ref name="Tannahill-1990" /&gt; showed that the three models of full face masks had a significant leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and the face. The minimum values of the workplace protection factors (WPF) of each of the three negative pressure full face mask models were 11, 17 and 26. The maximum value of the WPF from one of the models did not exceed 500 no times at all. And for all results together, the WPF was not more than 100 in ~ 30% of the measurements. So, for this reason, the values of the APFs for this RPD type in Germany (400), Finland (500), Italy (400), and Sweden (500), may not fully take into account the lower this type respirators' performance at the workplace compared to the performance in the laboratory (during certification). The same was true for other RPD types and their APF.

State standard in [[India]]&lt;ref name="Стандарт Индия" /&gt; points to the need to use the workplace protection factors for restricting the permissible use of respirators, but does not set any values of the APFs. The standard also recommends the use of those PFs, which are obtained during the certification (in the laboratories, but not at workplaces). These values greatly exceed the values used in the USA and in the UK.

The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] version of the EU standard EN 529 does not set any values of the APFs for the selection of respirator in this country.&lt;ref name="Украина" /&gt; This document only listed the values of APFs in several European countries (for reference); and declares the inadmissibility of the use of laboratory efficiency for predicting the protective properties at the workplace.

The APFs are not developed in [[Russia|RF]],&lt;ref name="ГОСТ РФ" /&gt; in [[South Korea]], as well as in many other countries, and selection of respirators is not regulated by its national legislation. This contributes to errors, and the usage of such respirator's types, which are not able to reliably protect the workers due to its design (even at high quality of specific certified models).

|}

== The use of the APFs when selecting respirators for known workplace conditions ==
US law obliges the employer to accurately [[Exposure assessment|measure air pollution]] at workplaces. The results of such measurements are used to assess whether short-term inhalation of harmful substances lead to the death of the person, or irreversible and significant deterioration of his health ([[Immediately dangerous to life or health|IDLH concentrations]]). If concentrations exceed the IDLH, the standard allows the use of only the most reliable respirators - SAR or self-contained breathing apparatus: with pressure-demand air supply in the full facepiece mask ( §(d)(2)&lt;ref name="Standard-US" /&gt;).

If the concentration of harmful substance is less than IDLH, when one must determine the coefficient of air pollution for harmful substance (Hazard Factor), which is equal to the ratio of this concentration to the PEL (TLV, OEL) for the harmful substance. APF of selected respirator type must be equal or exceed the Hazard Factor
.&lt;ref name="NIOSH-2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIOSH-1987" /&gt;

If there are several harmful substances in the workplace air, then the selected respirator must run the following requirement:&lt;ref name="NIOSH-2004" /&gt;

C&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt;/(APF×PEL&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + C&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;/(APF×PEL&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt; ) + C&lt;sub&gt;'''3'''&lt;/sub&gt;/(APF×PEL&lt;sub&gt;'''3'''&lt;/sub&gt; ) + ... + Cn/(APF×PELn) ≤ 1

where C&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt; ... and Cn - concentrations of harmful substances number 1, 2 ... n; and [[Permissible exposure limit|PEL]] is the maximum allowable concentration for corresponding harmful substances in the breathing zone.

If this requirement is not met, the employer needs to choose a different type of respirator, which has a greater APF value.

In all cases, if employer select respirator with tight-fitting facepiece (full face mask, elastomeric half-mask or quarter-mask, or filtering facepiece respirator), all employee must be [[Respirator fit test|fit tested]] (''to prevent leakage unfiltered polluted air through gaps between their faces and the tight-fitting masks, which may not match to their faces''). Appendix A&lt;ref name="Standard-US" /&gt; provides a detailed description of this testing.

Values of IDLH concentrations and detailed recommendations for the selection of respirators (and self-rescuers) are available in the NIOSH directory.&lt;ref name="NIOSH-2007" /&gt;

== International standard for RPD selection and usage ==
[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is developing two international standard types, that governing the certification of respirators;&lt;ref name="ISO-17420" /&gt; and their selection and application&lt;ref name="ISO-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO-2" /&gt;

The standards governing the selection of respirators, uses the values of APF. But [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] spesialist criticue this documents.&lt;ref name="Clayton-2014" /&gt; These standards are set those values of Assigned Protection Factors that differ from those established in the US and the UK (evidence-based); and these values are set not for specific RPD type, but for any RPD, that met approval requirements:
{| class="wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed" style="text-align:center"
! colspan="3"| New ISO RPD classification and APF
|-
! ISO RPD type || ISO requirements for approval&lt;ref&gt;TIL, Total Inward Leakage (''of air pollution from breathing zone to in-mask cavity'') - the sum of its leakage through gaps betwing RPD mask and the face; and penetration through the air-purifying element.&lt;/ref&gt; || Protection level

|-
| PC3 || TIL &lt; 1% || 30
|-
| PC2 || TIL &lt; 5% || 10
|-
| PC1 || TIL &lt; 20% || 4
|}

The report concluded - new ISO standards are used insufficiently substantiated APF values, and M. Clayton made recommendation: do not use these values in practice, and to continue work on APF justification for the different types of respirators.

'''Saab Information Display''' ('''SID''') later also called "'''Saab Car Computer'''"&lt;ref&gt;1995 Saab 900SE owner's manual&lt;/ref&gt; ('''SCC''') is the name for various in-car computer systems found on most [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] automobiles beginning in 1985 with the [[Saab 9000]] and followed in 1994 with the [[Saab 900#Saab 900 NG (1994-1998)|Saab 900 NG]].

SIDs typically provide functions useful to the driver such as multiple [[Trip computer|trip]] [[odometer]]s, [[fuel efficiency]], estimated range ("distance to empty" – DTE), current [[Compact disk|CD]] [[Track (CD)|track]] or [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]], and also brief description of car system failures. SIDs designed prior to the full [[General Motors]] takeover of Saab in 2000 were mounted in the [[Center console (automobile)|center console]], usually just above the [[head unit]] and below climate control vents with the exception of 9000 models, possibly after the "facelift" in the early 1990s.

The 9000 featured the SID on the standard instrument cluster, with a car [[pictogram]], showing open doors/tailgate/boot (trunk), lamp failures and low [[oil pressure]] in red. If there were no warnings, the white pictogram would disappear. To the right of this was the data display in orange with green background data. This constantly showed instantaneous fuel consumption on an orange moving bar display with other parameters to its left such as alternator voltage, battery cranking voltage during start, outside temperature, estimated fuel range and average fuel consumption, cycled through by pressing an INFO button on the clock on the dashboard. Also displayed were engine check warnings. In addition, the analogue electric clock module could be replaced by a digital unit that scrolled SAAB across the orange [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display on startup before showing the time. This display featured digital trip functions such as distance to destination, average speed, estimated arrival time and adjustable speed warning settings, cycled through and set by pressing several buttons and retaining the R (reset) and INFO button for the instrument cluster. When fitted, the automatic climate control (as opposed to simple air conditioning) showed the selected temperature on green LEDs on the [[Automobile air conditioning#Automatic climate control|ACC]] unit fitted in the centre console in degrees C or F, selected by a nearby slide switch. Heated rear window (repeated on the main instrument cluster), heated door mirrors, ventilation outlet selections (including rear side window demist) and ACC mode were also indicated on the ACC unit by green LEDs next to the selector buttons (orange for the electrically heated items). Audio functions were displayed on the head unit, also in the centre console, such as FM Radio Station Name where [[Radio Data System|RDS]] was available (otherwise just the Radio Frequency) on a green [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]. CD track info was similarly displayed on the console mounted single CD player, where fitted, on its own green LCD. The 9000 SID was not noted for pixel failures since it appears not to be LCD based. Where a CD "pack" was fitted, it is assumed the track info would be displayed on the head unit. Reference: from personal ownership.

On 2003–2005 [[Saab 9-3]] models, the SID was temporarily moved to the top of the [[dashboard]] just below the [[windshield]], in an enclosed hump facing the driver.

GM began moving SIDs in all Saabs to the [[electronic instrument cluster]], just above the [[steering wheel]], as stock GM navigation and/or audio head units replaced the Saab-designed units in the center console. The 2005 - 2006 [[Subaru Impreza (second generation)#Saab 9-2X|Saab 9-2X]] did not feature an authentic SID, having a less [[feature-rich]] [[Subaru]] unit instead as it was basically a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] 2nd generation Subaru Impreza with some styling changes.

[[Image:SaabInformationDisplay-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|SID-2 in a 1995 Saab 900SE, showing check warning and some pixel failure.]]
Saab Information Displays from 1994–2003 commonly suffer from an [[Electrical breakdown#Electrical system failure|electrical system failure]] that results in some or all of the on-screen [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD) pixel lines becoming invisible, rendering the SID difficult to read or, in some cases, entirely unusable. The problem is most often caused not by [[defective pixel]]s, but by some or all of the LCD's [[flexible flat cable]] ([[ribbon cable]]) contacts separating from the main [[logic board]].

Several third party vendors offer a service to permanently fix broken SIDs, for a fee.

The frequency of the problem strongly suggests a [[Product defect|design flaw]],{{Or|date=May 2011}} but Saab/GM has never issued a [[product recall]].

'''Sabre Global Distribution System''', owned by [[Sabre Corporation|Sabre Holdings]], is used by travel agents around the world with more than 400 airlines, 220,000 hotels, 42 car rental brands, 38 rail providers and 17 cruise lines. The Sabre [[Global distribution system|GDS]] enables companies such as [[American Airlines]] to search, price, book, and ticket travel services provided by airlines, hotels, car rental companies, rail providers and tour operators.

Sabre Holdings aggregates airlines, hotels, online and offline travel agents and travel buyers. The company is organized into three business units:

*Sabre Travel Network: global distribution system
*Sabre Airline Solutions: airline technology
*Sabre Hospitality Solutions: hotel technology solutions

The company is headquartered in [[Southlake, Texas]], and has employees in various locations around the world.

==History==
Sabre Holdings' history starts with '''SABRE''' ''('''S'''emi-'''a'''utomated '''B'''usiness '''R'''esearch '''E'''nvironment)'', a [[computer reservation system]] which was developed to automate the way [[American Airlines]] booked reservations.

In the 1950s, American Airlines was facing a serious challenge in its ability to quickly handle airline reservations in an era that witnessed high growth in passenger volumes in the airline industry. Before the introduction of SABRE, the airline's system for booking flights was entirely manual, having developed from the techniques originally developed at its [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] reservations center in the 1920s.  In this manual system, a team of eight operators would sort through a rotating file with cards for every flight. When a seat was booked, the operators would place a mark on the side of the card, and knew visually whether it was full. This part of the process was not all that slow, at least when there were not that many planes, but the entire end-to-end task of looking for a flight, reserving a seat and then writing up the ticket could take up to three hours in some cases, and 90 minutes on average. The system also had limited room to scale. It was limited to about eight operators because that was the maximum that could fit around the file, so in order to handle more queries the only solution was to add more layers of hierarchy to filter down requests into batches.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

American Airlines had already attacked the problem to some degree, and was in the process of introducing their new [[Reservisor#Magnetronic Reservisor|Magnetronic Reservisor]], an electromechanical computer, in 1952 to replace the card files. This computer consisted of a single [[magnetic drum]], each memory location holding the number of seats left on a particular flight. Using this system, a large number of operators could look up information simultaneously, so the ticket agents could be told over the phone whether a seat was available. On the downside, a staff member was still needed at each end of the phone line, and actually handling the ticket still took considerable effort and filing. Something much more highly automated was needed if American Airlines was going to enter the [[jet age]], booking many times more seats.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

It was during the testing phase of the Reservisor that a high-ranking [[IBM]] salesman, Blair Smith, was flying on an [[American Airlines]] flight from [[Los Angeles]] back to IBM in [[New York City]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Different sources disagree on many of the dates. Some place the project starting in 1953, some 1957, some place the original system in Manhattan, others Briarcliff. For instance [http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9906/29/1960.idg/ this CNN story] places the start date in 1960 and the cost at $150 million. The Serling book uses November 5, 1959 as the date of the announcement of the joint development and 1962 as the date of the first SABRE reservation taken at the Hartford Reservations office.&lt;/ref&gt;  He found himself sitting next to American Airlines president [[C. R. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.umn.edu/107637 Oral history interview with R. Blair Smith].  [[Charles Babbage Institute]], University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.  Smith discusses how a chance meeting with C. R. Smith, president of American Airlines, eventually led to the development of the SABRE system.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noting that they shared a family name, they began talking.&lt;ref&gt;The official corporate history of American Airlines, ''Eagle'', by Robert Serling, published in 1985 by St. Martin's/Marek, recounts the story of the meeting on page 347, and indicates it was between C. R. Smith and IBM president [[Thomas J. Watson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Just prior to this chance meeting, [[IBM]] had been working with the [[United States Air Force]] on their [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) project. SAGE used a series of large computers to coordinate the message flow from [[radar]] sites to [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]]s, dramatically reducing the time needed to direct an attack on an incoming bomber. The system used [[teleprinter]] machines located all around the world to feed information into the system, which then sent orders back out to teleprinters located at the fighter bases. It was one of the first [[online]] systems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

It was not lost on either man that the basic idea of the SAGE system was perfectly suited to American Airlines' booking needs. Teleprinters would be placed at American Airlines' ticketing offices to send in requests and receive responses directly, without the need for anyone on the other end of the phone. The number of available seats on the aircraft could be tracked automatically, and if a seat was available the ticket agent could be notified instantly. Booking simply took one more command, updating the availability and even printing out the ticket for them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Only 30 days later IBM sent a research proposal to American Airlines, suggesting that they really study the problem and see if an "electronic brain" could actually help. They set up a team consisting of IBM engineers led by John Siegfried and a large number of American Airlines' staff led by Malcolm Perry, taken from booking, reservations and ticket sales, calling the effort the ''Semi-Automated Business Research Environment'', or SABRE.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A formal development arrangement was signed in 1957, and the first experimental system went online in 1960, based on two [[IBM 7090]] mainframes in a new data center located in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. The system was a success. Up until this point, it had cost the astonishing sum of $40 million to develop and install (about $350 million in 2000 dollars). The SABRE system by IBM in the 1960s was specified to process a very large number of transactions, such as handling 83,000 daily phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Head, Robert V. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The system took over all booking functions in 1964, at which point the name had changed to the more familiar SABRE.&lt;ref&gt;After the name of the system was changed to Sabre, American Airlines' official definition of the [[acronym]] was "Semi-Automated Business Research Environment".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the system was migrated to IBM [[System/360]] systems in a new underground location in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. [[Max Hopper]] joined American Airlines in 1972 as director of Sabre, and pioneered its use.&lt;ref&gt;John Desmond. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SMG/is_n2_v9/ai_7349011/ Max Hopper knows Sabre's 'software guts': American pushing limits of software at 2,000+ TPS – transactions per second]. Software Magazine. February, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally used only by American Airlines, the system was expanded to travel agents in 1976.

With SABRE up and running, IBM offered its expertise to other airlines, and soon developed [[Deltamatic]] for [[Delta Air Lines]] on the [[IBM 7074]], and [[PANAMAC]] for [[Pan American World Airways]] using an [[IBM 7080]]. In 1968, they generalized their work into the [[Programmed Airline Reservation System|PARS]] (Programmed Airline Reservation System), which ran on any member of the IBM [[System/360]] family and thus could support any sized airline. The operating system component of PARS evolved into [[Airlines Control Program|ACP]] (''Airlines Control Program''), and later to [[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]] (''Transaction Processing Facility''). Application programs were originally written in [[assembly language]], later in [[SabreTalk]], a proprietary dialect of [[PL/I]], and now in [[C (programming language)|C]] and C++.

By the 1980s, SABRE offered airline reservations through the [[CompuServe|CompuServe Information Service]], and the Prodigy Internet Service [[GEnie]] under the Eaasy SABRE brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=950DE0D6163AF930A15751C1A96F948260|title=More Trips Start at a Home Computer|author=Philip S.

Lewis|publisher=New York Times|date=1992-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service was extended to [[America Online]] in the 1990s.

American and Sabre separated on March 15, 2000. Sabre had been a publicly traded corporation, [[Sabre Holdings]], stock symbol TSG on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] until taken private in March 2007. The corporation introduced the new logo and changed from the all-caps acronym "SABRE" to the mixed-case "Sabre Holdings", when the new corporation was formed. The [[Travelocity]] website, introduced in 1996, was owned by Sabre Holdings. [[Travelocity]] was acquired by [[Expedia]] in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/expedia-buys-travelocity-for-280-million-in-cash/?_r=1|title=Expedia Buys Travelocity for $280 million in cash|author=Michael J. De La Merced|publisher=New York Times|date=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabre Holdings' three remaining business units, Sabre Travel Network, Sabre Airline Solutions and Sabre Hospitality, today serves as a global travel technology company.  The system connects more than {{formatnum:57, 000}} travel agents and millions of travelers with more than 400 airlines, 90,000 hotels, 30 car-rental companies, 200 tour operators, and dozens of railways, ferries and cruise lines.

==Controversy==
A 1982 study&lt;ref&gt;"November Line of Sale Analysis", memo to R. E. Murray from S. D. Nason, American Airlines, Dec. 3, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; by American Airlines found that travel agents selected the flight appearing on the first line more than half the time.  Ninety-two percent of the time, the selected flight was on the first screen.  This provided a huge incentive for American to manipulate its ranking formula, or even corrupt the search algorithm outright, to favor American flights.

At first this was limited to juggling the relative importance of factors such as the length of the flight, how close the actual departure time was to the desired time, and whether the flight had a connection, but with each success American became bolder.  In late 1981, [[New York Air]] added a flight from [[LaGuardia Airport|La Guardia]] to [[Detroit]], challenging American in an important market.  Before long, the new flights suddenly started appearing at the bottom of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;"Motion of the Justice Department for an Extension of Time," in "Re Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking – Airline Computer Reservations System," Docket 41686, Civil Aeronautics Board, Oct. 5, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  Its reservations dried up, and it was forced to cut back from eight Detroit flights a day to none.

On one occasion, Sabre deliberately withheld [[Continental Airlines|Continental]]'s discount fares on 49 routes where American competed.&lt;ref&gt;Memo from J. L. Ott to L. A. Iovinelli ''et al.,'' "Subject: Continental Fares", American Airlines, Dec. 1, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Sabre staffer had been directed to work on a program that would automatically suppress any discount fares loaded into the computer system.

Congress investigated these practices and in 1983 [[Bob Crandall]], president of American, was the most vocal supporter of the systems. "The preferential display of our flights, and the corresponding increase in our market share, is the competitive ''raison d'être'' for having created the system in the first place," he told them. Unimpressed, in 1984 the United States government outlawed screen bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Truxal |first1=Steven |title=Competition and Regulation in the Airline Industry: Puppets in Chaos |chapter=Development of practical and strategic alliances |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Routledge |date=4 Jan 2013 |page=49 |accessdate=2017-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after biases were eliminated, travel agents using the system leased and serviced by American were significantly more likely to choose American over other airlines.  The same was true of United and its [[Apollo Reservation System|Apollo system]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The airlines referred to this phenomenon as the "halo" effect.&lt;ref&gt;Sabre (as with other Global Distribution Systems, such as [[Amadeus (computer system)|Amadeus]], [[Galileo (computer system)|Galileo]], and [[Worldspan]]) facilitates the sale of seats under airline [[codeshare]] agreements.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairness rules were eliminated or allowed to expire in 2010. By then, none of the major distribution systems was majority owned by the airlines.&lt;ref&gt;The original notice of rule making is available from the U.S. Department of Transportation at {{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/CRSrule.htm |accessdate=May 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406033413/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/CRSrule.htm |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |df= }}, and a PDF document of the final rule is at {{cite web|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/specialreports/GDSrule.pdf |accessdate=May 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702174342/http://www.travelweekly.com/specialreports/GDSrule.pdf |archivedate=July 2, 2006 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Sabre's success of selling to European travel agents was inhibited by the refusal of big European carriers led by [[British Airways]] to grant the system ticketing authority for their flights even though Sabre had obtained [[IATA]] Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) clearance for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1986. American brought High Court action which alleged that after the arrival of Sabre on its doorstep [[British Airways]] immediately offered financial incentives to travel agents who continued to use [[Travicom]] and would tie any override commissions to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201976.html |title=Flight Global |publisher=Flight Global |date=1987-10-10 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travicom was created by [[Videcom international|Videcom]], [[British Airways]] and [[British Caledonian]] and launched in 1976 as the world's first multi-access reservations system based on Videcom technology which eventually became part of [[Galileo (computer system)|Galileo]] UK. It connected 49 subscribing international airlines (including [[British Airways]], [[British Caledonian]], [[TWA]], [[Pan American World Airways]], [[Qantas]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Air France]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]], [[Air Canada]], [[KLM]], [[Alitalia]], [[Cathay Pacific]] and [[Japan Airlines|JAL]]) to thousands of travel agents in the UK. It allowed agents and airlines to communicate via a common distribution language and network, handling 97% of UK airline business trade bookings by 1987.

[[British Airways]] eventually bought out the stakes in Travicom held by [[Videcom international|Videcom]] and [[British Caledonian]], to become the sole owner. Although Sabre's vice-president in London, David Schwarte, made representations to the U.S. Department of Transportation and the British Monopolies Commission, British Airways defended the use of Travicom as a truly non-discriminatory system in flight selection because an agent had access to some 50 carriers worldwide, including Sabre, for flight information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1988/1988%20-%200486.html |title=Flight Global |publisher=Flight Global |date=1988-02-27 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies''''' is a 2014 book by the Swedish philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] from the [[University of Oxford]]. It argues that if machine brains surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new [[superintelligence]] could replace humans as the dominant lifeform on Earth. Sufficiently intelligent machines could improve their own capabilities faster than human computer scientists,&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/021d3484-fd1d-11e3-8ca9-00144feab7de.html Financial Times review], July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and the outcome could be an existential catastrophe for humans.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henderson|first1=Caspar|title=Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom and A Rough Ride to the Future by James Lovelock – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/superintelligence-nick-brostrom-rough-ride-future-james-lovelock-review|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bostrom's book has been translated into many languages and is available as an audiobook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/superintelligent-swede-snapped-oup|title=Superintelligent Swede snapped up by OUP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/Superintelligence-Audiobook/B00LPMD72K/|title=Superintelligence Audiobook - Nick Bostrom - Audible.com|work=Audible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
It is unknown whether human-level [[artificial intelligence]] will arrive in a matter of years, later this century, or not until future centuries. Regardless of the initial timescale, once human-level machine intelligence is developed, a "superintelligent" system that "greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest" would follow surprisingly quickly, possibly even instantaneously. Such a superintelligence would be difficult to control or restrain.

While the ultimate goals of superintelligences can vary greatly, a functional superintelligence will spontaneously generate, as natural subgoals, "instrumental goals" such as self-preservation and goal-content integrity, cognitive enhancement, and resource acquisition. For example, an agent whose sole final goal is to solve the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (a famous unsolved, mathematical [[conjecture]]) could create, and act upon, a subgoal of transforming the entire Earth into some form of [[computronium]] (hypothetical "[[programmable matter]]") to assist in the calculation. The superintelligence would proactively resist any outside attempts to turn the superintelligence off or otherwise prevent its subgoal completion. In order to prevent such an [[existential risk|existential catastrophe]], it might be necessary to successfully solve the "AI control problem" for the first superintelligence. The solution might involve instilling the superintelligence with goals that are compatible with human survival and well-being. Solving the control problem is surprisingly difficult because most goals, when translated into machine-implementable code, lead to unforeseen and undesirable consequences.

==Reception==
The book ranked #17 on the ''New York Times'' list of best selling science books for August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/best-selling-science-books.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3As&amp;_r=0 |title=Best Selling Science Books |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 8, 2014 |website=New York Times |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, [[business magnate]] [[Elon Musk]] made headlines by agreeing with the book that artificial intelligence is potentially more dangerous than nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/article4166795.ece|title=Artificial intelligence ‘may wipe out the human race’|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-may-be-more-dangerous-than-nukes/|title=Elon Musk tweets Artificial Intelligence may be "more dangerous than nukes"|date=4 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/outing-a-i-beyond-the-turing-test/?_r=0|title=The New York Times Blog|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bostrom’s work on [[superintelligence]] has also influenced [[Bill Gates]]’s concern for the existential risks facing humanity over the coming century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/01/28/bill-gates-also-worries-artificial-intelligence-is-a-threat/|title=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines |title=The Fiscal Times |publisher= The Fiscal Times|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2015 interview with [[Baidu]]'s CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" ''Superintelligence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG0ZjUfOBUs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=17m35s |title=Baidu CEO Robin Li interviews Bill Gates and Elon Musk at the Boao Forum, March 29 2015 |publisher= YouTube|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science editor of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' found that Bostrom’s writing "sometimes veers into opaque language that betrays his background as a philosophy professor" but convincingly demonstrates that the risk from superintelligence is large enough that society should start thinking now about ways to endow future machine intelligence with positive values.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;
A review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' pointed out that "even the most sophisticated machines created so far are intelligent in only a limited sense" and that "expectations that AI would soon overtake human intelligence were first dashed in the 1960s", but finds common ground with Bostrom in advising that "one would be ill-advised to dismiss the possibility altogether".&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt;

Some of Bostrom's colleagues suggest that nuclear war presents a greater threat to humanity than superintelligence, as does the future prospect of the weaponisation of [[nanotechnology]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/superintelligence-nick-brostrom-rough-ride-future-james-lovelock-review Guardian review], July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' stated that "Bostrom is forced to spend much of the book discussing speculations built upon plausible conjecture... but the book is nonetheless valuable. The implications of introducing a second intelligent species onto Earth are far-reaching enough to deserve hard thinking, even if the prospect of actually doing so seems remote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clever cogs|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21611037-potential-impacts-intelligent-machines-human-life-clever-cogs|accessdate=9 August 2014|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=9 August 2014|quote=It may seem an esoteric, even slightly crazy, subject. And much of the book’s language is technical and abstract (readers must contend with ideas such as "goal-content integrity" and "indirect normativity"). Because nobody knows how such an AI might be built, Mr Bostrom is forced to spend much of the book discussing speculations built upon plausible conjecture. He is honest enough to confront the problem head-on, admitting at the start that "many of the points made in this book are probably wrong."  But the book is nonetheless valuable. The implications of introducing a second intelligent species onto Earth are far-reaching enough to deserve hard thinking, even if the prospect of actually doing so seems remote. Trying to do some of that thinking in advance can only be a good thing.}} [http://www.businessinsider.com/intelligent-machines-and-human-life-2014-8 Syndicated] at [[Business Insider]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Bailey]] wrote in the libertarian ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that Bostrom makes a strong case that solving the AI control problem is the "essential task of our age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Ronald|title=Will Superintelligent Machines Destroy Humanity?|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/09/12/will-superintelligent-machines-destroy-h|accessdate=16 September 2014|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tom Chivers of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the book is difficult to read, but nonetheless rewarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chivers|first1=Tom|title=Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom, review: 'a hard read'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11021594/Superintelligence-by-Nick-Bostrom-review-a-hard-read.html|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=10 August 2014|quote=If you’re looking for a friendly, accessible introduction to AI issues, then this is probably not the place to start. But if you’re interested in this topic, and you’re prepared to do a bit of mental spadework, it is rewarding.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army]] '''tactical reconnaissance and counter-concealment-enabled radar''' – '''TRACER''' is a mid-range, long wavelength [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) system that provides all-weather persistent surveillance developed by the [[United States Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center]]'s [[Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate]]. The '''TRACER''' program began in April 2007 and has been integrated onto a [[Beechcraft C-12 Huron|C-12 Huron]]. In the fall of 2010, it is planned to test TRACER on [[NASA]]{{’}}s unmanned [[Predator-B]] [[IKHANA]], and later on [[Air Warrior]].&lt;ref name = Kushiyama&gt;Kushiyama, Kristen. "High-Tech Radar Cuts Through The “Foliage”." CERDEC U.S.ARMY RDECOM. United States Army, June 7, 2010. Web. June 18, 2010. &lt;http://www.cerdec.army.mil/news/hightechradar.asp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its decreased size, weight and power consumption compared to the predecessor [[foliage-penetrating radar]] program, or FOPEN which has been in the field since the late-90s, '''TRACER''' operates on manned and unmanned platforms and produces images on board in less than five minutes. As a follow-on to FOPEN, the '''TRACER''' system can be tailored to specific missions by providing a variety of SAR images including strip maps and spotlight and circle images.&lt;ref name = Kushiyama/&gt;

'''The Green Grid''' is a nonprofit, industry consortium of end-users, policy-makers, technology providers, facility architects, and utility companies collaborating to improve the resource efficiency of [[data center]]s. 
At one time it had more than 175 member companies.

As business demands increase, so does the number of data center facilities which house a rising amount of IT equipment. Data center managers run into resource limits on electrical power, cooling, and space.

==History==
An initial announcement in April 2006 included members [[Advanced Micro Devices]],  [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard]],  [[IBM]], and [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Tech Giants to Unveil Power-Usage Plan:  AMD, IBM, Rivals To Focus on Efficiency Of Servers, Data Centers|author= Don Clark and Jim Carlton |work= The Wall Street Journal |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117244447482018755 |accessdate= June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were soon joined by [[Intel]] and [[Microsoft]].
By February 26, 2007, [[APC by Schneider Electric]],  [[Rackable Systems]], SprayCool (later part of [[Parker Hannifin]]),  and [[VMware]] had joined the effort, and a meeting in April 2007 was announced.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Green Grid Plans First Technical Summit |work= eWeek |url= http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Infrastructure/Green-Grid-Plans-First-Technical-Summit/ |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130122131337/http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Infrastructure/Green-Grid-Plans-First-Technical-Summit/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date= January 22, 2013 |date= April 10, 2007 |author= Chris Preimesberger |accessdate= June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In March, 2011, the Green Grid proposed a new sustainability metric, Water Usage Effectiveness ([[WUE]]), which attempts to take into account the amount of water used by data centers in their cooling systems&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreengrid.org/en/Global/Content/white-papers/WUE Green Grid website, 'WP#35-Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE™): A Green Grid Data Center Sustainability Metric, retrieved 4 Sep 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal design''' is the [[design]] of buildings, products or environments to make them [[accessibility|accessible]] to all people, regardless of age, [[disability]] or other factors.

The term "universal design" was coined by the [[architect]] [[Ronald Mace]] to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_us/usronmace.htm |title=Ronald L. Mace on NC State University, College of Design |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of ''Designing for the Disabled'' (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the [[curb cut|dropped curb]] – now a standard feature of the built environment.

Universal design emerged from slightly earlier '''barrier-free''' concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and [[adaptive technology|adaptive]] and [[assistive technology]] and also seeks to blend [[aesthetics]] into these core considerations. As [[life expectancy]] rises and [[modern medicine]] increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments.

Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example.  [[Contrast (vision)|Color-contrast]] dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another.  There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's [[public transit]] systems, low-floor [[bus]]es that "kneel" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with [[Wheelchair ramp|ramp]]s rather than on-board lifts.

==Principles==
The Center for Universal Design at [[North Carolina State University]] expounds the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/ |title=Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Social equality|Equitable]] use
# [[Flexibility (engineering)|Flexibility]] in use
# [[Simplicity|Simple]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]]
# [[Perception|Perceptible]] information
# [[fault tolerance|Tolerance for error]]
# Low physical effort
# Size and space for approach and use

Each principle above is succinctly defined and contains a few brief guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm |title=The Principles of Universal Design Version 2.0 |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date=1997-04-01 |accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be applied to design processes in any realm: physical or digital.

These principles are broader than those of [[accessible design]] and barrier-free design.

==Goals of Universal Design==
In 2012, The Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access at [[The University at Buffalo]] expanded definition of the principles of universal design to include social participation and health and wellness. Rooted in evidence based design, the 8 goals of universal design were also developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universaldesign.com/what-is-ud/ |title=The Goals of Universal Design |publisher=Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access |date=April 10, 2012 |access-date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

# Body Fit
# Comfort
# Awareness
# Understanding
# Wellness
# Social Integration
# Personalization
# Cultural Appropriateness

The first four goals are oriented to human performance: [[anthropometry]], [[biomechanics]], [[perception]], [[cognition]]. Wellness bridges human performance and social participation. The last three goals addresses social participation outcomes. The definition and the goals are expanded upon in the textbook "Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1=Steinfeld | editor-first1=Edward | editor-last2=Maisel | editor-first2=Jordana | title=Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments | publisher=Wiley | date=April 10, 2012 | pages=408 pages }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* Smooth, ground level entrances without stairs
* Surface textures that require low force to traverse on level, less than 5 pounds force per 120 pounds rolling force
* Surfaces that are stable, firm, and slip resistant per ASTM 2047
* Wide interior doors (3'0"), hallways, and alcoves with 60" × 60" turning space at doors and dead-ends
* Functional clearances for approach and use of elements and components
* Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs
* Single-hand operation with closed fist for operable components including fire alarm pull stations
* Components that do not require tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist
* Components that require less than 5 pounds of force to operate
* Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches
* Buttons and other controls that can be distinguished by touch
* Bright and appropriate lighting, particularly task lighting
* Auditory output redundant with information on visual displays
* Visual output redundant with information in auditory output
* Contrast controls on visual output
* Use of meaningful icons with text labels
* Clear lines of sight to reduce dependence on sound
* Volume controls on auditory output
* Speed controls on auditory output
* Choice of language on speech output
* Ramp access in swimming pools
* Closed [[captioning]] on television networks
* Signs with light-on-dark visual contrast
* Web pages that provide alternative text to describe images
* Instruction that presents material both orally and visually
* Labels in large print on equipment control buttons
* A museum that allows visitors to choose to listen to or read descriptions

==Design standards==
In 1960, specifications for barrier free design were published. It was a compendium of over 11 years of disability ergonomic research. In 1961, the specifications became the first Barrier Free Design standard called the American National Standard, A1171.1 was published. It was the first standard to present the criteria for designing facilities and programs for the use of disabled individuals. The research started in 1949 at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] and continues to this day. The principal investigator is Dr. [[Timothy Nugent]] (his name is listed in the front of the 1961, 1971, 1980 standard). In 1949 Dr. [[Timothy Nugent|Nugent]] also started the [[National Wheelchair Basketball Association]]. This [[ANSI]] A117.1 standard was adopted by the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] [[General Services Administration]] under 35 FR 4814 - 3/20/70, 39 FR 23214 - 6/27/74, 43 FR 16478 ABA- 4/19/78, 44 FR 39393 7/6/79, 46 FR 39436 8/3/81, in 1984 for UFAS and then in 1990 for ADA. The archived research documents are at the [[International Code Council]] (ICC) - ANSI A117.1 division. Dr. [[Timothy Nugent|Nugent]] made presentations around the globe in the late 50's and 60's presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design.

Another comprehensive publication by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] published three editions 1963, 1967, 1976 and 1997 of Designing for the Disabled by [[Selwyn Goldsmith]] UK. These publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities. Both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder.

Disability ergonomics should be taught to designers, engineers, non-profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities.

In October 2003, representatives from [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] met in [[Beijing, China|Beijing]] and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use. Their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers, among other areas, standards on containers and wrappings of household goods (based on a proposal from experts in Japan), and standardization of signs for public facilities, a subject which was of particular interest to China as it prepared to host the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

The [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization]], and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] have developed:

==Design for All (DfA)==
The term '''Design for All''' (DfA) is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products, services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation. "Design for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality" (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). According to the [[European Commission]], it "encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone: technologies that are suitable for the [[elderly]] and people with [[disabilities]], as much as the teenage techno wizard."&lt;ref name="European Commission"/&gt; The origin of Design for All&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibletourism.org/resources/uk_museumsand-galleries_disability_directory_pdf_6877.pdf |title=The UK Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  lies in the field of barrier free [[accessibility]] for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design.

===Background===
''Design for All'' has been highlighted in Europe by the European Commission in seeking a more user-friendly society in Europe.&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;European Commission: [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/policy/accessibility/dfa/index_en.htm Design for All (DfA)].&lt;/ref&gt; Design for All is about ensuring that environments, products, services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances.

Design for All has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi-ethnic composition. It follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market. Easy-to-use, accessible, affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens. Design for All permits access to the built environment, access to services and user-friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons. Including Design for All early in the design process is more cost-effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market. This is best achieved by identifying and involving users ("stakeholders") in the decision-making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision-makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of Design (for All) in a wide range of socio-economic situations.

===Examples===
The following examples of Designs for All were presented in the book ''Diseños para todos/Designs for All'' published in 2008 by Optimastudio with the support of Spain's Ministry of Education, Social Affairs and Sports (IMSERSO) and CEAPAT:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optimastudio.com/disenosparatodos Feo, Roberto &amp; Hurtado, Rosario &amp; Optimastudio ''Diseños para Todos/Designs for All'' Madrid 2008] {{ISBN|978-84-691-3870-0}} Downloadable free version of ''Designs for All''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In information and communication technology (ICT)===
{{Main article|Design for All (in ICT)}}

Design for All criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the [[Information society]]. The European Union refers to this under the terms eInclusion and eAccessibility. A three-way approach is proposed: goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or, failing that, products being easy to adapt according to different needs, or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology. To this end, manufacturers and service providers, especially, but not exclusively, in the [[Information and Communication Technologies]] (ICT), produce new technologies, products, services and applications for everyone.&lt;ref name="European Commission" /&gt;

===European DfA organizational networks===
In Europe, people have joined in [[Social network|networks]] to promote and develop Design for All:

*The European Design for All eAccessibility Network (EDeAN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edean.org/ European Design for All eAccessibility Network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211231505/http://www.edean.org/ |date=December 11, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched under the lead of the European Commission and the European Member States in 2002. It fosters Design for All for eInclusion, that is, creating an information society for all. It has national contact centres (NCCs) in almost all EU countries and more than 160 network members in national networks.
*EIDD - Design for All Europe is a [[NGO]] and a 100% self-financed European organization that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD), to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2016) has 31 member organizations in 20 European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfaeurope.eu|title=Design for All Europe|author=|date=|website=EIDD - DfA Europe|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EuCAN - The European Concept for Accessibility Network started in 1984 as an open network of experts and advocates from all over Europe in order to promote and support the Design for All approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eca.lu|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.eca.lu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordination work of EuCAN and the functioning of the network are mainly voluntary work. In 1999 the Luxembourg Disability Information and Meeting Centre (better known by its acronym “Info-Handicap”) took over the coordination of the steering group, together with the implicit responsibility for the follow-up of the [[European Concept for Accessibility]] (ECA). The EuCAN publications - like ECA - aim to provide practical guidance. They are neither academic nor policy documents.

==The "Barrier-Free" concept==
'''{{Nihongo|Barrier-free|バリアフリー|bariafurii}}''' building modification consists of modifying [[building]]s or facilities so that they can be used by people who are [[disabled]] or have physical impairments. The term is used primarily in Japan and non-English speaking countries (e.g. German: Barrierefreiheit; Finnish: Esteettömyys), while in English-speaking countries, terms such as "accessibility" and "handicapped accessible" dominate in regular everyday use. An example of barrier-free design would be installing a [[Wheelchair ramp|ramp]] for [[wheelchair]]s alongside or in place of steps. In the case of new buildings, however, the idea of barrier free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design, which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access.

Freeing a building of barriers means:
* Recognizing the features that could form barriers for some people
* Thinking inclusively about the whole range of impairments
* Reviewing everything - from structure to smallest detail
* Seeking feedback from users and learning from mistakes

Barrier free is also a term that applies to handicap accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] Guidelines don't make specifications.

An example of a country that has sought to implement barrier-free accessibility in housing estates is Singapore. Within five years, all public housing estates in the country, all of 7,800 blocks of apartments, have benefited from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mndsingapore.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/making-hdb-towns-user-friendly/|title=Making HDB Towns User Friendly|author=|date=19 November 2012|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urea nitrate''' is a fertilizer-based [[high explosive]] that has been used in [[improvised explosive device]]s in [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iraq]], and various other [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts elsewhere in the world, like the [[1993 World Trade Center bombings]].&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|

Urea nitrate is produced in one step by reaction of [[urea]] with [[nitric acid]].  This is an [[exothermic reaction]], so steps must be taken to control the temperature.

Urea nitrate explosions may be initiated using a blasting cap.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity" /&gt;

==Chemistry==
Urea contains a [[Carbonyl|carbonyl group]]. The more electronegative oxygen atom pulls electrons away from the carbon forming a greater electron density around the oxygen, giving the oxygen a partial negative charge and forming a polar bond. When nitric acid is presented,  it ionizes. A hydrogen cation contributed by the acid is attracted to the oxygen and forms a covalent bond [electrophile H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]. The electronegative NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion then is attracted to the positive hydrogen ion. This forms an ionic bond and hence the compound urea nitrate.

(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO (aq) + HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COHNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s)

The compound is favored by many amateur explosive enthusiasts as a principal explosive for use in larger charges. In this role it acts as a substitute for ammonium nitrate based explosives. This is due to the ease of acquiring the materials necessary to synthesize it, and its greater sensitivity to initiation compared to ammonium nitrate based explosives.

'''World of Knowledge''' is a global Wikipedia inspired commercial project to enhance learning developed by company '''WOKcraft''' based on a community of users creating multiple choice questions for free public use. The abbreviation for the project is '''WOK''' and used to market quiz game mobile apps in a social network called the [[Knowledge Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=WOKwiki App Turns Wikipedia Into a Game|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wokwiki-app-turns-wikipedia-into-a-game-on-january-15-565300941.html|accessdate=14 January 2016|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all WOK apps the connection to Wikipedia is used by in coexistence with the multiple choice questions and Wikipedia content of articles and images using Wikipedia live content.

WOK develops [[mobile apps]] in a ecosystem that are connected with the same scoresystem and with Wikipedia articles using the [[open API]] from [[Wikimedia Commons]].

==History==

The WOK project was started by the founder Erik Bolinder in 2009. During several years he planned to create a system for social network based on learning and knowledge. After extensive travel around the World a team was found in [[Cairo]] for developing the first WOK related product called Wokcraft.com, WOKquiz and WOKbattle in 2012-2013. All initial projects were cancelled and redeveloped in 2014 when the app Quiz King was launched.

In 2015 the app WOKwiki was developed and launched on the 15th Anniversary of Wikipedia. In 2017 the app was renamed to WikiMaster. In late 2016 the app WikiFlip was launched as the third app in the WOK ecosystem of quiz apps. All apps have been developed for Android and iOS mobile smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia's Smart Apps|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2016/jan/23/Wikipedias-Smart-Apps-872601.html|accessdate=23 January 2016|publisher=[[The New Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All apps in WOK are based on the database of multiple choice questions with four alternatives, one being factually correct and three alternatives being incorrect. No direct relation to Wikipedia articles on questions exists other than keywords that are the same as Wikipedia articles.

In the WikiMaster app a full Wikipedia access is to be found in 11 languages. Quizzes exist in 4 languages, English being the largest with 300000 questions indexed.

WOKcraft has also developed an API that could be used in Wikipedia making all WOK questions available in Wikipedia without the need for access to apps from WOKcraft.

Critics among the Wikipedia community project point to the commercial interests the WOK project  based on which is not in line with the Wikipedia Foundation principles being a nonprofit organization.

Enhancers to the WOK project point to the fact that learning is in coexistence with control questions in text books at the end of chapters and this would be useful to Wikipedia users if accessed and that WOK has been free to use without any advertising or subscription model just as Wikipedia. WOK has developed an API for the Wikipedia community to implement free public access to the questions in WOK so Wikipedia users could use questions in Wikipedia articles.

The [[crowd sourced]] system of content used by Wikipedia articles is similar in WOK. All questions in WOK can be traced to a log file of creators, date and content. Wokers correct questions that are incorrect in spelling or content and are not fact based with a reliable source. All users of the WOK community can create and send questions in the WikiMaster app. 
During 2017 WOK plans to enlarge the existing database of questions currently available in English, Arabic, Swedish and French to Hindu, Portuguese and Spanish.

==Apps==
===''WikiMaster''===
[[File:WikiMaster.png|thumb]]
WikiMaster app was launched as WOKwiki on 15 January 2016 in [[Google Play]] and [[AppStore]]. In early 2017 the app changed name to WikiMaster. In WikiMaster you have access to Wikipedia in 11 languages. All Wikipedia articles can be found by a search function using the API provided by Wikipedia. On top of a Wikipedia article a function of quiz is added. If questions exist in WOK database and are indexed with same keyword or tag as the name of the Wikipedia article by any user the question is available in the Wikipedia article and a quiz exist to this Wikipedia article. If no questions are indexed, no quiz is available. Only the members of WOK add questions and tags. No bot or automatic procedure is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WOKwiki application learning|url=http://teknewlogy.it/wokwiki-applicazione-apprendimento|accessdate=15 January 2016|publisher=teknewlogy.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On all Wikipedia articles questions can be created with a five step by step procedure. A question created can be tagged by any other woker enhance the questions in other related articles on a broad and granular level. A question about a football player can be adequately tagged to the Wikipedia article Sport, Associated Football, a club in which the football player play in, a championship related to the question as well as the article about the football player him/herself and so on. The usefulness of WOK is therefore similar to Wikipedia over time in sense the more questions on top of Wikipedia articles, the more useful for the community finding relevant content to be quizzed in for educational purpose like learning a subject in education. Questions can have images attached from [[Wikimedia Commons]]. No other images can be uploaded to questions, thus enhance the interconnection with Wikipedia.

All quiz in WikiMaster can be played alone by the registered user or played with other wokers in a challenge. Challenges are independent of time for each woker to play. All WOKer get points called WOkbits based on correct questions, created questions, challenge wins and alerts. And notifications of events as common in social media apps. All WOKbits counts in a universal score-system in all apps. A WikiMaster can be reached on allocated WOKbits on article level, in a city, country or the World. And on different time periods.

===''WikiFlip''===
[[File:WikiFlip.png|thumb]]
WikiFlip is an app developed by WOKcraft in the end of 2016 aiming to use the images uploaded to Wikipedia Commons and used as a part of questions in WOK added in WikiMaster. With over 80000 questions in database with images associated from Wikimedia Commons, WikiFlip user can search any Wikipedia article and find questions in WOK related and take them by a clic on the image.

Using Wikimedia Commons images uploaded by users in Wikipedia community and questions created by the WOK community WikiFlip benefit the learning process by many students in need for learning in a new way. WOK claim to have "released the images captured by the Wikipedia text". Any answered flips can be reviewed and tags associated with the question can be flipped or the Wikipedia article opened in WikiMaster.

WOKers can reach as many correct questions flipped as possible in a row.

===''Quiz King''===
[[File:Quiz King.png|thumb]]
Quiz King is the first app developed by WOK that is still in AppStore and Google Play in 2014. The quiz game is based on questions from the WOK community.  Players play 5 rounds with four questions from a main category, chosen out of 22 categories. Each player chose a category and answer same questions in the round. The quicker correct answer is given, the more WOKbits is given.

'''Zytel''' is a trademark owned by [[DuPont]] and used for a number of different high strength, abrasion and impact resistant [[thermoplastic]] [[polyamide]] formulations of the family more commonly known as [[nylon]]. The Zytel product line is based mostly on [[nylon 66]], but also includes grades based on nylon 6 as a matrix, long chain nylons such as nylon 610 (if based on at least one renewable monomer they are branded Zytel RS), and copolymers including a transparent resin called Zytel 330.  Resins based on [[polyphthalamide|polyphthalamides]] are branded 'Zytel HTN'.  The Zytel product range takes advantage of the fact that nylons are one of the most compatible polymers with modifiers and so offers grades  with varying degrees of [[fiberglass]], from 13% to 60%, (to increase stiffness and strength), [[Rubber toughening|rubber toughened]] resins, [[Flame retardant|flame retarded]] grades. Nylon resins with mineral reinforcement are branded 'Minlon'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plastics.dupont.com/myplastics/Mediator?id=5047&amp;p=1&amp;locale=en_US|title=Plastics, Polymers &amp; Resins - DuPont Performance Materials - DuPont USA|first=|last=workflow-process-service|website=plastics.dupont.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Properties==
The properties of Zytel will vary with the specific formulation.  Formulation  Zytel HTN 35% Glass Reinforced Resin, consisting of 35% glass fiber by weight, has a [[tensile strength]] of around 30kpsi and a [[flexural modulus]] of 1500kpsi under room temperature conditions.  Zytel also offers good chemical resistance to common chemicals such as [[motor oil]], [[transmission fluid]], and [[methanol]], and shows little [[thermal expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plastics.dupont.com/myplastics/Mediator?id=1245&amp;locale=en_US#propcompare|title=Plastics, Polymers &amp; Resins - DuPont Performance Materials - DuPont USA|first=|last=workflow-process-service|website=plastics.dupont.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other additives or treatments may be used to increase toughness, wear resistance, and temperature tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1342|title=Polymers in Ski Equipment|date=2 April 2002|website=AZoM.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
*An early example of plastic bicycle wheels, using fiberglass reinforced Zytel, were Skyway "Tuff Wheels" for BMX bicycles. In this role any weight penalty was adequately compensated by durability and impact resistance.
*Former American 200m and 400m sprinter [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] used shoes made of Zytel at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympics]]. The special gold-colored shoes were made by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and weighed just 85&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name="gold"&gt;{{cite news| last =Christie| first =James| title =Bailey's Shoes Go High-Tech: Spikes to be ready for Skydome sprint| publisher =[[The Globe and Mail]]| date =8 April 1997| url =http://www.omni-lite.com/press1.php| format =reprint|accessdate =4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Zytel is often used for folding [[knife]] handles; [[Benchmade]], [[Grohmann Knives|Grohmann]], [[Leatherman| Leatherman Tool Group]], [[Smith &amp; Wesson]], [[Fallkniven]], [[Gerber Legendary Blades]], SARGE Knives, [[Cold Steel]], [[CRKT]] and [[SOG Specialty Knives]] (among many others) use fiberglass-filled versions of Zytel in many of their lightweight pocket knives
*Zytel is also used for the projectile in some [[less lethal]] 12 [[gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] [[shotgun shell]]s
*The intake manifold of the [[PT Cruiser]] GT is made of Zytel, as is an oil conduit in a [[Volkswagen]] transmission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plastics.dupont.com/myplastics/Mediator?id=5040&amp;p=1&amp;locale=en_US|title=Plastics, Polymers &amp; Resins - DuPont Performance Materials - DuPont USA|first=|last=workflow-process-service|website=plastics.dupont.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rollerblade]] Aggressive inline skates use Zytel in the Grind Plates.
*Zytel is used in the frame and grip assemblies in many of the firearms manufactured by [[Kel-Tec]] CNC Corporation.
*The original Laser roller skates had the plates and trucks made from Zytel.
*Zytel is used as the frame of many handguns, including the [[Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P]] And the Ruger 22/45 target pistols. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smith-wesson.com/wcsstore/SmWesson/upload/other/MP_TECH_SPECS.pdf|title=MEET THE M&amp;P FROM SMITH &amp; WESSON|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
