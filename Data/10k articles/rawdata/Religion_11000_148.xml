There he married a fellow Russian émigré in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=ACA/&gt;

Less than a year later, he chose to move to China,&lt;ref name=ACA/&gt; where he entered the world of [[Shanghai]]'s academia and, together with other highly qualified Jewish musicians (i.e., [[Alfred Wittenberg]], [[Walter Joachim]], [[Arrigo Foa]], etc.), who had fled the Russian [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]], trained a number of young Chinese musicians in classical music, who in turn became leading musicians in contemporary China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA156,M1 Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

'''Anian I ''' was [[Archdeacon of St Asaph|Bishop]] of the [[Diocese of St Asaph]] between 1249 and 1266.&lt;ref name=CathHierAnianI&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/banians.html Catholic Hierarchy: "Bishop Anian"] retrieved January 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to his appointment he was known as Einion ap Maredudd. Anian was appointed in a time of relative peace, with the area under the authority of the crown. When Llywelyn ap Gruffydd began his campaign to control the area in 1256 Anian was persuaded to remain faithful to the crown, in return for the King's protection. By 1261 however, Llywelyn's position had grown stronger, as did Anian's own support for him, "standing as head of a panel of arbitrators chosen by the parties to settle matters in dispute between the prince and Bishop Richard of Bangor (Rhyd-yr-arw, 28 and 29 April)", and acknowledging Llywelyn's authority without question. On his death in 1266 he was succeeded by John II.

The '''Bagh Caves''' are a group of nine rock-cut monuments, situated among the southern slopes of the [[Vindhyas]] in [[Bagh, Dhar|Bagh]] town of [[Dhar district]] in Madhya Pradesh state in central [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dhar.nic.in/visit.htm#tab=1&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments are located at a distance of 97&amp;nbsp;km from [[Dhar]] town. These are renowned for [[mural]] [[paintings]] by master painters of ancient India. The use of the word "cave" is a bit of a misnomer, since these are not natural, but instead examples of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]. 
The Bagh caves, like those at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], were excavated by master craftsmen on perpendicular sandstone rock face of a hill on the far bank of a seasonal stream, the Baghani. [[Buddhist]] in inspiration, of the nine caves, only five have survived. All of them are '[[vihara]]s' or resting places of monks [[monasteries]] having quadrangular plan. A small chamber, usually at the back, forms the '[[chaitya]]', the prayer hall. Most significant of these five extant caves is the Cave 4, commonly known as the ''Rang Mahal'' (Palace of Colors). 

The Bagh Caves were quarried in the 5th -6th century AD, in the very late stages of Buddhism in India, and long after most of the [[Indian rock-cut architecture|Indian Buddhist Caves]] had been built, many of them since the 2nd or 1st centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dutt |first1=Sukumar |title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture |date=1988 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe |isbn=9788120804982 |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxRHYFd0fB4C&amp;pg=PA162 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Paintings==
The paintings on the wall and ceilings of the ''vihara''s of Bagh, the fragments of which are still visible in Cave 3 and Cave 4 (remnants seen also in Caves 2, 5 and 7), were executed in tempera. These paintings are materialistic rather than spiritualistic.The ground prepared was a reddish-brown gritty and thick mud plaster, laid out on the walls and ceilings. Over the plaster, lime-priming was done, on which these paintings were executed. Some of the most beautiful paintings were on the walls of the portico of Cave 4. To prevent further loss of the values of Indian classical art, most paintings were carefully removed in 1982 and today can be seen in [[Gujari Mahal Archaeological Museum|Archaeological Museum of Gwalior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/India/MadhyaPradesh/Bagh.htm | title = Bagh Caves – rock cut Buddhist temples | accessdate = 23 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
An copperplate inscription of Maharaja Subandhu, recording his donation for the repair of the ''vihara'' was found at the site of Cave 2. Though, the date of the Bagh inscription is missing, his Badwani copperplate inscription is dated in the year (Gupta era) 167 (487). So the repair of Cave 2 took place in the late 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Verma, Archana (2007).

Though mentioned in the Bahá'í ({{lang-de|Bahaitum}}) literature in the 19th century, the '''Bahá'í Faith in Germany''' begins in the early 20th century when two emigrants to the United States returned on prolonged visits to [[Germany]] bringing their newfound religion.

===Early phase===
{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
[[Ibrahim George Kheiralla]], an early Bahá'í from Lebanon, traveled through Germany in 1892 attempting to making a living but found no interest in his inventions and moved on to the [[United States]] in February, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Two in particular traveled back to Germany: Edwin Fischer and Alma Knobloch. Dr. Edwin Fischer, a dentist, had emigrated in 1878 from Germany to [[New York City]], became a Bahá'í there, and then returned to [[Stuttgart]] in 1905. Fisher used every opportunity, including talking with his patients, to mention the [[Bahá'í teachings]], and in time a few Germans embraced the religion.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{Cite news

The second spiritual assembly in Germany was founded in 1909 in [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]].

In the [[German Colony, Haifa|German Colony]] in Palestine, as part of the worldwide [[:Category:German diaspora|German diaspora]], "Frau Doktor Fallscheer" was the [[family physician]] for the family of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son of the founder of the religion.

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to Germany===
`Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, visited Germany for 8 days in 1913, including visiting Stuttgart, Esslingen and [[Bad Mergentheim]].&lt;ref name="b_end"/&gt; During this visit he spoke to a youth group as well as a gathering of [[Esperantists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The seventh of the tablets mentioned [[Europe]]an regions and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The seventh tablet was translated and presented on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919 and mentioned Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God!

`Abdu'l-Bahá praised the German Bahá'ís - "individuals...endued with perceptive eyes and attentive ears" were "attracted to the principles of the oneness of mankind" and treated "all the peoples and kindreds of the earth in a spirit of concord and fellowship."

As World War I was becoming more widespread in its ramifications, the Bahá'ís pursued other courses of action. In 1916 a plaque was raised to honor `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit at Bad Mergentheim.&lt;ref name="plaque"&gt;{{Cite news | author = German Bahá'í News Service | title = German town re-erects monument | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | date = 2007-04-25 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 23, 1916, Austrian Franz Pöllinger learned of the religion while staying in Stuttgart and on returning to [[Austria]] had a prominent role in the growth of the religion there.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 700–704, 800–802, 825 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/693-719.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = L.

===Post-War closing===
After WWI, the national Bahá'í community organized a German Bahá'í Publishing Trust&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; and in 1920 [[Adelbert Mühlschlegel]] became a Bahá'í, and later appointed as a [[Hand of the Cause]], individuals who have been considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion.

===Inter-war period===
In 1921 a new magazine ''Sun of Truth'' was first published as one of five Bahá'í journals produced by German Bahá'ís through the 1920s.&lt;ref name="cent"/&gt; It contained newly translated Bahá'í literature and news from the Bahá'í community around the world.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

In 1923 the first Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assemblies]] were elected  "where conditions are favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size".&lt;ref name="admin"/&gt; Along with [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith in the United Kingdom|British Isles]], the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Germany and Austria was first elected in that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22  The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963], Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land, pages 22 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 there were 95 delegates who performed the election.&lt;ref name="admin"/&gt; A 1925 list of local Bahá'í Centers mentions no less than 26 in Germany, compared to three in [[England]] and two in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="cent"/&gt; In late 1926&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Miss Martha Root in Northern Europe | journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1927 | pages = 6–8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Miss Martha Root | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1929 | page = 8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely traveled [[Martha Root]] spoke in most German universities and technical colleges. [[Eugen Schmidt (Bahá'í)|Eugen Schmidt]], the second of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís, became a Bahá'í and was elected a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany from 1932 for many years and served as chairman in the decisive years of re-building after World War II.&lt;ref name="xviii"/&gt;

Among the Bahá'ís to visit Germany were [[Amelia Collins]], [[Marion Jack]] and Louisa Mathew Gregory, wife of [[Louis George Gregory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = International Community | first = Bahá'í | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Baha'i group pays homage to a heroine | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | date = 2005-08-03 | url = http://www.BahaiWorldNews.org/story.cfm?storyid=385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Bahá'í with links to Germany was [[Robert Sengstacke Abbott]] whose adoptive father was German and, through his family connection, he kept in contact with his family in Germany.&lt;ref name="door"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Perry | first = Mark | title = Robert S.

===National Socialist period===
During the early Nazi period Bahá'ís had general freedom; [[May Maxwell]], wife of [[William Sutherland Maxwell]], was still able to travel through Germany in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Compiled by Universal House of Justice | title = May Ellis Maxwell | work = Biographies | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url = http://bahai-library.com/may_ellis_maxwell_bw | accessdate = 2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the plaque commemorating `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit had been taken down.&lt;ref name="plaque"/&gt; By 1937 however, [[Heinrich Himmler]] signed an order disbanding the Bahá'í Faith's institutions in Germany&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; because of its 'international and pacifist tendencies'.&lt;ref name="Kolarz"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kolarz | first = Walter | authorlink =Walter Kolarz | title =Religion in the Soviet Union |publisher =St. Martin's Press | series =Armenian Research Center collection | year = 1962 | pages = 470–473 {{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|url =https://www.questia.com/read/419296/religion-in-the-soviet-union}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 and in 1942 there were sweeping arrests of former members of the National Spiritual Assembly. In May 1944 there was a public trial in [[Darmstadt]] at which Dr. Hermann Grossmann was allowed to defend the character of the religion but the Bahá'ís were instead heavily fined and its institutions continued to be disbanded. However for this service and others, Grossmann was ranked as the third of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="xviii"/&gt;

===After the National Socialist period===
Following the fall of Nazi Germany, an American Bahá'í, John C. Eichenauer who was a [[medic]] of the [[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th Infantry]] division then at [[Geislingen an der Steige|Geislingen]] started searching for the Bahá'í community in Stuttgart. He drove through Stuttgart looking and asking for Bahá'ís and was able to find an individual by nightfall/curfew. The next day saw the first meeting of Bahá'ís since their disbandment in 1937.  Two other American Bahá'ís, Bruce Davison and Henry Jarvis, in [[Frankfurt]] and [[Heidelberg]] respectively, also connected with the Bahá'í community in Germany. At the beginning of the [[History of Germany since 1945|partition of Germany]] there were about 150 German Bahá'ís in the American section and they became registered with the American authorities. The National Spiritual Assembly was re-elected in 1946&lt;ref name="hann"/&gt; and by 1950 there were 14 Local Spiritual Assemblies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_statistics_1844-1950 | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = Bahá'í Faith, The: 1844-1950 | location = Wilmette, IL | publisher =  Bahá'í Publishing Committee | year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[West German]] Bahá'ís were given the responsibility of trying to strengthen the Bahá'í community in [[Russia]] in 1963. During the 1960s and 1970s, a small number of Bahá'ís visited the [[Soviet Union]] as tourists but no attempt was made to promulgate the religion.

The writings of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and `Abdu'l-Bahá in the late 19th century and early 20th century contain some prophecies regarding Germany.  The first mention related to Germany in the Bahá'í Faith is when the founder of the religion, Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]] in 1873:
&lt;blockquote&gt;O banks of the [[Rhine]]! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of [[Berlin]], though she be today in [[German Empire|conspicuous glory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1912, shortly before visiting Germany, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke of the increasing tensions in Europe:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''pura''' is a [[Bali]]nese [[Hindu temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bali3000.com/all-about-bali/Temples.asp |title=Temples in Bali |publisher=Bali Directory |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511065215/http://www.bali3000.com/all-about-bali/Temples.asp |archivedate=2010-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the place of worship for the adherents of [[Balinese Hinduism]] in [[Indonesia]]. Puras are built in accordance to rules, style, guidance and rituals found in [[Balinese architecture]]. Most of the puras are found on the island of [[Bali]], as Hinduism is the predominant religion on it; however many puras exist in other parts of Indonesia where there are significant numbers of [[Balinese people]]. [[Mother Temple of Besakih]] is the most important, the largest and holiest temple in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/indonesia/mt-agung-pura-besakih |title=Mount Agung and Pura Besakih|publisher=Sacred Destinations|date=|accessdate=2010-07-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100711182312/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/indonesia/mt-agung-pura-besakih| archivedate= 11 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of puras have been built in Bali, leading it to be titled "the Island of a Thousand Puras".

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ulun Temple on Lake Bratan (7609679414).jpg|upright|thumb|The [[pagoda]]-like [[Meru tower|Pelinggih Meru]] shrine of [[Pura Ulun Danu Bratan]] is a distinctive feature of a Balinese temple.]]
The term '''''pura''''' originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word (''-pur, -puri, -pura, -puram, -pore''), meaning "city", "walled city", "towered city", or "palace". During the development of the [[Balinese language]] the term ''pura'' came to refer to a religious temple complex, while the term ''puri'' came to refer to [[palace]], the residence of kings and nobles, similar to [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]s.

== Design and layout==
[[File:Bali temple diagram.png|thumb|upright|Balinese temple layout, arranged in three zones (''mandalas'')]]
Unlike the common towering indoor Hindu temples of the [[Indian Subcontinent]], puras are designed as an open air place of worship within enclosed walls, connected with a series of intricately decorated gates between its compounds. These walled compounds contain several shrines, ''[[Meru tower|meru]]'' (towers), and ''bale'' (pavilions). The design, plan and layout of the pura follows the ''trimandala'' concept of Balinese space allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19670648/Traditional-Balinese-Architecture |title=Traditional Balinese Architecture |publisher=School of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, Udayana University|date=|accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[mandala]] zones arranged according to a sacred hierarchy:
# '''''Nista mandala (jaba pisan)''''': the outer zone, which directly connects the pura compound with the outer realm, and the entrance to the temple. This zone usually takes the form of an open field or a garden that can be used for religious dance performances, or act as an additional space for preparations during religious festivals.
# '''''Madya mandala (jaba tengah)''''': the middle zone of the temple, where the activity of adherents takes place, and also the location for supporting facilities of the temple. In this zone usually several pavilions are built, such as the ''[[bale kulkul]]'' (wooden [[Slit drum]] tower), ''bale gong'' ([[gamelan]] pavilion), ''[[wantilan]]'' (meeting pavilion), ''bale pesandekan'', and ''bale perantenan'', the temple's kitchen. 
# '''''Utama mandala (jero)''''': the holiest and the most sacred zone within the pura. This enclosed and typically highest of the compounds usually contains a ''[[Acintya|padmasana]]'', the towering [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] throne of the highest god, [[Acintya]] (the [[Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa]], or "All-in-one God", in modern Balinese), the ''[[pelinggih meru]]'' (a multi-tiered tower-shrine), and several pavilions, such as ''bale pawedan'' ([[veda|vedic]] chanting pavilion), ''bale piyasan'', ''bale pepelik'' (offering pavilion), ''bale panggungan'', ''bale murda'', and ''gedong penyimpenan'' (storehouse of the temple's relics).

However, the layout rules for arrangements the facilities of the two outer zones, nista mandala and madya mandala, are somewhat flexible. Several structures, such as the bale kulkul, could be built as outer corner tower; also, the perantenan (temple's kitchen) could be located in the Nista mandala.

=== Gates ===

[[File:Taman Ayun, Bali, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[Pura Taman Ayun]]]]
There are two types of gates within [[Balinese architecture]]: the split gate, known as ''[[candi bentar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indo.com/culture/temples.html |title=Bali:The Land of Temples|publisher=Indo.com|date=|accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the roofed tower gate known as [[paduraksa|''paduraksa'' or ''kori agung'']]. Both types of gates have specific roles in Balinese architectural design. Candi bentar is the gate used in the nista mandala, while the kori agung is employed as the gate between the madya mandala and Utama mandala inner compounds. The rules for gate types are also valid for non-religious compounds such as puri, nobles' and kings' residences.

== Types of pura ==
There are several types of pura, each serving certain functions of Balinese rituals throughout the [[Saka calendar|Balinese calendar]]. The Balinese temples are arranged according to the physical and spiritual realm of Balinese people, which corresponds to ''kaja-kelod'' sacred axis, from mountain tops the realms of gods, [[hyang]] spirits, the middle fertile plain the realm of humans and other beings, all the way to the beach and ocean, and the many realms in [[Indonesia]]. 
; ''Pura kahyangan jagad'': Pura that are located in the mountainous region of the island, built upon mountain or volcano slopes. The mountains are considered as the sacred magical and haunted realm, the abode of gods or [[hyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babadbali.com/pura/kahyangan_jagat.htm|title=Babad Bali - Pura Kahyangan Jagat|website=www.babadbali.com|language=id|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important pura kahyangan in Bali is [[Mother Temple of Besakih]] complex on the slopes of [[Mount Agung]]. Another example is [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]] on slopes of [[Mount Salak]], West Java.
; ''Pura tirta'': "Water temples", a type of pura that other than religious function, also have water management function as part of [[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system. The priests in these temples have authority to manage the water allocation among rice paddies in the villages surrounds the temple. Some tirta temples are noted for its sacred water and having ''petirtaan'' or sacred bathing pool for cleansing ritual. Other water temple are built within lakes, such as [[Pura Ulun Danu Bratan]]. The best example of this type of temple is [[Pura Tirta Empul]].
; ''Pura desa'': A type of pura dedicated to the worship of [[Brahma]] the Gods and deities, that are located within villages or cities, serving as the center of Balinese people's religious activities.
; ''Pura puseh'': A type of pura dedicated to the worship of [[Vishnu]].
; ''Pura dalem'': A type of pura dedicated to the worship of [[Shiva]], [[Durga]], Mother nature, Banaspatiraja (barong), Sang Bhuta Diyu, Sang Bhuta Garwa, and other deities, Usually Shiva's shakti, [[Durga]], is venerated in this temple. In human life cycle, the temple is connected to rituals concerning death. It is also common for a pura dalem to have a big tree like a banyan tree or a kepuh which is usually also used as a shrine. The Pura Dalem is typically located next to the graveyard of the deceased prior to ''[[ngaben]]'' (cremation) ceremony.
; ''Pura mrajapati'': A type of pura to worship ''[[prajapati]]'' (the lord of people) or the cosmic might. Most often, in this temple Shiva is worshipped in his form as ''prajapati''.
; ''Pura segara'': "Sea temples", a pura that are located by the sea to appease the sea Gods and deities. It is usually important during the [[Melasti]] ritual. One example of this type of temple is Pura [[Tanah Lot]] and Pura Uluwatu.

== Sad Kahyangan ==
The ''Sad Kahyangan'', ''Sad Kahyangan Jagad'' or the "six sanctuaries of the world" are the six holiest places of worship on Bali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredsites.com/asia/bali/sacred_sites.html |title=Sacred Sites of Bali|publisher=Sacred Sites|date=|accessdate=2010-07-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100721020216/http://www.sacredsites.com/asia/bali/sacred_sites.html| archivedate= 21 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Balinese beliefs, they are the pivotal points of the island, and are meant to provide spiritual balance to Bali. The number of these most sacred sanctuaries always adds up six, but depending on the region, the specific temples that are listed may vary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balix.com/travel/guide/chapters/religion/religion_temple.html Balinese temples]&lt;/ref&gt; A list of the Sad Kahyangan may include:

== Sea Temples ==
[[File:1 pura tanah lot2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Pura Tanah Lot]]
Bali has a number of important "sea temples" (Balinese: ''pura segara''), which were founded in the 16th century by a [[Majapahit]] [[Brahmin]] from [[Java (island)|Java]], named [[Nirartha]], to honour the gods of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baliblog.com/travel-tips/bali-travel/balinese-culture/temples/important-balinese-temples.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the temples is traditionally said to be visible from the next, forming a 'chain' around the coast of Bali. Many of the most important sea temples are located along the south-west coast of the island. The temples' positions were meant to provide a chain of spiritual protection for the Bali island.

Listed counterclockwise from Nirartha's legendary point of arrival in Bali, some of the most prominent Balinese sea temples include:

* [[Pura Pulaki]] near [[Pemuteran]], northeast of Gilimanuk ({{Coord|8|8|44|S|114|40|50|E}}).
* [[Pura Gede Perancak]], to the south of [[Negara, Bali|Negara]] ({{coord|8|24|5|S|114|36|40|E|}}).
* [[Pura Rambut Siwi]], to the east of [[Negara, Bali|Negara]] ({{Coord|8|24|11|S|114|45|59|E}}) &lt;br/&gt;At this site Nirartha is said{{By whom|date=November 2009}} to have made a gift of a lock of his hair, which was worshipped. ''Rambut Siwi'' translates as 'worship of the hair'&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.baliwww.com/guides/527/&lt;/ref&gt; and the tale is reminiscent of the Buddhist story of [[Gautama]] giving eight hairs to [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Tapussa and Bhallika]], which are now enshrined at [[Shwedagon]].
* Pura [[Tanah Lot]], west of [[Canggu]] and south of [[Tabanan|Tabanan city]] where two puras were built on a coastal rock overlooking the [[Indian Ocean]] as the shrine to honor sea deities. ({{Coord|8|37|16|S|115|5|12|E}}).
* [[Pura Luhur Uluwatu]], at the southwestern extremity of the [[Bukit Peninsula]] ({{coord|8|49|44|S|115|5|7|E|}}). This is the only Balinese sea temple that is also one of the six Balinese directional temples.
* [[Pura Mas Suka]], at the southern tip of the [[Bukit Peninsula]], near Greenbowl Beach ({{Coord|8|50|52|S|115|10|11|E}}).
* [[Pura Sakenan]] on [[Serangan Island|Serangan island]], an island between [[Tanjung Benoa]] and [[Sanur, Bali|Sanur]] ({{Coord|8|43|31|S|115|13|47|E}}).

The '''Beasts of Satan''' ({{lang-it|Bestie di Satana}}) were a satanic group, members of which were tried and convicted of a series of [[Satanism|satanic]] [[ritual murder]]s between 1998 and 2004.&lt;ref name="jailed"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/italy/story/0,,1420295,00.html Satanist band members jailed for ritual killings] Guardian Unlimited February 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The slayings were called "one of the most shocking crimes in [[History of the Italian Republic|post-war Italy]]" by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="investigate"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4446342.stm Investigating the 'death metal' murders] Sam Bagnall BBC News November 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes and investigation==

===First murders===
The first incident was a January 1998 double homicide that occurred in the woods near [[Somma Lombardo]], northwest of [[Milan]]. Chiara Marino, shop assistant, aged 19, and her boyfriend Fabio Tollis, a 16-year-old student and heavy metal musician, were [[Human sacrifice|sacrificially]] stabbed and beaten in a drug-fueled [[occult]] rite involving [[sex]] and heavy metal music. 
The young couple had spent a normal Saturday night drinking beer and listening to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music at ''Midnight Pub'', which was the center of the city's metal scene, but never returned home. Both Tollis and Marino were stabbed to death by their friends Andrea Volpe, Nicola Sapone and Marco Maccione. 
Fabio Tollis, a sturdy young man (6 feet and 2 inches tall, 220 pounds) desperately tried to defend himself and his girlfriend Marino but was overpowered by the larger group. Maccione, Sapone and Volpe later buried the corpses in a large grave in the woods and danced on the graves, laughing and screaming "''Now you're both zombies! Try to get out of this hole, if you dare!''".
The conclusion initially drawn by the authorities at the time was that they had run away together for a love affair, as their friend suggested, but this explanation was not accepted by Tollis' father, Michele Tollis, who began his own investigation. 
Just a few hours before the murder, Nicola Sapone forced Fabio Tollis to call home and tell his father he did not intend to come back home that evening because he preferred sleeping with his girlfriend. Michele Tollis, realizing something was not right with the call he received, immediately reached back out to his son at the ''Midnight'' to have a word with him. Unfortunately, it was too late: Fabio and Chiara had already left with their presumed friend for [[Somma Lombardo]] and never came back again. 
Michele Tollis discovered just how deeply they had become involved in satanism and the occult, both common themes of the [[black metal]] and [[death metal]] genres that his son and friends were interested in. Becoming convinced of a connection between satanism and their disappearance, Michele Tollis spent the next six years steadily  constructing a file on their activities and the bands in which they had played. When the third murder occurred, Tollis took his findings to the police, who used them to link all three murders to Andrea Volpe and the wider satanic sect.&lt;ref name="investigate" /&gt;

===Third murder and revelations===
The third murder was committed in January 2004. Mariangela Pezzotta, 27-year-old shop assistant, prior girlfriend of group member Andrea Volpe was first shot in the throat and later buried while she was still alive in a greenhouse in the nearby town of [[Golasecca]] not far from [[Somma Lombardo]]. Andrea Volpe was arrested shortly after with his young fiancée, an 18-year-old high school student named Elisabetta Ballarin, the daughter of an upper-class family who had run away from home with Volpe when she was just a teenager. Both Volpe and Ballarin were upset{{clarify|date=June 2018}}{{clarify|date=June 2018}} because of alcohol and drug addiction. Volpe confessed he invited Pezzotta for a friendly dinner but had already decided to kill her because she knew too many details about the sect and Tollis and Marino's murder. Volpe shot her after a violent fight, then rang Sapone up for help and they realized that, though in agony, Pezzotta was still alive. Volpe recalled that Sapone accused him "''You can't even kill a person!''" and threatened him; they tried hard to hide the dying girl's body in the greenhouse of Ballarin's parents' home and hit her several times with a heavy spade before burying her still alive. After that, Sapone came back home and pretended nothing had happened. Hours later Volpe and Ballarin took a heavy dose of [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] and decided to get rid of Pezzotta's car by driving it into a nearby river but they had a car crash and were arrested. 
The police investigation of the Pezzotta murder, and interrogation of Volpe using the information provided by Tollis led to the discovery of the buried bodies of Marino and Tollis and the revelation of the sect's existence. As the investigation continued, Pietro Guerrieri, who presented himself as "the medium" of the group and had been regarded by Tollis as his best friend, confessed to having beaten Fabio to death with a hammer, after Volpe and Sapone had stabbed him and Chiara Marino.&lt;ref name="investigate" /&gt;

Additionally sect members were accused of pushing their drummer, Andrea Bontade, to commit [[suicide]] because he refused to join Volpe and Sapone at [[Somma Lombardo]] and help them kill Marino and Tollis. In September 1998, Andrea Bontade drank heavily, then killed himself by crashing his car. Authorities also investigated whether the group had any links to a possible wider network of Satanists in Italy.&lt;ref name="jailed" /&gt;

==Trials==
On February 22, 2005 Andrea Volpe and Pietro Guerrieri were sentenced in the northern city of [[Busto Arsizio]] to 30 and 16 years imprisonment respectively. Volpe, in addition to the 1998 murders, was also found guilty of the 2004 slaying of Pezzotta. In Volpe's case the sentence was a decade longer than requested by prosecutors. A third suspect, Mario Maccione, had also confessed to the murders, but was cleared due to his secondary role in the crimes.&lt;ref name="jailed" /&gt;

The reactions of the victims' families to the sentencing were mixed. Michele Tollis, the father of Fabio, said "Today justice rewarded me." Lina Marino, mother of the slain Chiara, was outraged at the relatively light sentences Volpe and Guerrieri had received, due to their cooperation with prosecutors. She stated "They are murderers. It's not fair."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4287995.stm Italian 'Beasts of Satan' jailed] BBC News February 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Five more members of the group went to trial in June 2005 and were sentenced to long prison terms in early 2006. Nicola Sapone, leader of the group and the person suspected as the mastermind behind the killings, received a [[life sentence]]. The other four, Paolo Leoni, Marco Zampollo, Eros Monterosso and Elisabetta Ballarin, received sentences between 24 and 26 years for their role in all three murders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4669944.stm Italy jails five Satanic killers] BBC News February 1st, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 2007 the Court of Appeal confirmed the life sentence for Sapone and lengthened the convictions of the other three members of the group: Paolo Leoni passed from 26 years to a life sentence, Marco Zampollo from 26 years to 29 years and 2 months and Eros Monterosso from 24 years to 27 years and 3 months; the sentence for Elisabetta Ballarin was reduced from 24 years and 3 months to 23 years.  On May 2008 the last step, Court of Cassazione, confirmed all the Appeal's decisions.

==Reaction==
The crimes occurred against a background of growing concern in Italy that Satanism and the occult were becoming increasingly attractive to Italian youth. In February 2005, a [[Roman Catholic]] [[university]] connected to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] began offering a two-month course on [[Spirit possession|diabolical possession]] and [[exorcism]] for [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]]s and [[seminarians]]. In reaction to the crimes, priest Don Aldo Buonaito called for [[death metal]] to be banned, saying "If music makes itself an instrument of nefarious deeds and death, it should be stopped."&lt;ref name="investigate" /&gt;
In light of revelations from the Beasts of Satan investigation and trial, as well as growing public concern, Italian police stated their intention to create a special unit focusing on new religious sects, particularly Satanists and other violent ritualistic groups. It would coordinate nationwide investigations into potentially dangerous [[new religious movements]], and planned to include [[psychologists]] and a priest who is an expert on the occult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6168827.stm Italy police seek 'Satan squad'] Mark Duff BBC News December 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8980">[[File:JCH at Podium.jpg|thumb|Pastor [[John Hagee]], 2007]]
The '''blood moon prophecy''' was a series of [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic beliefs]] promoted by Christian ministers [[John Hagee]] and Mark Biltz, which state that a [[Tetrad (astronomy)|tetrad]] (a series of four consecutive [[lunar eclipse]]s—coinciding on [[Jewish holidays]]—with six full moons in between, and no intervening partial lunar eclipses) which began with the [[April 2014 lunar eclipse]] is a sign of the beginning of the [[end times]] as described in the Bible in the [[Book of Joel]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 2:20, and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 6:12. The tetrad ended with the [[September 2015 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse on September 27–28, 2015]].
==Overview==
On April 15, 2014, there was a total lunar eclipse which was the first of four consecutive total eclipses in a series, known as a tetrad; a second one took place on October 8, 2014, the third one on April 4, 2015, and the remaining one took place on September 27, 2015. It is one of eight tetrads to take place during the 21st century AD.&lt;ref name=EarthSky /&gt; As with most lunar eclipses, the moon appeared red during the April 15, 2014, eclipse.&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt;&lt;ref name=RNS /&gt; The red color is caused by [[Rayleigh scattering]] of sunlight through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the same effect that causes sunsets to appear red.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news|title=Blood moon eclipse on April 15 is a special event|date=April 3, 2014|work=USA Today|author=Elizabeth Weise|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/04/03/lunar-eclipse-april-15-blood-moon/7210901/|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagee also connects the [[solar eclipse of March 20, 2015]], in the middle of the sequence.

The idea of a "blood moon" serving as an omen of the coming of the end times comes from the [[Book of Joel]], where it is written "the sun will turn into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Joel|2:31|WEB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase is again mentioned by [[Saint Peter]] during [[Pentecost]], as recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|2:20|WEB}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Peter says that the date of Pentecost, not some future date, was the fulfillment of [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]]'s prophecy. The blood moon also appears in the Book of Revelation chapter 6 verses 11 – 13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+6:11-13&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 6:11-13 - King James Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; where verse 12 says " And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood".

Around 2008, Biltz began predicting that the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus would occur in the fall of 2015 with the seven years of the great tribulation beginning in the fall of 2008. He said he had "discovered" an astronomical pattern that predicted the next tetrad would coincide with the end times. When the prediction failed, he pulled the article from his website, but continued to teach on the "significance" of the tetrad.

Hagee would later seize on Biltz' prediction to write ''Four Blood Moons'', which would become a best seller, spending more than 150 days in [[Amazon.com]]'s top 150 by April 2014.&lt;ref name=RNS&gt;{{cite news|title='Blood moon' sets off apocalyptic debate among some Christians|date=April 15, 2014|work=Washington Post|agency=Religion News Service|author= Sarah Pulliam Bailey|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/blood-moon-sets-off-apocalyptic-debate-among-some-christians/2014/04/15/00b76502-c4be-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the week ending March 30, 2014, it was the ninth best selling paperback, according to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bestsellers for week ending March 30|work=Newsday|date=April 3, 2014|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/books/bestsellers-for-week-ending-march-30-1.7600211|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-April, Hagee's book had hit No. 4 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' best-seller list in the advice category.&lt;ref name=RNS /&gt; Hagee's book (and subsequent sermon series at his home congregation, Cornerstone Church) did not proclaim that any specific "end times" event would occur (as did Biltz in his original prophecy), but claimed that every prior tetrad of the last 500 years coincided with events in Jewish and Israeli history that were originally tragic, yet followed by triumph.

==Media attention and critics==
Hagee and Biltz's speculations gained mainstream media attention in publications such as ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt;&lt;ref name="RNS"/&gt;  ''Earth &amp; Sky'' reported receiving "a number of inquiries about Blood Moon", prompting a response.&lt;ref name=EarthSky /&gt; Samantha Blake of ''[[Christian Today]]'' wrote that only a "small group of Christians" saw the eclipse as significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lunar Eclipse April 15, 2014: Four Blood Moons a sign of End Times?|date=April 5, 2014 |author=Samantha Blake|work=[[Christian Today]] |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/lunar.eclipse.april.15.2014.blood.moon.sign.of.end.times.when.to.watch/36566.htm |accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''Earth &amp; Sky'' Bruce McClure and [[Deborah Byrd]] point out that the referenced verse also says the "sun will be turned into darkness", an apparent reference to a [[solar eclipse|''solar'' eclipse]]. They note that since the [[Jewish Calendar]] is lunar, one sixth of all eclipses will occur during Passover or [[Sukkot]].  Furthermore, there have been 62 [[Tetrad (astronomy)|tetrads]] since the first century AD, though only eight of them have coincided with both feasts.  Additionally, three of the four eclipses in the tetrad were not even visible in the biblical homeland of [[Israel]], casting further doubt on Hagee and Biltz's interpretation; even then, only the very end of the last eclipse was visible in Israel.&lt;ref name=EarthSky&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Blood Moon?|date=March 30, 2014|work=Earth &amp; Sky|author=Bruce McClure|author2=Deborah Byrd|url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-a-blood-moon-lunar-eclipses-2014-2015|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Space.com]], Geoff Gaherty said he was saddened that {{"-}}'prophets of doom'&amp;nbsp;... view these life-enriching events as portents of disaster" and said the eclipse was "hardly something to be concerned about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Blood Moons: Total Lunar Eclipse Series Not a Sign of Apocalypse|date=April 9, 2014|publisher=[[Space.com]]|url=http://www.space.com/25409-four-blood-moons-tetrad-lunar-eclipse.html|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Mike Moore, the then General Secretary of [[Christian Witness to Israel]], wrote a lengthy article dismissing the claims of Biltz and Hagee. Moore's view was that no significance can be drawn from the eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Moon Rising|date=20 January 2014|author=Mike Moore|url=http://fromthetopcom.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/blood-moon-rising_20.html |publisher=Mike's Musings |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has been the target of two terrorist attacks, in 2011 and 2015. Both were presumed to be in response to a number of controversial [[Muhammad]] cartoons it published. In [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|the second of these attacks]], 12 people were killed, including publishing director [[Charb]] and several other prominent cartoonists.

''Charlie Hebdo'' first appeared in 1970 as a companion to the monthly ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]'' magazine, after a previous title was banned for mocking the death of former French President [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3657256/charlie-hebdo-paris-attack/ |title=The Provocative History of French Weekly Newspaper Charlie Hebdo |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=11 January 2015 |author=Megan Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 publication ceased, but the magazine was resurrected in 1992. Its current [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Gérard Biard]]. The previous editors were [[François Cavanna]] (1970–1981) and [[Philippe Val]] (1992–2009). The magazine is published every Wednesday, with special editions issued on an unscheduled basis.

== Origins in ''Hara-Kiri'' ==
[[File:François Cavanna.jpg|thumb|300px|[[François Cavanna]] (1923–2014), one of the founders of the first ''Charlie Hebdo'' title]]

In 1960, [[Professeur Choron|Georges "Professeur Choron" Bernier]] and [[François Cavanna]] launched a monthly magazine entitled ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]''.&lt;ref name="Lemonnier 2008 50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lemonnier|2008|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Choron acted as the director of publication and Cavanna as its editor. Eventually Cavanna gathered together a team which included [[Roland Topor]], [[Fred Aristidès|Fred]], [[Jean-Marc Reiser]], [[Georges Wolinski]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Gébé|fr}}, and [[Cabu]]. After an early reader's letter accused them of being "dumb and nasty" ("bête et méchant"), the phrase became an official slogan for the magazine and made it into everyday language in France.

''Hara-Kiri'' was briefly banned in 1961, and again for six months in 1966. A few contributors did not return along with the newspaper, such as Gébé, Cabu, Topor, and Fred. New members of the team included {{Interlanguage link multi|Delfeil de Ton|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Fournier (journaliste)|fr}}, and [[Bernard Willem Holtrop|Willem]].

In 1969, the ''Hara-Kiri'' team decided to produce a weekly publication – on top of the existing monthly magazine – which would focus more on current affairs. This was launched in February as ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri Hebdo]]'' and renamed ''L'Hebdo Hara-Kiri'' in May of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/what-is-charlie-hebdo-banned-and-resurrected-but-always-in-the-grand-tradition-of-gallic-satire-9963721.html |title=What is Charlie Hebdo? A magazine banned and resurrected but always in the grand tradition of Gallic satire |last1=Sherwin |first1=Adam |date=16 January 2015 |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hebdo'' is short for ''hebdomadaire'' – "weekly")

== Launch of Charlie Hebdo ==
In November 1970, the former French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] died in his home village of [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], eight days after a disaster in a nightclub, the [[Club Cinq-Sept fire]], which caused the death of 146 people. The magazine released a cover spoofing the popular press's coverage of this disaster, headlined "Tragic Ball at Colombey, one dead."&lt;ref name="Lemonnier 2008 50" /&gt; As a result, the weekly was banned.

In order to sidestep the ban, the editorial team decided to change its title, and used ''Charlie Hebdo''.&lt;ref name="McNab 2006 26" /&gt; The new name was derived from a monthly comics magazine called ''Charlie'' (later renamed ''[[Charlie Mensuel]]'', meaning ''Charlie Monthly''), which had been started by Bernier and Delfeil de Ton in 1969. The monthly ''Charlie'' took its name from the lead character of one of the comics it originally published, ''[[Peanuts]]''{{'}}s [[Charlie Brown]]. Using that title for the new weekly magazine was also an inside joke about Charles de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2006/02/14/cavanna-et-les-cons_741216_3260.html Cavanna et "les cons"], ''Le Monde'', 14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyoncapitale.fr/Journal/France-monde/Culture/Vie-et-politique-culturelle/Quelle-est-l-origine-du-nom-Charlie-Hebdo Quelle est l’origine du nom Charlie Hebdo ?], ''Lyon Capitale'', 12 janvier 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directmatin.fr/bd/2015-01-08/pourquoi-charlie-hebdo-sappelle-charlie-hebdo-697511 Pourquoi Charlie Hebdo s'appelle Charlie Hebdo], ''Direct Matin'', 8 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue did feature a ''Peanuts'' strip, as the editors were fans of the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/evenement/2000/02/14/wolinski-ex-redacteur-en-chef-de-charlie-mensuel-se-souvient-de-peanuts-ca-serait-bien-de-renouer-av_315824 Wolinski L'ex-rédacteur en chef de «Charlie mensuel», se souvient de «Peanuts» «Ça serait bien de renouer avec ce genre de BD»], ''Libération'', 4 février 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1981, publication ceased.&lt;ref name=mashable&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbruzzese|first1=Jason|title=What is Charlie Hebdo? Behind the covers of the French satirical magazine targeted in deadly attack|url=http://mashable.com/2015/01/07/charlie-hebdo-magazine/|website=Mashable.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rebirth ==
In 1991, Gébé, Cabu and others were reunited to work for ''[[La Grosse Bertha]]'', a new weekly magazine resembling ''Charlie Hebdo'' created in reaction to the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]] and edited by singer and comedian [[Philippe Val]]. However, the following year, Val clashed with the publisher, who wanted apolitical humour, and was fired. Gébé and Cabu walked out with him and decided to launch their own paper again. The three called upon Cavanna, Delfeil de Ton and Wolinski, requesting their help and input. After much searching for a new name, the obvious idea of resurrecting ''Charlie Hebdo'' was agreed on. The new magazine was owned by Val, Gébé, Cabu and singer [[Renaud]]. Val was editor, Gébé publication director.

The publication of the new ''Charlie Hebdo'' began in July 1992 amidst much publicity. The first issue under the new publication sold 100,000 copies. Choron, who had fallen out with his former colleagues, tried to restart a weekly ''Hara-Kiri'', but its publication was short-lived. Choron died in January 2005.

On 26 April 1996, [[François Cavanna]], [[Charb]] and Philippe Val filed 173,704 signatures, obtained in eight months, with the aim of [[ban (law)|banning]] the political party [[National Front (France)|Front National]], since it would have contravened the articles 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Guiral, "[http://ecrans.liberation.fr/ecrans/1996/09/12/les-173-704-signatures-de-charlie-hebdo_183854 Les 173 704 signatures de Charlie Hebdo]" in ''[[Libération]]'', 12 September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, controversy broke over a column by veteran cartoonist [[Siné]] which led to accusations of antisemitism and Siné's sacking by Val. Siné successfully sued the newspaper for unfair dismissal and ''Charlie Hebdo'' was ordered to pay him €90,000 in damages.&lt;ref name="libe-17-12-12"&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/medias/2012/12/17/charlie-hebdo-doit-verser-90-000-euros-a-sine_868176 ''Charlie Hebdo'' doit verser 90 000 euros à Siné], ''Libération'', 17 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Siné launched a rival paper called ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Siné Hebdo|fr}}'' which later became ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Siné Mensuel|fr}}''. In 2009, Philippe Val resigned after being appointed director of [[France Inter]], a public radio station to which he has contributed since the early 1990s. His functions were split between two cartoonists, Charb and [[Riss (cartoonist)|Riss]]. Val gave away his shares in 2011. As of March 2011, ''Charlie Hebdo'' was owned by Charb (600 shares), Riss (599 shares), finance director Éric Portheault (299 shares), and Cabu and Bernard Maris with one share each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabu reste actionnaire de Charlie Hebdo|url=http://charlieenchaine.free.fr/?+Cabu-reste-actionnaire-de-Charlie+|website=Charlie Enchaîné|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==

=== ''Mosque of Paris v Val'' (2007) ===
In 2007 the [[Grand Mosque of Paris]] began criminal proceedings against the chief-editor of ''Charlie Hebdo'', Philipe Val, under [[Hate speech laws in France|France's hate speech laws]] for publicly abusing a group on the ground of their religion. The lawsuit was limited to three specific cartoons, including one depicting Muhammad carrying a bomb in his turban. In March 2007 a Paris court acquitted Val, finding that it was fundamentalists, rather than Muslims, who were being ridiculed in the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, Esther, "Limits to Expression on Religion in France" (8 March 2012).

Available at SSRN: [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2018277 SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siné sacking (2008) ===
On 2 July 2008, a column by the cartoonist [[Siné]] (Maurice Sinet) appeared in ''Charlie Hebdo'' citing a rumour that [[Jean Sarkozy]], son of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], had announced his intention to convert to [[Judaism]] before marrying his fiancée, Jewish heiress Jessica Sebaoun-[[Darty]]. Siné added, "he'll go far, this lad!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leprince|first1=Chloé|title=L'Affaire Siné|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/religion.france|website=The Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to complaints of antisemitism. The magazine's editor, [[Philippe Val]], ordered Siné to write a letter of apology or face termination. The cartoonist said he would rather "cut his own balls off," and was promptly fired. Both sides subsequently filed lawsuits, and in December 2010, Siné won a 40,000 euros court judgment against his former publisher for [[wrongful termination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuabd.com/+Le-Tribunal-de-Grande-Instance+ "Le Tribunal de Grande Instance donne raison à Siné contre Charlie Hebdo,"] ActuaBD (11 December 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 publication ===
Controversy arose over the publication's edition of 9 February 2006. Under the title "''Mahomet débordé par les intégristes''" ("Muhammad overwhelmed by fundamentalists"), the front page showed a cartoon of a weeping [[Muhammad]] saying "''C'est dur d'être aimé par des cons''" ("it's hard being loved by jerks"). The newspaper reprinted the twelve cartoons of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] and added some of their own. Compared to a regular circulation of 100,000 sold copies, this edition enjoyed great commercial success. 160,000 copies were sold and another 150,000 were in print later that day.

In response, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] condemned "overt provocations" which could inflame passions. "Anything that can hurt the convictions of someone else, in particular religious convictions, should be avoided", Chirac said. The [[Grand Mosque of Paris]], the [[Muslim World League]] and the [[Union of Islamic Organisations of France|Union of French Islamic Organisations]] (UOIF) sued, claiming the cartoon edition included racist cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfcm.tv/2007/03/22/caricatures-charlie-hebdo-relaxe/|title=Culte Musulman et Islam de France|publisher=CFCM TV|date=22 March 2007 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later edition contained a statement by a group of twelve writers warning against [[Islamism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4764730.stm |title=Writers' statement on cartoons (1 March 2006)|publisher=BBC News|date=1 March 2006|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suit by the Grand Mosque and the UOIF reached the courts in February 2007. Publisher [[Philippe Val]] contended "It is racist to imagine that they can't understand a joke," but Francis Szpiner, the lawyer for the Grand Mosque, explained the suit: "Two of those caricatures make a link between Muslims and Muslim terrorists. That has a name and it's called racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heneghan|first=Tom|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/cartoon-row-goes-to-french-court-1.313615|title=Cartoon row goes to French court|work=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] sent a letter to be read in court expressing his support for the ancient French tradition of satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lci.tf1.fr/france/societe/2007-02/soutien-sarkozy-charlie-hebdo-fache-cfcm-4889140.html|title=Caricatures : Le soutien de Sarkozy à Charlie Hebdo fâche le CFCM|work=TF1 News|date=15 December 2011|accessdate=21 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205220532/http://lci.tf1.fr/france/societe/2007-02/soutien-sarkozy-charlie-hebdo-fache-cfcm-4889140.html|archivedate=5 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Bayrou]] and future president [[François Hollande]] also expressed their support for [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]. The [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]] (CFCM) criticised the expression of these sentiments, claiming that they were politicising a court case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/sarkozy-accuse-de-politiser-le-proces_462776.html|title=Charlie Hebdo: Sarkozy accusé de politiser le procès|work=L'Express|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2007, executive editor Val was acquitted by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6479673.stm|title=French cartoons editor acquitted|work=[[BBC]]|date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court followed the state attorney's reasoning that two of the three cartoons were not an attack on Islam, but on Muslim terrorists, and that the third cartoon with Muhammad with a bomb in his turban should be seen in the context of the magazine in question, which attacked religious fundamentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswiretoday.com/news/13842/|title=French Satirical Newspaper 'Charlie Hebdo' Wins Second Trial Over Controversial Cartoon Ban Request|work=Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks were presumed to be linked to its decision to rename the edition of 3 November 2011 "[[Charia Hebdo]]", with Muhammad listed as the "editor-in-chief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15550350|title=Attack on French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo (2 November 2011)|publisher=BBC|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover, featuring a cartoon of Muhammad saying: "100 lashes of the whip if you don't die laughing" by [[Luz (cartoonist)|Luz]] (Rénald Luzier), had circulated on social media for a couple of days.

The "Charia Hebdo" issue had been a response to recent news of the post-election introduction of sharia law in Libya and the victory of the Islamist party in Tunisia.&lt;ref name=BBC1Nov11&gt;{{cite news|title=Satirical French magazine names 'Muhammad' as editor|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15536684|accessdate=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It especially focuses on oppression of women under sharia, taking aim at domestic violence, mandatory veiling, burquas, restrictions on freedom, forced marriage, and stoning of those accused of adultery. It also targeted oppression of gays and dissenters, and practices such as stoning, flogging, hand/foot/tongue amputations, polygamy, forced marriage, and early indoctrination of children. "Guest editor" Muhammad is portrayed as a good-humoured voice of reason, decrying the recent elections and calling for a separation between politics and religion, while stating that Islam is compatible with humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bogardiner.wordpress.com/2015/01/18/a-closer-look-at-sharia-hebdo-for-which-charlie-hebdo-offices-were-firebombed-in-2011/|title=A closer look at "Sharia Hebdo," for which Charlie Hebdo was firebombed in 2011|last=Gardiner|first=Bo|date=18 January 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine responded to the bombing by distributing some four times the usual number of copies.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=French paper reprints Mohammad cartoon after fire-bomb|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/03/us-france-fire-magazine-idUSTRE7A26MO20111103|accessdate=19 January 2015|agency=Reuters|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charb was quoted by [[Associated Press]] stating that the attack might have been carried out by "stupid people who don't know what Islam is" and that they are "idiots who betray their own religion". [[Mohammed Moussaoui]], head of the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]], said his organisation deplores "the very mocking tone of the paper toward Islam and its prophet but reaffirms with force its total opposition to all acts and all forms of violence."&lt;ref name="Ganley-02.11.11"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ganley|first1=Elaine|title=Fire at French newspaper after Muhammad issue|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/11/02/fire_at_french_newspaper_after_muhammad_issue/?page=full|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=Boston.com|agency=Associated Press|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Fillon]], the prime minister, and [[Claude Guéant]], the interior minister, voiced support for ''Charlie Hebdo'',&lt;ref name=FT01 /&gt; as did feminist writer [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], who criticised calls for self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/09/extremists-hurt-non-militant-muslims-the-most|title=Extremists hurt non-militant Muslims the most|author=Peter Worthington|agency=QMI|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] criticised the magazine's decision, saying, "In France, there is a principle of freedom of expression, which should not be undermined.

==== ''Je suis Charlie'' ====
{{Main|Je suis Charlie|l1=''Je suis Charlie''}}
[[File:Charlie Hebdo Tout est pardonné.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The front cover of [[Charlie Hebdo issue No. 1178|edition of 14 January 2015]], with a cartoon in the same style as 3 November 2011 cover, uses the phrase "Je Suis Charlie". (Headline translation: "All is forgiven.") &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11343077/How-I-created-the-Charlie-Hebdo-magazine-cover-cartoonist-Luzs-statement-in-full.html|title=How I created the Charlie Hebdo magazine cover: cartoonist Luz's statement in full|work=The Telegraph|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] After the attacks, the phrase ''{{lang|fr|Je suis Charlie}}'', French for "I am Charlie", was adopted by supporters of [[free speech]] and freedom of expression who were reacting to the shootings. The phrase identifies a speaker or supporter of those who were killed at the ''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting, and by extension, a supporter of freedom of speech and resistance to armed threats. Some journalists embraced the expression as a rallying cry for the freedom of self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enisyavuz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jesuis05.png |title=image |publisher=Enis Yavuz |accessdate=8 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109002354/http://enisyavuz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jesuis05.png |archivedate=9 January 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan was first used on [[Twitter]] and spread to the Internet at large. The Twitter account and the original "Je suis Charlie" picture bearing the phrase in white Charlie Hebdo style font on black background were created by French journalist and artist [[Joachim Roncin]] just after the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#JeSuisCharlie creator: Phrase cannot be a trademark |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30797059|publisher=BBC News|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website of ''Charlie Hebdo'' went offline shortly after the shooting, and when it returned it bore the legend ''Je Suis Charlie'' on a black background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliehebdo.fr|title=Charlie Hedbo|date=7 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120424/http://www.charliehebdo.fr/|archivedate=7 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was used as the [[hashtag]] #jesuischarlie on Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/je-suis-charlie-trends-people-4935086|work=Daily Mirror|title='Je suis Charlie' trends as people refuse to be silenced by Charlie Hebdo gunmen|author=Richard Booth|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as computer-printed or hand-made placards and stickers, and displayed on mobile phones at vigils, and on many websites, particularly media sites. While other symbols were used, notably holding pens in the air, the phrase "Not Afraid", and tweeting certain images, "''Je Suis Charlie''" became more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ecrans.liberation.fr/ecrans/2015/01/09/charlie-s-installe-a-libe-bon-on-fait-le-journal_1177043|title=Charlie" s'installe à "Libé"&amp;nbsp;: "Bon, on fait le journal&amp;nbsp;? |author=Isabelle Hanne |journal=Libération|accessdate=9 January 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of rallies took place in cities across France on 10–11 January 2015 to honour the victims of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], and also to voice support for [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name="BB9JAN"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-09/shots-fired-hostages-taken-in-town-northeast-of-paris.html |title=Paris Terror Suspects Killed in Twin French Police Raids |publisher=Bloomberg |date=9 January 2014 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churches were also reported to be on fire in eastern [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]] and [[Goure]]. Violent demonstrations also were prevalent in [[Zinder]], where some burned French flags. There were violent demonstrations in Karachi in [[Pakistan]], where Asif Hassan, a photographer working for the [[Agence France-Presse]], was seriously injured by a shot to the chest. In Algiers and Jordan, protesters clashed with police, while peaceful demonstrations were held in Khartoum, Sudan, Russia, Mali, Senegal, and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref name="emmagraham-harrison" /&gt;

[[RT (TV network)|RT]] reported that a million people attended a demonstration in [[Grozny]], the [[capital city]] of the [[Chechnya|Chechen Republic]], protesting against the [[depictions of Muhammad]] in ''Charlie Hebdo'' and proclaiming that [[Islam]] is a religion of peace.

One week after the murders, [[Donald Trump]] mocked ''Charlie Hebdo'', saying the magazine reminded him of another "nasty and dishonest" satirical publication and that the magazine was on the verge of financial collapse.&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'', [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/donald-trump-charlie-hebdo-tweets-twitter-president-terrorism-coverage-islamic-state-a7569586.html Donald Trump's mocking tweets about Charlie Hebdo resurface after President criticises terrorism coverage], February 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-attack ==
[[File:Global Debout - Place de la République, 2016.05.15 (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Place de la République, 2016.05.15]]
Following some controversies over the paper's future following the 2015 attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Picquard|first1=Alexandre|title=" La vie à "Charlie" n’a jamais été un fleuve tranquille " |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/actualite-medias/article/2015/05/18/la-vie-a-charlie-n-a-jamais-ete-un-fleuve-tranquille_4634998_3236.html|website=Le Monde|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charb's 40% stake in ''Charlie Hebdo'' was purchased from his parents by Riss and Eric Portheault, who were as of July 2015 sole shareholders in the paper. ''Charlie Hebdo'' switched to a new legal press publisher status which requires 70% of profits to be reinvested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=" Charlie Hebdo " devient la première " entreprise solidaire de presse " |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/actualite-medias/article/2015/07/17/charlie-hebdo-devient-la-premiere-entreprise-solidaire-de-presse_4687647_3236.html|website=Le Monde|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other controversies ===
''Charlie Hebdo'' was accused of attacking freedom of press when its lawyer Richard Malka tried to prevent the publication of the magazine ''Charpie Hebdo'', a pastiche of ''Charlie Hebdo''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/medias/charlie-hebdo/quand-charlie-hebdo-veut-faire-interdire-charpie-hebdo_828099.html Quand "Charlie Hebdo" veut faire interdire "Charpie Hebdo"], ''Francetvinfo'', 18 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charlie_Hebdo_September_14_cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Coco (cartoonist)|Coco]]'s artwork on the front cover of ''Charlie Hebdo'' on 14 September 2015 illustrates a parody of racist attitudes that proclaim that migrants are "welcome" but are treated as footstools. The speech balloon, "This [land] is your home", is a reference to a famous nationalist phrase, "This is our home".]]

[[Daniel Schneidermann]] argues that the 2015 attack raised the profile of the paper internationally with non-Francophone audiences, meaning that only parts of the paper are selectively translated into English, making it easy to misrepresent the editorial stance of the publication and the purpose of provocative work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/112747/charlie-hebdo-nouveau-victime-paradoxal-succes|title=Charlie Hebdo de nouveau victime de son paradoxal succès|work=Slate.fr|language=fr|date=14 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nadine Morano]] was offended at being drawn as a baby with Down syndrome after making remarks supporting the [[National Front (France)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/medias/charlie-hebdo/charlie-hebdo-on-se-moque-de-nadine-morano-pas-des-handicapes-explique-la-dessinatrice-coco_1118621.html|title="Charlie Hebdo" : "On se moque de Nadine Morano, pas des handicapés", explique la dessinatrice Coco|author=Elise Lambert|work=francetv info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14 September 2015 edition's cover cartoon by [[Coco (cartoonist)|Coco]] depicted a migrant being maltreated by a man who proclaims "welcome to refugees" - in order to parody European claims about compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-mocks-europes-response-to-migrant-crisis-with-cartoons-of-dead-syrian-boy.html?_r=0|title=Charlie Hebdo Mocks Europe’s Response to Migrant Crisis With Cartoons of Dead Syrian Boy|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riss wrote an editorial on the [[European migrant crisis]], arguing that it was hypocritical for Hungarian politicians to declare themselves compassionate because of their Christian beliefs, but at the same time reject migrants from Syria. Riss parodied anti-immigrant attitudes by featuring a cartoon with a caricature of Jesus walking on water next to a drowning Muslim boy, with the caption "this is how we know Europe is Christian". The cartoons were widely seen as [[gallows humour]] in France, but prompted another wave of controversy abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/09/15/dessins-charlie-hebdo-migrants-aylan-internautes-scandalises_n_8137844.html|title=Les dessins de "Charlie Hebdo" sur la mort du petit Aylan scandalisent les internautes à l'étranger|date=15 September 2015|work=Le Huffington Post|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; That issue also included a caricature of the dead body of Syrian Kurdish refugee child [[Alan Kurdi]] next to a McDonald's sign with the caption, "So close to his goal."&lt;ref name="europe.newsweek.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charlie Hebdo Cartoon Depicts Drowned Toddler Aylan Kurdi as Future Sexual Harasser|url = http://europe.newsweek.com/charlie-hebdo-aylan-kurdi-cologne-cartoon-415358?rm=eu|website = Newsweek|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, cartoonist [[Coco (cartoonist)|Corinne Rey]] said that she was criticising the consumerist society that was being sold to migrants like a dream.&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Charlie Hebdo Mocks Europe’s Response to Migrant Crisis With Cartoons of Dead Syrian Boy|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-mocks-europes-response-to-migrant-crisis-with-cartoons-of-dead-syrian-boy.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-09-15|access-date = 2016-01-14|issn = 0362-4331|first = Robert|last = Mackey}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]], a January 2016 edition included a cartoon by Riss about Kurdi, reflecting fickle sentiment towards refugees by including a caption questioning whether the boy would have grown up to be an "ass groper in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-charlie-hebdo-cartoon-about-aylan-kurdi-and-sex-attackers-is-one-of-its-most-powerful-and-a6812346.html|title=The Charlie Hebdo cartoon about Aylan Kurdi and sex attackers is one of its most powerful|author=Jessica Brown|date=14 January 2016|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charlie Hebdo cartoon depicts grown-up Aylan Kurdi as 'ass groper in Germany'|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-sparks-new-controversy-with-cartoon-depicting-aylan-kurdi-as-an-ass-groper-in-germany-a6810331.html|website = The Independent|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Charlie Hebdo cartoon depicting drowned child Alan Kurdi sparks racism debate|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/14/charlie-hebdo-cartoon-depicting-drowned-child-alan-kurdi-sparks-racism-debate|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2016-01-14|access-date = 2016-01-14|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charlie Hebdo backlash over 'racist' Alan Kurdi cartoon - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35306906|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the cartoons showed a victim's blue-eyed skull and a burned-out plane on the ground, with the caption: "The dangers of Russian low cost" flights.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; The other showed pieces of the plane falling on an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (ISIS) fighter with the caption: "Russia's air force intensifies its bombing." A spokesman for [[Vladimir Putin]] called the artwork "sacrilege", and members of the [[State Duma]] called for the magazine to be banned as extremist literature and demanded an apology from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34747432|title=Russia hits out at Charlie Hebdo over crash cartoon|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2016, following the [[August 2016 Central Italy earthquake]], which caused 294 deaths, the French magazine published a cartoon in which the earthquake victims are depicted as pasta dishes, under the title "Séisme à l'italienne".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Hebdo draws Italian anger with cartoon portraying earthquake victims as pasta|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/02/charlie-hebdo-draws-italian-anger-with-cartoon-portraying-earthq/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of Italians was unleashed on social networks so that, on the official Facebook page of the magazine, the cartoonist Coco pointed out with another cartoon: "Italians ... it's not Charlie Hebdo who builds your houses, it's the Mafia!"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/106626879360459/photos/a.106706332685847.10430.106626879360459/1236792179677251/?type=3&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt; The French ambassador in Rome, in a statement, pointed out that the French Government's position on the Italian earthquake is not that expressed by ''Charlie Hebdo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French embassy disowns Charlie Hebdo cartoons|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/09/02/french-embassy-disowns-charlie-hebdo-cartoons_d716f1a1-075e-4212-b087-c14f61678b84.html|website=ANSA|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
'''Covenant-breaker''' is a term used by [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] to refer to a person who has been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Bahá'í community for the act of '''covenant-breaking,''' roughly defined as active opposition to the Bahá'í Faith from a current member. According to [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law,]] only the head of the religion, currently the [[Universal House of Justice]], has the authority to declare a person a covenant-breaker.  

A person may be declared a covenant-breaker for actions which are seen as challenging the unity of the Bahá'í community, not for personal matters such as failure to obey Bahá'í law or conversion to another religion. 

When a person is a declared a covenant-breaker all Bahá'ís are expected to avoid unnecessary association with that person. 

==Definition==
Covenant-breaking does not refer to attacks from non-Bahá'ís or former Baha'is. Rather, it is in reference to internal campaigns of opposition where the Covenant-breaker is seen as challenging the unity of the Bahá'í Faith, causing internal division, or by claiming or supporting an alternate succession of authority or administrative structure. The central purpose of the covenant is to prevent schism and dissension.&lt;ref name="bahai-library1"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In a letter to an individual dated 23 March 1975, the Universal House of Justice wrote:
{{quote|When a person declares his acceptance of Bahá'u'lláh as a Manifestation of God he becomes a party to the Covenant and accepts the totality of His Revelation. If he then turns round and attacks Bahá'u'lláh or the Central Institution of the Faith he violates the Covenant. If this happens every effort is made to help that person to see the illogicality and error of his actions, but if he persists he must, in accordance with the instructions of Bahá'u'lláh Himself, be shunned as a Covenant-breaker.}}

The term 'Covenant-breaker' or, in Arabic 'naqid al-mithaq' [pl. Naqidu 'l-mithaq], was first used by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] to describe the partisans of his brother [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], who challenged his leadership.  In `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]], He appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the ''[[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]]'' of the religion and called for the eventual election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], and defined in the same manner opposition to these two institutions as Covenant-Breaking.  `Abdu'l-Bahá advised all Bahá'ís to shun anyone opposing the Covenant: "...one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts exerted in the past."&lt;ref&gt;''The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/wt-2.html#gr10 p 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization==

=== Included categories of people ===
Most Covenant-breakers are involved in schismatic groups, but not always.  For example, a Bahá'í who refuses to follow guidance on treatment of Covenant-breakers is at risk of being named one. One article&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant The Covenant, and Covenant-breaker], by [[Moojan Momen]]&lt;/ref&gt; originally written for the Bahá'í Encyclopedia, characterized Covenant-breakers that have emerged in the course of Bahá'í history as belonging to one of four categories:

#Leadership challenge: These are persons who dispute the authority and legitimacy of the head of the religion and advance claims either for themselves or for another. The main examples of these are [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]] and [[Mason Remey|Charles Mason Remey]].
#Dissidence: Those who actively disagree with the policies and actions of the head of the faith without, however, advancing an alternative claim for leadership. This group consisted mostly of opponents of the Bahá'í administration such as [[Ruth White (Bahá'í author)|Ruth White]] and [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]].
#Disobedience: Those who disobey certain direct instructions from the head of the religion.  Mostly the instruction in question is to cease to associate with a Covenant-breaker. Examples of this type include most of the descendants of `Abdu'l-Bahá during Shoghi Effendi's time.
#Apostates who maliciously attack the Bahá'í Faith. Examples include [[Abd al-Hosayn Ayati|Ávárih]] and [[Níkú]].

=== Excluded categories of people ===
Shoghi Effendi wrote to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada in 1957:
{{quote|People who have withdrawn from the Cause because they no longer feel that they can support its Teachings and Institutions sincerely, are not Covenant-breakers -- they are non-Bahá'ís and should just be treated as such. Only those who ally themselves actively with known enemies of the Faith who are Covenant-breakers, and who attack the Faith in the same spirit as these people, can be considered, themselves, to be Covenant-breakers.&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, Messages to Canada, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beyond this, many other relationships to the Bahá'í Faith exist, both positive and negative.  Covenant-breaking does not apply to most of them. The following is a partial list of those who could not rightly be termed Covenant-breakers:

* Members of other religions or no religion--with or without any particular relationship to the Bahá'í Faith.
* Bahá'ís who simply leave the religion. (see above)
* Bahá'ís who, in the estimation of the head of the religion have insufficiently understood the nature of the covenant from the start.  These are sometimes "disenrolled" and are considered to have never actually been Bahá'ís, given their fundamental diversion from this core Bahá'í doctrine.

===Bábís===
[[Bábís]] are generally regarded as another religion altogether. Since Covenant-breaking presumes that one has submitted oneself to a covenant and then broken it, and Bábís never recognized or swore allegiance to Bahá'u'lláh, they are not Covenant-breakers.

Followers of [[Subh-i-Azal]], Bahá'u'lláh's half-brother who tried to poison him, engaged in active opposition to Bahá'ís, and Shoghi Effendi did inform Bahá'ís that they should avoid contact with his descendants, writing that "No intelligent and loyal Baha'i would associate with a descendant of Azal, if he traced the slightest breath of criticism of our Faith, in any aspect, from that person. In fact these people should be strenuously avoided as having an inherited spiritual disease -- the disease of Covenant-breaking!".&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, From letter dated 9 December 1948 to an individual believer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covenant-breaking in Shoghi Effendi's immediate family==
Through the influence of [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|Bahiyyih Khanum]], the eldest daughter of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], everyone in the household initially rallied around [[Shoghi Effendi]] after the death of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]. For several years his brother Husayn and several cousins served him as secretaries. The only ones publicly opposing him were [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]] and his followers, who were declared Covenant-breakers by `Abdu'l-Bahá. Contrary to `Abdu'l-Bahá's specific instruction, certain family members established illicit links with those whom `Abdu'l-Bahá had declared Covenant-breakers. After Bahiyyih Khanum died in 1932, Shoghi Effendi's eldest sister – Ruhangiz – married a son of [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|Siyyid Ali Afnan]].  Bahá'u'lláh's son-in-law was, thus, a long-standing enemy of `Abdu'l-Bahá (who had declared him a Covenant-breaker.) Through Ruhangiz's efforts, Shoghi Effendi's other sister and his cousin Thurayya also married sons of Siyyid Ali Afnan. Presumably being faced with a choice between shunning their disobedient family members and being themselves disobedient to `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, his cousins, aunts and uncles chose the latter.

===Ruhi Afnan===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ruhi Afnan.jpeg|thumb|Shoghi Effendi (sitting) and Ruhi Afnan (standing)]] --&gt;

After years of silence on these developments, cables sent by [[Shoghi Effendi]] on November 2, 1941 provide background to developments among family members. Ruhi Afnan, Shoghi Effendi's cousin through [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s daughter Tuba:

* "Ruhi's sister married Covenant-breaker Faydi whose mother joined and supported arch-enemy Muhammad-`Ali and whose father `Abdu'l-Bahá denounced openly and repeatedly as His deadly enemy. Ruhi's family concurred. Inform all believers all manner communication excommunicated family forbidden."

Faydi was the son of [[Bahá'u'lláh's family#Furughiyyih|Furughiyyih Khanum]], a daughter of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] by his third wife [[Bahá'u'lláh's family#Gawhar|Gawhar]].  Furughiyyih and her children all supported [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]]. Faydi had two elder brothers. Hussein Effendi Afnan was aide-de-camp to [[Faisal II of Iraq]] and Nayyer Effendi Afnan was Commissioner of Parks in Cairo, Egypt. The entire Bahá'í Family was stigmatized by Shoghi Effendi as Covenant-breakers as he was displeased with their marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sohrab |first=Ahmad|authorlink=Ahmad Sohrab |title=Abdul Baha's Grandson Story of a Twentieth Century Excommunication |page = 166   |url=https://www.abebooks.com/Abdul-Bahas-Grandson-Story-Twentieth-Century/18337084751/bd |publisher= Universal Publishing Company, New York |date= 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in a 1950 cable:

* "Inform friends that Ruhi, his mother, with Ruha, his aunt, and their families, not content with years of disobedience and unworthy conduct, are now showing open defiance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Effendi |first=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi||date=February 22, 2015 |title=Citadel of Faith  |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/CF/cf-6.html#pg87 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |page=87 |isbn=978-1508530596}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Citadel of Faith'', p.&amp;nbsp;87)

And in 1953:

* "Treacherous Ruhi Afnan, not content with previous disobedience, correspondence with [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]], contact with old Covenant-breakers, sale, in conjunction with other members of family, of sacred property purchased by Founder of Faith, and allowing his sister to marry son of `Abdu'l-Bahá's enemy, is now openly lecturing on Bahá'í movement, claiming to be its exponent and is misrepresenting the teachings and deliberately causing confusion in minds of authorities and the local population. Inform National Assemblies." (''Messages to the Bahá'í World – 1950–1957'', p.&amp;nbsp;48)

Later, Ruhi was presented with a copy of Sohrab's book about his excommunication:

:"… under ordinary circumstances he would have been very much elated, and therefore thankful to see someone make such records of his services to the Cause, but that the references to the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] and the Administration changed his attitude completely. He did not wish to be defended; he felt that he must suffer in silence and be true to the Master’s last will and testament. Then Ruhi Effendi referred to Ahmad as being in the same plight as himself, but reacting differently. He thought this very regrettable." [p. 281]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol2/newhist1.html From Gaslight to Dawn 10-19&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munib Shahid===
Concerning [[Munib Shahid]], Shoghi Effendi's cousin through `Abdu'l-Bahá's daughter Ruha, Shoghi Effendi sent the following cable to the Bahá'í world in November 1944:

* "Monib Shahid, grandson of both `Abdu'l-Bahá and the [[Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn|King of Martyrs]], married according to the Moslem rites the daughter of a political exile who is [[Jamal al-Husayni|nephew]] of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. This treacherous act of alliance with enemies of the Faith merits condemnation of entire Bahá'í world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | date=December 1944|title=Messages from the Guardian |url=https://bahai.works/Baha%27i_News/Issue_172 |newspaper=Bahá'í News|issue=172 |access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Bahá'í News'', No. 172)

===Husayn Ali===

Husayn Ali was Shoghi Effendi's brother.  In April 1945, Shoghi Effendi sent the following cable to the Bahá'í world: "My faithless brother Husayn, after long period of dishonourable conduct, has abandoned the Master's home to consort with his sister and other Covenant-breakers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | date=April 1945 |title=Messages from the Guardian |url=https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File%3ABaha%27i_News_174.pdf&amp;page=2|newspaper=Bahá'í News|issue=174 |access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Bahá'í News'', No. 174, p.2).  In March 1950, Shoghi Effendi would send a further cable: "Faithless brother Hussein, already abased through dishonorable conduct over period (of) years followed by association with Covenant-breakers (in) Holy Land and efforts (to) undermine Guardian's position, recently further demeaned himself through marriage under obscure circumstances with lowborn Christian girl (in) Europe" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | date=March 1950 |title=Faithless Brother |url=https://bahai.works/Baha%27i_News/Issue_229|newspaper=Bahá'í News|issue=229 |access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Bahá'í News'', No. 229, p.1).  Shoghi Effendi would later defend the use of the term "lowborn Christian girl" as follows: "Regarding his cable concerning Hussein: he has been very surprised to note that the terms 'low-born Christian girl ' and 'disgraceful alliance' should arouse any question; it seems to him that the friends should realize it is not befitting for the Guardian's own brother, the grandchild of the Master, an [[Afnán]] and [[Aghsán]] mentioned in the Will and Testament of the Master, and of whom so much was expected because of his relation to the family of the Prophet, to marry an unknown girl, according to goodness knows what rite, who is not a believer at all"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | date=October 1950|title=Hussein |url=https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File%3ABaha%27i_News_236.pdf&amp;page=4 |newspaper=Bahá'í News|issue=236 |access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Bahá'í News'', No. 236, p.4).

===Riaz===
Concerning his own brother Riaz, the following cable was sent in December 1951:

* "With feeling profound concern, grief, indignation, am compelled disclose Bahá'í world recent developments Holy Land furnishing further incontestable proof relationship established old and new Covenant-breakers demonstrating increasing boldness, marked, tragic decline in character and spiritual condition grandchildren `Abdu'l-Bahá. Their shameful attitude and conduct receiving approbation their elders. Evidences multiplying attesting Ruhi's increasing rebelliousness, efforts exerted my eldest sister pave way fourth alliance members family Siyyid Ali involving marriage his granddaughter with Ruha's son and personal contact recently established my own treacherous, despicable brother Riaz with [[Mírzá Músá#Family|Majdi'd-Din]], redoubtable enemy Faith, former henchman Muhammad-'Ali, Archbreaker Bahá'u'lláh's Covenant. Convey information all National Assemblies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Effendi |first=Shoghi |date=1999 |title=Messages to the Bahá’í World: 1950–1957  |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-13.html|publisher=Baha'i Publishing Trust|page=16 |isbn= 978-0877432500}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Messages to the Bahá'í World – 1950–1957'', p.&amp;nbsp;16)

===Mehrangiz===
He dispatched a cable concerning his younger sister in December 1941:

* "Sister Mehrangis [Mehrangiz] followed example Ruhi's [Ruhi] sister Justice demands announce believers her expulsion.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Effendi |first=Shoghi  |title=The unfolding destiny of the British Baha'i community: Messages from the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith to the Baha'is of the British Isles |page = 149   |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-158.html |publisher= UK Bahá’í Publishing Trust|date= December 1981 |isbn=978-0900125430}}&lt;/ref&gt;(''Unfolding Destiny'', p.&amp;nbsp;149)

The reason for her being declared a Covenant-breaker was that she followed the example of Ruhi's sister by marrying to one of his cousins without the Guardian's consent. Mehrangiz married to Hassan Afnan, the son of [[Bahá'u'lláh's family#Furughiyyih|Furughiyyih Khanum]], a daughter of Bahá'u'lláh by his third wife [[Bahá'u'lláh's family#Gawhar|Gawhar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sohrab |first=Ahmad|authorlink=Ahmad Sohrab |title=Abdul Baha's Grandson Story of a Twentieth Century Excommunication |page = 22   |url=https://www.abebooks.com/Abdul-Bahas-Grandson-Story-Twentieth-Century/18337084751/bd |publisher= Universal Publishing Company, New York |date= 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resultant groups==
{{main|Bahá'í divisions}}
{{unsourced section|date=February 2017}}
Most of the groups regarded by the larger group of Bahá'ís as Covenant-breakers originated in the claims of Charles Mason Remey to the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardianship]] in 1960.  The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]] states that Guardians should be [[lineal primogeniture|lineal descendant]]s of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], that each Guardian must select his successor during his lifetime, and that the nine [[Hands of the Cause of God]] permanently stationed in the [[holy land]] must approve the appointment by majority vote.  Bahá'ís interpret lineal descendency to mean physical familial relation to Bahá'u'lláh, of which Mason Remey was not.

Almost all of Bahá'ís accepted the determination of the [[Hands of the Cause]] that upon the death of Shoghi Effendi, he died "without having appointed his successor". There was an absence of a valid descendant of Bahá'u'lláh who could qualify under the terms of `Abdu'l-Bahá's will. Later the [[Universal House of Justice]], initially elected in 1963, made a ruling on the subject that it was not possible for another Guardian to be appointed.

In 1960 Remey, a Hand of the Cause himself, retracted his earlier position, and claimed to have been coerced.  He claimed to be the successor to Shoghi Effendi.  He and the small number of people who followed him were expelled from the Faith by the Hands of the Cause. Those close to Remey claimed that he went senile in old age, and by the time of his death he was largely abandoned, with his most prominent followers fighting amongst themselves for leadership.

The largest group of the remaining followers of Remey, members of the so called "[[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]]", believe that legitimate authority passed from Shoghi Effendi to Mason Remey to Joel Marangella. They, therefore, regard the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Israel to be illegitimate, and its members and followers to be Covenant-breakers.

The present descendants of expelled members of Bahá'u'lláh's family have not specifically been declared Covenant-breakers, though they mostly do not associate themselves with the Bahá'í religion.

A small group of Bahá'ís in Northern New Mexico believe that these descendants are eligible for appointment to the Guardianship and are waiting for such a direct descendant of Bahá'u'lláh to arise as the rightful Guardian.

There is also a small group in Montana, originally inspired by Leland Jensen, who claimed a status higher than that of the Guardian. His failed apocalyptic predictions and unsuccessful efforts to reestablish the Guardianship and the administration were apparent by his death in 1996. A dispute among Jensen's followers over the identity of the Guardian resulted in another division in 2001.

{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar}}
[[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] is the central figure of [[Christianity]]. [[Christian]]s believe that [[Jesus in Christianity|he]] was (and still is) [[divinity|divine]], while [[Jesus in Islam|Islam considers him]] to have been a [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]], messenger and the [[Messiah]]. Since the time in which he is said to have lived, a number of noted individuals have criticised Jesus, some of whom were themselves Christians.&lt;ref name=Dulles/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt;

Early [[Criticism of Christianity|critics of Jesus and Christianity]] included [[Celsus]] in the second century and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the third.&lt;ref name="Celsus"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Chadwick|editor-first= Henry |title=Contra Celsum| publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980| page= xxviii| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wsKLIV3TpOYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-29576-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.|last= Stevenson |publisher=SPCK |title= A New Eusebius: Documents illustrating the history of the Church to AD 337|year=1987|editor-first= W.

More contemporary notable critics of Jesus include [[Ayn Rand]], [[Hector Avalos]], [[Sita Ram Goel]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Dayananda Saraswati]].

==Criticism by Jesus' contemporaries==

===Pharisees and scribes===

The [[Pharisees]] and [[scribes]] criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing Mosaic Law. They criticized his disciples for not washing their hands before eating. (The religious leaders engaged in ceremonial cleansing like washing up to the elbow and baptizing the cups and plates before eating food in them—{{bibleref2|Mark|7:1-23}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|15:1-20}}.) Jesus is also criticized for eating with the publicans ({{bibleref2|Mark|2:15}}). The Pharisees also criticized Jesus' disciples for gathering grain on the Sabbath ({{bibleref2|Mark|2:23–3:6}}).

===Magic and exorcism===

In the latter half of the first century and into the second century, Jewish and pagan opponents of Christianity argued that the miracles and exorcisms of Jesus and his followers were the result of magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jews and Christians: the parting of the ways, A.D. 70 to 135 : the second Durham-Tübingen Research Symposium on Earliest Christianity and Judaism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zCh9SBb6Y8C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22Criticism+of+Jesus%22+Pharisees&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JI4FTsGfBuzXiALb8vHHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Criticism%20of%20Jesus%22%20Pharisees&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism by theme==

===Slavery===

{{See also | Christian views on slavery#New Testament}}

[[Avery Robert Dulles]] held the opinion that "Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.&lt;ref name=Dulles&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/development-or-reversal-37 |last=Cardinal Dulles |first=Avery |journal=First Things |title=Development or Reversal? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731064009/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/development-or-reversal-37 |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper published in [[Evangelical Quarterly]], [[Kevin Giles]] notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, "but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery." Giles points to this fact as being used as an argument that Jesus approved of slavery.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;[[Kevin Giles|Giles, Kevin]]. "The Biblical Argument for Slavery: Can the Bible Mislead? A Case Study in Hermeneutics." Evangelical Quarterly 66 (1994): p. 10 http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1994-1_003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In certain major non-English translations,{{Attribution needed|date=September 2016}} the first statement in the first sermon of Jesus (Luke 4:18), is a call to free the slaves: "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the slaves from war,..." (see Cornilescu translation).

==Criticism by author==

===Celsus===

{{main article|Celsus}}

[[Celsus]], 2nd-century Greek philosopher and opponent of Early Christianity, mounts a wide criticism against Jesus as the founder of the Christian [[faith]].&lt;ref name="Celsus" /&gt; He discounts or disparages Jesus' ancestry, conception, birth, childhood, ministry, death, [[resurrection]], and continuing influence.  According to Celsus, Jesus' ancestors came from a Jewish village. His mother was a poor country girl who earned her living by spinning cloth. He worked his [[miracles]] by sorcery and was a small, homely man. This Rabbi Jesus kept all Jewish customs, including sacrifice at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. He gathered only a few followers and taught them his worst habits, including begging for money. These [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], amounting to "ten boatmen and a couple of tax collectors" were not respectable. The [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|reports of his resurrection]] came from a hysterical female, and belief in the resurrection was the result of Jesus' sorcery and the crazed thinking of his followers, all for the purpose of impressing others and increasing the chance for others to become beggars.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond Edward Brown 1978. pp 261-262"&gt;Raymond Edward Brown, ''Mary in the New Testament'',  Paulist Press, 1978. pp 261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Celsus, Jesus was the inspiration for skulking rebels who deserve persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0301/celsus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102091719/http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0301/celsus.htm |archivedate=2011-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celsus stated that Jesus was the bastard child of the Roman soldier [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera#Jesus connection|Panthera]] or Pantera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen161.html Origen, ''Contra Celsus''1.32]&lt;/ref&gt;  These charges of illegitimacy are the earliest datable statement of the Jewish charge that Jesus was conceived as the result of adultery (see [[Jesus in the Talmud]]) and that his true father was a Roman soldier named Panthera. Panthera was a common name among Roman soldiers of that period. The name has [[Language shift|some similarity]] to the Greek adjective ''parthenos'', meaning "virgin".&lt;ref name="James D. Tabor 2006. p 64"&gt;James D. Tabor, ''The Jesus Dynasty: The Hidden History of Jesus, His Royal Family, and the Birth of Christianity'', Simon and Schuster, 2006. p 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Van Voorst,''Jesus outside the New Testament'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb of a Roman soldier named [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera]], found in [[Bad Kreuznach]], Germany, is taken by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;James Tabor, ''The Jesus Dynasty'' (2006), pages. 64-72&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the Pantera named by Celsus.

According to Celsus, Jesus had no standing in the [[Hebrew Bible]] prophecies and talk of his resurrection was foolishness.&lt;ref name="Raymond Edward Brown 1978. pp 261-262"/&gt;

===Porphyry of Tyre===

{{main article|Porphyry (philosopher)}}

The [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher Porphyry of Tyre (c. 232–c. 304) authored the 15 volume treatise ''Against the Christians'', proscribed by the Emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and [[Theodosius II]], of which only fragments now survive and were collected by [[Adolf von Harnack]]. Selected fragments were published in English translation by J. Stevenson in 1957, of which the following is one example:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;Even supposing some Greeks are so foolish as to think that the gods dwell in the statues, even that would be a much purer concept (of religion) than to admit that the Divine Power should descend into the womb of the Virgin Mary, that it became an embryo, and after birth was wrapped in rags, soiled with blood and bile, and even worse.&lt;ref&gt;J. Stevenson, ''A New Eusebius: Documents illustrating the history of the Church to AD 337'' (Society For Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1957; New Edition, revised by [[W. H. C. Frend]], page 257,  1987). {{ISBN|0-281-04268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Janes, ''Romans and Christians'', page 51 (Tempus, 2002). {{ISBN|978-0752419541}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===

[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|right|Nietzsche considered Jesus’ teachings to be "unnatural".]]
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a 19th-century philosopher, has many criticisms of Jesus and Christianity, even going so far as to style himself as ''[[The Anti-Christ]]''. In ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', and ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' for example, Nietzsche accuses the Church's and Jesus' teachings as being anti-natural in their treatment of passions, in particularly sexuality: "There [In the Sermon on the Mount] it is said, for example, with particular reference to sexuality: 'If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.' Fortunately, no Christian acts in accordance with this precept...&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, 1895, Twilight of the Idols, Morality as Anti-nature, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche does explicitly consider Jesus as a mortal, and furthermore as ultimately misguided, the antithesis of a true hero, whom he posits with his concept of a [[Dionysian]] hero. Nietzsche was repulsed by Jesus' elevation of the lowly: "Everything pitiful, everything suffering from itself, everything tormented by base feelings, the whole ghetto-world of the soul suddenly on top!"&lt;ref&gt;http://centretruths.co.uk/fahdtu/THE%20ANTICHRIST.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

However Nietzsche did not demur of Jesus, saying he was the "only one true Christian". He presented a Christ whose own inner life consisted of "blessedness in peace, in gentleness, in the ''inability'' for enmity". There is much criticism by Nietzsche of the organized institution of Christianity and its class of priests. Christ's evangelism consisted of the good news that the kingdom of God is within you.&lt;ref name="A34"&gt;''The Antichrist'', § 34&lt;/ref&gt; "What are the 'glad tidings'? True life, eternal life is found—it is not promised, it is here, it is ''within you'': as life lived in love.... 'Sin', every kind of distancing relationship between God and man, is abolished - ''precisely this is the 'glad tidings'.'' The 'glad tidings' are precisely that there are no more opposites...."

===Dayanand Saraswati===

[[Dayananda Saraswati]], a 19th-century philosopher and the founder of [[Arya Samaj]], in his book ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'', criticized Christianity and described Jesus as a "great thing in a country of uneducated savages":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All Christian missionaries say that Jesus was a very calm and peace-loving person. But in reality he was a hot-tempered person destitute of knowledge and who behaved like a wild savage. This shows that Jesus was neither the son of God, nor had he any miraculous powers. He did not possess the power to forgive sins. The righteous people do not stand in need of any mediator like Jesus. Jesus came to spread discord which is going on everywhere in the world. Therefore, it is evident that the hoax of Christ’s being the Son of God, the knower of the past and the future, the forgiver of sin, has been set up falsely by his disciples. In reality, he was a very ordinary ignorant man, neither learned nor a yogi."&lt;ref&gt;"Hindu Nationalists of Modern India" by Jose Kuruvachira, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Saraswati asserted that Jesus wasn't an enlightened man either, and that if Jesus was a son of God, God would have saved him at the time of his death, and he wouldn't have suffered from severe mental and physical pain at last moments.

Noting that the Bible writes that women held the feet of Jesus and worshiped him, he questions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Was it the same body which had been buried? Now that body had been buried for three days, we should like to know why did it not decompose?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bertrand Russell===

In the 1927 essay ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'', [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] pointed to parts of the gospel where Jesus is saying that his second coming will occur in the lifetime of some of his listeners ({{bibleref2|Luke|9:27}}). He concludes from this that Jesus' prediction was incorrect and thus that Jesus was "not so wise as some other people have been, and He was certainly not superlatively wise".&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Bertrand (1927). ''Why I am not a Christian'' in "Why I am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects," 2004, Routledge Classics, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Russell believed Jesus 'had a very high degree of moral goodness', he also felt there were some notable flaws in his character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=Why I am Not a Christian|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~sabar/enc3311/Why%20I%20Am%20Not%20A%20Christian%20-%20Bertrand%20Russell.pdf|website=www2fiu.edu|accessdate=February 9, 2017|ref=page 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay he wrote: 
:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one very serious defect to my mind in Christ's moral character, and that is that He believed in hell. I do not myself feel that any person who is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment. Christ certainly as depicted in the Gospels did believe in everlasting punishment, and one does find repeatedly a vindictive fury against those people who would not listen to His preaching -- an attitude which is not uncommon with preachers, but which does somewhat detract from superlative excellence. You do not, for instance find that attitude in Socrates. You find him quite bland and urbane toward the people who would not listen to him; and it is, to my mind, far more worthy of a sage to take that line than to take the line of indignation.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EB6PCgUZZMQC&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;ots=-Hqar-POlU&amp;dq=%22serious%20defect%20to%20my%20mind%20in%20Christ's%20moral%20character%22%20russell&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Why I am not a Christian] By Russell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Russell also expresses doubt over the [[Historicity of Jesus|historical existence of Jesus]] and questions the morality of religion: "I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world."&lt;ref name="why"&gt;{{cite web

===Ayn Rand===

Novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] denounced the [[Altruism#Christianity|altruist]] recipe that Jesus passed down to his pupils, and with it the idea of [[Atonement in Christianity|vicarious redemption]]. She thought that not even Christians, who think of Jesus in the highest possible terms, shouldn't feel outraged by the notion of sacrificing virtue to vice.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, her understanding of love as a consequence of the rational mind looking after embodied values attributes evil to the ideas Jesus is most famous for. Consider the following excerpt from a 1959 interview conducted by [[Mike Wallace]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wallace: Christ, every important moral leader in man's history, has taught us that we should love one another. Why then is this kind of love in your mind immoral?&lt;br&gt;
Rand: It is immoral if it is a love placed above oneself. It is more than immoral, it's impossible. Because when you are asked to love everybody indiscriminately. That is to love people without any standard. To love them regardless of whether they have any value or virtue, you are asked to love nobody.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notwithstanding disagreements over the value of faith and the existence of an afterlife, Rand saw Jesus' insistence on procuring the eternal happiness of individuals as confirmation of the moral confusion and inconsistency in which much of religious ethics operates, including Christian altruism.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[For the New Intellectual]], Rand further accuses Judeo-Christian tenets such as the doctrine of original sin for their conspicuous immorality. "The evils for which they damn him [man] are reason, morality, creativeness, joy — all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn. They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man." And proceeds to charge religious leaders with fostering a death cult: "No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien object: his body. No, they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish to make him lose his body."&lt;ref&gt;

=== Sita Ram Goel ===

Historian and Hindu activist [[Sita Ram Goel]] accused Jesus of being the intellectual author behind Western imperialism and [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Blackwell Companion to Jesus
|page=285
|first=Delbert
|last=Burkett}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goel further writes that Jesus "is no more than an artifice for legitimizing wanton imperialist aggression. He does not symbolize spiritual power or moral uprightness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{see also|Antisemitism and the New Testament}}

He made his case based on the gospels, which he thought cast too dark a shadow on unconverted Jews (see for instance {{Bibleref2|John|8:38-47||John 8:38-47}}). From there he drew parallels between Jesus and Adolf Hitler, the latter of whom was, in Goel's words, the first to "completely grasp the verdict passed on the Jews by the Jesus of the gospels".&lt;ref name="artifice-for-aggression"&gt;{{cite book
| author1 = Sita Ram Goel
| authorlink1 = Sita Ram Goel
| title = Jesus Christ: An Artifice for Aggression
| date = 1994
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram Goel also ridiculed what he termed "the cult of the disentangled Christ", whereby Christian revisionism attempts to salvage the figure of Jesus from the atrocious historical outcomes he inspired — and only from the bad ones — as though missionary proselytism and Western expansionism were to be perceived in the separate as mere coincidence.&lt;ref name="artifice-for-aggression"/&gt;

===Christopher Hitchens===
{{See also|God Is Not Great}}
[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hitchens]]

Author and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]], one of the leading exponents in the "[[New Atheism]]" movement, was extremely critical of Jesus, Christianity and any religion in general. Regarding [[Christian views on Hell#Hell in the New Testament|Jesus' teachings on hell]], Hitchens wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The god of Moses would call for other tribes, including his favorite one, to suffer massacre and plague and even extirpation, but when the grave closed over his victims he was essentially finished with them unless he remembered to curse their succeeding progeny. Not until the advent of the Prince of Peace do we hear of the ghastly idea of further punishing and torturing the dead."&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]], ''[[God is Not Great]]'', (2007) pages: 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hitchens also felt that a divine Jesus would be the more morally problematic by virtue of the [[problem of evil]], asking:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If Jesus could heal a blind person he happened to meet, then why not heal blindness?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]], ''[[God is Not Great]]'', (2007) page: 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sam Harris===

[[Sam Harris]], author of [[The End of Faith]], has expressed ambivalent views on Jesus' teachings. He argues that while Jesus may have been an insightful spiritual master of compassion at times, he also taught his followers to fulfill the barbaric [[Mosaic Law|law of the Old Testament]], and gave his followers specifics on how to execute heretics. To Harris, Jesus' unresolved frustration and hatred of non-Christians runs contrary to the imagination of contemporary religious moderates, and actually lends honesty to more fundamentalist interpretations of salvation and hell. He wrote:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to demanding that we fulfill every "jot" and "tittle" of Old Testament Law, Jesus seems to have suggested, in John 15:6, further refinements to the practice of killing heretics and unbelievers: "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned." Whether we want to interpret Jesus metaphorically is, of course, our business. The problem with scripture, however, is that many of its possible interpretations (including most of the literal ones) can be used to justify attrocities in defense of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Harris]], ''[[The End of Faith]]'', (2004) page 83&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

To the same end of exposing Jesus in relation to the doctrine of hell, Harris quotes Luke's version of the [[parable of the talents]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82YIluFmdbs&lt;/ref&gt; which ends with the nobleman character saying:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (King James)/Luke#19:27]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which is taken to be a self-portrait of Jesus and his own eschatological views.&lt;ref name=Finley&gt;Finley, Tom.

===Hector Avalos===

[[Hector Avalos]] is perhaps the first openly atheist biblical scholar to write a systematic critique of the ethics of Jesus in his book, ''The Bad Jesus: The Ethics of New Testament Ethics''. Koowon Kim, an associate professor in the Old Testament at Reformed Graduate University in South Korea remarks in his review of ''The Bad Jesus'': "Whether or not one agrees with the author’s conclusions, this book is the first systematic challenge to New Testament ethics by an atheist scholar firmly grounded in the Hebrew Bible and its ancient Near Eastern context and well-versed in New Testament and Early Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/31835722/Reivew_of_The_Bad_Jesus_The_Ethics_of_New_Testament_Ethics_by_Hector_Avalos&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in ''Bilbilcal Theology Bulletin'', Sarah Rollens, a New Testament scholar at Rhodes College, remarks: "Hector Avalos aims not only to convince us that many portrayals of Jesus based on New Testament texts are morally or ethically problematic, but also to demonstrate how scholars have engaged in questionable distortions to minimize, explain away, or otherwise ignore any textual evidence that might not comport with modern ethical standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rollens, Sarah |title=Book Review: The Bad Jesus: The Ethics of New Testament Ethics | url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146107917697910h |journal=Biblical Theology Bulletin |volume=47 |year=2017 |pages=127-128 |doi=10.1177/0146107917697910h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]], which includes [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Haredi Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], [[Reform Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Karaite Judaism]], and [[Samaritanism|Samaritan Judaism]], entirely rejects the idea of Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|being a god]], a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God who has a special relationship with Him that somehow makes Jesus "divine". Moreover, it is ''[[Idolatry in Judaism|Avodah Zarah]]'' ("foreign worship", which means [[idolatry]]) to regard or worship a human being as God; in Judaism, as well as in [[Islam]], [[God in Judaism|God is only One, totally transcendent, and cannot be human]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|20:1–19|HE}}, [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|6:4–9|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|11:13–32|HE}}).

Judaism also holds that [[Jewish Messiah claimants|Jesus couldn't be the Jewish Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled any of the [[Messianic prophecies]] foretold in the [[Tanakh]], nor did he embody the [[Messiah in Judaism#Scriptural requirements|personal qualifications]] of the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] foretold by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after [[Malachi]], who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophecies about 420 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], "[http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&amp;o=350 Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?]", [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Hammer of God" Page 34 by Stephen Andrew Missick&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Judaism is critical of Jesus' own claims and allusions about his alleged messiahship and his identification as the "son of God",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitacre|first=Rodney A.|title=John (IVP New Testament Commentary)|date=2010|publisher=Ivp Academic|location=Downers Grove, Ill.|isbn=978-0830840045|chapter=John 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as presented in the New Testament, and considers Jesus to be just one of many [[Jewish Messiah claimants|individuals who claimed to be the Messiah]], but didn't fulfill any of the Messianic prophecies; therefore, they were all impostors.

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', one of the most authoritative works of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], written by [[Moses Maimonides]], provides the last established consensus view of the Jewish community, in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".
{{quote|Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. So that it was said, "And the members of the outlaws of your nation would be carried to make a (prophetic) vision stand. And they stumbled."{{Bibleref2c|Dan.|11:14}} Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God. However, the thoughts of the Creator of the world&amp;nbsp;— there is no force in a human to attain them because our ways are not God's ways, and our thoughts not God's thoughts. And all these things of Jesus the Nazarene, and of ([[Muhammad]]) the [[Ishmael]]ite who stood after him&amp;nbsp;— there is no (purpose) but to straighten out the way for the King Messiah, and to restore all the world to serve God together. So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder."{{Bibleref2c|Zeph.|3:9}} Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the [[Torah]], and the things of the commandments! And these things spread among the far islands and among the many nations uncircumcised of heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e511.htm Hilchot Malachim (laws concerning kings) (Hebrew)]", MechonMamre.org, Retrieved April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Faith healing''' is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as [[laying on of hands]]) that are believed by some to elicit [[miracle|divine intervention]] in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Faith healing|url=http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp#F|website=thearda.com|location=University Park, PA|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=2015-10-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101012004/http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp|archivedate=2016-01-01|deadurl=no}} Citing {{cite encyclopedia|year=1995|title=|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=William Scott|encyclopedia=The Harper Collins Dictionary of Religion|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer and/or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a [[divine presence]] and power. Religious belief in divine intervention does not depend on [[empirical evidence]] that faith healing achieves an [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based outcome]].&lt;ref name=Village/&gt;

Many people interpret the Bible, especially the [[New Testament]], as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. According to a 2004 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll, 72 percent of Americans said they believe that praying to God can cure someone, even if science says the person has an incurable disease.&lt;ref name="Kalb2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalb|first=Claudia|date=2004-11-10|title=Can religion improve health?

Regarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], faith healing often involves the [[laying on of hands]]. It is also called supernatural healing, divine healing, and miracle healing, among other things. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including [[Elijah]], [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].&lt;ref name="Village" /&gt;

Christian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{cite book |first= Reginald B. |last= Cherry |title= The Bible Cure |publisher= HarperOne |year= 1999 |origyear= 1998 |edition= reprint |isbn= 0062516159}}{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Citing: {{Bibleref2|John|9:1–7}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:46–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ's redemption on the cross.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=32}} Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves, Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Wilfred, Jr. |last= Graves |authorlink= Wilfred Graves, Jr. |title= In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God's Salvation for the Total Person |page= 52 |location= Shippensburg, PA |publisher= Destiny Image |isbn= 9780768437942}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:17|NIV}}, after describing [[Jesus exorcising at sunset]] and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|53:5|NIV}}: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases."

Even those Christian writers who believe in faith healing do not all believe that one's faith presently brings about the desired healing. "[Y]our faith does not effect your healing now.

====New Testament====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=September 2015}}
Parts of the four [[gospel]]s in the [[New Testament]] say that [[Jesus]] cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. One example is the case of "a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:26–27}} After healing her, Jesus tells her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:34|GW}} At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:52}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|19:10}}.

Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] (Luke 10:25-37), who "bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, "And who is my neighbor?" in verse 29) to "go, and do likewise" in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thefaithfulword.org/faithhealing.html |title= Faith Healing – God's Compassion, God's Power, and God's Sovereignty: Is a Christian permitted to seek medical assistance and to use medicine? |date= December 16, 2003 |first= Craig W. |last= Booth |accessdate= 2007-05-01 |work= thefaithfulword.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healing in the gospels is referred to as a "sign"{{Bibleref2c|John|6:2}} to prove Jesus' divinity and to foster belief in him as the Christ.{{Bibleref2c|John|4:48}} However, when asked for other types of miracles, Jesus refused some{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38-42}} but granted others{{Bibleref2c|Luke|9:38–43}} in consideration of the motive of the request. Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed ''all'' who were present every single time.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=61}} Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}}

Jesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to "cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|10:8}}{{Bibleref2c|Mark|16:17–18}}

Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: "Do not tell anyone!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:4}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|9:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|5:43}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:36}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|8:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|9:9}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a "wicked and adulterous generation."{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38–39}}

The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]],{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|12:9||1 Corinthians 12:9}} and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Price |first= Charles P. |url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |chapter= Faith Healing |title= Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia. |year= 2009 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpJ3YJj?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |archivedate= 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament [[Epistle of James]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|James|5:14}} the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord.

The New Testament says that during Jesus' [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]] and after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles.

Jesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the Messianic Age. as in Mt 12.28. Scholars have described Jesus' miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|last=Brown, et al|first=Raymond E.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=0-13-614934-0|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=|chapter=78:20; 81:106,112,113,117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pentecostalism/Charismatic movement====
[[File:RichardRossiHealingService.JPG|right|thumb|[[Richard Rossi]] prays for the sick at one of his faith healing services, September, 1990.]]At the beginning of the 20th century, the new [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement drew participants from the [[Holiness movement]] and other movements in America that already believed in divine healing. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings.

The first Pentecostals in the modern sense appeared in [[Topeka, Kansas]], in a Bible school conducted by [[Charles Fox Parham]], a holiness teacher and former [[Methodist]] pastor. Pentecostalism achieved worldwide attention in 1906 through the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in [[Los Angeles]] led by [[William Joseph Seymour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Synan |first= Vinson |title= The Origins of the Pentecostal Movement |url= http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/library/holyspirit/pentorg1.html |publisher= Holy Spirit Research Center, Oral Roberts University |date= 14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smith Wigglesworth]] was also a well-known figure in the early part of the 20th century. A former English plumber turned [[evangelism|evangelist]] who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. Wigglesworth claimed to raise several people from the dead in Jesus' name in his meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Sarah |last1=Posner |first2= Joe |last2= Conason |title= God's Profits: Faith, Fraud, and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters |publisher= Polipoint Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 0979482216 |page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the [[Great Depression]]. Subsequently, [[William M. Branham]] has been credited as the initiater of the post-World War II [[healing revival]]s.&lt;ref name="Anderson2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first= Allan|year=2004|title=An introduction to Pentecostalism: global charismatic Christianity|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521532808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPbPTOi0Rk4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=58}}&lt;ref name="Harrell1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrell|first=David E.|year=1975|title=All things are possible: the healing and charismatic revivals in modern America|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253100900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ks-Sa1mSnI8C&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=25}} The healing revival he began led many to emulate his style and spawned a generation of faith healers.

Oral Roberts's successful use of television as a medium to gain a wider audience led others to follow suit. His former pilot, [[Kenneth Copeland]], started a healing ministry.

In 2000, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] issued "Instruction on prayers for healing" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing,&lt;ref name="CDF2000"/&gt; which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing.&lt;ref name="Ascoli2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascoli|first=Micol|year=2009|chapter=Psychotherapy or religious healing? : the 'therapeutic' cult of charismatic Catholics in Italy|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Su9Zhe3HglsC&amp;pg=PA229|editor1-last=Incayawar|editor1-first=Mario|editor2-last=Wintrob|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Bouchard|editor3-first=Lise|title=Psychiatrist and traditional healers : unwitting partners in global mental health|series=WPA series, evidence and experience in psychiatry|location=Hoboken, NJ|publisher=J.

Faith in a [[scientific discovery]] acts through the mind of a patient to bring about an improvement of symptoms, if not a cure of the disease. The patients who are cured usually suffer from [[chronic condition]]s, they either have only a [[persuasion]] that they are ill or have some physical ailment, but the patients inhibit through {{linktext|solicitude}} and worry the natural forces that would bring about a cure. This inhibition cannot be lifted until the mind is relieved by confidence in a remedy or scientific discovery that gives them a conviction of cure.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}} but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="USCCB2009"/&gt;{{rp|at=nn11–12}}

Faith healing is reported by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] as the result of [[intercessory prayer]] to a [[saint]] or to a person with the gift of healing. According to ''U.S. Catholic'' magazine, "Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific age—miracles really are possible." Three-fourths of American Catholics say they pray for miracles.&lt;ref name=Scanlon&gt;{{cite news |first= Leslie |last= Scanlon |title= It's a miracle! |magazine= U.S. Catholic |date= June 2009 |volume= 74 |issue= 6 |page= 12 |url= http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2009/05/its-miracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Cavadini, when healing is granted, "The miracle is not primarily for the person healed, but for all people, as a sign of God's work in the ultimate healing called 'salvation,' or a sign of the kingdom that is coming." Some might view their own healing as a sign they are particularly worthy or holy, while others do not deserve it.&lt;ref name=Scanlon/&gt;

The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Pope Francis tightened the rules on money and miracles in the canonization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/09/23/vatican-tightens-rules-miracles-money-sainthood-cases/|title=Vatican tightens rules on miracles and money in sainthood cases|date=2016-09-23|work=Crux|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles. While the popular conception of a miracle can be wide-ranging, the Catholic Church has a specific definition for the kind of miracle formally recognized in a canonization process.&lt;ref name=Pinches&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pinches |first= Charles |title= Miracles: A Christian theological overview |journal= [[Southern Medical Journal]] |year= 2007 |volume= 100 |issue= 12 |pages= 1236–42 |pmid= 18090969 |doi= 10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31815843cd |url= http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/Fulltext/2007/12000/Miracles__A_Christian_Theological_Overview.17.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', it is often said that cures at [[shrine]]s and during [[Christian pilgrimage]]s are mainly due to psychotherapy — partly to confident trust in [[Divine providence]], and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|title=Psychotherapy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12549a.htm|first=James J.|last=Walsh|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A pre-1911 analysis of the records of cures shows that the majority of accepted cures have been in patients suffering from demonstrable physical conditions.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}}

Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in [[France]] and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to [[Saint Jude]], who is known as the "[[patron saint]] of lost causes".

[[Christian Science]] claims that healing is possible through an understanding of the underlying spiritual perfection of God's creation.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; The world as humanly perceived is believed to be a distortion of spiritual reality.

An important point in Christian Science is that effectual prayer and the moral regeneration of one's life go hand-in-hand: that "signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical healing of physical disease; but these signs are only to demonstrate its divine origin, to attest the reality of the higher mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the world."{{sfn|Eddy, Mary Baker|1875|loc= "Medicine" p. [http://sentinel.christianscience.com/concordapi/view?q=SH%20150:4-150:17 150]}} Christian Science teaches that disease is mental, a mortal fear, a mistaken belief or conviction of the necessity and power of ill-health – an ignorance of God's power and goodness. The chapter "Prayer" in ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'' gives a full account of healing through prayer, while the testimonies at the end of the book are written by people who believe they have been healed through spiritual understanding gained from reading the book.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. Many members of the LDS Church have told their stories of healing within the LDS publication, the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Miller |first= Brandon J. |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= I needed a blessing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Ensign) |date= September 2001 |pages= 64–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ribeiro |first= Sérgio |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2004/01/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= He restoreth my soul |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= January 2004 |pages= 70–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Heal |first= Simon |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2010/04/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= Call an ambulance! |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= April 2010 |pages= 60–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Peñate de Guerra |first= Magdalena |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2005/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= We rejoiced in her healing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= September 2005 |pages= 66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church believes healings come most often as a result of [[priesthood blessing]]s given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Healing is always attributed to be God's power. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, [[Joseph Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |title= Joseph Smith/Healings and miracles |publisher= [[FairMormon]] |work= fairmormon.org |date= May 23, 2010 |accessdate= 2010-09-20 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201100307/http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |archivedate= 2010-02-01 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.josephsmith.net/josephsmith/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=041579179acbff00VgnVCM1000001f5e340aRCRD&amp;locale=0 |title= Joseph Smith: Prophet of God |work= Josephsmith.net |publisher= [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS)}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to LDS doctrine, even though members may have the restored [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood authority]] to heal in the name of Jesus Christ, all efforts should be made to seek the appropriate medical help. [[Brigham Young]] stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young, Brigham|1997|loc= Chapter 34: "Strengthening the Saints Through the Gifts of the Spirit."

===Islam===
{{disputed section|date=April 2016}}
Konkhogin Haokip has claimed some [[Muslim]]s believe that the [[Quran]] was sent not only as a revelation, but as a medicine, and that they believe the Quran heals any physical and spiritual ailments through such practices as
* Reciting the Quran over water or olive oil and drinking, bathing or anointing oneself with it.
* Placing the right hand on a place that is in pain, or placing the right hand on the forehead and reciting ''[[Al-Fatiha|Sura Al-Fatiha]]''. These methods are referred to as ''ruqyah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Increasing Knowledge about Divine Healing Within the Leadership of an Immigrant Asian Baptist Church|last=Haokip|first=Konkhogin (Hagin)|publisher=ProQuest|year=2007|isbn=9781109065787|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0vcxUctPta8C&amp;pg=PA53 53–4]}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2013-11-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in a ''New York Times'' article on prayer studies from October 10, 2004, Rev. Raymond J. Lawrence Jr. of New York-Presbyterian Hospital is quoted as saying, "There's no way to put God to the test, and that's exactly what you're doing when you design a study to see if God answers your prayers.

The Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) was created in 2012 to start collecting medical records of patients who claim to have received a supernatural healing miracle as a result of Christian Spiritual Healing practices. The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient’s records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. “The overall goal of GMRI is to promote an empirically grounded understanding of the physiological, emotional, and sociological effects of Christian Spiritual Healing practices.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalmri.org/index.php/about Global Medical Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by applying the same rigorous standards used in other forms of medical and scientific research.

Skeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural.{{efn|"Benefits may result because of the natural progression of the illness, rarely but regularly occurring spontaneous remission or through the placebo effect."

These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the [[placebo]] effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{cite book |last= Park |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L.

Both cases, however, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

According to the [[American Cancer Society]]:
{{quote|... available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments... One review published in 1998 looked at 172 cases of deaths among children treated by faith healing instead of conventional methods. These researchers estimated that if conventional treatment had been given, the survival rate for most of these children would have been more than 90 percent, with the remainder of the children also having a good chance of survival. A more recent study found that more than 200 children had died of treatable illnesses in the United States over the past thirty years because their parents relied on spiritual healing rather than conventional medical treatment.}}

===Negative impact on public health===
Reliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques.{{efn|"Faith healing can cause patients to shun effective medical care."

===Christian theological criticism of faith healing===
Christian theological criticism of faith healing broadly falls into two distinct levels of disagreement.

The first is widely termed the "open-but-cautious" view of the miraculous in the church today. This term is deliberately used by [[Robert L. Saucy]] in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?''.&lt;ref name="grudem et al."&gt;{{cite book |last= Saucy |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L. Saucy |title= Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? |editor-last= Grudem |editor-first= Wayne |editor-link= Wayne Grudem |year= 1996 |isbn= 0310201551 |chapter= |page=}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Carson]] is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an "open-but-cautious" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/bio/dacarson.html |title= D.A. Carson: Biographical Sketch |work= Monergism.com |publisher= Christian Publication Resource Foundation |location= Portland, OR |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with the claims of [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|Warfield]], particularly "Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased,"{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} Carson asserts, "But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so."{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, "Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith."{{sfn|Carson|1987|pages=174–5}}

The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as [[cessationism]], its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. [[Richard Gaffin]] argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy's in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today''? In his book ''Perspectives on Pentecost''{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}} Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that "the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|pages=113–4}} Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying "At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14,15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|page=114}}

===Fraud===
Skeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a [[quackery|quack]] practice in which the "healers" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} [[James Randi]]'s ''[[The Faith Healers]]'' investigates Christian evangelists such as [[Peter Popoff]], who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants' lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html|title=Some Thoughts about Faith Healing|website=www.quackwatch.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes.{{efn|"[Some] faith-healers have been less than careful in their use of funds sent to them for specific purposes."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} Physicist [[Robert L. Park]]&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; and doctor and consumer advocate [[Stephen Barrett]]&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; have called into question the ethics of some exorbitant fees.

There have also been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a [[Jack Coe]] revival service in [[Miami, Florida]], Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130129191538/http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= January 29, 2013 |title= Faith healer dies – Victim of bulbar polio |newspaper= [[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|Daily Courier]] |location= Yavapai County, AZ |date= December 18, 1956 |accessdate= 2007-11-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Faith-healer' dies of polio |date= December 17, 1956 |newspaper= [[The Salina Journal]] |location= Salina, KS |page= 5 |url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40757536/ |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's [[leg braces]].&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt; However, their son was not cured of polio and removing the braces left the boy in constant pain.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Davis |first= Mike |title= Lost faith: Mother's story of healer |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19560208&amp;id=AJ0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MekFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3001,2779353 |date= February 8, 1956 |page= 7A |newspaper= [[The Miami News|The Miami Daily News]] |location= Miami, FL |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, through the efforts of [[Joseph L.

===Miracles for sale===
TV personality [[Derren Brown]] produced a show on faith healing entitled "Miracles for sale" which arguably exposed the art of faith healing as a scam. In this show, Derren trained a scuba diver trainer picked from the general public to be a faith healer and took him to Texas to successfully deliver a faith healing session to a congregation.&lt;ref name="metro-derren-brown"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041421/http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303/ |dead-url= no |archive-date= February 15, 2013 |title= Derren Brown: Miracles For Sale was deceptively entertaining polio |newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date= April 25, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States law==
The 1974 [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) required states to grant religious exemptions to [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse]] laws in order to receive federal money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Merrick |first=Janna C. |year= 2003 |title= Spiritual healing, sick kids and the law: Inequities in the American healthcare system |journal= [[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]] |volume= 29 |issue=2-3 |pages= 269–99 |pmid= 12961808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAPTA amendments of 1996 {{usc|42|5106i}} state:

{{quote|text=
(a) In General. – Nothing in this Act shall be construed –

"(1) as establishing a Federal requirement that a parent or legal guardian provide a child any medical service or treatment against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian; and "(2) to require that a State find, or to prohibit a State from finding, abuse or neglect in cases in which a parent or legal guardian relies solely or partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, in accordance with the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian.

"(b) State Requirement. – Notwithstanding subsection (a), a State shall, at a minimum, have in place authority under State law to permit the child protective services system of the State to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, to provide medical care or treatment for a child when such care or treatment is necessary to prevent or remedy serious harm to the child, or to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from children with life threatening conditions. Except with respect to the withholding of medically indicated treatments from disabled infants with life threatening conditions, case by case determinations concerning the exercise of the authority of this subsection shall be within the sole discretion of the State.}}

Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions. These are Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher=[[Child Welfare Information Gateway]], [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services]] |date=April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- updated version (February 2011) available at url given --&gt; In six of these states, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio and West Virginia, the exemptions extend to murder and manslaughter.

      <comment>/* Other changes */ Removed reference to institution of feast of Queenship of Mary; instituted in October 1954</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6153">In 1955 [[Pope Pius XII]] made several changes to the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]], changes that remained in force only until 1960, when [[Pope John XXIII]], on the basis of further recommendations of the commission that Pius XII had set up, decreed a further revision of the [[General Roman Calendar]] (see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]). The changes made by Pope Pius XII thus remained unaltered for only five years.

He made the following changes by the decree ''"Cum nostra hac aetate"'' (De rubricis ad simpliciorem formam redigendis) of 23 March 1955&lt;ref&gt;[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] 47(1955), pages 218-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rank of feasts==
The grade and rite of ''"Semi-Double"'' was suppressed, and the liturgical days formerly celebrated as that rite were to be celebrated in the simple rite except the Vigil of Pentecost which was raised to the double rite.&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sundays==
The Sundays of Advent and Lent and those that follow up to Low Sunday, and also Pentecost Sunday, were to be celebrated as doubles of the first class, outranking all feasts; but when feasts of the first class occurred on the second, third or fourth Sunday of Advent, [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] of the feast were permitted except the conventual Mass. Sundays previously celebrated in the Semi-Double rite were raised to the Double rite. An impeded Sunday Office and Mass was to be neither anticipated nor resumed. A feast or title or any mystery of [[Jesus|Our Lord]] falling on a Sunday per annum was thenceforth to take the place of the Sunday, with the latter merely [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemorated]].&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vigils==
The Vigil of the Nativity of the Lord and the vigil of Pentecost were privileged vigils. The Vigils of the Ascension of Our Lord, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Baptist, Saints Peter and Paul and Saint Lawrence were to be common vigils and, if they occurred on a Sunday, were not to be anticipated, but simply omitted. All other vigils, including those marked in particular calendars, were suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Octaves==
Only the [[Octave (liturgical)|Octaves]] of Easter, Christmas and Pentecost were to be celebrated; all others occurring either in the universal or in particular calendars were suppressed. The days within the Easter and Pentecost octaves were raised to the Double rite, had precedence over all feasts, and did not admit commemorations. But the days of the Octave of Christmas, although of the Double rite, continued to be celebrated as before.&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2 to 5 January, unless some feast occurred, the Office was to be of the current [[feria]] in the simple rite. The Mass was to be the same as that of 1 January but without the Credo and the special ''Communicantes''.&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

With the suppression of the Octave of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]], the days from 7 to 12 January became feriae per annum (in the Simple rite); up to the Sunday following Epiphany, the Mass was to be the same as that of the Epiphany, but without the Credo and without the special ''Communicantes''; after the Sunday, the mass was to be that of the Sunday (which on that Sunday itself remained continually impeded by the Feast of the Holy Family). On 13 January the Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord was to be celebrated in the major double rite, using for the Office and the Mass those previously said on the Octave of the Epiphany. But if 13 January occurred on Sunday, the Office and Mass were to be those of the ''"Feast of the Holy Family"'' without any commemoration of the Baptism of Our Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The days from the Ascension of Our Lord to the Vigil of Pentecost exclusive became feriae of Eastertide (in the Simple rite); the Mass was to be that of the Feast of the Ascension, but without the Credo and the special Communicantes (even on the Friday before Pentecost, where hitherto the Mass of the Sunday had to be taken). The days of the suppressed Octaves of Corpus Christi and the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus became feriae per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasts of the Saints==
Saints' feasts previously celebrated in the Semi-Double rite were to be treated as Simple feasts, and those previously celebrated in the Simple rite were reduced to a commemoration. If any feast not of the first or second class occurred on the ferias of [[Lent]] and [[Passiontide]], from [[Ash Wednesday]] to the Saturday before [[Palm Sunday]], the Office (if recited privately) and the Mass could be either of the feria or of the feast.&lt;ref&gt;Title II: Changes in the calendar, 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other changes==
By a separate decree of the same year 1955, Pope Pius XII instituted the feast of ''"Saint Joseph the Worker"'' on 1 May (moving the feast of ''"Saints [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] and [[James the Just|James]] Apostles"'' from 1 May, where it had been since the sixth century, to 11 May, and suppressing the ''"Solemnity of [[Saint Joseph]], Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary"'' that, since [[Pope Pius IX]]'s decree of 10 September 1847, had been celebrated on the second Wednesday after the Octave of Easter).

The '''''Gita Govinda''''' ({{lang-sa|गीत गोविन्द}}) (''Song of [[Govinda]]'') is a work composed by the 12th-century Indian poet, [[Jayadeva]]&lt;!-- DO NOT INCLUDE EXTENDED DISCUSSION OF JAYADEVA'S BIRTHPLACE IN THIS ARTICLE. IT BELONGS IN THE ARTICLE ON JAYADEVA BIRTH CONTROVERSY. --&gt;. It describes the relationship between [[Krishna]] and the ''[[gopi]]s'' (female cow herders) of [[Vrindavana]], and in particular one gopi named [[Radha]].

The ''Gita Govinda'' is organized into twelve chapters. Each chapter is further sub-divided into twenty-four divisions called ''Prabandha''s. The prabandhas contain couplets grouped into eights, called ''[[Ashtapadis]]''. It is mentioned that [[Radha]] is greater than [[Krishna]]. The text also elaborates the eight moods of Heroine, the ''[[Ashta Nayika]]'', which has been an inspiration for many compositions and choreographic works in [[Indian classical dance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/14/stories/2007091450100200.htm|title=Learn the lingo|date=14 September 2007|work=Hindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{See also|Jayadeva|Works of Jayadeva}}
The work delineates the love of Krishna for Radha, the milkmaid, his faithlessness and subsequent return to her, and is taken as symbolical of the human soul's straying from its true allegiance but returning at length to the God which created it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Jayadéva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the existence of the figure [[Muhammad]] is established by contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous historical records,&lt;ref&gt;W. Wright, Catalogue Of Syriac Manuscripts In The British Museum Acquired Since The Year 1838, 1872, Part III, Printed by order of the Trustees: London, No. DCCCCXIII, pp. 1040-1041&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Palmer (with contributions from S. P. Brock and R. G. Hoyland), The Seventh Century In The West-Syrian Chronicles Including Two Seventh-Century Syriac Apocalyptic Texts, 1993, op. cit., pp. 5-6; R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, op. cit., pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to distinguish between the historical elements and the unhistorical elements of many of the reports of Muhammad have not been very successful. Hence the '''historicity of Muhammad''', aside from his existence, is debated. The earliest Muslim source of information for the life of Muhammad, the [[Quran]], gives very little personal information and its [[History of the Qur'an|historicity]] has been questioned.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', ''Muhammad''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=6}} Next in importance is the [[Prophetic biography|sīra literature]] and [[hadith]], which survive in the historical works of writers from the third, and fourth centuries of the [[Islamic calendar|Muslim era]] (c. 800−1000 AD).{{sfn|Donner|1998|p=125}}&lt;ref name="Watt-Mecca-xi"&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt]], ''[[Muhammad at Mecca (book)|Muhammad in Mecca]]'', 1953, Oxford University Press, p.xi&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a relatively small number of contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous non-Muslim sources, which confirm the existence of Muhammad and are valuable both in themselves and for comparison with Muslim sources.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=6}}

==Islamic sources for the historical Muhammad==
[[File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|thumb|left|11th-century Persian Quran folio page in [[kufic]] script]]

The main Islamic source on Muhammad's life are Muslim sources written in [[Arabic]], which include the [[Quran]] and accounts of Muhammad's life written down by later Muslims, based on [[oral tradition]]s. These sources are known as [[sīra]] and [[hadith]].

===Quran===
{{see also|History of the Quran|Criticism of the Quran}}
{{Quran}}
According to traditional Islamic scholarship, all of the Quran was written down by Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]] while he was alive (during AD 610–632), but it was primarily an orally related document. The written compilation of the whole Quran in its definite form as we have it now was not completed until many years after the death of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt]] in ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars differ in their assessment of the Quran as a historical source about Muhammad's life.

According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', the "Qur'an responds constantly and often candidly to Muhammad's changing historical circumstances and contains a wealth of hidden data that are relevant to the task of the quest for the historical Muhammad."&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad" /&gt; In contrast, Solomon A. Nigosian writes that the Quran tells us very little about the life of Muhammad.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=6}}

[[F.E. Peters]] states, "Few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is, in fact, what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words... To sum this up: the Quran is convincingly the words of Muhammad, perhaps even dictated by him after their recitation".&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;F. E. Peters (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Peters argues that "The search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman’s alleged recension in the 640s (what can be called the 'sources' behind our text) has not yielded any differences of great significance."&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt;

[[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] challenge the traditional account of how the Quran was compiled writing that "there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century." They also question the accuracy of some of the Quran's historical accounts.&lt;ref name="Crone"&gt;Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, and Gerd R. Puin as quoted in {{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199901/koran|work=The Atlantic Monthly|title=What Is the Koran?|author=Toby Lester|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was generally acknowledged that the work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early [[Muslim history|Islamic history]], but their alternative account of early Islam had been almost universally rejected.&lt;ref&gt;David Waines(1995), p. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt; Van Ess dismissed it stating that "a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail...Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous."&lt;ref name="van Ess"&gt;van Ess, "The Making Of Islam", [[The Times Literary Supplement|''Times Literary Supplement'']], September 8, 1978, p. 998&lt;/ref&gt; R. B. Serjeant stated: "Hagarism [the thesis of Crone and Cook] ... is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a 'leg pull', pure 'spoof'."&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Serjeant, ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' (1978) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Fred Donner]], a supporter of the [[Revisionist School of Islamic Studies|revisionist school of Islamic studies]] wrote that "Yet now more than 30 years later we can see that the publication of Hagarism was a milestone in the study of Islamic studies."&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, Vol. 40, No. 2 (December 2006), pp. 197–199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uthman Koran Taschkent a.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Samarkand Kufic Quran]], dated to the early 9th century. It is an alleged 7th century original of the edition of the third caliph Uthman. This Quran is located in the small Telyashayakh mosque in [[Tashkent]].]]

[[Gerd R. Puin]]'s initial study of ancient Quran manuscripts found in Yemen led him to conclude that the Quran is a "cocktail of texts", some of which may have been existent a hundred years before Muhammad. He later stated that "these Yemeni Qur'anic fragments do not differ from those found in museums and libraries elsewhere, with the exception of details that do not touch the Qur'an itself, but are rather differences in the way words are spelled."  Puin has stated that he believes the Quran was an evolving text rather than simply the Word of God as revealed in its entirety to Muhammad in the seventh century A.D&lt;ref name="Crone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://individual.utoronto.ca/fantastic/The_History_of_the_Quranic_Text_from_Revelation_to_Compilation.pdf THE HISTORY OF THE QUR’ANIC TEXT FROM REVELATION TO COMPILATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY WITH THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS] by Muhammad Mustafa Al-A’zami, Leicester: UK, page 12; Al-A’zami quotes a letter that was published in the Yemeni newspaper ''ath-Thawra'', 11 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/aug/08/highereducation.theguardian Querying the Koran], by Abul Taher, The Guardian, 8 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]] comes to the conclusion that the person of Muhammed was not central to early Islam at all, and that at this very early stage Islam was in fact an Arabic Christian sect which had objections to the concept of the [[trinity]], and that the later hadith and biographies are in large part [[legend]]s, instrumental in severing Islam from its Christian roots and building a full-blown new religion.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ohlig, ''Der frühe Islam'', 2007, {{ISBN|3-89930-090-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2012}} [[John Wansbrough]] believes that the Qu’ran is a [[redaction]] in part of other sacred scriptures, in particular the [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christian]] scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation (1977) and The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition of Islamic Salvation History (1978) by Wansbrough.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.derafsh-kaviyani.com/english/quran3.html (Discusses Wansbrough)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Berg (religion)|Herbert Berg]] writes that "Despite John Wansbrough's very cautious and careful inclusion of qualifications such as "conjectural," and "tentative and emphatically provisional", his work is condemned by some. Some of the negative reaction is undoubtedly due to its radicalness...Wansbrough's work has been embraced wholeheartedly by few and has been employed in a piecemeal fashion by many. Many praise his insights and methods, if not all of his conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Berg(2000), p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable academic debate over the real chronology of the chapters of the Quran.&lt;ref name="Carole Hillenbrand"&gt;Carole Hillenbrand in ''The New Cambridge Medieval History'', p.329&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carole Hillenbrand]] holds that there are several remaining tasks for the Orientalist Quranic scholars: Few Quranic scholars have worked on the epigraphy of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] whose foundation inscription dates to 72/692 and the antique Quran recently discovered in the Yemen, the [[Sana'a manuscripts]]. The [[Carbon-14]] tests applied to this Quran date its parchment to 645–690 AD with 95 percent accuracy. Their real age may be a good deal younger, since C-14 estimates the time of growth of an organism, and the process from that to the final writing on the parchment involves an unknown amount of time, and parchments were also re-used often.&lt;ref name="Carole Hillenbrand"/&gt; [[Paleography]] has dated the San'a manuscripts to 690–750 AD.

The parchment of the [[Birmingham Quran manuscript]] received radiocarbon analysis in 2015, which revealed with a 95.4% accuracy that it was made from an animal alive sometime between 568 and 645 AD, roughly around the lifetime of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=birmingham&gt;{{cite web|title=Birmingham Qur'an manuscript dated among the oldest in the world |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2015/07/quran-manuscript-22-07-15.aspx|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text differs only slightly to modern versions of the Quran.&lt;ref name=birmingham/&gt; Only the parchment has been analysed, the date of the ink is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hassan|first1=Zuher |title=Birmingham Qur’an manuscript, is it as early as claimed?|url=http://muslimnews.co.uk/newspaper/comment/birmingham-quran-manuscript-is-it-authentic/|accessdate=16 October 2017|publisher=The Muslim News|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadith===
{{main|Hadith|Criticism of Hadith}}

The [[hadith]] collections include traditional, [[hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts of the [[sunnah|verbal and physical traditions]] of Muhammad.

Early [[List of Muslim scholars|Muslim scholars]] were concerned that some hadiths (and sīra reports) may have been fabricated, and thus they developed a science of hadith criticism (see [[Hadith studies]]) to distinguish between genuine sayings and those that were forged, recorded using different words, or were wrongly ascribed to Muhammad.

In general, the majority of western academics view the [[hadith]] collections with caution. [[Bernard Lewis]] states that "The collection and recording of Hadith did not take place until several generations after the death of the Prophet. During that period the opportunities and motives for falsification were almost unlimited."{{sfn|Lewis|1967|p=37}}

The main feature of hadith is that of [[Isnad]] (chains of transmission), which are the basis of determining authenticity of the reports in traditional Islamic scholarship. According to Stephen Humphreys, while a number of "very capable" modern scholars defended the general authenticity of ''isnads'', most modern scholars regard ''isnads'' with "deep suspicion".&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{Cite book |edition=Revised |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-00856-6 |last=Humphreys |first=R. Stephen |title=Islamic History: A framework for Inquiry |year=1991|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan A. C. Brown asserts the hadith tradition is a "common sense science" or a "common sense tradition" and is "one of the biggest accomplishments in human intellectual history ... in its breadth, in its depth, in its complexity and in its internal consistency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ilmisfree|title=Dr. Jonathan A.C. Brown - An Introduction to Hadith|date=2012-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZlEtV0rDPA%20(see%20from%200:01:03)|accessdate=2016-12-11}} (see from 0:01:13)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prophetic biography (sīra)===
{{main|Prophetic biography#Authenticity and usefulness}}

In the [[Prophetic biography|sīra literature]], the most important extant biography are the two recensions of [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s (d. 768), now known as ''Sīrat Rasūl Allah'' ("Biography/Life of the Messenger/Apostle of Allah"), which survive in the works of his editors, most notably [[Ibn Hisham]] (d. 834) and Yunus b. Bukayr (d.814–815), although not in its original form.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; According to Ibn Hisham, Ibn Ishaq wrote his biography some 120 to 130 years after Muhammad's death. Many, but not all, scholars accept the accuracy of these biographies, though their accuracy is unascertainable.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=6}} After Ibn Ishaq, there are a number of shorter accounts (some of which are earlier than Ibn Ishaq) recorded in different forms (see [[Prophetic biography#Early compilations of s.C4.ABra|List of earliest writers of sīra]]). Other biographies of Muhammad include [[al-Waqidi|al-Waqidi's]] (d. 822) and then [[Ibn Sa'd]]'s (d.844–45). Al-Waqidi is often criticized by early [[Muslim historians]] who state that the author is unreliable.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; These biographies are hardly biographies in the modern sense. The writers did not wish to record the life of Muhammad, but rather to describe Muhammad's military expeditions and to preserve stories about Muhammad, his sayings and the [[asbab al-nuzul|reasons of revelations]] and interpretations of verses in the Quran.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; In addition to sīra, the [[biographical dictionaries]] of [[Ali ibn al-Athir]] and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] provide much detail about the [[sahaba|contemporaries of Muhammad]] but add little to our information about Muhammad himself.&lt;ref name="Watt-Mecca-xii"&gt;William Montgomery Watt, ''[[Muhammad at Mecca (book)|Muhammad at Mecca]]'', Oxford University Press, p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wim Raven, it is often noted that a coherent image of Muhammad cannot be formed from the literature of sīra, whose authenticity and factual value have been questioned on a number of different grounds.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |edition=2nd |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |volume=9 |pages=660–663 |last=Raven |first=W. |title=SĪRA |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |isbn=90-04-10422-4 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lists the following arguments against the authenticity of sīra, followed here by counter arguments:

# Hardly any sīra work was compiled during the first century of Islam. Fred Donner points out that the earliest historical writings about the origins of Islam first emerged in 60-70 AH, well within the first century of Hijra (see also [[List of biographies of Muhammad]]). Furthermore, the sources now extant, dating from the second, third, and fourth centuries AH, are according to Donner mostly compilations of material derived from earlier sources.{{sfn|Donner|1998|p=125}}
# The many discrepancies exhibited in different narrations found in sīra works. Yet, despite the lack of a single orthodoxy in Islam, there is still a marked agreement on the most general features of the traditional origins story.{{sfn|Donner|1998|pp=26–27}}
# Later sources claiming to know more about the time of Muhammad than earlier ones (to add embellishments and exaggeration common to an oral storytelling tradition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crone and Cook|first=Patricia and Michael|title=Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World|year=1980|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-29754-0|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Discrepancies compared to non-Muslim sources. But there are also similarities and agreements both in information specific to Muhammad,&lt;ref name="Cook 73–74"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=0192876058 |last=Cook |first=Michael |title=Muhammad |date=1983-01-26  |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concerning Muslim tradition at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Darwin |isbn=0878501258 |last=Hoyland |first=Robert G |title=[[Seeing Islam as Others Saw It|Seeing Islam as Others Saw It: A Survey and Evaluation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian Writings on Early Islam]] |year=1998 |authorlink=Robert G. Hoyland |page=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some parts or genres of sīra, namely those dealing with miracles, are not fit as sources for scientific historiographical information about Muhammad, except for showing the beliefs and doctrines of his community.

Nevertheless, other content of sīra, like the [[Constitution of Medina]], are generally considered to be authentic by both Muslim and non-Muslim historians.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt;

==Non-Muslim sources==
Early Islamic history is also reflected in sources written in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Hebrew]] by Jewish and Christian communities, all of which are dated after 633 CE.{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=6}} These sources contain some essential differences with regard to Muslim sources, in particular regarding the chronology and Muhammad's attitude towards the Jews and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=6}}

There is a reference recording the Arab conquest of Syria (known as [[Fragment on the Arab Conquests]]), that mentions Muhammed. This much faded note is preserved on [[Folio#Page numbering|folio]] 1 of [[British Library#Additional manuscripts|BL Add.]] 14,461, a codex containing the Gospel according to Matthew and the Gospel according to Mark. This note appears to have been penned soon after the [[Battle of Yarmouk|battle of Gabitha]] (636 CE) at which the Arabs inflicted crushing defeat of the Byzantines. Wright was first to draw the attention to the fragment and suggested that "it seems to be a nearly contemporary notice",&lt;ref&gt;W. Wright, Catalogue Of Syriac Manuscripts In The British Museum Acquired Since The Year 1838, 1870, Part I, Printed by order of the Trustees: London, No. XCIV, pp. 65-66. This book was republished in 2002 by Gorgias Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a view which was also endorsed by Nöldeke.&lt;ref&gt;Th. Nöldeke, "Zur Geschichte Der Araber Im 1, Jahrh. d.H. Aus Syrischen Quellen", Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 1876, Volume 29, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of jotting this note in the book of Gospels appears to be commemorative as the author appears to have realized how momentous the events of his time were. The words "we saw" are positive evidence that the author was a contemporary. The author also talks about olive oil, cattle, ruined villages, suggesting that he belonged to peasant stock, i.e., parish priest or a monk who could read and write. It is worthwhile cautioning that the condition of the text is fragmentary and many of the readings unclear or disputable. The [[Lacuna_(manuscripts)|lacunae]] are supplied in square brackets:

The 8th century BL Add. 14,643 was published by Wright who first brought to attention the mention of an early date of 947 [[Seleucid era|AG]] (635–36 CE).&lt;ref&gt;W. Wright, Catalogue Of Syriac Manuscripts In The British Museum Acquired Since The Year 1838, 1872, Part III, Printed by order of the Trustees: London, No. DCCCCXIII, pp. 1040–1041&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of this manuscript has puzzled many scholars for their apparent lack of coherence as it contains an assembly of texts with diverse nature.&lt;ref&gt;A. Palmer (with contributions from S. P. Brock and R. G. Hoyland), The Seventh Century In The West-Syrian Chronicles Including Two Seventh-Century Syriac Apocalyptic Texts, 1993, op. cit., pp. 5–6; R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, op. cit., pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Arabs of Mohamed, there are two important dates mentioned in this manuscript.

{{quote|AG 945, indiction VII: On Friday, 4 February, [i.e., 634 CE / Dhul Qa‘dah 12 AH] at the ninth hour, there was a battle between the Romans and the Arabs of Mụhammad [Syr. tayyāyē d-Ṃhmt] in Palestine twelve miles east of Gaza. The Romans fled, leaving behind the patrician YRDN (Syr. BRYRDN), whom the Arabs killed. Some 4000 poor villagers of Palestine were killed there, Christians, Jews and Samaritans. The Arabs ravaged the whole region.

AG 947, indiction IX: The Arabs invaded the whole of Syria and went down to Persia and conquered it; the Arabs climbed mountain of Mardin and killed many monks there in [the monasteries of] Kedar and Benōthō. There died the blessed man Simon, doorkeeper of Qedar, brother of Thomas the priest.&lt;ref&gt;A. Palmer (with contributions from S. Brock and R. G. Hoyland), The Seventh Century In The West-Syrian Chronicles Including Two Seventh-Century Syriac Apocalyptic Texts, 1993, op. cit., pp. 18–19; Also see R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, op. cit., p. 119 and p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is the first date above which is of great importance as it provides the first explicit reference to Muhammad in a non-Muslim source. The account is usually identified with the [[battle of Dathin]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Palmer (with contributions from S. P. Brock and R. G. Hoyland), The Seventh Century In The West-Syrian Chronicles Including Two Seventh-Century Syriac Apocalyptic Texts, 1993, op. cit., p. 19, note 119; Also see R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, op. cit., p. 120, note 14&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hoyland, "its precise dating inspires confidence that it ultimately derives from first-hand knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, op. cit., p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account of the early seventh century comes from [[Sebeos]] who was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] bishop of the [[Bagratuni dynasty|House of Bagratuni]]. From this chronicle, there are indications that he lived through many of the events he relates. He maintains that the account of Arab conquests derives from the fugitives who had been eyewitnesses thereof. He concludes with Mu‘awiya's ascendancy in the Arab civil war (656–661 CE), which suggests that he was writing soon after this date. Sebeos is the first non-Muslim author to present us with a theory for the rise of Islam that pays attention to what the Muslims themselves thought they were doing.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Hoyland, Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey And Evaluation Of Christian, Jewish And Zoroastrian Writings On Early Islam, 1997, op. cit., p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning Muhammad, he says:

{{quote|At that time a certain man from along those same sons of Ismael, whose name was Mahmet [i.e., Mụhammad], a merchant, as if by God's command appeared to them as a preacher [and] the path of truth. He taught them to recognize the God of Abraham, especially because he was learnt and informed in the history of Moses. Now because the command was from on high, at a single order they all came together in unity of religion. Abandoning their vain cults, they turned to the living God who had appeared to their father Abraham. So, Mahmet legislated for them: not to eat carrion, not to drink wine, not to speak falsely, and not to engage in fornication. He said: 'With an oath God promised this land to Abraham and his seed after him for ever. And he brought about as he promised during that time while he loved Ismael. But now you are the sons of Abraham and God is accomplishing his promise to Abraham and his seed for you. Love sincerely only the God of Abraham, and go and seize the land which God gave to your father Abraham. No one will be able to resist you in battle, because God is with you.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Thomson (with contributions from J. Howard-Johnson &amp; T. Greenwood), The Armenian History Attributed To Sebeos Part - I: Translation and Notes, 1999, Translated Texts For Historians - Volume 31, Liverpool University Press, pp. 95-96.

L. Nettler (Ed.), Medieval And Modern Perspectives On Muslim-Jewish Relations, 1995, Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH in cooperation with the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sebeos was writing the chronicle at a time when memories of sudden eruption of the Arabs was fresh. He knows Muhammad's name and that he was a merchant by profession. He hints that his life was suddenly changed by a divinely inspired revelation.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Thomson (with contributions from J. Howard-Johnson &amp; T.

==Views of modern historians==
As early as 1930, the question for the existence of Muhammad [[Soviet Orientalist studies in Islam#Existence of Muhammad|was raised by Soviet orientalist Klimovich]], yet his thesis found no resonance in Islamic Studies. The question for the historicity of Muhammad was put on the agenda, when in the 1970s the so-called [[Revisionist School of Islamic Studies]] raised fundamental doubts about the reliability of traditional Islamic sources and applied the [[historical-critical method]]s to the early Islamic period. After the first provocative theses, the revisionist approach differentiated and moderated and spread in Islamic Studies with various intensity. Today, only a minority of historians of early Islam doubt the historicity of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999.

Attempts to distinguish between the historical elements and the unhistorical elements of many of the reports of Muhammad have not been very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Raven, Introduction on a translation of Islamic texts into Dutch by Ibn Ishaq, ''Het leven van Muhammad'' (The life of Muhammad), {{ISBN|90-5460-056-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of difficulty in the quest for the historical Muhammad is the modern lack of knowledge about pre-Islamic Arabia.&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt; According to [[Harald Motzki]], "On the one hand, it is not possible to write a historical biography of the Prophet without being accused of using the sources uncritically, while on the other hand, when using the sources critically, it is simply not possible to write such a biography."{{sfn|Nigosian|2004|p=6}}

Historian [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] takes the view that evidence independent of Islamic tradition "precludes any doubts as to whether Muhammad was a real person" and clearly shows that he became the central figure of a new religion in the decades following his death. He reports, though, that this evidence conflicts with the Islamic view in some aspects, associating Muhammad with Israel rather than Inner Arabia, complicating the question of his sole authorship or transmission of the Quran, and suggesting that there were Jews as well as Arabs among his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0192876058| last = Cook| first = Michael| title = Muhammad| date = 1996 | pages=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Patricia Crone]], a single Greek text written at around the time of Muhammad's death provides "irrefutable proof" that he was a historical figure. There is also, she says, "exceptionally good" evidence that Muhammad was an Arab political leader and prophet. She says we can be "reasonably sure" in attributing all or most of the Quran to him. She takes a view that Muhammad's traditional association with the Arabian Peninsula may be "doctrinally inspired", and is put in doubt by the Quran itself, which describes agricultural activity that could not have taken place there, as well as making a reference to the site of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] which appears to place Muhammad's community close to the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crone|first1=Patricia|title=What do we actually know about Mohammed?|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-europe_islam/mohammed_3866.jsp|publisher=Open Democracy|date=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2003 book ''[[Crossroads to Islam]]'', [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] and Judith Koren advanced a thesis, based on an extensive examination of archaeological evidence from the early Islamic period, that Muhammad may never have existed, with monotheistic Islam only coming into existence some time after he is supposed to have lived. This has been described as "plausible or at least arguable" and employing a "very rigorous historical methodology" by David Cook of [[Rice University]], but has also been compared to [[Holocaust denial]] by historian [[Colin Wells (historian)|Colin Wells]], who suggests that the authors deal with some of the evidence illogically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-02-33.html|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.02.33|last=Wells|first=Colin|date=February 2004|publisher=Bryn Mawr Classical Review|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/1038/crossroads-to-islam|title=Review of Crossroads to Islam|last=Cook|first=David|date=Fall 2006|work=Middle East Quarterly|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sven Kalisch|Muhammad Sven Kalisch]], a Muslim convert and Germany's first professor of Islamic theology, has expressed the view that the Prophet Muhammad probably never existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122669909279629451|title=Islamic Theologian Says Prophet Muhammad Likely Never Existed - WSJ|author=Andrew Higgins|date=16 November 2008|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar views were also held by other scholars too as Professor Muhammad Sven Kalisch quotes in his conclusions. Another example is the case of Hans Jansen, a Dutch scholar, who too has the opinion that the evidences supporting the historicity of Muhammad are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trykkefrihed.dk/blog/335/The-historicity-of-Muhammad-Aisha-and-who-knows-who-else.htm|title=The historicity of Muhammad, Aisha and who knows who else|work=trykkefrihed.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volker Popp]] (2004/5) proposed that both ''Muḥammad''  and ''‘Alī'' originated as titles given to [[Jesus Christ]] by [[Syriac Christians]] in the [[Sassanid Empire]] (i.e. ''muḥammad'' "blessed" being the equivalent of the ''benedictus'' (ευλογηµένος) of the [[New Testament]]). In a numismatic study, Popp identified coins dated to AH 16 inscribed with ''mḥmd'' but lacking  the ''rasūl allāh'' that later became common. Popp adduced Arabo-Sassanid and Syrian coins inscribed with ''MHMT'' in Pahlavi script, and also partly with  ''mḥmd'' in Arabic script, in some cases combined with Christian symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Volker Popp, "Bildliche Darstellungen aus der Frühzeit des Islam (IV)"  imprimatur   5+6/2004.
Voker Popp, "Die frühe Islamgeschichte nach inschriftlichen und numismatischen Zeugnissen" in Karl-Heinz Ohlig (ed.), ''Die dunklen Anfänge. Neue Forschungen zur Entstehung und frühen
Geschichte des Islam'', Berlin   2005,  16&amp;ndash;123 (here pp. 63ff).&lt;/ref&gt;
Heger (2008) argues that  ''Muḥammad''  "the blessed one" being a title of Christ does not necessarily preclude the historicity of the prophet of Islam. It rather opens up a scale of possibilities summarised in three alternatives to the default assumption of the historicity of a Muhammad recognizably similar to the hadith accounts, 
#the Islamic tradition on the life of Muhammad is entirely legendary,
#Muhammad is historical, but was active roughly a century later than suggested by Islamic tradition,
#there were two distinct people, both given the epithet Muhammad or "blessed", one active in the early 7th century, and author of the Meccan suras, and the other the ''Mamed'' of [[Johannes Damascenus]], author of the Medinian suras.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christoph Heger]],  [http://www.christoph-heger.de/2008-03-14_Inarah-Symposion_Christoph_Heger_5.pdf 'yā muhammad ̣ – kein „o MOHAMMED“, und wer ist ‛alī?'], in [[Markus Groß]] and Karl-Heinz Ohlig (eds.), ''Schlaglichter: Die beiden ersten islamischen Jahrhunderte'', Berlin (Verlag Hans Schiler) 2008, pp. 278-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
[[Jainism]] is an Indian religion which is traditionally believed to be propagated by twenty-four spiritual teachers known as ''tirthankara''. Broadly, Jainism is divided into two major [[sect]]s, [[Digambara]] and [[Svetambara]]. These are further divided into different sub-sects and traditions. While there are differences in practices, the core philosophy and main principles of each sect is same.

==Schism==
{{See also|Schism|Sect}}
Traditionally, the original doctrine of Jainism was contained in scriptures called Purva. There were fourteen Purva. These are believed to have originated from [[Rishabhanatha]], the first ''[[tirthankara]]''.{{sfn|Shah|1998|p=12}} There was a twelve-year famine around fourth century BCE.{{sfn|Clarke|Beyer|2009|p=326}} At that time, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] was the ruler of [[Magadha]] and [[Bhadrabahu]] was the head of [[Jain community]]. Bhadrabahu went south to [[Karnataka]] with his adherents and [[Sthulabhadra]], another Jain leader remained behind. During this time the knowledge of the doctrine was getting lost. A [[Jain councils|council was formed at Pataliputra]] where eleven scriptures called Angas were compiled and the remnant of fourteen purvas were written down in 12th Anga, Ditthivaya by the adherents of Sthulbhadra. When followers of Bhadrabahu returned, there was a dispute between them regarding the authenticity of the Angas. Also, those who stayed at Magadha started wearing white clothes which was unacceptable to the other who remain naked. This is how the Digambara and Svetambara sect came about. The ''Digambara'' being the naked ones where as ''Svetambara'' being the white clothed. According to Digambara, the purvas and the angas were lost. In course of time, the cannons of Svetambara were also getting lost.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=415–416}} About 980 to 993 years after the Nirvana of Mahavira, a [[Vallabhi council]] was held at [[Vallabhi]] (now in Gujarat). This was headed by Devardhi Ksamashramana.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=415–416}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the 12th Anga, the Ditthivaya, was lost too. The other Angas were written down.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=415–416}} This is a traditional account of schism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Svetambara, there were eight schisms (''Nihvana'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Digambara tradition, [[Ganadhara]] knew fourteen [[Purva]] and eleven [[Anga]]. Knowledge of Purva was lost around 436 years after [[Mahavira]] and Anga were lost around 683 years after Mahavira.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|p=417}} The texts which do not belong to Anga are called Angabahyas. There were fourteen Angabahyas. The first four Angabahyas, ''Samayika'', ''Chaturvimasvika'', ''Vandana'' and ''Pratikramana'' corresponds to sections of second ''Mulasutra'' of Svetambara. The only texts of angabahyas which occurs in Svetambara texts are ''Dasavaikalika'', ''[[Uttaradhyayana]]'' and ''Kalpavyavahara''.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|p=455}}

==Digambara==
{{Main|Digambara}}
[[File:Acharya5.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Digambar Jain monk]]
'''Digambara''' is one of the two main sects of [[Jainism]].{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=23}} This sect of Jainism rejects the authority of the ''[[Jain Agamas (Śvētāmbara)|Jain Agama]]'' compiled by [[Sthulabhadra]].{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=444}} They believe that by the time of Dharasena, the twenty-third teacher after Gandhar Gautama, knowledge of only one Anga was there. This was about 683 years after the death of [[Mahavira]]. After Dharasena's pupils [[Pushpadanta (Jain monk)|Acharya Puspadanta]] and [[Bhutabali]]. They wrote down the ''[[Shatkhandagama]]'', one of the oldest scriptures of the digambara sect of Jainism. The other most revered and oldest scripture is the ''[[Kasay-pahuda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Digambara tradition, [[Mahavira]], the last ''jaina tirthankara'', never married. He renounced the world at the age of thirty after taking permission of his parents.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=313}} The Digambara believe that after attaining enlightenment, Mahavira was free from human activities like hunger, thirst, and sleep.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=314}} [[Digambara monk]]s tradition do not wear any clothes. They carry only a broom made up of fallen peacock feathers and a water gourd.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=316}} One of the most important scholar-monks of Digambara tradition was [[Kundakunda|Acharya Kundakunda]]. He authored Prakrit texts such as Samayasara and Pravachansara. Samantabhadra and Siddhasena Divakara were other important monks of this tradition.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=524}} The Digambara are present mainly in Southern India, Bundelkhand region ([[Madhya Pradesh]], Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, etc. Digambar tradition is divided into two main orders [[Mula Sangh]] and the [[Kashtha Sangh]]. Among the prominent Digambara [[Acharya]]s today are [[Acharya Vidyasagar]], Acharya Vardhman sagar, Acharya Vidyananda. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Monastic orders===
'''Mula Sangh''' is an ancient monastic order. Mula literally means ''root'' or ''original''.&lt;ref&gt;Jain Dharma, Kailash Chandra Siddhanta Shastri, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The great Acharya [[Kundakunda]] is associated with Mula Sangh. The oldest known mention of Mula Sangh is from 430 CE.
Mula Sangh was divided into a few branches. According to ''Shrutavatara'' and ''Nitisar'' of [[Bhattaraka]] Indranandi, Acharya Arhadbali had organised a council of Jain monks, and had given names (gana or sangha) to different groups. The four major groups were ''Nandi Gana'', ''Sena Gana'', ''Deva Gana'' and ''Simha Gana''. The [[Bhattaraka]]s of [[Shravanabelagola]], [[Mudabidri]] and [[Humbaj]] belongs to the ''Nandi Gana''.

'''Kashtha Sangha''' was a [[monastic order]] once dominant in several regions of North and Western [[India]]. It is said to have originated from a town named Kashtha. The origin of Kashtha Sangha is often attributed to Lohacharya in several texts and inscriptions from Delhi region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idjo.org/PDFBooks/Muni%20Sabhachandra%20Avam%20Unka%20Padmapuran.pdf |title=Muni Sabhachandra Avam Unka Padmapuran |format=PDF |publisher=Idjo.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726170714/http://www.idjo.org/PDFBooks/Muni%20Sabhachandra%20Avam%20Unka%20Padmapuran.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kashtasangh Gurvavali identifies Lohacharya as the last person who knew [[Acharanga]] in the Digambara tradition, who lived until around 683-year after the ''nirvana'' of Lord [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idjo.org/Manuscript.asp?id=11&amp;i=182 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726170909/http://www.idjo.org/Manuscript.asp?id=11&amp;i=182 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-26 |title=(International Digamber Jain Organization) |publisher=IDJO.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Digambara orders in North India belonged to [[Kashtha Sangha]]. The [[Agrawal Jain]]s were the major supporters of Kashtha Sangha. They were initiated by Lohacharya.  Kashta Sangha has several orders including ''Nanditat gachchha'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndjains.org |title=This website is currently unavailable |publisher=Ndjains.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mathura Sangha'', ''Bagada gachha'' and ''Lata-bagada gachha''. The celebrated poet and pratishthacharya [[Raighu]] was a disciple of the Kashtha Sangh [[Bhattaraka]]s of [[Gwalior]]. The rock carved Jain statues in the [[Gwalior Fort]] were mostly consecrated by the Kashtha Sangh [[Bhattaraka]]s.

The '''[[Digambar Terapanth]]''' subsect was formed by Amra Bhaunsa Godika and his son Jodhraj Godika during 1664–1667 in opposition to the bhattakaras. The Bhattakara are the priestly class of Jainism who are responsible for maintaining libraries and other Jain institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sangave|2001|pp=133–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Terapanth'' sub-sect among the [[Digambara]] Jains emerged around the Jaipur (Sanganer, [[Amber, India|Amber]] and Jaipur region itself).&lt;ref&gt;John E. Cort "A Tale of Two Cities: On the Origins of Digambara Sectarianism in North India." L. A. Babb, V. Joshi, and M. W. Meister (eds.), Multiple Histories: Culture and Society in the Study of Rajasthan, 39–83. Jaipur: Rawat, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Godika duo expressed opposition to the [[Bhattaraka]] Narendrakirti of Amber. Authors [[Daulatram Kasliwal]] and [[Pandit Todarmal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmadharma.com/shastras/mokshmargprakashak_eng_txt/index.html |title=The Illuminator of the Path of Liberation By Acharyakalp Pt. Todamalji, Jaipur |publisher=Atmadharma.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were associated with the Terapanth movement. They opposed worship of various minor gods and goddesses. Some Terapanthi practices, like not using flowers in worship, gradually spread throughout North India among the Digambaras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/jainism/taran.html |title=Taranpanthis |publisher=Philtar.ucsm.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtaram in his "Mithyatva Khandan Natak" (1764) mentions that group that started it included thirteen individuals, who collectively built a new temple, thus giving it its name Tera-Panth (Thirteen Path). However according to "Kavitta Terapanth kau" by a Chanda Kavi, the movement was named Tera Panth, because the founders disagreed with the Bhattaraka on thirteen points. A letter of 1692 from Tera Panthis at Kama to those at Sanganer mentions thirteen rituals that were rejected. These are mentioned in Buddhivilas (1770) of Bakhtaram. These are– authority of Bhattarakas, Use of flowers, cooked food or lamps, Abhisheka (panchamrita), consecretation of images without supervision by the representatives of Bhattarakas, Puja while seated, Puja at night, Using drums in the temple and Worship of minor gods like dikpalas, shasan devis ([[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmavati]] etc.) and Kshetrapal. The Digambara Jains who have continued to follow these practices are termed '''Bispanthi'''.

The '''Taranapanth''' was founded by Taran Svami in [[Bundelkhand]] in 1505.&lt;ref&gt;Smarika, Sarva Dharma Sammelan, 1974, Taran Taran Samaj, Jabalpur&lt;/ref&gt; They do not believe in idol worshiping. Instead, the taranapantha community prays to the scriptures written by Taran Swami.
Taran Svami is also referred to as Taran Taran, the one who can help the swimmers to the other side, i.e. towards [[nirvana]]. A mystical account of his life, perhaps an autobiography, is given in Chadmastha Vani. The language in his fourteen books is a unique blend of [[Prakrit]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Apabhramsha]]. His language was perhaps influenced by his reading of the books of Acharya [[Kundakunda]]. Commentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been written recently. [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]], who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included Shunya Svabhava and Siddhi Svabhava as among the books that influenced him most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osho.nl/New-Osho-NL/EnglBooks/BooksIHave.htm |title=Books I have Loved |publisher=Osho.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Taranpanthis is very small. Their shrines are called Chaityalaya (or sometimes Nisai/Nasia). At the altar (vimana) they have a book instead of an idol. The Taranpanthis were originally from six communities.

==Svetambara==
{{Main|Śvētāmbara}}
[[File:Acharya Mahapragya.jpg|thumb|Svetambara Jain monk]]
The '''Śvētāmbara''' (white-clad) is one of the two main sects of [[Jainism]]. [[wikt:Svetambar|Śvētāmbara]] is a term describing its [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]]' practice of wearing white clothes, which sets it apart from the ''Digambara'' whose ascetic practitioners go naked. Śvētāmbaras, unlike Digambaras, do not believe that [[ascetic]]s must practice nudity. Svetambara monks usually wear white maintaining that nudism is no longer practical. Śvētāmbaras also believe that women are able to obtain [[moksha]]. Śvētāmbaras maintain that the 19th [[Tirthankara]], [[Mallinath]], was a woman. Some Śvētāmbara monks and nuns cover their mouth with a white cloth or [[muhapatti]] to practise [[ahimsa]] even when they talk. By doing so they minimise the possibility of inhaling small organisms. The Śvētāmbara tradition follows the lineage of [[Acharya]] Sthulibhadra Suri. The [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpa Sūtra]] mentions some of the lineages in ancient times.

===Svetambara sub-sects===

====Sthanakavasi====
{{Main|Sthānakavāsī}}
A major dispute was initiated by Lonka Shaha, who started a movement opposed to idol worship in 1476. [[Sthānakavāsī]] is a sect of [[Jainism]] founded by a merchant named Lavaji about 1653 CE that do not pray to any statue.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, S.: Heart of Jainism, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The sect is essentially a reformation of the one founded on teachings of Lonka.&lt;ref name="Thane Jain Yuva Group"&gt;{{cite web|last=Madrecha |first=Adarsh |url=http://thanejain.blogspot.in/2012/08/united-pratikraman-organised.html |title=Thane Jain Yuva Group: United pratikraman organised |publisher=Thanejain.blogspot.in |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sthānakavāsīs reject all but thirty-two of the [[Svetambara|Śvētāmbara]] canon.

====Murtipujaka====
Śvētāmbarins who are not Sthānakavāsins are called [[Murtipujaka]] (''Idol-worshipers''). Murtipujaka differ from [[Sthanakvasi]] Svetambaras in that their [[derasar]]s contain idols of the [[Tirthankara]]s instead of empty rooms. They worship idols and have rituals for it. Murtipujaka [[Jain monasticism|monastics]] and worshippers do not use the [[muhapatti]], a piece of cloth over the mouth, during prayers, whereas it is permanently worn by Sthanakvasi. The most prominent among the classical orders called [[Gaccha]]s today are the Kharatara, [[Tapa Gaccha|Tapa]] and the [[Tristutik]]. Major reforms by [[Vijayanandsuri]] of the Tapa Gaccha in 1880 led a movement to restore orders of wandering monks, which brought about the near-extinction of the Yati institutions. [[Acharya Rajendrasuri]] restored the [[shramana]] organisation in the [[Tristutik]] Order.

; Murtipujaka Svetambara monastic orders
The monks of Murtipujaka sect are divided into six orders or ''[[Gaccha]]''. These are:{{sfn|Flügel|2006|p=317}}
* [[Kharatara Gaccha]] (1023 CE)
* [[Ancala Gaccha]] (1156 CE)
* [[Tristutik Gaccha]] (1193 CE)
* [[Tapa Gaccha]] (1228 CE)
* [[Vimala Gaccha]] (1495 CE)
* [[Parsvacandra Gaccha]] (1515 CE)

'''Kharatara Gaccha''' is one of [[Shvetambara]] gacchas. It is also called Vidhisangha (the Assembly) as they follow sacred texts literally.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of world religions-Jainism-Kharatara Gaccha|url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/jainism/khara.html|work=Philtar.ac.uk|publisher=Division of Religion and Philosophy, University of Cumbria|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hvg&gt;{{Cite book|last= Glasenapp|first=Helmuth|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|isbn= 9788120813762|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=jainism#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 November 2012|page=389|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Vardhamana Suri&lt;ref name=hvg/&gt; (1031). His teacher was a temple-dwelling monk. He rejected him because of not following texts.&lt;ref name="phil"/&gt;
His pupil, Jineshvara, got honorary title 'Kharatara' (Sharp witted or Fierce) because he defeated Suracharya, leader of Chaityavasis in public debate in 1023 at Anahilvada [[Patan district|Patan]]. So the Gaccha got his title.&lt;ref name=hvg/&gt; Another tradition regards Jinadatta Suri (1075–1154) as a founder of Gaccha.&lt;ref name=hvg/&gt; Kharatara ascetics follow the sacred texts to the word. They follow basic [[Shvetambara]] canon and works of other Kharatara teachers.&lt;ref name="phil"/&gt;

'''Tristutik Gaccha''' was a [[Murtipujaka]] [[Svetambara]] [[Jainism|Jain]] religious grouping preceding the founding of the [[Tapa Gaccha]] by [[Acharya Rajendrasuri]]. It was established in 1194. It was known as [[Āgama (Jainism)|Agama]] [[Gaccha]] in ancient times. The Tristutik believed in devotion to the [[Tirthankara]]s alone in most rituals, although offerings to helper divinities were made during large ceremonies. The Tristutik Gaccha was reformed by [[Acharya Rajendrasuri]].

'''Tapa Gaccha''' is the largest [[Jain monasticism|monastic order]] of [[Svetambara]] [[Jainism]]. It was founded by Acharya Jagat Chandrasuri in 1229. He was given the title of "Tapa" (i.e. the meditative one) by the ruler of [[Mewar]]. Vijayananda Suri was responsible for reviving the wandering orders among the Svetambara monks. As a result of this reform, most Svetambara Jain monks today belong to the Tapa Gaccha.

====Terapanth====
'''Terapanth '''is another reformist religious sect under [[Svetambara]] Jainism. It was founded by [[Acharya Bhikshu]], also known as Swami Bhikanji Maharaj. Swami Bhikanji was formerly a Sthanakvasi saint and had initiation by Acharya Raghunatha. But he had differences with his Guru on several aspects of religious practices of [[Sthanakvasi]] ascetics. Hence he left the Sthanakvasi sect with the motto of correcting practise of Jain monks, eventually on 28 June 1760 at Kelwa, a small town in [[Udaipur district]] of [[Rajasthan]] state, Terapanth was founded by him. This sect is also non-idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Du|Dundas, p. 254]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sa|Shashi, p. 945]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Va|Vallely, p. 59]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Si|Singh, p. 5184]]&lt;/ref&gt; As Acharya Bhikanaji laid stress on the thirteen religious principles, namely, five Mahavratas (great vows), five samitis (regulations) and three Guptis (controls or restraints), his sub-sect was known as the Tera-pantha (''path of thirteen''). In this connection, two other interpretations have been given for the use of the term Terapantha for the sub-sect. According to one account, it is mentioned that as there were only thirteen monks and thirteen laymen in the pantha when it was founded. Other account says, ''Tera'' derived from ''Tera'' which literally means "yours". Terapanth is organised under the direction of one Acharya. Terapanth had a succession of only eleven Acharyas from the founder Acharya Bhikanaji as the First Acharya to the present. Further, the Terapanth regularly observes a festival known as ''Maryada Mahotasava''. This distinctive festival is celebrated every year on the seventh day of the bright half of the month of Magha. At present [[Mahasharman]] is the eleventh Acharya of Terapanth.

==Others==
Raj Bhakta Marg or Kavi Panth or Shrimadia are founded on teachings of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] by his followers after his death in 1901&lt;ref name="Jainpedia"&gt;{{cite web | title=Rājacandra | website=Jainpedia|first=Jérôme|last=Petit| date=2016 | url=http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/studying-jainism/rajacandra.html | accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while former Sthanakavasi monk [[Kanji Swami]] established [[Kanji Panth]] in 1934. [[Akram Vignan Movement]] established by [[Dada Bhagwan]] draws inspiration from teachings of Rajchandra and other Jain scriptures though it is considered as a Jain-[[Vaishnava]] Hindu [[Religious syncretism|syncretistic]] movement.&lt;ref name=FPeter&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/7438/1/Present_Lord_2003.pdf|title=Present Lord: Simandhara Svami and the Akram Vijnan Movement|last=Flügel|first=Peter|work=The Intimate Other: Love Divine in the Indic Religions|publisher=Orient Longman|year=2005|isbn=9788125028017|editor-last=King|editor-first=Anna S.|location=New Delhi|pages=194–243|chapter=|format=PDF|quote=|editor-last2=Brockington|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yapaniya==
{{Main|Yapaniya}}
'''Yapaniya''' was a [[Jain]] order in western Karnataka which is now extinct. The first inscription that mentions them by Mrigesavarman (AD 475–490) a [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] king of Palasika who donated for a Jain temple, and made a grant to the sects of Yapaniyas, Nirgranthas (identifiable as [[Digambara]]s), and the Kurchakas (not identified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainworld.com/book/historyofjainism/ch10.asp |title=Yapaniyas |publisher=Jainworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last inscription which mentioned the Yapaniyas was found in the [[Tuluva]] region southwest [[Karnataka]], dated Saka 1316 (1394 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Jainism in South India and Some Jaina Epigraphs By Pandurang Bhimarao Desai, 1957, published by [[Gulabchand Hirachand Doshi]], Jaina Saṁskṛti Saṁrakshaka Sangha&lt;/ref&gt; According to Darshana-Sara, they were a branch of the [[Svetambara]] sect, however they were regarded to be [[Digambara]] by Swetambar authors. The Yapaniya monks remained naked but followed some Svetamabar views. They also possessed their own versions of texts that have been preserved in the Svetambar tradition. The great grammarian Shakatayana, who was a contemporary of the [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Amoghavarsha]] (c. 817–877), was a Yapaniya, as mentioned by Malayagira in his commentary on the ''NandiSutra''.

{{Jainism}}
The history of '''Jainism in Australia''' is relatively short when compared with the histories of [[Christianity in Australia|Christianity]] on the same continent. There are four [[Jain]] centres in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jains.australians.com/ |title=Welcome to Jains in Australia! |publisher=Jains.australians.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain population in Australia was counted in the 2016 census to be 4,047, of whom 38% lived in Greater [[Sydney]], 31% in Greater [[Melbourne]], and 15% in Greater [[Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://auth.censusdata.abs.gov.au/webapi/jsf/tableView/tableView.xhtml |title=Census Table Builder|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics| accessdate=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states and territories with the highest proportion of Jains are [[Western Australia]] (0.025%) and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (0.022%), whereas those with the lowest are [[Queensland]] (0.006%) and [[Tasmania]] (0.001%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census TableBuilder - Dataset: 2016 Census - Cultural Diversity |url=https://guest.censusdata.abs.gov.au/webapi/jsf/tableView/tableView.xhtml|work=Australian Bureau of Statistics – Census 2016|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Jain community established itself in Australia through immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XubfClGnIAUC&amp;pg=PA19 |title=Historical Dictionary of Jainism - Kristi L. Wiley - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Jain society has been formed in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLNQKGcDIhsC&amp;pg=PA80 |title=Jainism: The World of Conquerors - Natubhai Shah - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exodus of Asians from Uganda in 1972 due to [[Idi Amin]]'s policies, forced some Jains to migrate elsewhere, like Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loQkEIf8z5wC&amp;pg=PA263 |title=Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-violence - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=603&amp;cat=42 |title=on www.jainsamaj.org ( Jainism, Ahimsa News, Religion, Non-Violence, Culture, Vegetarianism, Meditation, India. ) |publisher=Jainsamaj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain Centres==
Jain centres and/or societies have been established in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne. Most of the centres practice Jain unity by making sure every Jain sect comes and prays together. In Sydney the centre is known as Vitraag Jain Shwetambar Sangh &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vitraagjainsangh.org |title=VJSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2914">'''Jeff King''' (1865?–1964; known in [[Navajo language|Navajo]] as ''Hashkeh-yilth-e-yah'') was a [[US Army]] scout from 1891 to 1911, and went on to become a highly respected {{spell-nv|hataałii}} (singer, or medicine man). 

According to army records, King was born in [[Rock Springs, New Mexico]], in 1865; however, his family's records indicated that he may have been born as early as 1851. He lived for most of his life in [[Pinedale, New Mexico]] on the [[Navajo Reservation]].&lt;ref name=navajotimes&gt;[http://www.navajotimes.com/news/2009/0109/012209scout.php "Diné scout lies buried at Arlington"], ''The Navajo Times,'' January 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States joined [[World War II]] in 1941 and young Navajos left the reservation to serve in the army, King performed a ritual for them called ''Where the Two Came to Their Father'' that tells the story of two young heroes who go to the [[hogan]] of their father, the Sun, and return with the power to destroy the monsters that are plaguing their people. The two-day ceremony, which included songs and elaborate sand paintings, was meant to keep the young men's souls healthy as they went off to fight, away from their land and their people.

At the time, an artist and [[ethnologist]] named [[Maud Oakes]] was living on the reservation. With King's permission, she recorded the ceremony, including the sand-paintings. She published the text and her paintings, with commentary by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], as ''Where the Two Came to Their Father: A Navaho War Ceremonial''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff King and Maud Oakes, ''Where the Two Came to Their Father: A Navaho War Ceremonial'', with commentary by Joseph Campbell. New York: Pantheon Press, 1943. 3rd edition, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-691-02069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most complete extant recordings of a Navajo ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Evers, review of ''Where the Two Came to Their Father: A Navajo War Ceremonial Given by Jeff King'', by Maud Oakes and Joseph Campbell, ''American Indian Quarterly'', 18, no. 1 (Winter 1994), pp. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

King was also known to perform two of the other great Navajo ceremonies: the {{spell-nv|Hózhǫ́ǫ́jí}} ([[Blessing Way]]) and {{spell-nv|Anaaʼjí}} ([[Enemy Way]]).

King died and was buried in January 1964.  He was the first Navajo buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], near [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=navajotimes /&gt;

'''Jethwa''' (or '''Jethva''', '''Jaitwa''', '''Jethi''' or '''Kamari''', '''Camari''', '''Kam(a)r''') is a branch of the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] [[Rajput]] clan.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Origin==
[[File:Drapeau Porbandar.png|thumb|Merchant Navy flag of [[Porbandar State]] adopted by Jethwas, showing image of [[Hanuman]], from whom the Jethwas claim their descent.]]

It has been suggested that the [[Saindhava]] dynasty ruling eastern part of Saurashtra peninsula is now represented by the Jethwas. It is also suggested that the term Jethwa probably originating from Jayadratha (another name of Saindhawa dynasty), Jyeshtha (the elder branch) or Jyeshthuka from which the region derived its name Jyeshthukadesha.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nanavati|first=J.

'''Jhākri''' ({{lang-ne|झाक्री}}) is the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word for [[shaman]]. It is sometimes reserved specifically for practitioners of Nepali shamanism, such as that practiced among the [[Tamang people]] and the [[Magars]]; it is also used in the [[States and territories of India|Indian states]] of [[Sikkim]] and [[West Bengal]], which border [[Nepal]].

Jhākri shamanism is practiced among numerous [[ethnic group]]s of Nepal and [[Northeast India]], including the [[Limbu people|Limbu]], [[Rai people|Rai]], [[Sunwar]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], [[Kami (caste)|Kami]], [[Tamang people|Tamang]], [[Gurung people|Gurung]], [[Magars]], [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] and [[Khas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |pp=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in spirits is prevalent, hence also the fear of [[spirit possession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some vernacular words for ''jhākri'' are ''phedangbo'' in the [[Limbu language]], ''maangpa'' or ''nakchyong'' in [[Khambu]], and ''boongthing'' in [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]].

Jhākris perform rituals during weddings, funerals, and harvests. They diagnose and cure diseases. Their practices are influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Mun (religion)|Mun]], and [[Bön]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">'''Joseph C. Dylkes''', also referred to as the '''Leatherwood God''', was a messianic figure in the early settlement of the [[Ohio Country]] in the [[United States]].

Very little is known about Dylkes. Details about his birth, as well as information regarding his whereabouts following his enigmatic disappearance remain apocryphal.

Dylkes achieved notoriety in August 1828, at a [[camp meeting]] near a chapel known as the Leatherwood Church in [[Salesville, Ohio]]. On a Sunday afternoon, the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ|United Brethren]] minister John Crum was preaching to a large congregation when a voice shouted "Salvation" followed by a strange sound, taken by all who heard it to be the snort of a horse.

Everyone was taken by surprise and turned to see a stranger dressed in a black broadcloth suit, [[frock coat]], white cravat, and yellow beaver hat. He appeared to be between the ages of 45 and 50 and wore long black hair.

The stranger was hosted by some members of that congregation. He attended various religious meetings, and sometimes preached.  Displaying knowledge of the [[Bible]], he started to declare himself a celestial being, and finally claimed he was the Messiah come to establish a kingdom that would never end. His assertion of immortality was bolstered by claims that no one could harm him or touch a single hair of his head.

Some families accepted his claims and became his followers, stirring controversy in the Ohio valley. A mob bent on discrediting him came to a religious service in the home of a Dylkes follower and tore out a considerable lock of his hair to demonstrate his mortality.

Dylkes was taken before the local Squire to be charged but was released on the grounds that it "was not a crime to be a god." Dylkes took refuge in a farm belonging to one of his followers and ultimately declared he was going to Philadelphia to establish a "New Jerusalem." During the trip he disappeared without a trace.

A few of his believers, such as Michael Brill and Robert McCormick, died believing in Dylkes.

'''Kangan Giin''' (寒巌義尹, 1217–1300) was a disciple of [[Dōgen]] and the founder of the Higo school of [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]]. It has been claimed that his father was [[Emperor Go-Toba]] or [[Emperor Juntoku]]. He did much evangelization work in [[Kyūshū]], where he founded Daiji-ji (大慈寺) in Kumamoto. This temple has since been destroyed by fire twice, and nothing of Giin's remains there. He probably studied in China, but all extant biographies of him are hagiography so it is impossible to be certain.

'''''Makor Rishon''''' is an Israeli newspaper. Religious and nationalist, it is affiliated with the conservative right-wing Israeli parties. 
The paper was originally led by secular writers but over the years it became more religious. Makor Rishon is associated with the Settlers positions and is considered to have a qualitative impact on senior [[Likud]] and [[Jewish Home]].

== History ==
''Makor Rishon'' was founded as a weekly magazine in July 1997 in order to create an independent [[newspaper]] with a [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious and nationalistic slant. The paper was the brainchild of its original owner, [[Rabbi Shmuel Tal]]. The Listenberg family, a National Religious family in the diamond business based in Belgium and [[Tel Aviv|Tel]] Aviv financed the founding of the newspaper. [[Journalist]] [[Meir Uziel]] was hired to recruit the staff. Uziel enlisted [[Michael Ruzulio]] to find writers. Ruzulio had served as a reporter for ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' as well as for the [[Second Authority for Television and Radio]], and helped create the “[[Voice of the Red Sea]]” radio station. The newsroom was established in the “Pirsum Yisrael” offices located in [[Givat Shaul]] in [[Jerusalem]] and included religious and secular journalists and editors.

The majority of the newspaper’s editors in its early years were secular and included Meir Uziel, Michael Ruzulio, [[Yehuda Levi (journalist)]] and [[Ofer Shapira]].

Earnings from the paper were low and its financial situation worsened. The paper closed down at the end of October 1999, after which the owners filed for bankruptcy.

''Makor Rishon'' was reestablished after five weeks, in December 1999, under the auspices of a company named “The New Makor Rishon” – a move that enabled its purchaser, Dr. Michael Karash, to derive benefit from the newspaper’s name without having to be burdened by past debts. Karash worked to broaden the subscriber base and to make the paper financially viable. Over the course of 2003, the paper was purchased by businessman Shlomo Ben-Tzvi.  After the buyout, changes were made that included  a significant increase in the number of pages and journalists as well as a move to a broadsheet  newspaper format.

Until mid-2007, ''Makor Rishon'' was published as a weekly. On April 25, 2007, the ''[[HaTzofe]]'' daily was incorporated into ''Makor Rishon'', which started appearing with the logo “Makor Rishon-HaTzofe”. [[Shlomo Ben-Tzvi]], who until then had been the newspaper’s [[CEO]], was appointed the editor-in-chief. ''Makor Rishon'' was then published as a daily for the next two years.

In November 2008, the newspaper entered into financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Makor rishon in recovery plan (in Hebrew)|url = http://www.bizportal.co.il/general/news/article/30126446|website = |accessdate = |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The employees requested the court liquidate the assets of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Makor Rishon employees submitted a court appeal (in Hebrew)|url = http://www.bizportal.co.il/general/news/article/30126349|website = |accessdate = |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper dealt with the crises by drastically cutting content, raising prices, firing workers, and closing down its website and article archives, among other actions. Starting from June 2009, the paper returned to being a weekly. A reduced daily edition was distributed only to subscribers but was made available on the newspaper’s website, and a weekend edition was also attainable at newsstands.

On February 16, 2012, the newspaper began distributing a free expanded edition at various locations throughout the country, that contained many references to the newspaper’s flagship edition that is sold on weekends, a move intended to increase sales and subscribers for the Friday edition.

On March 9, 2014, Ben-Tzvi’s request for a two-month injunction to halt [[bankruptcy]] proceedings against the ''Makor'' ''Rishon'' and ''Ma’ariv'' newspapers was approved by the court. On March 30, 2014, the Jerusalem District Court approved selling the newspaper to ''[[Israel Hayom]]'' for 14 million shekels,.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mobile.mako.co.il/culture-showbiz/Article-be2570750231541006.htm?sCh=3d385dd2dd5d4110&amp;pId=389626226|title = "The court approved the sale of "Makor Rishon" to "Israel Hayom"" (in Hebrew)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo approved the sale one month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.2308940|title = Gilo approved selling it to Adelson (in Hebrew)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2014, the daily edition was printed for the last time. Starting from this date, only the weekend edition is published.

== Newspaper format ==
In the past, the newspaper had only included a main news section, a news journal and a weekly magazine, ''Diyukan'', that also included a cultural supplement. After Shlomo Ben-Tzvi purchased the newspaper in 2003, new supplements began appearing, which culminated  with the switch to a new format in May 2005. The newspaper has undergone frequent changes since Ben-Tzvi purchased it. In its current format, the paper includes eight sections:

* '''General News''' – news items; editorial articles; opinion columns; and finance, science, sports and local travel sections.
*'''Yoman''' (Journal) – a weekly current affairs supplement containing articles, interviews and personal columns. The regular sections are Amnon Lord’s column “Neged Haruach”; a current events poetry column by Tzur Ehrlich; Adi Arbel’s series of observations “Lo Actuali”; political journalist Sophia Ron-Moriah’s column; Pazit Rabinah’s section “Teivat Pandora” containing international affairs exposés; a satirical section “Brichat Hamochot” edited by Gidon Dukov; and a weekly in-depth article on Middle Eastern affairs by Dr. Mordechai Kider. Avinadav Vitkun and Ariel Kahana are among the regular contributors. The supplement’s editor was Ori Elitzur. After his death in 2014, Chaggai Segal took over as editor, and his current news column which had been in ''Diyukan'', was moved to the “Yoman”. 
* '''Diyukan''' (Portrait) – a magazine that includes personal interest stories, personal columns and various sections, including an automotive section by Edward Atler, a food column by Ori Melamed, a travelogue  by Galit Dehan-Karlibach, a computer games section by Assi Tubia, a broadcast calendar, a crosswords section and a film review by Nachum Mochiach (which had been written in the past by Renanit Parshani, preceded by Yuval Rivlin). Orly Goldklang is the supplement’s editor-in-chief. In the past, Goldklang had written, together with Maya Levenson, “Tzippornaim”, a humor column, and today writes “Puzzle” on the first page. The magazine’s regular writers include Yifat Ehrlich, David Chermetz, Rikki Rat, Tzur Ehrlich, and Elyashiv Reichner.
* '''Shabbat''' ([[Sabbath]]) – a supplement for Jewish philosophy, Judaism and literature, with an intellectual bent. The editor-in-chief is Elchanan Nir. The editor of the section for book review is Dr. Shmuel Faust.
* '''Motzash''' ([[Motza'ei Shabbat]]) – a life-style magazine that began appearing in 2011. The editor-in-chief is Elad Teneh. The editor is Ariel Shinbal.

=== Past supplements ===
* '''Tzedek''' (Justice) – news and commentaries in the fields of religious and secular law, edited by Yehuda Yifrach.
From January 1, 2005, until February 2006, the weekly “''Hashavuon''”, a culture supplement that also contained a calendar for scheduled broadcasts and plays. Tamar Nesher-Rati was the editor-in-chief. The assistant editor was Shai Tzeler.
* '''Nashim''' (Women) – a supplement geared to women that began appearing in the summer of 2006 and is published bi-weekly. Limor Garzim-Magen is the editor. Before this supplement began there was a magazine, termed ''Pnei Isha'', that was edited by Ronny Shuv, preceded by Ayelet Kedem.
* '''Otiot''' (Letters) – a magazine for children and teens. A joint venture started in 2011 by the merger of the ''Makor'' ''L’Yiladim'' supplement and the established ''Otiot'' magazine. The new magazine was initially called “''Otiot L’Yiladim”'', after which it returned to being called “Otiot, a newspaper from ''Makor Rishon''”. The first edition of ''Makor L’Yiladim'' appeared on December 10, 2004. Its editors were Etti Elboim and Orit Zimmer. In previous years, a two-page children’s section had appeared in the ''Diyukan'' supplement. In its final years, its editor was Ehud Maksimov. Among its writers were Shoshie Greenfield, Yoel Chait, Yossi Shachar and Avinadav Vitkon.
* '''Sukariot''' (Candies) – a newspaper for preschoolers, known as the sister paper to ''Otiot''. Before the merger between the children’s supplements of ''Makor Rishon'' and the newspapers from ''Otiot'', ''Makor Rishon'' had published a supplement for preschoolers entitled “''Anakim”''. The two supplements were unified but the name ''Sukariot'' remained.

At the start of the newspaper’s switch to the new format, a vacation supplement was added, which became bi-weekly and was quickly cancelled.

In June of 2006, several months after the cancellation of “''Hashavuon''”, a bi-weekly section entitled “''Shishi Yisraeli''” was added, that was planned to become a weekly. It was a glossy supplement in a small format and contained articles on topics of current affairs. It was cancelled after around three months.

The ''Kalkala'' supplement edited by economist Eran Bar-Tal and the sports section edited by Dotan Malach were originally separate entities, but since August 3, 2012 have been incorporated into the ''Motzash'' magazine.

For a while, the newspaper published ''Shabbat Hagadol'' – an expanded Jewish philosophy supplement that appeared three times a year and was edited by Yoav Shurek. The paper also published ''Makori'' – a Shabbat pamphlet that was distributed free of charge in [[synagogue]]s and contained condensed articles from the ''Makor Rishon'' newspaper and from other sections, but was canceled towards the end of 2010.

=== The Shabbat supplement ===
The newspaper’s ''Shabbat'' supplement deals with the topics of Jewish philosophy, literature and Torah thought and has been in print since 2004. Yoav Shurek was the editor from its inception until 2012. The current editor is Rabbi Elchanan Nir, with Dr. Shmuel Faust for book reviews.

The ''Shabbat'' supplement combines [[Judaism|Jewish]] content with articles on [[Literature review|literature]] and the arts, in a format similar to ''[[Haaretz]]''[[Haaretz|’s]] “''Culture and Literature''” supplement. ''Shabbat'' deals with more extensive subject matter and is far longer than a regular literary supplement. It has 24 pages which has been the case for nearly all the years it has been in existence. The supplement is highly regarded and is considered a respectable platform where authors, poets, translators, researchers and [[Torah scholar|Torah]] scholars can publish regularly. It also serves as a forum to publish short stories and poetry. The supplement’s format has only undergone minor changes since its inception. The front page features a work of art (a [[drawing]] or a [[photograph]]) together with a quotation.

The supplement is published in a similar format as ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv’s]]'' culture supplement, entitled “''Erev'' ''Shabbat”'', which contains exclusive material including weekly columns by [[Dov Elbaum|Dov]] Elboim and Yair Sheleg.

The sections in the supplement are: a regular column on the weekly Torah portion whose author changes from Chumash to Chumash; “Arachim from a Jewish Lexicon” by Professor Shalom Rosenberg; a poetry review by Yonatan Berg, a music review by Amichai Chason; Chayuta Deutsch’s column “Lipnai U’lifnim”; “B’safa Acheret” – a monthly overview of periodicals from around the world by Zeev Shpeidel; “Yashan Mipnei Chadash”, a book column by Edmiel Cosman; and a section dealing with rabbinic leaders in Jewish communities around the world written by Rabbi Eliyahu Birenbaum.

== Exclusives ==
The newspaper claims several exclusives to its credit, such as exposing the non-profit organizations affair in which Ehud Barak was involved during the 1999 general Israeli elections, and election fraud accusations made during the Labor party primaries that year that led to MK [[Ediso Masalah]]’s defeat.

{{see also|Character structure|good moral character}}
'''Moral character''' or '''character''' is an evaluation of an individual's stable [[Morality|moral]] qualities. The concept of ''character'' can imply a variety of attributes including the existence or lack of [[virtue]]s such as [[empathy]], [[courage]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], [[honesty]], and [[loyalty]], or of good behaviors or [[habit]]s. Moral character primarily refers to the assemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another—although on a cultural level, the set of moral behaviors to which a social group adheres can be said to unite and define it culturally as distinct from others. Psychologist Lawrence Pervin defines moral character as "a disposition to express behavior in consistent patterns of functions across a range of situations".&lt;ref&gt;Pervin 1994, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the philosopher George refers to moral character as the “sum of one’s moral habits and dispositions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=George |first1=MI |title=What moral character is and is not. |journal=The Linacre quarterly |date=August 2017 |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=261-274 |doi=10.1080/00243639.2017.1338442 |pmid=28912619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The word "character" is derived from the Ancient Greek word "charaktêr", referring to a mark impressed upon a coin. Later it came to mean a point by which one thing was told apart from others.&lt;ref name="Timpe 2007"&gt;Timpe 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There are two approaches when dealing with moral character: [[Normative ethics]] involve moral standards that exhibit right and wrong conduct. It is a test of proper behavior and determining what is right and wrong. [[Applied ethics]] involve specific and [[controversial]] issues along with a moral choice, and tend to involve situations where people are either for or against the issue.&lt;ref name="Timpe 2007"/&gt;

In 1982  [[V. Campbell]] and [[R. Bond]] proposed the following as major sources in influencing character and moral development: [[heredity]], early childhood experience, [[Role model|modeling]] by important adults and older youth, [[peer influence]], the general [[Environment (biophysical)|physical]] and [[social environment]], the [[communications media]], the teachings of [[schools]] and other institutions, and specific situations and roles that elicit corresponding behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, V., &amp; Bond, R. (1982). "Evaluation of a Character Education Curriculum". In D. McClelland (ed.), ''Education For Values''. (New York: Irvington Publishers). As described in Huitt, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of [[business ethics]] examines moral controversies relating to the social responsibilities of [[capitalist]] business practices, the moral status of [[corporate entities]], [[deceptive advertising]], [[insider trading]], [[employee rights]], [[job discrimination]], [[affirmative action]] and [[drug testing]].

In the military field, character is considered particularly relevant in the [[leadership]] development area. Military leaders should not only "know" theoretically the moral values but they must embody these values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milsci.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.mili.d7/files/sitefiles/fm6_22.pdf|title=FM-62: Leader Development|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Department of the Army|accessdate=18 December 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' provides a historical account of some important developments in philosophical approaches to moral character. A lot of attention is given to [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Karl Marx]]'s views, since they all follow the idea of moral character after the [[Greeks]]. Marx accepts Aristotle's insight that virtue and good character are based on a sense of [[self-esteem]] and [[self-confidence]].

[[Plato]] believed that the [[soul]] is divided into three parts of desire: [[Rationality|Rational]], [[Appetitive]], or [[Spirited]].&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-character/ |title=Moral Character (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to have moral character, we must understand what contributes to our overall good and have our spirited and appetitive desires educated properly, so that they can agree with the guidance provided by the rational part of the soul.

[[Aristotle]] tells us that there are good people in the world.  These are those who exhibit [[excellence]]s – excellences of [[thought]] and excellences of character. His phrase for excellences of character – ''êthikai aretai'' – we usually translate as moral virtue or moral excellence. When we speak of a moral [[virtue]] or an excellence of character, the emphasis is on the combination of qualities that make an individual the sort of ethically admirable person that he is.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;  Aristotle defines virtuous character at the beginning of Book II in ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'': “Excellence of character, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a [[mean]] relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of [[practical wisdom]] would determine it. Now it is a mean between two [[vices]], that which depends on [[wikt:excess|excess]] and that which depends on [[wikt:Special:Search/defect|defect]]”. In Aristotle's view, good character is based on two naturally occurring psychological responses that most people experience without difficulty: our tendency to take [[pleasure]] from [[self-realizing]] activity and our tendency to form friendly feelings toward others under specific circumstances. Based on his view, virtually everyone is capable of becoming better and they are the ones [[Individual responsibility|responsible]] for actions that express (or could express) their character.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

[[Abraham Lincoln]] once said, "Character is like a [[tree]] and [[reputation]] like its [[shadow]]. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/subjects/character/ |title=Character Quotes |publisher=The Quotations Page |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
[[File:Dublin Christ Church Cathedral Passage to Synod Hall Window Fruit of the Spirit 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|Stained glass window at [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin]], depicting the ''Fruit of the Holy Spirit'' along with role models representing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dia.ie/works/view/57668/building/CO.+DUBLIN%2C+DUBLIN%2C+CHRISTCHURCH+PLACE%2C+CHRIST+CHURCH+CATHEDRAL+%28CI%29 |title=CO.

Christian character is also defined as exhibiting the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]": love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.{{Bibleref2c|Galatians|5:22-23|NIV}} Doctrines of [[Grace (Christianity)#Augustine versus Pelagius|grace]] and [[total depravity]] assert that – due to [[original sin]] – mankind, entirely or in part, was incapable of truly being good without God's intervention; otherwise at best, one could only mimic good behavior for selfish reasons.

==Scientific experiments==
The [[Milgram experiment]] was a study done in the early 1960s that helped measure a person's moral character. Subjects from different [[socio-economic group]]s were tested on their willingness to press a [[buzzer]] that caused a participant – posing as a [[Human subject research|subject]] – in another room to express great [[pain]] and distress for giving a wrong answer to a test question. When the subjects raised questions about what they are being asked to do, the [[experiment]]er applied mild pressure in the form of appealing to the need to complete the experiment. The Milgram experiment caused a huge amount of criticism among individuals.  In post-experiment interviews with subjects Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the wrongness of what they were doing. Although the subjects may have had moral values, many were criticized on whether they were a truly moral character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1344 |title=Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2003-08-02 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one experiment that was done in the United States in 1985, the moral character of a person was based on whether or not a person had found a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] in a [[public phone booth]]. The findings were that 87% of subjects who found a dime in a phone booth mailed a sealed and addressed envelope that was left at the booth in an apparent mistake by someone else, while only 4% of those who did not find a dime helped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Isen |last2= Levin|first1=Paula F. |first2= Alice M.|title=Further Studies on the Effect of Feeling Good on Helping|jstor=2786238|publisher=American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{Who|date=April 2011}} found it very troubling that people would be influenced by such morally [[trivia]]l factors in their choice whether to provide low-cost [[Aid|assistance]] to others. [[John M. Doris]] raises the issue of [[ecological validity]] – do experimental findings reflect [[phenomena]] found in natural [[Archaeological context|context]]s. He recognizes that these results are [[counterintuitive]] to the way most of us think about morally relevant behavior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1344 |title=Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2003-08-02 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment that was done that asked [[college student]]s at [[Cornell]] to predict how they would behave when faced with one of several [[moral dilemma]]s, and to make the same [[prediction]]s for their [[Peer group|peer]]s. Again and again, people predicted that they would be more [[Generosity|generous]] and [[Kindness|kind]] than others. Yet when put into the moral dilemma, the subjects did not behave as generously or as kindly as they had predicted. In [[psychological terms]], the experimental subjects were successfully anticipating the base rate of moral behavior and accurately predicting how often others, in general, would be [[Self sacrifice|self-sacrificing]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of [[philosophers]] and [[social scientists]] began to question the very [[presuppositions]] that theories of moral character and moral character traits are based on. Due to the importance of moral character to issues in [[philosophy]], it is unlikely that the debates over the nature of moral character will disappear anytime soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/moral-ch.htm#H3 |title=Moral Character |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Situationism (psychology)|Situationism]] can be understood as composed of three central claims:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/moral-ch.htm |title=Moral Character |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Non-robustness Claim: moral character traits are not consistent across a wide spectrum of trait-relevant situations. Whatever moral character traits an individual has are situation specific.
*Consistency Claim: while a person’s moral character traits are relatively stable over time, this should be understood as consistency of situation specific traits, rather than robust traits.
*Fragmentation Claim: a person’s moral character traits do not have the [[evaluative]] [[integrity]] suggested by the Integrity Claim. There may be considerable disunity in a person’s moral character among his or her situation-specific character traits.

According to Situationists, the [[empirical]] evidence favors their view of moral character over the Traditional View. [[Hugh Hartshorne]] and [[M. A. May]]’s study of the trait of [[honesty]] among school [[children]] found no cross-situational [[correlation]]. A child may be consistently honest with his [[friendship|friends]], but not with his [[parents]] or [[teachers]]. From this and other studies, Hartshorne and May concluded that character traits are not [[wikt:robust|robust]] but rather “specific functions of life situations”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A second challenge to the traditional view can be found in the idea of moral [[luck]]. This idea is that moral luck occurs when the moral judgment of an [[Moral agency|agent]] depends on factors beyond the agent’s control. Fiery Cushman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2219685|title=A Solution to the Problem of Moral Luck|first=Brynmor|last=Browne|date=1 January 1992|publisher=|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=42|issue=168|pages=345–56|doi=10.2307/2219685}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifies that this is judgement of an outcome comprising both the agent's character and an unanticipated circumstance, rather than an agent's intent. There are number of ways that moral luck can motivate criticisms of moral character. It is similar to “the kind of problems and situations one faces”&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel, Thomas]] (1993). "Moral Luck," in ''Moral Luck'', ed. Daniel Statman ([[State University of New York Press]]): 57–61&lt;/ref&gt;  If all of an agent’s moral character traits are situation-specific rather than robust, what traits an agent manifests will depend on the situation that she finds herself in. But what situations an agent finds herself in is often beyond her control and thus a matter of situational luck. Whether moral character traits are robust or situation-specific, some have suggested that what character traits one has is itself a matter of luck. If our having certain traits is itself a matter of luck, this would seem to undermine one’s moral responsibility for one’s moral character, and thus the concept of moral character altogether. As [[Owen Flanagan]] and Amélie Oksenberg Rorty write:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
{{quote|It [the morality and meaning of an individual’s life] will depend on luck in an individual’s upbringing, the values she is taught, the [[self-control]]ling and self-constructing capacities her [[social environment]] enables and encourages her to develop, the moral challenges she faces or avoids. If all her character, not just [[temperamental traits]] and [[disposition]]s but also the reflexive capacities for self-control and self-construction, are matters of luck, then the very ideas of character and agency are in danger of [[evaporation]].}}

A moral character trait is a character trait for which the agent is morally responsible. If moral responsibility is impossible, however, then agents cannot be held responsible for their character traits or for the behaviors that they do as a result of those character traits.

A similar argument has also recently been advocated by [[Bruce Waller]]. According to Waller, no one is "morally responsible for her character or deliberative powers, or for the results that flow from them.… Given the fact that she was shaped to have such characteristics by [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] (or [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]]) forces far beyond her control, she deserves no [[blame]] [nor [[praise]]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Mount Yengo''' is a [[mountain]] that is located in the [[Hunter Region|Lower Hunter]] region of [[New South Wales]], in eastern [[Australia]]. The {{convert|668|m|adj=on}} mountain is part of the Calore Range, part of the [[Great Dividing Range]], and is situated within the [[Yengo National Park]], approximately {{convert|3|km}} east of the [[Macdonald River (St Albans)|Macdonald River]] and {{convert|17|km}} east by south of {{NSWcity|Putty}}.&lt;ref name=gnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/yengo-national-park|title=Yengo National Park|work=[[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service]]|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance to indigenous Australians==
Mount Yengo is a natural feature of spiritual and ceremonial importance to the [[Wonnarua]], [[Awabakal]], [[Worimi]] and [[Darkinjung]] [[Indigenous Australians]]. According to [[Dreamtime|indigenous mythology]], Mount Yengo is the place from which [[Baiame]], a creational ancestral hero, jumped back up to the spirit world after he had created all of the mountains, lakes, rivers and caves in the area. Baiame flattened the top of Mount Yengo when he jumped skyward and the flat top is still visible today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/aboriginalplaces/MountYengo.htm|title=Atlas of Aboriginal Places: Mount Yengo|work=Office of Environment &amp; Heritage|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wollombi.org/yengo.html|title=Mount Yengo|work=Wollombi Valley Arts Council.

The '''Nagarparkar Jain Temples''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|نگرپارکر جین مندر}}}}) are located in the region around [[Nagarparkar]], in [[Pakistan]]'s southern [[Sindh]] province. The site consists of a collection of abandoned [[Jainism|Jain]] temples, as well as a mosque heavily influenced by the architectural style of the temples. Buildings in the region date from the 12th to the 15th centuries - a period when Jain architectural expression was at its zenith.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Tentative Lists|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6111/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frescoes at the Gori Temple are the oldest Jain frescoes still in existence in the northern regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The temples were inscribed on the tentative list for [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]] status in 2016 as the '''Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape.'''&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

==Background==
The region around Nagarparkar forms a zone of transition between the marshes and salt-flats of the [[Rann of Kutch]], and the dry grounds of stabilized sand dunes and nearby pink-granite [[Karoonjhar Mountains]]. The region had been mostly covered by the [[Arabian Sea]] until the 15th century,&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; though the region around Nagarparkar formed an area of raised and perennially dry land.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

Nagarparkar was a centre of Jainism for several centuries,&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; and the wealthy local Jain community built several extravagant temples  in the nearby hills between the 12th and 15th centuries&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; - considered a high point of Jain architectural expression.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The region became a place of pilgrimage known as ''Sardhara'',&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; with Jain ascetics establishing themselves in the Karoonjhar Mountains.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; The Nagarparkar region was described in 1650 as the "most glorious of all regions of [[Indian subcontinent|India]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shri Gaudi Parshvanth Stavan, Bhanvarlal Nahta, Shri Gaudi Parchvanath Tirth, Muni Jinavijaya Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Dalsukh Malvania, Jinavijayaji Samman Samiti, Jaipur, 1971, p. 263-275&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jain influence in the region began to decline due to shifting of the Arabian Sea away from centres of Jain economic activity,&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; as silt from the [[Indus River]] deposited in the [[Rann of Kutch]].&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; Changes in the coast line resulted in a large-scale shift of the local Jain population in the 19th century,&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; while remaining Jains left the area following the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947,&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; though several of the temples continue to be maintained by the area's sizable Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kalhoro|first1=Zulfiqar Ali|title=The Jain Temples in Nagarparkar|url=https://www.academia.edu/11775817/The_Jain_Temples_in_Nagarparkar|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several new temples were built in nearby [[Rajasthan]], which trace their heritage back to older sites in Nagarparkar.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; 

The remains of a number of Jain temples are popular tourist attractions and heritage sites in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Vanishing temples of Thar and Nagar Parkar, Ameer Hamza, Dawn, October 21, 2006 
http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/gallery/archive/061021/gallery3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of an adequate road system in the area contributed to the site's state of good preservation,&lt;ref name=hasan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasan|first1=Arif|title=The future of Nagarparkar|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/205267/the-future-of-nagarparkar/|accessdate=16 September 2017|agency=Express Tribune|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the recent construction of roadways has led to a surge of tourists,&lt;ref name=hasan/&gt; despite the lack of adequate protection at the site.&lt;ref name=hasan/&gt; In 2009, satellite imagery was employed to document the site,&lt;ref name=hasan/&gt; and to help devise a plan to manage tourism.&lt;ref name=hasan/&gt;

====Significance====
For  several centuries, the temple at Goripur was a celebrated Jain [[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]. The temple is notable amongst local Hindus as well for its image of [[Parshvanatha|Parasnath]].&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt; 

An account of its building is contained in "Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan" by Pritivimala, composed in Samvat 1650 and "Shri Gaudi Parshvanath Stavan" written by Nemavijaya in Samvat 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Bhanvarlal Nahta, Shri Gaudi Parchvanath Tirth, Muni Jinavijaya Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Dalsukh Malvania, Jinavijayaji Samman Samiti, Jaipur, 1971, p. 263-275&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muni Darshanvijaya,&lt;ref&gt;Jain Paramparano Itihas, Munishi Darshanvijaya, Jnanavijaya, Nyayavijaya, Charitra Smarak Granthamala, Ahmedabad, 1960, p. 739-743&lt;/ref&gt; it was installed by Seth Godidas of Jhinjhuvad and was consecrated by Acharya [[Hemachandra]] at [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] in Samvat 1228. It was brought to Patan and was buried underground for safekeeping during a period of disturbance. It was rediscovered in 1375-76 and was stored in the stable of the local ruler.

According to the texts, a merchant 500 yearsa ago named Manga Oswal from [[Nagarparkar]] had gone to Pattan to purchase some items.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; He was informed in a dream that an image was buried under the house of a local Muslim that Oswal was instructed to acquire.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; Oswal bought the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka), and was instructed in another dream to place the image on a cart and to move forward without looking back.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; The cart is said to have broken down near Nagarparkar, where Oswal then fell asleep.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; In his next dream, he was informed that underneath him lay marble and treasure,&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; and instructed him to recruit craftsmen to build a fine temple in which to worship the idol, which was bestowed with the name Gori.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; The temple's construction was supervised by an architect from [[Sirohi]], while the ''[[shikhara|shikhar]]'' of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The image was formally reconsecrated by Acharya Merutunga Suri of [[Anchala]] [[Gachchha]], thus establishing the ''Gori Parshvanth Tirth'', and the temple as a place of pilgrimage for Jains from afar.

The image is said to have disappeared in 1835.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; The temple was visited by Stanley Napier Raikes in 1854,&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Napier Raikes, Memoir on the Thurr and Parkur districts of Sind, Education Society's Press, Byculla, 1859. p. 83, Appendix B,&lt;/ref&gt; who met local Jains to compile recent history and consulted ''Goorjee Kuntvujajee'' who had manuscripts describing the history of the temple. The temple was damaged by British troops who tried to capture a ''Sodha'' chief who had led a local rebellion.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt;

===Nagarparkar Bazaar Temple=== 
[[File:Jain_Temple_Nagarparkar_by_smn121-15.JPG|thumb|The Nagarparkar Bazaar temple]]
The '''Nagarparkar Bazaar Temple''' was built main bazar of the Nagarparkar town. The temple is remarkable for its intricately carved sculptures and paintings.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; The structure of the temple, including its ''[[shikhara]]'' and the ''torana'' gateway is completely intact. It was in use until the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and perhaps for some years even after that.

=== Bhodesar Temples===
[[File:Jain_Temple_by_Bilal_Soomro.JPG|thumb|The Bhodesar Temple is at the base of the [[Karoonjhar Mountains]].]] 
Bhodesar, 4 miles from Nagar,&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; features the ruins of three Jain temples.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; Bhodesar was the region's capital during Sodha rule. Two of the three temples were used as cattle sheds, while the third was noted in 1897 to be in disrepair with holes in the back.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; An ancient water tank, known as ''Bhodesar Talao'', was also built in the nearby hills.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt;

The oldest temple, was built in the classical style with stones without any mortar, built around the 9th century CE, by a Jain woman named Poni Daharo.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; It is built on a high platform and reached by a series of steps carved into the rock. It has beautifully carved huge stone columns and other structural elements. The remaining walls are unstable and partially collapsed.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; Parts of the building had been dismantled by the locals who used the bricks to construct their homes.

The two other Jain temples are said to have been built in 1375 CE and 1449 CE,&lt;ref name="friday"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Jain Temples of Nangarparkar|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta3/tft/article.php?issue=20120420&amp;page=16|accessdate=16 September 2017|agency=The Friday Times|date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; built of ''kanjur'' and redstone, with fine carvings and corbelled domes.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt;

=== Viravah Jain Temples===
[[File:Virawah Jain Temple.jpg|thumb|The Viravah site is home to an abandoned, but well-preserved, temple.]]
The '''Viravah Temples''' were 3 temples that are located near the town of Viravah, about 15 miles north of Nagarparkar. The site is near the ruins of the ancient seaport of ''Parinagar'' on the edge of the [[Rann of Kutch]]. The area once had three temples, which are said to have been founded in 456 CE by Jeso Parmāra.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; 

One of the temples was in use during the British era,&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; and is well-preserved and made of white marble.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; Another temple had a block of finely carved marble which was transferred to the [[National Museum of Pakistan|Karachi Museum]] during the British era.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; The third ruined temple has 26 small domes surrounding a large central dome measuring 18 feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt; The central dome features fine stone tracing It contains carved stone pillars with carved capitals.&lt;ref name="cousens"/&gt;

During construction of a nearby road, workers accidentally discovered numerous Jain statues,&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; which were then placed by locals in the remaining abandoned temple,&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; while others were taken to the museum in [[Umerkot]].&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt;

==Architectural impact ==
===Bhodesar Mosque===
[[File:Bhudesar_Mosque,_Nagarparkar.JPG|thumb|The Bhodesar Mosque was heavily influenced by Jain architectural styles.]]
The white marble mosque of Bhodesar is built in a style that was highly influenced by the architecture of nearby Jain temples. The mosque was built in 1505 CE by the Sultan [[Mahmud Begada]] of Gujarat.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt; The mosque features a central dome very similar to domes found on the nearby Jain temples,  resting upon a square shaped edifice measuring 9.2 metres on each side. Pillars at the mosque also reflect Jain architecture, while decorative elements along the roofline were also inspired by Jain temples.

==Conservation==
The temples and mosques are protected by the ''Antiquities Act 1968,'' which was replaced by the ''Antiquities Act 1975.'' The site is managed by Director General of Archaeology and Museums. The Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of the Heritage of Sindh,&lt;ref&gt;[https://eftsindh.com Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of the Heritage of Sindh]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 2008, has undertaken restoration works at the site using private funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Robert G.|last2=Stubbs|first2=John H.|title=Architectural Conservation in Asia: National Experiences and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317406198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA434&amp;dq=nagarparkar+jain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjluef64qjWAhUBKyYKHYeZD6cQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=jain&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape was submitted by the Pakistani government in 2016 to be inscribed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 2016.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

'''The Old Man of the South Pole''' (in {{zh|t=南極老人, 南極仙翁}} or {{lang-ja|南極老人}}) is the [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[:wikt:deify|deification]] of [[Canopus]], the brightest star of the constellation [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]].

It is the symbol of happiness and [[longevity]] in [[Far East]]ern culture.

==Description==
The Old Man of the South Pole is often depicted in the Chinese pictures as an old man with a long white beard, with a deer by his side.  This style of picture is related to the story of an emperor of the [[Song Dynasty#Northern Song, 960–1127|Northern Song]] Dynasty who had invited such an old man from the street and later considered the old man as the sign of his longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/1136086.htm |title=Baidu Encyclopedia: The Old Man of the South Pole |publisher=Baike.baidu.com |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canopus is usually called in Chinese the Star of the Old Man (in {{zh|老人星}}) or the Star of the Old Man of the South Pole (in {{zh|t=南極老人星}}).  Since Carina is a Southern constellation,  Canopus is rarely seen in [[North China|Northern China]] and, if seen in good weather, looks reddish lying near the southern horizon.  Because the [[Red#In different cultures and traditions|color red]] is the symbol of happiness and longevity in China, Canopus is also known in China and its neighboring countries of Korea, Japan and Vietnam as the Star of Old Age (in {{zh|壽星}}) or the Star of the Man of the Old Age (in {{zh|壽老人}}). In Japan, it became [[Jurōjin]] (in {{lang-ja|壽老人}}), one of the [[Seven Lucky Gods|Seven Gods of Fortune]] (in {{lang-ja|七福神}}).

Born in London, he contributed significantly to the advancement of Roman Catholic life and [[ecumenism]] in England during the 20th century, notably through co-founding the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] of Great Britain, his collaboration as an Editorial Committee member of the first one-volume Bible commentary for English-speaking Catholics and his General Editorship of its second edition, and his work as a member of the Revised Standard Version Bible Committee and as Co-Editor of the first complete Bible translation in modern English for Catholics from the Hebrew and the Greek, as well as of its ecumenical edition. His specialist subjects were the [[Deuterocanonical Books]], on which he contributed articles to three major Biblical Commentaries (see "Publications" below), and the life and works of [[Alexander Geddes]], a pioneer of biblical criticism, on which he wrote his doctoral thesis (see "Publications" below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/canon_reginald_c_fuller/5721903570/sizes/l/in/set-72157626599316103/|title=All sizes – Canon Reginald Cuthbert Fuller, Biographical Info 3 (4 May 2004, his final version for "Who's Who in Catholic Life") – Flickr – Photo Sharing!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Initially Fuller's parents, the physician and medical author Arthur William Fuller and Florence Margaret Fuller (née Montgomery), of [[St John's Wood]], London, sent their son to Ealing Priory School (subsequently renamed [[St Benedict's School, Ealing|St Benedict's School]]) where he happened to share classes and hone his Latin skills in competition with a younger pupil, later also a [[New Testament]] scholar who would be Fuller's colleague on a number of major academic projects, [[Bernard Orchard|John Bernard Orchard]]. Recognizing his academic potential, they then decided to move their son to Cardinal Vaughan School, before sending him for the final years of his schooling to [[Ampleforth College]].

==Seminary and academic studies==
Fuller attended seminary studies at [[St Edmund's College (Ware)|Allen Hall, St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire]], from 1926 to 1931 and was ordained priest by Cardinal Bourne at [[Westminster Cathedral]] in 1931. His academic studies at the Dominican University in Rome earned him a SThL in 1933 and a SThD in 1935, and at the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute|Biblical Institute]] in Rome a SScriptLic in 1934. During 1964–1968 he took up biblical research at [[Cambridge University]] and earned a PhD.

==Pastoral appointments==
At various times during 1950–1994 Rev. Fuller held pastoral appointments in the Archdiocese of Westminster. He served as Rector of the Church and [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary#United Kingdom|Shrine]] of Our Lady of the Assumption and St. Gregory, Warwick Street, London W1 (1950–1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/canon_reginald_c_fuller/5722057098/|title=Warwick Street Church History 51 – p.88}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Chaplain at Westminster Cathedral (1976–1978), and as Rector of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, [[Islington]] (1978–1983). After his retirement he served as Assistant Priest at the Church of St. Mellitus, Tollington Park, London (1983–1990, (where on one occasion in the sacristy he was attacked by intruders and hit over the head with a crucifix but suffered no lasting injury), and at the Church of Our Lady and St. Joseph, [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], London (1990–1994). Thereafter he took up residence in Clergy House at Westminster Cathedral, regularly hearing [[Confession (religion)|Confessions]] at the Cathedral and helping with occasional exhibitions. In 2003 he moved to Nazareth House, where on request he continued to provide spiritual guidance to his visitors on an individual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://romanmiscellany.blogspot.com/2008_05_01_archive.html|title=Roman Miscellany: May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching appointments==
Fuller was lecturer in [[Biblical Studies]] at [[St Edmund's College (Ware)|Allen Hall, St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire]], from 1936 to 1949, for the Newman Association from 1950 to 1954, and at [[St. Mary's University College (Twickenham)|St Mary's College, Strawberry Hill]], [[Twickenham]], from 1968 to 1972. He then spent three years in [[Kenya]] as lecturer in [[Old Testament]] Studies at the University of [[Nairobi]] from 1972 to 1975. While there he availed himself of the opportunity to indulge some of his recreational interests and with members of the university staff went mountain climbing and visited [[Mount Kenya]] and the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], and admired the wild-life in [[Serengeti]]/Tanzania and the [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] in Zimbabwe.

==Other professional activities==
From 1949 to 1990 Fuller was a member of the ''[[Society of Old Testament Studies]] (SOTS)''. Among his involvement in major professional projects was the co-founding of the ''Catholic Biblical Association of Great Britain'' (CBA), of which he then was Hon. Secretary from 1940 to 1965 and chairman from 1968 to 1982. As representative of the CBA he acted in 1963 as Promoter of the English spelling of Biblical names for Catholic use to the Conference of the Bishops of England and Wales (e.g. Noah, Elijah, Joshua, in place of Noe, Elias, Josue as in the Douay-Challoner Bible, based on the Latin text).

Fr [[Bernard Orchard]] invited Fuller onto the Editorial Committee of the first one-volume Bible commentary for English-speaking Catholics, entitled ''A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture'' (CCHS, 1953 [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99240475]); and the Diocese entrusted Fuller in 1951 with the office of ''Censor Deputatus'' for the ''Nihil Obstat'' in its regard (cf. CCHS, p. iv). When subsequent developments – among them [[Vatican II]] and the discovery of the manuscripts in the caves at [[Qumran]] – required an updating of the commentary, he was General Editor of its second edition, entitled ''A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture'' (1969).

He was, moreover, Co-Editor of the first complete Bible translation in modern English for Catholics from the Hebrew and Greek, entitled ''The Holy Bible – [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]]'' (1966), and its ecumenical counterpart, ''The Common Bible'' (1973). He was a member of the Revised Standard Version Bible Committee from 1969 to 1980 and of the Joint Committee on the Revised English Bible from 1979 to 1989. From 1946 to 1953 he was the Editor of the quarterly journal, ''Scripture''.

==Publications==
In addition to many articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/canon_reginald_c_fuller/5721543053/|title=Canon Reginald Cuthbert Fuller, Publications p. 1 (4 Apr 2004 in his own hand)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and book reviews that Fuller contributed to specialist journals, e.g. ''Scripture Bulletin'', ''Priests and People'', ''[[The Tablet]].'' He wrote articles on the [[Deuterocanonical Books]] for ''A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture'' (1953), ''A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture'' (1966), and ''International Catholic Bible Commentary'' (1996), and the articles ''[[Alexander Geddes|"]]''[[Alexander Geddes]]'','' 1737–1802" and "Mythology and Biblical Studies to 1800" for ''Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation'' (1999).

His PhD thesis was published in 1984 under the title ''[[Alexander Geddes]]: A Pioneer of Biblical Criticism, 1737–1802''.

He outlined the history of the Church and Shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, better known as "Warwick Street Church", where he had been a Rector from 1950 to 1963, in a small illustrated book entitled ''Steadfast in Loyalty – Warwick Street Church – A Short History and Guide'' (1956, 1973).&lt;ref&gt;[http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/zblg/seite/zblg23_0363 First edition 1956 (see entry #428)], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/canon_reginald_c_fuller/5721996642/in/set-72157626724343742 Second edition 1973] of ''Steadfast in Loyalty – Warwick Street Church''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His friendship with [[Leonard Cheshire]] led to his editing a slender volume providing an insight into Cheshire's spiritual resources during his struggle with the effects of [[motor neurone disease]], entitled ''Crossing the Finishing Line – Last Thoughts of Leonard Cheshire VC'' (1998, {{ISBN|0-85439-527-X}}, see pp.&amp;nbsp;7–14, 80).

[[Myanmar]] (Burma) is a multi-religious country. There is no official state religion, but the government shows preference for [[Theravada Buddhism]], the majority religion.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119035.htm |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Burma |publisher=State.gov |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to both the 2014 census of the Burmese government [[Buddhism]] is the dominant religion, of 88% of the population, practiced especially by the [[Bamar]], [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Karen people]] and [[Chinese people in Burma|Chinese]] ethnic groups. Bamar people also practice the [[Burmese folk religion]] under the name of Buddhism. The new constitution provides for the freedom of religion; however, it also grants broad exceptions that allow the regime to restrict these rights at will.&lt;ref name="state.gov" /&gt; Ethnic minorities practice [[Christianity]] (6.2%, particularly the [[Chin people|Chin]], [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] and [[Karen people]]), [[Islam]] (4.3%, particularly the [[Burmese Indians|Indians]], [[Burmese Malays|Malays]], and other minorities), and [[Hinduism]] (0.5%, particularly by Burmese Indians).&lt;ref name="TUR"/&gt;

[[Burmese folk religion|Nat worship]] is common in Myanmar. Nats are named spirits and shrines can be seen around the country, either standing alone, or as part of Buddhist temples. Nat worship has a relationship with Myanmar Buddhism and there is a recognised pantheon of 37 nats.

*Note: the figures of Burma's Muslim population is divided into two. One that ignores the people who are believed to be not citizens of Burma and the other that includes them. Without these people in the demographics the Muslim population will only be as low as 2.3℅ of the whole population of Burma. Many minority religions claim that they have a greater following than the official statistics but they also tend to over-represent the number of adherents. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Buddhism in Myanmar==
{{Further information|Buddhism in Myanmar}}
[[Image:Shwedagon-Pano.jpg|thumb|left|Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon - the most revered pagoda in Myanmar]]
[[Image:Bagan, Hpaya-thon-zu-Group.JPG|thumb|The [[Payathonzu Temple]] is built in the [[Mon people|Mon]] style.]]
[[Buddhism]] in Myanmar is predominantly of the [[Theravada]] tradition, practised by 88% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="TUR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127266.htm |title=Burma—International Religious Freedom Report 2009 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the most religious Buddhist country in terms of the proportion of monks in the population and proportion of income spent on religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cone &amp; Gombrich, ''Perfect Generosity of Prince Vessantara'', Oxford University Press, 1977, page xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents are most likely found among the dominant ethnic [[Bamar]], [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Karen people|Karen]], and [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]] who are well integrated into Burmese society. [[Bhikkhu|Monks]], collectively known as the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the [[Bamar]] and [[Shan people|Shan]], Theravada Buddhism is practised in conjunction with [[nat (spirit)|nat worship]], which involves the placation of spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs.

Buddhists, although clearly professed by the majority of people in Myanmar, have their complaints regarding religious freedom.  A political party, the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]], split from the main Karen nationalist movement, the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU), after the Buddhists were denied to rebuild and repair the stupas at [[Manerplaw]]. The top leadership of the KNU were also dominated by Christians, although roughly 65% of the Karen are Buddhist.

Many monks took part in the 2007 [[Saffron Revolution]] and were reportedly arrested by government security forces.  Some of the leading monks are still detained in various prisons across the country.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127266.htm |title=Burma—International Religious Freedom Report 2009 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity in Myanmar==
{{Further information|Christianity in Myanmar}}
[[File:Yangon St Marys Cathedral 2017.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Cathedral, Yangon]]]]
[[Christianity]] is practised by 6.2% of the population,&lt;ref name="TUR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html#People |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily among the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], [[Chin people|Chin]] and Karen people, and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] because of missionary work in their respective areas. About four-fifths of the country’s Christians are [[Protestant]]s, in particular [[Baptists]] of the [[Myanmar Baptist Convention]]; [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] make up the remainder.

Christians were the fastest growing religious group in Burma for the last 3 decades, still even though that growth gap have narrowed close to the general population they still are the fastest growing religious group.

==Hinduism in Myanmar==
{{Further information|Hinduism in Myanmar}}
[[File:Hindu temple procession cart, Yangon.jpg|thumb|A Hindu procession in Yangon, Myanmar]]
[[File:Hindutempleyangon.jpg|thumb|Shri Kali Temple in Yangon]]
Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population.&lt;ref name="TUR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/table-religious-composition-by-country-in-numbers/ |title=Table: Religious Composition by Country, in Numbers &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Hindus in Myanmar are [[Burmese Indians]].

Hinduism, along with Buddhism, arrived in Burma during ancient times. Both names of the country are rooted in Hinduism; Burma is the British colonial officials' phonetic equivalent for the first half of ''Brahma Desha'' the ancient name of the region.&lt;ref name=tck&gt;Toʻ Cinʻ Khu, {{Google books|tEI6AQAAMAAJ|Elementary Hand-book of the Burmese Language|page=4}}, pp. iv-v&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brahma]] is part of Hindu trinity, a deity with four heads. The name ''Myanmar'' is regional language&lt;ref&gt;in both Talaing and Burmese languages; ''Prome'' is similarly derived from Brohm or Brahma.&lt;/ref&gt; transliteration of ''Brahma'', where ''b'' and ''m'' are interchangeable.&lt;ref name=tck/&gt;

[[Arakan Mountains|Arakan]] (Rakhine) Yoma is a significant natural mountainous barrier between Burma and India, and the migration of Hinduism and Buddhism into Burma occurred slowly through [[Manipur]] and by South Asian seaborne traders. Hinduism greatly influenced the royal court of Burmese kings in pre-colonial times, as seen in the architecture of cities such as [[Bagan]]. Likewise, the [[Burmese language]] adopted many words from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], many of which relate to religion. While ancient and medieval arrival of ideas and culture fusion transformed Burma over time, it is in 19th and 20th century that over a million Hindu workers were brought in by British colonial government to serve in plantations and mines. The British also felt that surrounding the European residential centre with Indian immigrants provided a buffer and a degree of security from tribal theft and raids. According to 1931 census, 55% of Rangoon's ([[Yangon]]) population were Indian migrants, mostly Hindus.&lt;ref name=dms&gt;Donald M. Seekins (2006), Historical Dictionary of Burma, {{ISBN|978-0810854765}}, pp. 216-220&lt;/ref&gt; After independence from Britain, Burma Socialist Programme Party under [[Ne Win]] adopted xenophobic policies and expelled 300,000 Indian ethnic people (Hindus and Buddhists), along with 100,000 Chinese, from Burma between 1963 and 1967. The Indian policy of encouraging democratic protests in Burma increased persecution of Hindus, as well as led to Burmese retaliatory support of left-leaning rebel groups in northeastern states of India.&lt;ref name=dms/&gt; Since the 1990s, the opening of Burma and its greater economic engagement has led to general improvement in the acceptance of Hindus and other minority religions in Myanmar.

Aspects of Hinduism continue in Burma today, even in the majority Buddhist culture. For example, Thagyamin is worshipped whose origins are in the Hindu god [[Indra]]. Burmese literature has also been enriched by Hinduism, including the Burmese adaptation of the Ramayana, called [[Yama Zatdaw]]. Many Hindu gods are likewise worshipped by many Burmese people, such as [[Saraswati]] (known as Thuyathadi in Burmese), the goddess of knowledge, who is often worshipped before examinations; Shiva is called ''Paramizwa''; Vishnu is called ''Withano'', and others. Many of these ideas are part of thirty seven [[Nat (spirit)|Nat]] or deities found in Burmese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thant Myint-U (2001), The Making of Modern Burma, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521799140}}, pp. 27-47&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Myanmar, most [[Burmese Indians|Hindus]] are found in the urban centres of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. Ancient Hindu temples are present in other parts of Burma, such as the 11th-century [[Nathlaung Kyaung Temple]] dedicated to Vishnu in [[Bagan]].

==Judaism in Myanmar==

Although Burma's [[Jews]] once numbered in the thousands, there are currently only approximately twenty Jews in [[Yangon]] (Rangoon), where the country's only [[Musmeah Yeshua Synagogue|synagogue]] is. Most Jews left Myanmar at the commencement of the Second World War, and also after General [[Ne Win]] took over in 1962.

== Islam in Myanmar ==
{{Further information|Islam in Myanmar}}
[[File:Bengali Sunni Jameh Mosque, Yangon.jpg|thumb|Bengali Sunni Jameh Mosque in Yangon]]
[[Islam]], mainly of the [[Sunni]] group, is practised by 4.3% of the population according to the government census.&lt;ref name="TUR" /&gt;

=== Burmese Muslim groups ===
* Muslims are spread across the country in small communities. The Indian-descended Muslims live mainly in [[Rangoon]]. See [[Burmese Indians#Muslims|Burmese Indian Muslims]].
* [[Rohingya people|Rohingyas]], a minority [[Muslim]] [[ethnic group]] in northern [[Rakhine State]], Western [[Burma]]. The Rohingya population is mostly concentrated in five northern townships of Rakhine State: [[Maungdaw]], [[Buthidaung]], [[Rathedaung]], [[Sittwe|Akyab]], Sandway, Tongo, Shokepro, Rashong Island and [[Kyauktaw]].
* [[Panthay]], Burmese Chinese Muslims.
* Muslims of Malay ancestry in [[Kawthaung]]. People of Malay ancestry are locally called ''Pashu'' regardless of religion.
* Zerbadi Muslims are descendent community of intermarriages between foreign [[Muslim]] ([[South Asia]]n and [[Middle East]]ern) males and Burmese females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNYUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA168 |title=Islam in South-East Asia |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rohingya conflict ===
{{Main article|Rohingya rebellion in Western Burma}}
Around 800,000 [[Rohingya people|Muslim Rohingyas]] live in Burma with around 80% living in the western state of [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]]. Some Rohingya militant have been fighting on and off since the 1940s to create an Islamic state in Western Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar, Bangladesh leaders 'to discuss Rohingya'|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j7a3oPcHSvWSpkXzzSruvNZfdPMA?docId=CNG.8d52d8a6dba835c4ac54aab3f3c8031b.571|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their initial ambition during [[Mujahideen]] movements (1947-1961) was to separate the Rohingya-populated [[Mayu Frontier District|Mayu]] frontier region of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] from western [[Burma]] and annex that region into newly formed neighbouring [[East Pakistan]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]]).&lt;ref name="yegar-1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yegar|first=Moshe|title=Muslims of Burma|year=1972|publisher=Verlag Otto Harrassowitz|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, uprisings appeared again during the period of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Recently, during the [[2012 Rakhine State riots|Arakan State Riots]], the aspiration of the Rohingya militant groups, according to various media reports, is to create northern part of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] an independent or autonomous state.&lt;ref name="BD-1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dainikpurbokone.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47174:2012-09-07-21-41-19&amp;catid=6:2011-05-26-03-32-28&amp;Itemid=1| title=টার্গেট আরাকান ও বাংলাদেশের কয়েকটি জেলা স্বাধীন রাষ্ট্রের স্বপ্ন জঙ্গিদের (Some Arakan and Bangladeshi militants target of Independent State)|publisher=Dainik Purbokone Bangladesh|accessdate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BD-2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.the-editor.net/bangla/index.php/2012-06-24-03-58-28/2012-06-11-07-22-53/3608-2012-09-08-09-12-10| title=নতুন রাষ্ট্র গঠনে মিয়ানমারের ১১ টি বিচ্ছিন্নতাবাদী গ্রুপ সংগঠিত হচ্ছে (11 secessionist group is organizing to create a new state in Burma)|publisher=The Editor, Bangladesh|accessdate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[US State Department]]’s 2009 international religious freedom report, the country's non-Buddhist populations were underestimated in the census. Islamic scholars claim the country's Muslim population at around 6 to 10% of the total populace.&lt;ref name="US Department of State"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127266.htm |title=Burma—International Religious Freedom Report 2009 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims are divided amongst [[Indian Muslims|Indians]], Indo-Burmese, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Panthay]]s and the Chinese [[Hui people]].

===Persecution===
{{Main article|Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar|Freedom of religion in Myanmar}}
The Muslim population faces religious persecution in Myanmar. Since independence, successive governments (both democratic and military) did not grant the citizenship of the Muslim [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] of Northern Rakhine (Arakan) and forbid missionary activities. The Rohingyas have been forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh or to Muslim states.

Their claim to citizenship has been marred by disputes with the ethnic Arakanese, who are mainly Buddhists. Aye Chan, a historian at the Kanda University, has written that as a consequence of acquiring arms from the British during World War II, Rohingyas tried to destroy the Arakanese villages instead of resisting the Japanese.&lt;ref name="aye-chan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64388.pdf | title=The Development of a Muslim Enclave in Arakan (Rakhine) State of Burma (Myanmar) | publisher=SOAS | year=2005 | accessdate=1 November 2011 | author=Aye Chan| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 1942, Rohingya Muslims from Northern Rakhine State killed around 20,000 Arakanese. In return, around 5,000 Muslims in the [[Minbya Township|Minbya]] and [[Mrauk-U Township|Mrohaung Townships]] were killed by Rakhine nationalists and [[Karenni]].&lt;ref name=kzt&gt;{{cite journal | title=Background of Rohingya Problem | author=Kyaw Zan Tha, MA |date=July 2008 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{main|Buddhism in Sri Lanka}}
[[File:Sri Lanka - 029 - Kandy Temple of the Tooth.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the sacred [[temple of the Tooth]] in [[Kandy]].]]
[[Theravada Buddhism]] is the major religion in Sri Lanka, with about 70% of the country's population as followers. [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Arahath Mahinda]] son of Indian Buddhist emperor [[Ashoka]], led the mission to Sri Lanka in 246 BCE where he converted the Sri Lankan king of that time [[Devanampiya Tissa]] to Buddhism. [[Sanghamitra|Arahath Sanghamitra]], daughter of King Ashoka, brought a sapling of the [[Bodhi tree]] in [[Buddha Gaya]] to Sri Lanka. She also established the Order of Nuns in Sri Lanka. The Sapling of the Bodhi tree, known as [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]] was planted in the Mahameghavana Park in [[Anuradhapura]] by the King Devanampiya Tissa.

From then on, the royal families had helped to encourage the spread of Buddhism, aiding Buddhist missionaries and building monasteries. Around 200 BCE, Buddhism became the official religion of Sri Lanka. The [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Sacred Tooth Relic]] was brought to Sri Lanka in 4th century by Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala. Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation. During the periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contacts with [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. Later on, however, Hindu and European colonial influences contributed to the decline of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The religion of Buddhism originally started in India, which is now the home to most of the Hinduism.

In the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as Upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Siamese Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by [[Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero]] during the reign of king [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy]]. By the mid-19th century, Buddhist leaders such as [[Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera]], [[Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera]], Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] started a successful national Buddhist movement for the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

==Hinduism==
[[File:Ravanan - King of Lanka.jpg|thumbnail|left|150px|Statue of [[Ravana]] at [[Koneswaram Temple]].]]
{{main|Hinduism in Sri Lanka}}

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] make up 12.6% of Sri Lanka's population.&lt;ref name="2011census"/&gt; The origins of the religion are linked to early Tamil immigration into the island since the Chola conquests in the 10th century or even earlier with the Saivite devotional movement that swept South India.

Hinduism in Sri Lanka is largely identified with the Tamil population and is concentrated in the Northern, Eastern and Central Provinces. The population declined since the 1981 census on account of Sri Lankan Tamil immigration overseas and the repatriation of 'Indian' Tamils.

A significant Hindu religious figure in Sri Lankan modern history is [[Yogaswami|Satguru Siva Yogaswami]] of [[Jaffna]]. One of the mystics of the 20th century, [[Yogaswami]] was the official [[satguru]] and counseling sage of Lanka's several million Tamil Hindu population. The [[Ramakrishna Mission]] is somewhat active in the [[Amparai]] and [[Batticaloa]] districts while the [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] school of philosophy of [[Shaivism]] sect of hinduism is prevalent in the North of Sri Lanka. Yogaswami belonged to the [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] and he was 161st head of the [[Nandinatha Sampradaya]]. The next person in the line of succession after Yogaswami was [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/monastery/lineage-philosophy/gurudeva|title=Shivaya subramaniam|last=|first=|date=|website=himalayanacademy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam ==
[[File:Gallemosque.JPG|thumb|123px|align="right"|A [[Mosque]] in [[Galle]].]]
{{main|Islam in Sri Lanka}}

By the 6th century, [[Arab]] traders had controlled much of the trade on the [[Indian Ocean]], including that of Sri Lanka's. Many of these traders settled down in Sri Lanka, encouraging the spread of [[Islam]]. However, when the Portuguese arrived at Sri Lanka during the 16th century, many of the Arabs' Muslim descendants were persecuted, thus forcing them to migrate to the Central Highlands and to the east coast.

In modern times, Muslims in Sri Lanka have the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department, which was established in the 1980s to prevent the continual isolation of the Muslim community from the rest of Sri Lanka. Today, about 9.7% of Sri Lankans adhere to Islam;&lt;ref name="2011census" /&gt; mostly from the [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moor]] and [[Sri Lankan Malays|Malay]] ethnic communities on the island.

==Christianity==
[[File:Negombo 03.jpg|thumb|200px|St. Sebastian's Church in [[Negombo]].]]
{{main|Christianity in Sri Lanka}}

According to [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions, Christianity introduced by [[Thomas (Apostle)|Thomas the Apostle]] in Sri Lanka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=OzEOKNPsv2EC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=Apostle+Thomas+arrived+in+Sri+Lanka&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u_f-sizHMB&amp;sig=1X7wPU-lxfkU9c1xN8SRnRx1b2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OOzuVNrwN4WXuASFj4DQBA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Apostle%20Thomas%20arrived%20in%20Sri%20Lanka&amp;f=false | title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary | publisher=William Carey Library | date=2004 | accessdate=26 February 2015 | author=Hattaway, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as well as [[India]]) during the 1st century. Legend has it small Christian settlements were recorded to have been established on Sri Lanka's coastline.{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} However, the population of Christians in Sri Lanka didn't dramatically increase until the arrival of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] missionaries during the 15th century. In the 17th century, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] took over Sri Lanka and Dutch missionaries were able to convert 21% of Sri Lanka's population to Christianity by 1622.

In 1796 the Dutch were displaced by the British and in 1802 Ceylon became a Crown colony. [[Anglican]] and other [[Protestant]] missionaries arrived at Sri Lanka during the early 19th century, when the British took control of Sri Lanka from the Dutch. Under British rule missionary work was undertaken by English societies: Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist, the CMS and SPG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O95-SriLankaChristianityin.html Sri Lanka, Christianity in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church] | 2000 | [[Elizabeth Livingstone|E. A. LIVINGSTONE]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Salvation Army]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are also present in Sri Lanka.

Even so, the percentage of Christians has slowly declined since the end of colonial rule from the height of 10% in 1891 to 7.61% at the latest census, the numbers were 302,000 in the former year and 1.552 million in the latter of a population of 20,650 million. By the 1980s, the population of Christians (mostly concentrated in the northwest of Sri Lanka and in the capital where they are 10% of the population). Of these Christians, about 85% are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s and the rest are Anglicans,Methodists and other Protestants.

{{Inca civilization}}
In the heterogeneous [[Inca Empire]], [[polytheistic]] religions were practiced. Some deities, such as [[Pachamama]] and [[Viracocha]], were known throughout the empire, while others were localised.

==Deities==
[[Image:Sol de Mayo-Bandera de Argentina.svg|'''Inti''' or [[Sun of May]] of the [[flag of Argentina]], 1818|right|thumb|x216px]]
Inca deities occupied the three realms:
*''[[Hanan Pacha|hanan pacha]]'', the celestial realm in the sky.
*''[[Ukhu Pacha|ukhu pacha]]'', the inner earth realm.
*''[[Kay Pacha|kay pacha]]'', the outer earth realm, where humans live.

=== Deities of the Official Pantheon ===
*[[File:Viracocha (porta do sol - detalhe).jpg|thumb|Viracocha depicted in the wall as a man]]'''[[Viracocha]]''':&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156911932|title=The history of the Incas|last=1532-1592.|first=Sarmiento de Gamboa, Pedro,|date=2007|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Bauer, Brian S., Smith-Oka, Vania, 1975-|isbn=9780292714137|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=156911932}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was typically seen as a white male human and known as the creator of humanity and everything else in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/708564500|title=Gods, goddesses, and mythology|date=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|others=Littleton, C. Scott.|isbn=0761475656|location=New York|oclc=708564500}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Inca Water Worship and Religion, it states, "He created humanity on an island in Lake Titicaca on the border between modern Peru and Bolivia and taught people how to live, assigning them tribal dress and customs and determining where they should live."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inca Water Worship and Religion|last=Gibaja Oviedo|first=Arminda M., et al.|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|year=2016|isbn=9780784414163|location=Reston, VA|pages=11–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this occurred, Viracocha gave control over humanity to lower gods then disappeared. When the Spaniards came to the Inca territory, the Inca thought they were god like because of their similarities in appearance with Viracocha.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''[[Inti]]:'''  Inti was one of the most important gods to the Inca people and known as the sun god. He is typically viewed as a boy from the Inca society and was also known as a golden disk with fire like rays coming and a face in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62805010|title=Incan mythology and other myths of the Andes|last=Greg.|first=Roza,|date=2008|publisher=Rosen Central|isbn=1404207392|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=62805010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca believed the sun was a key element for agriculture by protecting and helping with the growth of their crops.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The temple dedicated to Inti was the [[Coricancha]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (a.k.a. The Golden Enclosure), which was one of the most important temples for the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Inside Coricancha was a miniature field of corn and the corn was made out of gold. Annually, the emperor would "farm" this as a tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Viracocha did not start out as the top deity in Inca religion, Inti was the first original and most powerful god. The transition from Inti to Virachocha has a couple of theories including: 1. The [[Inca society]] and people developed intellectually and started to question Inti's power. They questioned why an all powerful god did the same thing everyday.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2. The society moved forward and they started going more towards monotheism (one god ruled over everything else, not that there was only one god). Since Viracocha was seen as a human, they saw this as being more powerful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Illapa (Inti-Illapa):''' The name of this god means thunder and controls things like weather, rain, and lightning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46449340|title=The Incas|last=N.,|first=D'Altroy, Terence|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1405116765|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=46449340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca valued this god because Illapa was in control of the weather and the growth of their crops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the Inca society saw the image of this deity as a man wearing a sling.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Every time that Illapa would use the sling it would create the thunder heard by the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''[[Mama Killa|Mamaquilla]] (Kilyamama'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''):''' The name of this god in the Inca language can be translated into Mother Moon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All of the Inca society recognized this deity as female and was also seen as a silver disk with a face in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was the wife of the deity Inti and was also in control of calendars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This god was in charge of calendars because of the moons cycle which the Inca could track.  All the temples that worshiped Mamaquilla were worked on by priestesses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''[[Pachamama]]:''' The name of this god translates to Earth Mother and is known as a female among the Inca society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Inca saw her as a protector of their crops/fields and a god of fertility to help their crops grow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Mamacocha:''' The meaning of this gods name from the Inca language is Mother of Lakes and is widely known as a female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The job of this deity is to keep the world strong and provide sources of water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Stella Deities:''' These are deities formed using constellations or other cosmology features and are mostly believed to be of animals or activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the book ''Inca Water Worship and Religion'', an example would be "Urcuchillay, which is known to western astronomers as Lira, [who] was thought to protect llamas and alpacas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Huacas'''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;''':'''  Anything, including people, places, and objects, in the world that the Inca believed had a supernatural spirit, were called Huacas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The size of the Huaca determined how much power it had. For example, mountains were considered some of the more powerful Huacas. The Inca worshiped and cared for them similar to the other deities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Household gods=== 
[[File:Camelid Conopa, 1470-1532, 36.683.jpg|thumb|Caullama conopa, 1470-1532]]
In addition to the communally worshiped deities, Incan families sometimes worshiped household gods via their representation as miniature figurines most commonly referred to as ''chancas'' or ''conopas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth Mills |authorlink= |title=Idolatry and Its Enemies: Colonial Andean Religion and Extirpation, 1640-1750 |year=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |chapter=Chancas and Conopas |pages=75–100 |quote= | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOo9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |isbn=9780691155487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conopa were often natural or carved stone objects that resembled crops or livestock, such as ''zarap conopa'' for [[maize]], ''papap conopa'' for potatoes and caullama for [[llamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew James Hamilton |authorlink= |title=Scale and the Incas |year=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |pages=60–63 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sC1KDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60 |isbn=9781400890194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pablo Joseph de Arriaga |translator=L.

==Origin==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Many ancient Andean peoples traced their origins to ancestral deities. Multiple clans could share similar ancestral origins. The Inca claimed descent from the Sun and the Moon, their Father and Mother. Many clans claimed descent from early proto-humans that emerged from local sites in nature called pacarinas.

The earliest ancestors of the Inca were known as Ayar, the first of which was [[Manco Cápac|Manco Capac]] or Ayar Manco. Inca mythology tells of his travels, in which he and the Ayar shaped and marked the land and introduced the cultivation of [[maize]].

==Religious expansion==
Religious traditions in the Andes tended to vary among different ayllus. While the Inca generally allowed or even incorporated local deities and heroes of the ayllus they conquered, they did bring their gods to those peoples by incorporating them in law such as required sacrifice. The Inca attempted to combine their deities with conquered ones in ways that raised the status of their own. One example of this is Pachamama, the goddess of Earth, who was worshiped long before the rise of the Inca. In the Inca mythology Pachamama having been integrated was placed below the Moon who the Inca believed ruled over all female gods.&lt;ref name=Steele2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=Paul Richar d|title=Handbook of World Mythology |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576073544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duality==
A theme in Inca mythology is the duality of the Cosmos. The realms were separated into the upper and lower realms, the ''hanan pacha'' and the ''ukhu pacha'' and ''urin pacha''. ''Hanan pacha'', the upper world, consisted of the deities of the sun, moon, stars, rainbow, and lightning while ''ukhu pacha'' and ''urin pacha'' were the realms of Pachamama, the earth mother, and the ancestors and heroes of the Inca or other ayllus. ''Kay pacha'', the realm of the outer earth, where humans resided was viewed as an intermediary realm between ''hanan pacha'' and ''ukhu pacha''. The realms were represented by the [[condor]] (upper world), [[Cougar|puma]] (outer earth) and [[snake]] (inner earth).

Sacred sites or things named ''[[Huaca|wak'a]]'' were spread around the Inca Empire. In Andean mythology a ''wak'a'' was a deific entity which resided in natural objects such as mountains, boulders, streams, battle fields, other meeting places, and any type of place that was connected with past Incan rulers. A ''wak'a'' could also be an inanimate object such as pottery which was believed to be a deity-carrying vessel. Spiritual leaders in a community would use [[prayer]] and offerings to communicate with a ''wak'a'' for advice or assistance. Human sacrifice was part of Incan rituals in which they usually [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|sacrificed a child]] (''[[qhapaq hucha]]'') or a slave. The Incan people thought it was an honor to die as an offering.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Archaeological remains confirm such human sacrificial practices, according to Reinhard and Ceruti: "Archaeological evidence found on distant mountain summits has established that the burial of offerings was a common practice among the Incas and that human sacrifice took place at several of the sites. The excellent preservation of the bodies and other material in the cold and dry environment of the high Andes provides revealing details about the rituals that were performed at these ceremonial complexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reinhard |first1=Johan |first2=Constanza |last2=Ceruti |title=Sacred Mountains, Ceremonial Sites, and Human Sacrifice Among the Incas |journal=Archaeoastronomy: The Journal of Astronomy in Culture |year=2005 |volume=19 |pages=2 |issn=0190-9940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination==
The Incas also used [[divination]]. Divination was used to inform people in the city of social events, predict battle outcomes, and ask for metaphysical intervention.

Divination was essential before taking any action.  Nearly every religious rite was accompanied by sacrifices.  These were usually maize beer, food or llamas, but were occasionally of virgins or children. &lt;ref&gt;Eerdman's Handbook to the World's Religions, 1982, Lion Publishing, Herts, England, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

Divination was an important part of Inca religion, as reflected in the following quote:
{{quote|The native elements are more obvious in the case of the sunrise divination. Apachetas, [[coca]] and the sun were major elements in pre-Conquest religion, and divination, the worship of sacred mountains and the bringing retribution against enemies were important ritual practices.&lt;ref name=Rowe1946&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of South American Indians Vol. 2 The Andean Civilizations |year=1946 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington |pages=183–330 |last=Rowe |first=John H. |editor=Julian H. Steward |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ANTH/emeritus/rowe/pub/rowe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|292–314}}}}

== Mummification ==
The rulers of the Inca empire, such as the last united Inca ruler [[Huayna Capac]], were often mummified upon the time of their death, allowing for their bodies to be worshipped within the palaces.These worshipping events were intercepted by the Spaniards under Juan Polo de Ondegardo y Zárate, who was newly appointed as the Chief Magistrate of [[Cuzco]] in 1559, when it was under Spanish control. Ondegardo conducted a massive effort to prevent the [[Inca]] from committing their  “idolatrous sins”, mainly by locating the mummified bodies of late Inca kings and sending them to the viceroy in [[Lima]].&lt;ref name="Hospital"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Brian S.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Antonio C.|date=2007|title=The Hospital of San Andrés (Lima, Peru) and the Search for the Royal Mummies of the Incas|journal=Fieldiana Anthropology|volume=39|pages=1–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained in a hospital for around 80 years before their whereabouts became unknown.The Inca used to mummify their kings and several times a year they would be aligned in accordance to when they chronologically ruled in Cuzco’s plaza for the public to pay their respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peruvian Traditions|last1=Palma|first1=Ricardo|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other parts of the year, the mummies were returned to the Cuzco palaces and were worshipped privately by groups of visitors. [[Francisco Pizarro]] stated that “It was customary for the dead to visit one another, and they held great dances and debaucheries, and sometimes the dead went to the house of the living, and sometimes the living came to the house of the dead”.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt; The kings were thought to have been able to speak back to the worshippers through the use of oracles, and even gave advice to the protection and ruling of the land. The ruling Inca was expected to seek advice from the mummies of his ancestors for important issues. Not all Inca mummies were glorified, however, as in one case Topa Inca Yupanqui’s mummified body was torched and his bloodline all killed as they sided with [[Huascar]] in the civil war.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt;

Upon the arrival of the Spanish, the [[Inca]] started to hide the bodies of the kings and become more secretive with their worship, as stated by [[Juan de Betanzos]]. After being appointed, Polo do Ondegardo and his men found most of the mummified kings and took their bodies along with other ritualistic items such as their huaques, or their statues. A popular thought is that Ondegardo had the bodies buried in or around [[Cuzco]] in secret so that they would not be uncovered and worshipped again. Garcilaso de la Vega visited Ondegardo’s house and was shown an assembly of embalmed kings and attested to the degree of their preservation: “The bodies were perfectly preserved without the loss of hair of the head or brow or an eyelash. They were dressed as if they had been in life, with Ilautus (royal headbands) on their heads… their hands were crossed across their breast.”. The mummies were afterwards sent to the viceroy for him to see them and then afterwards they were brought back to Cuzco and thought to be secretly buried.The viceroy stored the mummies in the Hospital of San Andres in [[Lima]] because he was “a major benefactor of it”. Since the hospital was solely for the Spanish residents, they were likely on display for the citizens to view, away from the natives.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt;

The Inca calendar had 12 months of 30 days, with each month having its own festival, and a five-day feast at the end, before the new year began. The Incan year started in December, and began with Qhapaq Raymi, the magnificent festival.&lt;ref name=Kendall1989&gt;{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=Ann |title=Everyday life of the Incas |year=1989 |publisher=Dorset Press |location=New York |isbn=9780880293501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SwaminarayanNZ.jpg|left|thumb|450px| [http://www.swaminarayan.info/auckland Shree Swaminarayan Temple, Auckland, New Zealand]]] --&gt;

Auckland has the highest population density of people of Chinese and Indian cultures and a number of new Hindu temples were opened in recent years.

An Asia New Zealand Foundation report, "Diverse Auckland: The Face of New Zealand in the 21st Century", written by [[University of Auckland]]'s Dr Wardlow Friesen, says the city will continue to absorb more migrants than the rest of the country.

In his report Dr. Friesen confirms: "On a physical level, the evidence of the emergence of diverse religious practices of the Asian population of Auckland is dramatic."  &lt;ref&gt;

Recently completed Shri Swaminarayan Temple in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] has become a beacon within all [[Sanatana Dharma|Sanatan Dharmic]] temples purely because of the amount of faith that has been put in God before and during the project. Thousands of hours of service have gone into individually hand carving the walls and ceiling of this temple. Over 5 years, careful planning and implementing took place by the local community of Papatoetoe, Auckland to ensure a new home is made for [[Swaminarayan]]. Designing, engineering and construction had gone beyond New Zealand to [[Hong Kong]], [[India]] and [[Europe]] to ensure results. Intricate wood carvings as per traditional [[Indian architecture]], to grand purpose built moldings, pillars and [[Shikhars]] have all been carefully crafted by expert tradesmen from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminarayan.info/Mandirs/mandirdetails.asp?MandirID=118 Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Auckland]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Kantilal Patel and his wife, Mrs Ranjna Patel, two people who were involved in the building of this temple, have been awarded the Queen’s Service Medal (QSM) for their community service.&lt;ref name = "HPTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two lives dedicated to helping others |url=http://www.times.co.nz/cms/news/2009/01/two_lives_dedicated_to_helping_others.php|publisher=Howick and Pakuranga Times|date= 2009-01-08|accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qazi]] '''Maulana Syed Bande Ali Husaini''' (1816–1871) was the last Qazi-ul-Quzaat "Islamic Chief Justice" of the Islamic Judiciary System in [[Banaras]], India.

The Islamic judiciary system in Banaras was established by the Muslim rulers of India and  the ancestors of Qazi Bande Ali Husaini were holding the post of Qazi-ul-Quzat (Islamic Chief Justice) since the reign of [[Mughal emperor]] King [[Aurangzeb]] (around 1659/1661). It lasted for more than two centuries till the [[British Empire]] rule (around 1867/1870) during the reign of British Queen Alexandrina Victoria the [[Empress of India]]. Maulana Husaini was awarded the title of [[Khan Bahadur]] by the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] and all his works were appreciated by her.

The First Qazi-ul-Quzaat of this system was his forefather Qazi Maulana Syed Inayatullah Husaini (1613–1685), who was the class mate of King Aurangzeb and their tutor was a prominent religious scholar of that time known as Mulla Jeewan who was the Royal Ataleeq of [[Mughal Empire]]. [[Qazi Syed Bande Ali]] had notable efforts towards the establishment of the First Shia Religious Seminary of [[Indian sub-continent]] named [[Jamia-e-Imania]] [[Banaras]] which was founded on his proposal by a visionary landlord of that time Moulvi Khursheed Ali Khan in 1866/1283 (A.H.) and he was the one who provided an escape of land in the city area for this purpose and the construction work of its premises was completed under his supervision in 1870/1287 (A.H.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10366">'''''The Cartoons that Shook the World''''' is a 2009 book by [[Brandeis University]] professor [[Jytte Klausen]] about the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. Klausen contends that the controversy was deliberately stoked up by people with vested interests on all sides, and argues against the view that it was based on a cultural misunderstanding about the [[depictions of Muhammad|depiction of Muhammad]]. The book itself caused controversy before its publication when Yale University Press removed all images from the book, including the controversial cartoons themselves and some other images of Muhammad.

==Publishing history==

The book was scheduled to be published in November 2009 by [[Yale University Press]]. Prior to publication, officials at the Press decided to remove all images of [[Muhammad]] from the forthcoming book, including all of the controversial cartoons and a number of historical images of Muhammad from both Muslim and non-Muslim sources, including a 19th-century engraving by [[Gustave Doré]] showing Muhammad being tormented in a scene from Dante's Inferno&lt;ref&gt;Yale U. Press's Attempt to Avoid Risk Has Risks of Its Own, by Jennifer Howard, The Chronicle of Higher Education, August 26, 2009, http://chronicle.com/article/Hot-Type-Yale-U-Presss/48177/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Yale Press Bans Images of Muhammad in New Book,"  Patricia Cohen, New York Times, Aug. 13, 2009, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/books/13book.html?_r=1]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'', the story first broke in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on Thursday, August 13, 2009.&lt;ref name="yaledailynews.com"&gt;Yale Press panned for nixing cartoons of Muhammad, Esther Zuckerman, Yale Daily News, August 16, 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/29111 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818184146/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/29111 |archivedate=2009-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Press defended its decision, releasing a statement&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/KlausenStatement.asp Official Statement by Yale University Press, August 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that the University had consulted  counterterrorism officials, the highest-level Muslim official at the United Nations, foreign ambassadors from Muslim countries, and Islamic Studies scholars, and that they had "all" voiced serious fears about provoking more violence.&lt;ref name="yaledailynews.com"/&gt;

[[Sheila Blair]], Calderwood Professor of Fine Arts at [[Boston College]] and an expert on the art of the Islamic world was one of the authorities consulted by the Yale University Press.  She told ''[[The Guardian]] ''that she  had "strongly urged" the Press to publish the images since, "To deny that such images were made is to distort the historical record and to bow to the biased view of some modern zealots who would deny that others at other times and places perceived and illustrated Muhammad in different ways."&lt;ref&gt;Publisher Bans Images of Muhammad in New Book [incl. Jytte Klausen]
Yale University Press has ditched plans to reprint the Danish cartoons and other caricatures in a study of the controversy,  Alison Flood, [[The Guardian]], Aug. 14, 2009,[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/14/publisher-bans-images-muhammad]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boston College]] professor Jonathan Laurence,  co-author of ''Integrating Islam: Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France'', has said that he told the Press that  it should reproduce the original ''Jyllands-Posten'' newspaper page that included the cartoon.  "I was consulted by the press about the decision whether or not to publish. I suggested that they publish the newspaper page in its entirety as documentary evidence of the episode being discussed," he told ''[[The Times]]''. "I actually know another professor who was also consulted and also told them to go ahead, but do it in a responsible manner."&lt;ref&gt;August 18, 2009, Yale University Press accused of cowardice over Muhammad cartoons, James Bone, The Times,  [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6799684.ece]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cary Nelson]], the president of the [[American Association of University Professors]] issued a statement describing  the decision not to publish the illustrations as [[prior restraint]]. "What is to stop publishers from suppressing an author's words if it appears they may offend religious fundamentalists or groups threatening violence?" he said. "We deplore this decision and its potential consequences." &lt;ref name="yaledailynews.com"/&gt;  Nelson accused the Press of acceding  to the "anticipated demands" of "terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;Academic Freedom Abridged at Yale Press, by Cary Nelson, American Association of University Professors, August 13, 2009

According to ''[[The Bookseller]]'', the Press has come under "heavy criticism" for its decision to [[Censorship|censor]] the illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/94389-criticism-grows-over-yale-muhammad-censorship.html Criticism grows over Yale Muhammad censorship, The Bookseller] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820040400/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/94389-criticism-grows-over-yale-muhammad-censorship.html |date=2009-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] took issue with both the decision to expunge the cartoons and with the statement by the director of the Press, [[John Donatich]], who told the ''New York Times'' that while he has "never blinked" before in the face of controversy,  "when it came between that and blood on my hands, there was no question."  Hitchens compared this line of reasoning to the reasoning of people who "argue that women who won't wear the veil have 'provoked' those who rape or disfigure them … and now Yale has adopted that 'logic' as its own."  Concluding, "What a cause of shame that the campus of [[Nathan Hale]] should have pre-emptively run up the white flag and then cringingly taken the blood guilt of potential assassins and tyrants upon itself."&lt;ref&gt;Yale Surrenders; Why did Yale University Press remove images of Mohammed from a book about the Danish cartoons?, By Christopher Hitchens
 Aug. 17, 2009, Slate [http://www.slate.com/id/2225504/?wpisrc=eDialog]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Kimball]], Professor Klausen was informed of the decision to expunge the cartoons and other images of Muhammad from the book at a meeting in Boston attended by John Donatich, director of Yale University Press,   [[Linda Lorimer]], Vice President and Secretary of [[Yale University]], and [[Marcia Inhorn]], professor of Anthropology and chairman of the Council on Middle East Studies at Yale.&lt;ref&gt;Villain or Fall Guy?

According to Professor Klausen, "My book is an academic book with footnotes and the notion that it would set off civil war in Nigeria is laughable," she added that her book has become part of "a battle over the limits of freedom of speech".&lt;ref&gt;August 18, 2009, Yale University Press accused of cowardice over Muhammad cartoons, James Bone, Times of London,  [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6799684.ece]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication of the expunged images==

In November, 2009, [[Voltaire Press]] published all of the images expunged by Yale University in a book entitled ''[[Muhammad: The "Banned" Images]]'' by Professor [[Gary Hull]] of [[Duke University]].   According to Hull, the new publication is "a 'picture book' – or errata to the [[bowdlerized]] version of Klausen's book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emailwire.com/release/29470-Danish-Cartoons-Illustrated-in-New-Book-of-Images-of-Muhammad--Just-as-FBI-Arrests-Two-for-Conspiring-to-Kill-the-Cartoons-Publisher-.html |title=Danish Cartoons Illustrated in New Book of Images of Muhammad - Just as FBI Arrests Two for Conspiring to Kill the Cartoons' Publisher |date=November 9, 2009 |website=emailwire.com |archive-url=http://archive.is/20120731103723/http://www.emailwire.com/release/29470-Danish-Cartoons-Illustrated-in-New-Book-of-Images-of-Muhammad--Just-as-FBI-Arrests-Two-for-Conspiring-to-Kill-the-Cartoons-Publisher-.html |archive-date=2012-07-31 |access-date=2018-11-07 |deadurl=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesis==
According to the publisher,

{{quote|Jytte Klausen interviewed politicians in the Middle East, Muslim leaders in Europe, the Danish editors and cartoonists, and the Danish imam who started the controversy. Following the winding trail of protests across the world, she deconstructs the arguments and motives that drove the escalation of the increasingly globalized conflict. She concludes that the Muslim reaction to the cartoons was not—as was commonly assumed—a spontaneous emotional reaction arising out of the clash of Western and Islamic civilizations. Rather it was orchestrated, first by those with vested interests in elections in Denmark and Egypt, and later by Islamic extremists seeking to destabilize governments in Pakistan, Lebanon, Libya, and Nigeria. Klausen shows how the cartoon crisis was, therefore, ultimately a political conflict rather than a colossal cultural misunderstanding.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klausen|first=Jytte|title=The Cartoons That Shook the World|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300124729|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Image:Sibilla Tiburtina Chiesa S Giovanni Evangelista Tivoli.jpg|thumb|right|The Tiburtine Sibyl, fresco in the Church of [[St. John the Evangelist]] at [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], 1483.]]

The '''Tiburtine Sibyl''' or '''Albunea'''&lt;ref&gt;Arianna Pascucci, L'iconografia medievale della Sibilla Tiburtina, Tivoli, 2011 [https://www.academia.edu/9789364/Liconografia_medievale_della_Sibilla_Tiburtina_di_Arianna_Pascucci_Tivoli_2011]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[sibyl]], whose seat was the ancient [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] town of [[Tibur]] (modern [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]]). 

The mythic meeting of [[Cæsar Augustus]] with the Sibyl, of whom he inquired whether he should be worshiped as a god, was a favored [[wiktionary:motif|motif]] of Christian artists{{who|date=September 2016}}. Whether the sibyl in question was the [[Etruscan Sibyl]] of Tibur or the [[Cumaean Sibyl|Greek Sibyl]] of [[Cumæ]] is not always clear. The Christian author [[Lactantius]] identified the sibyl in question as the Tiburtine sibyl. He gave a circumstantial account of the pagan sibyls that is useful mostly as a guide to their identifications, as seen by 4th century Christians{{who|date=September 2016}}: 
{{cquote|The Tiburtine Sibyl, by name Albunea, is worshiped at Tibur as a goddess, near the banks of the [[Anio River|Anio]], in which stream her image is said to have been found, holding a book in her hand. Her [[oracle|oracular]] responses the Senate transferred into the capitol.}}
::(''Divine Institutes'' I.vi)

==The prophecy of the Tiburtine Sibyl==
An apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} exists among the [[Sibylline Oracles]], which was attributed to the Tiburtine Sibyl. Its earliest version may date from the fourth century, but in the form that it survives today it was written in the early eleventh century, and has been influenced by the [[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]. &lt;ref&gt;C. Bonura, ‘When Did the Legend of the Last Emperor Originate? A New Look at the Textual Relationship between the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Tiburtine Sibyl’, Viator 47, 3 (2016), 47-100. The text is edited in E. Sackur, ''Sibyllinische Texte und Forschungen'' (Halle, 1898) p 177ff; "it stands apart from the remaining Sibylline literature in holding that there is a total of nine ages, and although it draws upon ideas of considerable antiquity and apparently possesses a core dating from the fourth century A.D., much of its material is medieval."  M. J. McGann, "Juvenal's Ninth Age (13, 28ff.)" ''Hermes'' '''96'''.3 (1968:509-514)  p.513 note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first version in Latin dates from the tenth century and may have come from Lombardy, though it was quickly picked up (and rewritten) by the [[Salian dynasty]] and the [[Hohenstaufen]]s. It proved a useful rhetorical tool, valuable for many a ruler; the lists it contained of emperors and kings were revised to fit the circumstances, and hundreds of versions remain from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800–1229|first=Anne A.|last=Latowsky|publisher=Cornell UP|year=2013|isbn=9780801451485|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its conclusion purports to prophesy the advent in the world's ninth age of a [[final Emperor]] vanquishing the foes of Christianity:
{{quote|Then will arise a king of the Greeks whose name is Constans. He will be king of the Romans and the Greeks. He will be tall of stature, of handsome appearance with shining face, and well put together in all parts of his body...}}

This Emperor's reign is characterized by great wealth, victory over the foes of Christianity, an end of paganism and the conversion of the Jews. The Emperor having vanquished [[Gog and Magog]], 
{{quote|After this he will come to Jerusalem, and having put off the diadem from his head and laid aside the whole imperial garb, he will hand over the empire of the Christians to God the Father and to Jesus Christ his Son.}} 

In doing so, he will give way to the [[Antichrist]]:
{{quote|At that time the Prince of Iniquity who will be called Antichrist will arise from the [[tribe of Dan]]. He will be the [[Son of Perdition]], the head of pride, the master of error, the fullness of malice who will overturn the world and do wonders and great signs through dissimulation. He will delude many by magic art so that fire will seem to come down from heaven. ... When the [[Roman Empire]] shall have ceased, then the Antichrist will be openly revealed and will sit in the House of the Lord in Jerusalem.}}

The prophecy relates that Antichrist would be opposed by the [[Two Witnesses]] from the [[Book of Revelation]], identified with [[Elijah]] and [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]]; after having killed the witnesses and started a final persecution of the Christians, 
{{quote|the Antichrist will be slain by the power of God through [[Michael the Archangel]] on the [[Mount of Olives]].}}

==Frescoes at the Villa d'Este==
[[Ippolito II d'Este]] rebuilt the [[Villa d'Este]] at Tibur, the modern [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], from 1550 onward, and commissioned elaborate fresco murals in the Villa that celebrate the Tiburtine Sibyl, as prophesying the birth of Christ to the classical world.

'''Tichel''' ([[Yiddish]] טיכל ''tikhl''), also called a ''mitpachat'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מִטפַּחַת ''miṭpaḥat''), is the [[Yiddish]] word for the [[headscarf]] worn by many married [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] women in compliance with the code of modesty known as ''[[tzniut]]'', which requires married women to cover their hair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&amp;pg=PA519&amp;lpg=PA519&amp;dq=tichel+meaning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vKoWWuLJwa&amp;sig=gyDfTra2fx-4QZFdk6t3syHHKfs&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjiIThrfrOAhUBxxQKHdycAT44ChDoAQhdMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=tichel%20meaning&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Judaism: Tichel]&lt;/ref&gt; Tichels can range from a simple plain color cotton kerchief tied in the back to elaborate head coverings using multiple fabrics and tying techniques.
==Etymology==
The Yiddish word ''tichel'' is the [[diminutive]] of ''tuch'' ("cloth"). Compare German ''Tuch'' ("cloth"), and the corresponding [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] diminutive ''Tiachal, Tücherl'' ("small piece of cloth").

==Background==
After the wedding ceremony, Orthodox Jews believe that a woman should only show her hair to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodox-jews.com/orthodox-jewish-women.html#axzz4JTIBu1gS All about Orthodox Jewish women]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Mishnah]] in [[Ketuboth]] (7:6), hair covering is not an obligation of biblical origin. It discusses behaviors that are grounds for divorce such as, "appearing in public with loose hair, weaving in the marketplace, and talking to any man" and calls these violations of ''Dat Yehudit'', which means Jewish rule, as opposed to ''Dat Moshe'', Mosaic rule. However, the [[Talmud]] on this Mishna explains that if the hair is completely uncovered in public, this would indeed be a violation of "Dat Moshe", and the Mishna is referring to one who cover her hair with a netlike covering where hair is visible through the holes, as in this case the Biblical requirement is met, but not the "Dat Yehudit".&lt;ref&gt;Kesubot 72a-72b&lt;/ref&gt;. This categorization suggests that hair covering is not an absolute obligation originating from Moses at Sinai, but rather is a standard of modesty that was defined by the Jewish community. In [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] 24a), the rabbis define hair as sexually erotic (''ervah''), and prohibit men from praying in sight of a woman's hair. The rabbis base this estimation on a biblical verse: "Your hair is like a flock of goats" (Song of Songs 4:1), suggesting that this praise reflects the sensual nature of hair.

A '''toli''' is a round, ritual [[mirror]] used in [[Shamanism]] in some parts of [[Mongolia]] and in [[Buryatia|the Republic of Buryatia]].{{sfn|DeMello|2012|p=221}}{{sfn | Edson | 2009 | p=135}}{{sfn | Hoppál | 2000 | p=74}}{{sfn | Tedlock | 2005 | p=48}} The mirror, ornamented on one side and polished on the other, may be made of [[bronze]], [[brass]] or [[copper]].{{sfn | Edson | 2009 | pp=42, 135}}{{sfn | Tedlock | 2005 | p=48}}

Toli are traditionally worn as part of a shaman's attire around the shaman's neck, or in quantity on the shaman's [[kaftan]] or [[apron]] - often called their armour as these pieces of ritual clothing help to protect the shaman from hostile spirit attack. Toli  help ward off harmful or attacking [[evil spirit|spirit]]s in their own right, and also can be thought of as an object which signifies  the shaman's authority or role.{{sfn|DeMello|2012|p=221}}{{sfn | Edson | 2009 | pp=77, 135}}{{sfn | Tedlock | 2005 | p=48}}

Toils have additional purposes as well, for example, amongst the [[Daur people]] and all the other shamanistic groups who use them, they are used for a variety of practices, including to purifying and empowering water or vodka, collecting and trapping hostile spirits, and providing a home for helper spirits. They also act as vessels for spiritual power - called 'wind horse' in Mongolia - which is the shaman's power.  They can also collect and store the power of blessings, or power given from the sun, moon, stars or other parts of Creation, all of which can be given to a sick person, or which can be added to the shaman's own power. 

[[Walther Heissig]], describing shamans and their incantations in [[Hure Banner]] in the 1940s, remarks that one shamaness indicated that the toli contained "the white horses of the shamans"; the mirror itself was seen as a vehicle for the shamans.{{sfn | Heissig| 1944 | p=45-46}}

Toli may be used in different sizes; among the Daur, the front and back of the shaman's costume was covered with small toli placed like overlapping scales while the front might also feature eight large mirrors and one medium-sized mirror to protect the heart, the ''neker-toli'';{{sfn | Edson | 2009 | p=135}} according to Heissig, in Hure Banner shamans wore nine mirrors, nine being a particularly meaningful number in Mongolian religion and mythology.{{sfn | Heissig| 1944 | p=45}} The neker-toli might be plated in [[nickel]].{{sfn | Edson | 2009 | p=117}} The number of toli collected by the Daur shaman was an indicator of his or her level of power.{{sfn | Edson | 2009 | p=135}}
