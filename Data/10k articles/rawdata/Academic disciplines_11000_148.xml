'''Aldo Rossi''' (3 May 1931 – 4 September 1997) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[designer]] who achieved international recognition in four distinct areas: architectural theory, drawing and design and also product design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Germano |last=Celant |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Diane |last2=Ghirardo |title=Aldo Rossi: Drawings |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-6130-143-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Italian to receive the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker Prize for Architecture - [http://www.pritzkerprize.com/about/purpose chriteria]&lt;/ref&gt; for architecture.

==Early life==

He was born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  After early education by the [[Somaschi Fathers|Somascan Religious Order]] and then at [[:it:Collegio arcivescovile Alessandro Volta|Alessandro Volta College]] in [[Lecco]], in 1949 he went to the school of architecture at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]].  His thesis advisor was [[:it:Piero Portaluppi|Piero Portaluppi]] and he  graduated in 1959.

In 1955 he had started writing for, and from 1959 was one of the editors of, the architectural magazine [[Casabella|Casabella-Continuità]], with editor in chief [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]. Rossi left in 1964, when the chief editorship went to Gian Antonio Bernasconi. Rossi went on to work for [[:it:Società (rivista)|Società magazine]] and Il_contemporaneo, making him one of the most active participants in the fervent cultural debate of the time.

His early articles cover architects such as [[Alessandro Antonelli]],  [[:it:Mario Ridolfi|Mario Ridolfi]], [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Emil Kaufmann]] and much of this material became part of his second book, ''Scritti scelti sull'architettura e la città 1956-1972'' (''Selected writings on architecture and the city from 1956 to 1972''). He married the Swiss actress Sonia Gessner, who introduced him to the world of film and theater. Culture and his family became central to his life. His son Fausto was active in movie-making both in front of and behind the camera and his daughter Vera was involved with theatre.

==Career==

He began his professional career at the studio of [[Ignazio Gardella]] in 1956, moving on to the studio of [[Marco Zanuso]]. In 1963 also he began teaching, firstly as an assistant to [[:it:Ludovico Quaroni|Ludovico Quaroni]] (1963) at the school of urban planning in [[Arezzo]], then to [[Carlo Aymonino]] at the [[Università Iuav di Venezia|Institute of Architecture in Venice]]. In 1965 he was appointed lecturer at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] and the following year he published ''The architecture of the city'' which soon became a classic of architectural literature.

His professional career, initially dedicated to architectural theory and small building work took a huge leap forward when [[Carlo Aymonino|Aymonino]] allowed Rossi to design part of the [[Monte Amiata Housing|Monte Amiata complex]] in the [[Gallaratese|Gallaratese quarter]] of Milan. In 1971 he won the design competition for the extension of the San Cataldo Cemetery in [[Modena]], which made him internationally famous.

After suspension from teaching in Italy in those politically troubled times, he moved to [[ETH Zurich]], occupying the chair in architectural design from 1971 to 1975.

In 1973 he was director of the International Architecture Section at the [[:it:XV Triennale di Milano|XV Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture]], where he presented, among others, his student [[Arduino Cantafora]].  Rossi's design ideas for the exhibition are explained in the International Architecture Catalogue and in a 16mm documentary ''Ornament and crime'' directed by Luigi Durissi and produced along with Gianni Braghieri and Franco Raggi.  In 1975, Rossi returned to the teaching profession in Italy, teaching architectural composition in Venice.

In 1979 he was made a member of the prestigious [[Accademia di San Luca|Academy of Saint Luke]]. Meanwhile, there was international interest in his skills.  He taught at several universities in the United States, including [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca (New York State).  At Cornell he participated in the ''Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies'' joint venture with New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], travelling to China and Hong Kong and attending conferences in South America.

In 1981 he published his autobiography, ''A scientific autobiography''. In this work the author, "in discrete disorder", brings back memories, objects, places, forms, literature notes, quotes, and insights and tries to "... go over things or impressions, describe, or look for ways to describe."  In the same year he won first prize at the international competition for the design of an apartment block on the corner of Kochstraße and Wilhelmstraße in central [[Berlin]].

In 1984 together with [[Ignazio Gardella]] and [[Fabio Reinhart]], he won the competition for the renovation of the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] in [[Genoa]], which was not fully completed until 1991. In 1985 and 1986 Rossi was director of the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|3rd (respectively 4th) International Architecture Exhibition]] at the [[Venice Biennale]] including further away display spaces such as Villa Farsetti in [[Santa Maria di Sala]].

In 1987 he won two international competitions: one for a site at the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, the other for the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] in Berlin, which was never brought to fruition. In 1989 he continued product design work for Unifor (now part of [[:it:Molteni&amp;C|Molteni Furniture]]) and [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]]. His espresso maker ''La Cupola'', designed for Alessi came out in 1988.

In 1990 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name=Goldberger1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Aldo Rossi: Sentiment For The Unsentimental|work=New York Times|date=22 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Fukuoka]] in Japan honoured him for his work on the hotel complex ''The Palace'' and he won the 1991 Thomas Jefferson Medal in Public Architecture from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. These prestigious awards were followed by exhibitions at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Beurs van Berlage]] in Amsterdam, the [[Berlinische Galerie]] in Berlin and the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Ghent, Belgium.

In 1996 he became an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the following year he received their special cultural award in architecture and design.  He died in Milan on 4 September 1997, following a car accident. Posthumously he received the ''[[Torre Guinigi]]'' prize for his contribution to urban studies and the ''Seaside Prize'' of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150509102932/http://seasideinstitute.org/what-we-do/ Seaside Institute], Florida, where he had built a detached family home in 1995.

On appeal his proposals won the 1999 competition for the restoration of the [[Teatro La Fenice]], Venice and it reopened in 2004.  In 1999 the Faculty of Architecture of the [[University of Bologna]], based in [[Cesena]], was named after him.

==Work==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stainless steel kettle "Il Conico" (designed by Aldo Rossi).png|thumb|200px|left|Stainless steel kettle ''Il Conico'', 1986]] --&gt;
[[File:Aldo Rossi La Cupola Alessi Coffee Maker Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|Aldo Rossi La Cupola Espresso Maker 1988, produced by Alessi]]
His earliest works of the 1960s were mostly theoretical and displayed a simultaneous influence of 1920s [[Italian modernism]] (''see [[Giuseppe Terragni]]''), classicist influences of Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the reflections of the painter [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. A trip to the [[Soviet Union]] to study [[Stalinist architecture]] also left a marked impression.

In his writings Rossi criticized the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argued that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our "collective memory"), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city. Inspired by the persistence of Europe's ancient cities, Rossi strove to create similar structures immune to obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aldo Rossi, Modena Cemetery, Model, c.1983.jpg.png|thumb|right|200px|Model of San Cataldo Cemetery, [[Modena]], Italy, 1971-]]  --&gt;
He became extremely influential in the late 1970s and 1980s as his body of built work expanded and for his theories promoted in his books ''[[The Architecture of the City]]'' (''L'architettura della città'', 1966) and ''A Scientific Autobiography'' (''Autobiografia scientifica'', 1981).The largest of Rossi's projects in terms of scale was the San Cataldo Cemetery, in [[Modena]], Italy, which began in 1971 but is yet to be completed. Rossi referred to it as a "city of the dead".

The distinctive independence of his buildings is reflected in the micro-architectures of the products designed by Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buerdek |first=Bernhard E. |year=2005 |title=Design: History, theory and practice of product design |url= |location=Basel, Switzerland |publisher=Birkhauser-Publishers for Architecture |isbn=978-3-764-37029-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Rossi designed stainless steel [[French press|cafetières]] and other products for [[Alessi (company)|Alessi]], [[Pirelli]], and others.

[[File:Bonnefanten2013-04.jpg|thumb|200px|Central staircase [[Bonnefanten Museum]], [[Maastricht]]]]

==Exhibits==

For the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1979 Rossi designed a floating ''Teatro del Mondo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archidose.blogspot.com/1999/02/teatro-del-mondo.html |title=Teatro del Mondo |date=8 February 1999 |access-date=29 October 2018 |work=A Daily Dose of Architecture |first=John |last=Hill |publisher=[[Blogspot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seated 250 people. For the Venice Biennale in 1984, he designed a triumphal arch at the entrance to the exhibition site. In 2006 two [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] based on an original 1989 design by Aldo Rossi were erected in front of the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht by the Delft architectural firm Ufo Architecten.

The chalcolithic [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]], in Eastern Europe, left behind thousands of [[Human settlement|settlement]] ruins, circa 6000 to 3500 BC, containing a wealth of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] attesting to their [[Archaeological culture|cultural]] and [[Assemblage (archaeology)|technological]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mallory"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth |year=1989 |publisher= Thames and Hudson |location= London |isbn=0-500-05052-X |oclc= 246601873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction techniques==
{{See also|Neolithic architecture}}
The houses of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements were constructed in several general ways:
* Wattle and daub homes.
* Log homes, called ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|площадки}} ''ploshchadki'').
* Semi-underground homes called [[Bordei]].
Some Cucuteni-Trypillia homes were two storeys tall, and evidence shows that the members of this culture sometimes decorated the outsides of their homes with many of the same complex red-ochre swirling designs that are to be found on their pottery. Most houses had thatched roofs and wooden floors covered with clay.
Archaeologists have identified two types of [[Timber framing|house framing]] found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites. One type, somewhat resembling the [[Post and lintel|post and beam]] style, used evenly distributed fork-shaped log pillars that were partially sunk vertically into the ground so that the fork was located at the top and supported the roof beams above. The other type of framing used vertical beams measuring {{cvt|15|–|20|cm|in|disp=x|in diameter (|)}}, or greater, which rested on horizontal ground-sill foundational timbers that were in turn fixed in place on top of the soil.

Most of the walls were built in the [[Wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] style. The construction of these houses first started by erecting the framework of larger timbers in place [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/123.ridicare.casa.stadiul.1.poz.2.jpg (photo 1)], which would take the weight of the structure, and then the space between these timbers would be filled in with a "wattle" made of pliable smaller branches and vines woven together to form a thin twiggy [[Latticework|latticed]] net which was then affixed to the sturdy timbers [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/116.peretele.c.impletitura.orizontala.jpg (photo 2)]. Onto this wattle framework the "daub" would be applied made of mostly dampened clay soil although sometimes mixed with small bits of straw and/or animal dung to help keep its structural integrity ([http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/145.jpg photo 3]). The daub had to be applied with some force against the wattle in order for it to partially push through the twiggy framework, to which it would stick. Sometimes there would only be a single layer of wattle, and at other times two wattle layers would be used; one for the interior and another for the exterior of the wall. Daub was applied on both sides of the wall, inside and out [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/casa.jpg (photo 4)], creating a finished wall that was usually about {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick. Once applied it was smoothed before drying to create an air- and water-tight barrier against the elements [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/last.jpg (photo 5)]. After the daub was fully dried, it was usually painted with [[Lime plaster|lime]] to prevent infestations of [[Pest (organism)|pests]].(''note: the photographic examples used in this paragraph were taken from the web page "Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house", hosted by The Archaeological Park Cucuteni, see "External Links" at bottom of this article'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house |publisher=The Archaeological Park Cucuteni |url= http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |language=English, Romanian |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628222111/http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the walls were made of [[Log home|horizontally laid timbers]] (similar to log homes) that were then covered with clay daub. Some examples have been found where the horizontal timbers were in turn covered with a wattle-and-daub layer. At other times the horizontal timbers would be covered with a layer of primitively finished lumber. There was no standard practice in building walls there during Neolithic times; sometimes, even in the same house, walls would be constructed with horizontal timbers while others would be covered with finished lumber or wattle-and-daub. This type of horizontal log construction found in Cucuteni-Trypillia houses is called {{lang-ru|italic=yes|площадки}} ''ploshchadki'' in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Darvill |first= Timothy |work= Archaeology Dictionary |title= definition: ploshchadki | publisher= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |year=2003 |url= http://www.answers.com/topic/ploshchadki |format= online system or service |oclc= 425961211 |accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Kipfer |first= Barbara Ann |authorlink =Barbara Ann Kipfer&lt;!--http://archaeologywordsmith.com/arch-cv.php--&gt; |work= Archaeology Wordsmith |title= definition: ploshchadki | publisher = Dr. Barbara Ann Kipfer |url= http://archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=ploshchadki |format= online system or service |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were roofed with [[Sod|live turf]] or [[Thatching|thatched reeds]].&lt;ref name="Cucoș1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cucoș | first = Ștefan |title= Faza Cucuteni B în zona subcarpatică a Moldovei | trans-title= Cucuteni B period in the lower Carpathian region of Moldova | journal = Bibliotheca Memoriae antiquitatis (BMA) (Memorial Library antiquities) | volume = 6 | publisher = Muzeul de Istorie Piatra Neamț (Historical Museum Piatra Neamț) | location = Piatra Neamț, Romania | year = 1999 | url = http://www.neamt.ro/cmj/istorie/piatra-neamt/BMA_2.html | language = Romanian | oclc = 223302267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the house was usually rectangular but some were laid out in an "L" shape.

==Bordei dwellings==
{{See also|Bordei}}
Some of the houses found by archeologists were [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] [[earth house]]s, of the style called ''bordei'' in both Romanian ({{lang-ro |italic=yes|bordei}}) and Ukrainian ({{lang-ua|italic=yes|бордей}}). Unlike surface dwellings characterized by walls with right angles and rectangular shapes the bordei houses were characterized by elliptical shapes. These houses would typically have a wooden [[floor]] that was about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below ground, which would place the roof at just above ground level.&lt;ref name="Sorochin" /&gt; Images of bordei homes may be seen at the Romanian Art Zone page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grigorescu |first=Nicolae |title=Bordei in padure |trans-title=Bordei in the forest |publisher=Art Zone |date=1838–1907 |url=http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |postscript=An online reproduction of an oil painting done by Romanian artist Nicolae Grigorescu (1838—1907) |accessdate=6 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190925/http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |archivedate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==House interior==
[[File:Cucuteni House Clay Model.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Clay Model of house interior with two fireplaces]]
Most of the Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were arranged by locating the front door opposite from where the [[fireplace]] sat. Large ceramic pottery containers used to store water and grain were placed next to the fireplace. Other ceramic containers, including the more valuable painted pottery, would also be located near the fireplace. Some of the fine painted pottery for which this culture is known would be used for clothing storage but most of it seems to have been used in rituals.&lt;ref name="Monah"&gt;{{Citation |first=Dan |last=Monah |author-link=Dan Monah &lt;!--http://www.arheo.ro/text/colectiv/Pagini_personale/Monah%20Dan.html--&gt; |editor-last=Dumitroaia |editor-first=Gheorghe |contribution = Religie si arta in cultura Cucuteni (Religion and art in Cucuteni culture) |booktitle=Primul muzeu Cucuteni din Romania |title=Muzeul Cucuteni prima pentru Romania |trans-title=The first Cucuteni museum for Romania |series=Bibliotheca memoriae antiquitatis XV |year=2005 |pages=162–173 |place=Piatra-Neamț, Romania |publisher=Editura Foton |language=Romanian |oclc=319165024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of fireplaces found within each house varied from just one (which was the most common) to several, or even none. Each of the fireplaces found in houses that had more than one would have its own specific use such as one for cooking, one for [[Kiln|firing ceramics]], etc. Most Cucuteni-Trypillia fireplaces were a type of open [[fire pit]] and were usually constructed on the floor by laying down a bed of clay mixed with broken pottery shards and then covering this with a smooth clay-plastered surface.

It is assumed that furniture was extensively used however, due to the climate of this region, wood does not preserve well here. However some of the many miniature clay figurines found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites were placed sitting or reclining on different pieces of furniture, some of which resemble sofas, chairs, or even ovens. There is also some evidence of furniture being incorporated into the structure of the walls of houses by using woven branches covered with clay.&lt;ref name="Krichevski"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Кричевский  (Krichevski) | first = Евгений Юрьевич (Evgeniye Yurivich) | title = Трипольские площадки ; по раскопкам последних лет (Triploskiye ploshchadki : po raskopkam poslednič let) |trans-title=Trypillian ploshchadki : on the excavations of recent years | journal = Советская археология (''Sovyetskaya arkheologiya'' Soviet Archeology) | volume = 6 | publisher = институтом археологии АН СССР (Archeological Institute A.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Area studies''' (also '''regional studies''') are [[interdisciplinary]] fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular [[geography|geographical]], [[nation]]al/[[Federal government|federal]], or [[culture|cultural]] regions.  The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. Typical area study programs involve [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[languages]], [[geography]], [[literature]], and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include [[diaspora]] and [[emigration]] from the area.

==History==
[[Interdisciplinary]] area studies became increasingly common in the [[United States of America]] and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] in the context of the emerging [[Cold War]], as well as to the fall-out from the [[Decolonisation of Africa|Decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

{{Double image|right|Diploma_de_Especialista_Universitario_de_la_Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid.jpg|200px|Diploma-licenciatura-estudos-europeus-universidade.jpg|200px|[[Latin American studies]] and [[European studies]] are examples of Area studies, offered both in [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] degrees, the images show examples from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucm.es/amelat/interes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universidade Aberta|Aberta University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uab.pt/guiainformativo/eng_detailcursos.php?curso=14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this context, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Therefore, the foundations of the field are strongly rooted in America.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented [[political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching [[macrohistory | macrohistorial]] theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

The [[Ford Foundation]] would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area-studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, ''The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the United States. From 1953 to 1966 it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Szanton, "The Origin, Nature and Challenges of Area Studies in the United States," in ''The Politics of Knowledge: Area Studies and the Disciplines'', ed. David L. Szanton (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford's. Most notably, the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as [[National Resource Center]] programs at U.S. universities, as well as for [[Foreign Language and Area Studies]] fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;

Others moved from area studies into international journalism. [...] All state and Party organs that dealt with cultural diplomacy drew on the staff of area studies and their network of contacts.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick O'Meara, "Changing perspectives on international education", (Indiana University Press 2010), pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. 2009. “Area Studies in a Global Context.” Chronicle of Higher Education. Nov 29. http://chronicle.com/article/Area-Studies-in-a-Global-Co/49284/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of [[rational choice theory]] in political science and economics.&lt;ref&gt;See "Rational Choice Theory," by John Scott, in ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of The Present'', edited by G. Browning, A. Halcli, and F. Webster (Sage Publications, 2000). {{cite web|url=http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227085005/http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar [[Chalmers Johnson]] asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan's history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers Johnson and E. B. Keehn, "A Disaster in the Making: Rational Choice and Asian Studies," ''The National Interest'' 36 (summer 1994), pp. 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like "development and democracy". When the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], which had long served as the national [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumings article, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increasing interest in studying translocal, transregional, transnational and transcontinental phenomena, a Potsdam-based research network has recently coined the term "TransArea Studies" [http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/ (POINTS – Potsdam International Network for TransArea Studies)].

Other interdisciplinary research fields such as [[women's studies]] (also known as [[gender studies]]), [[disability studies]], and [[ethnic studies]] (including [[African American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[Latino/a studies]], and [[Native American studies]]) are not part of '''area studies''' but are sometimes included in discussion along with it.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], part of the [[University of London]], or the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] in Japan. At the [[University of Oxford]], the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS)[http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/][http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/ School of Interdiscplinary Area Studies, Oxford] and [[St Antony's College]] specialise in area studies, and hosts a number of post-graduate teaching programmes and research centres covering various regions of the world.
[[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi, is the only institution with immense contribution towards popularising area studies in India.
An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|GIGA]] (German Institute of Global Area Studies) in Germany.  Additionally, [[Lund University]] in Sweden offers the largest [http://www.ace.lu.se/ Asian Studies] masters program in Northern Europe and is dedicated to promoting studies related to South Asia through its [http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ SASNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund|title=Study Asia in Lund!|author=|date=27 June 2017|website=lu.se|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Best management practices''' ('''BMPs''') is a term used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe a type of [[water pollution]] control.  Historically the term has referred to auxiliary pollution controls in the fields of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] control and [[sewage treatment| municipal sewage]] control, while in [[stormwater]] management (both urban and rural) and [[wetland]] management, BMPs may refer to a principal control or treatment technique as well.

==Terminology==
Beginning in the 20th century, designers of industrial and municipal sewage pollution controls typically utilized [[sewage treatment|engineered systems]] (e.g. [[Trickling filter|filters]], [[clarifier]]s, [[Bioreactor|biological reactors]]) to provide the central components of pollution control systems, and used the term "BMPs" to describe the supporting functions for these systems, such as operator training and equipment maintenance.

'''Stormwater management,''' as a specialized area within the field of [[environmental engineering]], emerged later in the 20th century, and some practitioners have used the term '''BMP''' to describe both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. [[retention basin|retention ponds]]) to treat polluted stormwater, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. minimizing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides). Other practitioners prefer to use the term '''Stormwater control measure''', due to the varied definitions of the term "BMP" and its use in non-stormwater practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=http://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/7 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=5. Stormwater Management Approaches |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Clean Water Act References to "BMP" ==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] referred to '''BMP'''  in several sections of the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) but did not define the term.
*The 1977 CWA used the term in describing the areawide waste treatment planning program&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub.L. 95-217, December 27, 1977. Sections 208 (b), (i) and (j), {{USC|33|1288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in procedures for controlling [[toxic]] [[water pollution|pollutants]] associated with industrial discharges.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(e), {{USC|33|1314(e)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|"Section 404" program]], which covers dredge and fill permits, refers to BMPs in one of the enforcement exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 404(f), {{USC|33|1344}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*References to stormwater BMPs first appear in the 1987 amendment to the CWA in describing the Nonpoint Source Management Demonstration Program.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. CWA sec. 319(a),(b),(h),(l), &amp; (m), {{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another stormwater BMP reference was added in 2001 with the authorization for a Wet Weather Watershed Pilot Project program.&lt;ref&gt;Wet Weather Water Quality Act of 2000, December 21, 2000. Added by the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763A–225), as enacted into law by section 1(a)(6) of Pub.L. 106–554 (114 Stat. 2763). Amended CWA sec.121(a)(2), {{USC|33|1274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPA definitions ==
In implementing the CWA, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined '''BMP''' in the federal wastewater permit regulations, initially to refer to auxiliary procedures for industrial wastewater controls.  
:...schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States, BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|40|122|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the Agency added a reference to stormwater management BMPs.
:...each NPDES permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable... (k) Best management practices (BMPs)  to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when: ... (2) Authorized under section 402(p) of the CWA for the control of storm water discharges...&lt;ref&gt;EPA. {{CodeFedReg|40|122|44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial wastewater BMPs ==
Industrial wastewater BMPs are considered an adjunct to engineered [[sewage treatment|treatment]] systems. Typical BMPs include operator training, maintenance practices, and spill control procedures for treatment chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite report |date=July 1994 |title=Best Management Practices and Spill Response: Guidance Document |url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f7457ac3-7967-49c9-94dd-7986cb6624da/resource/6b40c069-d846-4fa2-a98b-bfd060a7ab3a/download/best-management-practices-spill-response-guidance-document.pdf |publisher=Alberta Environmental Protection |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many BMPs available which are specific to particular industrial processes, for example:
* source reduction practices in metal finishing industries (e.g. substituting less toxic [[solvent]]s or using water-based cleaners);
* in the [[chemical industry]], capturing equipment washdown waters for recycle/reuse at various process stages;
* in the [[paper industry]], using [[process control]] monitoring to optimize [[bleaching]] processes, and reduce the overall amount of bleach used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1993 |title=Guidance Manual for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP) |chapter=Ch. 3. Industry-Specific Best Management Practices |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0274.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-B-93-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stormwater management BMPs ==
[[Stormwater]] management BMPs are control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[urban runoff]] caused through changes to [[land use]]. Generally BMPs focus on [[water quality]] problems caused by increased [[impervious surface]]s from [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/5 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=3. Hydrologic, Geomorphic, and Biological Effects of Urbanization on Watersheds |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs are designed to reduce stormwater volume, peak flows, and/or [[nonpoint source pollution]] through [[evapotranspiration]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[detention basin|detention]], and filtration or biological and chemical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Debo |first1=Thomas N. |last2=Reese |first2=Andrew J. |authorlink= |title=Municipal Stormwater Management |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=1-56670-584-3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs also can improve receiving-water quality by extending the duration of outflows in comparison to inflow duration (known as  hydrograph extension), which dilutes the stormwater discharged into a larger volume of upstream flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author-last1=Granato |author-first1=G.E. |date=2014 |title=Statistics for stochastic modeling of volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment by structural stormwater runoff best management practices (BMPs) |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5037/ |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |id=Scientific Investigations Report 2014–5037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater BMPs can be classified as "structural" (i.e., devices installed or constructed on a site) or "non-structural" (procedures, such as modified landscaping practices or street sweeping). There are a variety of BMPs available; selection typically depends on site characteristics and pollutant removal objectives. EPA has published a series of stormwater BMP fact sheets for use by local governments, builders and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater |title=National Menu of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Stormwater |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater management BMPs can be also categorized into four basic types:
# Storage practices: ponds; recovery; [[Green infrastructure|green infrastructure design]]. 
# Vegetative practices: [[Buffer zone|buffers]]; channels; [[green roof]]s; wetlands; functional art;{{explain|date=November 2018}} stormwater wetland park design; wetland park engineering &amp; design. 
# Filtration/Infiltration practices: filtering; [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; [[Rain garden|rain gardens]]; [[Permeable paving|porous pavement]]; civic infrastructure and design; functional stormwater design.
# Water sensitive development: better site design;{{explain|date=November 2018}} open space site design; [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low impact development]].

'''Calponin 1''' is a basic smooth muscle [[protein]] that in [[human]]s is encoded by the ''CNN1'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: calponin 1, basic, smooth muscle | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=1264| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''CNN1'' gene is located at 19p13.2-p13.1 in the human chromosomal [[genome]] and contains 7 [[exons]], encoding the protein calponin 1, an [[actin]] filament-associated regulatory protein.&lt;ref name="Takahashi_1994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Abe M, Hiwada K, Kokubu T | title = A novel troponin T-like protein (calponin) in vascular smooth muscle: interaction with tropomyosin paracrystals | journal = Journal of Hypertension Supplement | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = S40-3 | date = December 1988 | pmid = 3241227 | doi=10.1097/00004872-198812040-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human calponin 1 is a 33.2-KDa protein consists of 297 [[amino acid]]s with an [[isoelectric point]] of 9.1,&lt;ref name = "Gao_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao J, Hwang JM, Jin JP | title = Complete nucleotide sequence, structural organization, and an alternatively spliced exon of mouse h1-calponin gene | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 218 | issue = 1 | pages = 292–7 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8573148 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus calponin 1 is also known as basic calponin.

==Evolution==
[[File:CNN1 wikipage.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 1''': Evolutionary lineage of vertebrate ''CNN1''.|400x400px]]
Three homologous genes, ''Cnn1'', ''Cnn2'' and ''Cnn3'', have evolved in [[vertebrate]]s, encoding three [[Protein isoform|isoforms]] of [[calponin]]: calponin 1,&lt;ref name = "Gao_1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strasser P, Gimona M, Moessler H, Herzog M, Small JV | title = Mammalian calponin. Identification and expression of genetic variants | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 330 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–8 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8370452 | doi=10.1016/0014-5793(93)80909-e}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[calponin 2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masuda H, Tanaka K, Takagi M, Ohgami K, Sakamaki T, Shibata N, Takahashi K | title = Molecular cloning and characterization of human non-smooth muscle calponin | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 415–24 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8889829 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021428}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calponin 3, acidic|calponin 3]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Applegate D, Feng W, Green RS, Taubman MB | title = Cloning and expression of a novel acidic calponin isoform from rat aortic vascular smooth muscle | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 14 | pages = 10683–90 | date = April 1994 | pmid = 8144658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Protein [[sequence alignment]] shows that calponin 1 is highly conserved in [[mammal]]s but more diverged among lower vertebrates.

==Smooth muscle-specific expression==
The [[Gene expression|expression]] of CNN1 is specific to differentiated mature smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role in [[Muscle contraction|contractile functions]]. Calponin 1 is up-regulated in [[smooth muscle tissue]]s during postnatal development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hossain MM, Hwang DY, Huang QQ, Sasaki Y, Jin JP | title = Developmentally regulated expression of calponin isoforms and the effect of h2-calponin on cell proliferation | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Cell Physiology | volume = 284 | issue = 1 | pages = C156-67 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12388067 | doi = 10.1152/ajpcell.00233.2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a higher content in phasic smooth muscle of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jin JP, Walsh MP, Resek ME, McMartin GA | title = Expression and epitopic conservation of calponin in different smooth muscles and during development | journal =  	Biochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–96 | pmid = 9213427 | doi=10.1139/o96-019 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure-function relationship==
[[File:Calponin structure wikigene final.jpg|thumb|534x534px|'''Figure 2. Structural and functional domains of calponin.''' The linear structural map summarized primarily from studies of chicken calponin 1 illustrates the structural and functional domains of calponin. The CH domain, two actin-binding sites, three repeating sequence motifs, and the C-terminal variable region are outlined. The CH domain overlaps with the ERK signaling binding region. Amino acid sequences of the two actin-binding sites in the three isoforms and the three repeating motifs of calponin 1 are shown in the insets. The regulatory phosphorylation sites Ser&lt;sub&gt;175&lt;/sub&gt; and Thr&lt;sub&gt;184&lt;/sub&gt; are located in the second actin-binding site that overlaps with the first repeating motif. Potentially phosphorylatable serine residues corresponding to Ser&lt;sub&gt;175&lt;/sub&gt; are conserved in repeats 2 and 3, while a Thr&lt;sub&gt;184&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent is conserved in repeat 2. Different from calponin 1 and calponin 3, calponin 2 has a potentially phosphorylatable additional serine at position 177.
]]
The majority of structure-function relationship studies of calponin were with experiments using chicken calponin 1. Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] [[Calponin homology domain|calponin homology (CH) domain]], a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms.

===The CH domain===
The CH domain was found in a number of actin-binding proteins (such as [[Actinin alpha 1|α-actinin]], [[spectrin]], and [[filamin]]) to form the actin-binding region or serve as a regulatory structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gimona M, Djinovic-Carugo K, Kranewitter WJ, Winder SJ | title = Functional plasticity of CH domains | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 513 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–106 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11911887 | doi=10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03240-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CH domain in calponin is not the binding site for actin nor does it regulate the modes of calponin-F-actin binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galkin VE, Orlova A, Fattoum A, Walsh MP, Egelman EH | title = The CH-domain of calponin does not determine the modes of calponin binding to F-actin | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 359 | issue = 2 | pages = 478–85 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16626733 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.03.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, CH domain in calponin was found to bind to extra-cellular regulated [[kinase]] (ERK) for calponin to play a possible role as an [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor protein]] in the ERK signaling cascades.&lt;ref name="Leinweber_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leinweber BD, Leavis PC, Grabarek Z, Wang CL, Morgan KG | title = Extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) interaction with actin and the calponin homology (CH) domain of actin-binding proteins | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 344 | pages = 117–23 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10548541 | doi=10.1042/0264-6021:3440117 | issue=1 | pmc=1220621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actin-binding sites===
Calponin binds actin to promote and sustain [[polymerization]]. The binding of calponin to F-actin inhibits the [[Magnesium-ATPase|MgATPase]] activity of smooth muscle [[myosin]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abe M, Takahashi K, Hiwada K | title = Effect of calponin on actin-activated myosin ATPase activity | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 108 | issue = 5 | pages = 835–8 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2150518 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mezgueldi M, Fattoum A, Derancourt J, Kassab R | title = Mapping of the functional domains in the amino-terminal region of calponin | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 267 | issue = 22 | pages = 15943–51 | date = August 1992 | pmid = 1639822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winder_1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winder SJ, Walsh MP | title = Calponin: thin filament-linked regulation of smooth muscle contraction | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 677–86 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8130072 | doi=10.1016/0898-6568(93)90029-l}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calponin binds F-actin through two sites at residues 144-162 and 171-188 in chicken calponin 1. The two actin-binding sites are conserved in the three calponin isoforms.

There are three repeating [[sequence motif]]s in calponin next to the C-terminal region. This repeating structure is conserved in all three isoforms and across [[species]]. Outlined in Fig. 2, the first repeating motif overlaps with the second actin-binding site and contains [[protein kinase C]] (PKC) [[phosphorylation]] sites Ser175 and Thr184 that are not present in the first actin-binding site. This feature is consistent with the hypothesis that the second actin-binding site plays a regulatory role in the binding of calponin to the [[Microfilament|actin filament]]. Similar sequences as well as potential phosphorylation sites are present in repeats 2 and 3 whereas their function is unknown.

===C-terminal variable region===
The C-terminal segment of calponin has diverged significantly among the three isoforms. The variable lengths and amino acid sequences of the C-terminal segment produce the size and charge differences among the calponin isoforms. The corresponding charge features rendered calponin 1, 2 and 3 the names of basic, neutral and acidic calponins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jin JP, Zhang Z, Bautista JA | title = Isoform diversity, regulation, and functional adaptation of troponin and calponin | journal = Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–124 | pmid = 18304026 | doi=10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v18.i2.10 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu KC, Jin JP | title = Calponin in non-muscle cells | journal = [[Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics]] | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 139–48 | pmid = 18946636 | doi = 10.1007/s12013-008-9031-6 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu R, Jin JP | date = 2015 | title = Calponin: A mechanical tension-modulated regulator of cytoskeleton and cell motility. | journal = Current Topics in Biochemical Research | volume = 16 | pages = 1–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C-terminal segment of calponin has an effect on weakening the binding of calponin to F-actin.

==Regulation of smooth muscle contractility==

Numerous [[in vitro]] experimental data indicate that calponin 1 functions as an inhibitory regulator of smooth muscle contractility through inhibiting [[Myofibril|actomyosin]] interactions.&lt;ref name="Takahashi_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Hiwada K, Kokubu T | title = Isolation and characterization of a 34,000-dalton calmodulin- and F-actin-binding protein from chicken gizzard smooth muscle | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 141 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–6 | date = November 1986 | pmid = 3606745 | doi=10.1016/s0006-291x(86)80328-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen BG, Walsh MP | title = The biochemical basis of the regulation of smooth-muscle contraction | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 362–8 | date = September 1994 | pmid = 7985229 | doi=10.1016/0968-0004(94)90112-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regulation, binding of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-calmodulin and PKC phosphorylation dissociate calponin 1 from the actin filament and facilitate smooth muscle contraction.&lt;ref name="Naka_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naka M, Kureishi Y, Muroga Y, Takahashi K, Ito M, Tanaka T | title = Modulation of smooth muscle calponin by protein kinase C and calmodulin | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 171 | issue = 3 | pages = 933–7 | date = September 1990 | pmid = 2222454 | doi=10.1016/0006-291x(90)90773-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[In vivo]] data also support the role of calponin 1 as regulator of smooth muscle contractility. While [[Aorta|aortic]] smooth muscle of adult Wistar Kyoto [[rat]]s, which naturally lacks calponin 1, is fully contractile, it has a decreased sensitivity to [[norepinephrine]] activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nigam R, Triggle CR, Jin JP | title = h1- and h2-calponins are not essential for norepinephrine- or sodium fluoride-induced contraction of rat aortic smooth muscle | journal = Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 695–703 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9742453 | doi=10.1023/a:1005389300151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Facemire C, Brozovich FV, Jin JP | title = The maximal velocity of vascular smooth muscle shortening is independent of the expression of calponin | journal = Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–73 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 11032347 | doi=10.1023/a:1005680614296}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gelatinase A|Matrix metalloproteinase-2]] [[proteolysis]] of calponin 1 resulted in [[Blood vessel|vascular]] hypocontractility to [[phenylephrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castro MM, Cena J, Cho WJ, Walsh MP, Schulz R | title = Matrix metalloproteinase-2 proteolysis of calponin-1 contributes to vascular hypocontractility in endotoxemic rats | journal = Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 662–8 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22199370 | doi = 10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.242685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vas deferens]] smooth muscle from calponin 1 [[Knockout mouse|knockout mice]] showed faster maximum shortening velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yoshimoto R, Fuchibe K, Fujishige A, Mitsui-Saito M, Hori M, Ozaki H, Yamamura H, Awata N, Taniguchi S, Katsuki M, Tsuchiya T, Karaki H | title = Regulation of shortening velocity by calponin in intact contracting smooth muscles | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 279 | issue = 1 | pages = 150–7 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11112431 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calponin 1 knockout mice exhibited blunted [[Microtubule-associated protein|MAP]] response to phenylephrine administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masuki S, Takeoka M, Taniguchi S, Nose H | title = Enhanced baroreflex sensitivity in free-moving calponin knockout mice | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

==Phosphorylation regulation==
There is a large collection of in vitro evidences demonstrating the phosphorylation regulation of calponin. The primary phosphorylation sites are Ser175 and Thr184 in the second actin-binding site (Fig. 2). Experimental data showed that Ser175 and Thr184 in calponin 1 are phosphorylated by PKC in vitro.&lt;ref name="Naka_1990"/&gt; Direct association was found between calponin 1 and [[PKC alpha|PKCα]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Somara S, Bitar KN | title = Direct association of calponin with specific domains of PKC-alpha | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

Dephosphorylation of calponin is [[Catalysis|catalyzed]] by type 2B protein [[phosphatase]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser ED, Walsh MP | title = Dephosphorylation of calponin by type 2B protein phosphatase | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 28 | pages = 9151–8 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7619814 | doi=10.1021/bi00028a026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ichikawa K, Ito M, Okubo S, Konishi T, Nakano T, Mino T, Nakamura F, Naka M, Tanaka T | title = Calponin phosphatase from smooth muscle: a possible role of type 1 protein phosphatase in smooth muscle relaxation | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 193 | issue = 3 | pages = 827–33 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8391807 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.1993.1700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unphosphorylated calponin binds to actin and inhibits actomyosin MgATPase. Ser175 phosphorylation alters the [[Chemical structure|molecular conformation]] of calponin and [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociates]] calponin from F-actin.&lt;ref name="Jin_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jin JP, Walsh MP, Sutherland C, Chen W | title = A role for serine-175 in modulating the molecular conformation of calponin | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 350 | pages = 579–88 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10947974 | doi=10.1042/0264-6021:3500579 | issue=2 | pmc=1221287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence is to release the inhibition of actomyosin MgATPase and increase the production of force.&lt;ref name="Winder_1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang DC, Kang HM, Jin JP, Fraser ED, Walsh MP | title = Structure-function relations of smooth muscle calponin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3996">'''Diploma in Computer Science''', originally known as the "Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing", was a conversion course in [[Computer Science]] offered by the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. It was equivalent to a [[master's degree]] in present-day nomenclature but the title ''diploma'' was retained for historic reasons, "diploma" being the archaic term for a master's degree.

The Diploma was the world's first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students with degrees in mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government ([[EPSRC]]) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the University took the decision to withdraw the Diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service. 

==History==
The introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a [[University of Cambridge]] Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the "demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing … &lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered". The [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] "was one of the pioneers in the de and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)". It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that "The Summer School deals &lt;nowiki&gt;[only]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with 'programming', rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed." The Diploma "would include theoretical and practical work … &lt;nowiki&gt;[and also]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instruction about the various types of computing-machine … and the principles of design on which they are based." With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/UoCCL/misc/EDSAC99/history.html Informal history of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

University-supported teaching and research staff in the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Laboratory]] at the time were [[Maurice Wilkes]] (head of the laboratory), [[J. C. P. Miller]], W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove.

In its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year ("Part IB") of the undergraduate [[Computer Science Tripos]] course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate ("Part II") lecture courses also included.

There were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16682">In keeping with the [[Paris Principles]] definition of a child soldier, the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative defines a ''child pirate''' as any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by a [[pirate]] gang in any capacity, including children - boys and/or girls - used as gunmen in boarding parties, hostage guards, negotiators, ship captains, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes, whether at sea or on land.  It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in kinetic criminal operations.

Children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities (usually on account of socioeconomic desperation, familial suggestion or peer influence) or they may be forcibly abducted by piratical gangs.

== Causes  ==

There are a number of reasons why an adult pirate commander would view children as being of significant tactical value.  These perceptions render children vulnerable to abduction or forced recruitment.  As noted by Carl Conradi:

:"Like warlords, pirate commanders recruit children because they are vulnerable and easily manipulated; fearless and ignorant of the long-term consequences of their actions; inexpensive to maintain; plentiful in developing countries most afflicted by piracy; small in stature and therefore nimble; easily indoctrinated; largely invulnerable to legal proceedings; and because they pose a moral challenge to their enemies."&lt;ref name="navalreview"&gt;http://www.navalreview.ca/2013/02/the-invisible-phenomenon-of-child-piracy/&lt;/ref&gt;”

In other cases, children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities.  However, as asserted by the Canada-based [[Roméo Dallaire]] Child Soldiers Initiative, "'voluntary' enlistment must be understood in terms of the limited choices and circumstances that may exist in the context of a particular country."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers"&gt;http://www.childsoldiers.org/files/publications/2012-DMPP-Children-Youth-Marine-Piracy.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;’  If a child is extremely poor, has been displaced from his or her home, has been separated from his or her family, has limited educational opportunities or has been exposed to conflict, there is an increased likelihood that he or she will view piracy as a legitimate vehicle for social advancement.

== National and international mechanisms and laws ==

In the absence of specific international legislation on juvenile maritime piracy, the precise age of a child’s criminal responsibility when committing piratical acts differs from country to country.  There are, however, a number of international conventions pertaining to either maritime law or children’s rights that may provide some guidance as to the proper handling of child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  ===

While the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS, 1982) does not discuss children’s involvement in maritime criminal activities, it does provide a clear definition of piracy.  According to Article 101, piracy is:

:a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed:
:::i. on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;
:::ii. against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;
:b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
:c) any act of inciting or intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCLOS does recognise universal jurisdiction over the crime of piracy but it only applies to criminal acts that take place on international waters.  If an act of piracy occurs within a country’s territorial waters, it is a matter of state jurisdiction and prosecution.

=== International Labour Organisation Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention ===

Article 3 of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (No. 182, 1999) stipulates that:

:…the term the worst forms of child labour comprises:

:a) all forms of [[slavery]] or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and [[trafficking of children]], [[debt bondage]] and [[serfdom]] and forced or [[Unfree labour|compulsory labour]], including forced or compulsory [[Military use of children|recruitment of children for use in armed conflict]];
:b) the use, procuring or offering of a child for [[Prostitution of children|prostitution]], for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances;
:c) the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs defined in the relevant international treaties;
:d) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C182&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as participation in any form of maritime criminality is dangerous (and indeed, potentially lethal), child piracy clearly constitutes a worst form of child labour.

According to the Convention, a child is any person who is below the age of 18.

As of April 2013, eight countries had not signed ILO Convention No. 182.  These include Cuba, Eritrea, India, the Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11310:0::NO:11310:P11310_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327:NO&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these countries – India and Somalia – are currently detaining and prosecuting alleged child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ===

Like ILO Convention No. 182, Article 1 of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef-irc.org/portfolios/crc.html&lt;/ref&gt; (1990) specifies that a child is any human being below the age of 18 years.  However, the same article adds a caveat to the effect that a country’s minimum age of criminal responsibility may be lower than 18, as stipulated by national law.

Other sections that may have some bearing upon the status of child pirates include Article 6, in which, “States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life,” and that, “States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.”

Article 19(1) affirms that, “States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.”  This clause may be particularly relevant in cases where a child’s parents have forced him or her to participate in piratical activity, or where the State is responsible for detaining, interrogating, trying and/or incarcerating a captured child pirate.

Article 32(1) echoes ILO Convention No. 182 by stipulating that, “States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.”

Article 35 says that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.”  When a piratical gang permanently separates a child from his or her family, this may constitute an act of child trafficking.

Article 37(a) affirms that, “No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.”  Likewise, Article 37(c) states that, “Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age.  In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interests not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances.”

Lastly, Article 39 stipulates that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation or abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts.  Such recovery and reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.”

=== Other regional mechanisms and conventions ===

The third version of the ''Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secure-marine.com/bmp3/bpm3_pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'' (June 2010) recommends a sample follow-up report that should be filled by the captain of any vessel that has come under pirate attack.  While the report does solicit certain details concerning the offending raiding party – such as the number of constituent pirate members, their physical appearance and the weapons that were used – it does not ask for the estimated ages of pirates.

The [[Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia]] (ReCAAP) is a multilateral pact that facilitates information sharing between signatory countries.  The reporting mechanism that it establishes does not specifically call for the collection of disaggregated data pertaining to the ages of captured pirates.

According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the UN [[Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia]] is in the midst of drafting an apprehension and transfer protocol for juvenile pirates who are captured by international navies operating in the Horn of Africa region.

=== National laws and judicial mechanisms ===

All three of the main Somali sub-regions (i.e., [[Somalia|South-Central]], [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]]) have signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with the governments of Mauritius and the Seychelles, allowing for the transfer of convicted pirates to prison facilities in Somalia.  These MoUs, however, do not specify clear standard operating procedures for processing and/or transferring pirates who are determined to be under the age of 18.  Kenya is also trying suspected Somali pirates but no prisoner transfer agreement is currently in place.

According to UNICEF-Somalia, some 100 child pirates are currently being detained in a prison in [[Bosaso]], Puntland.  A second prison for juvenile pirates with a capacity of 100 is being built in [[Garoowe]], while a 70-person prison for juvenile pirates is being built in Somaliland.

The Republic of Somaliland’s Juvenile Justice Law (2007) raised the age of criminal responsibility for 14 to 15 years and established separate judicial mechanisms for minors, such as child-specific courts of first instance and appellate courts.  However, Somaliland’s Law on Combating Piracy (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

The Somali sub-region of Puntland does not have any specific legislation pertaining to child protection, though as of April 2013, a policy on orphans and other vulnerable children had been tabled in Parliament.

India’s Piracy Bill (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

== Incidences ==

=== Nigeria ===

According to the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative:

:"In Nigeria, young unemployed men, in particular, are frequently enticed into the organized pirate gangs operating in the Delta region by “…promised riches, fancy cars, luxury goods and weapons,” such that these gangs are increasingly composed of younger members.  It has also become recognized that in Nigeria, social mobility and the struggle for survival now necessitate the use of violence as “…society gradually stopped recognizing merit and force became a plausible avenue to the top of social and economic strata with drug trafficking, smuggling and other perceived moneymaking ventures like armed robbery, seen as ways to get rich quickly."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;”’

=== Somalia ===

One of the most egregious instances of child maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia is recounted on the Canadian Naval Review’s Broadsides forum:

:"In March 2011, Indian naval forces operating in the Arabian Sea captured the Mozambique-flagged fishing vessel ''Vega 5''.  Somali pirates had kidnapped the trawler’s original crew several months earlier.  They subsequently refurbished the stolen craft into an operationally significant "mothership".  Of the 61 marauders who were arrested during the Indian raid, an astonishing 25 persons – or some 40% of the entire crew – were determined to be under the age of 15.  Indeed, ensuring reports revealed that four of the pirates could not have been older than 11."&lt;ref name="navalreview" /&gt;'

The ''Vega 5'' hijacking does not appear to be an isolated incident.  The Broadsides article continues to report that:

:"During a recent visit to the autonomous Somali region of Puntland, former UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], was told by a jailed adult pirate that his colleagues and superiors were increasingly reliant upon child recruits when attempting seize ships for ransom.  Many of the adults who are responsible for directing piracy operations only do so from their homes on land, rather than from motherships on the high seas.  As such, according to Ms. Coomaraswamy, the individuals actually sent out to, "…do the dangerous stuff are the young children, between the ages of 15, 16 and 17."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabnews.com/node/360064&lt;/ref&gt;"'

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has determined that a significant proportion of those Somali pirates who are currently being tried internationally are actually under the age of 18.  In India, 38 out of 61 pirates (62%) facing trial are juveniles; in Germany, 3 out of 10 (30%) are children; and in the United States of America, all three Somali pirates currently facing trial are under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

=== Sri Lanka ===

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has noted that:&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

:"As part of its military strategy, the [[LTTE]] [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] maintained “…the most comprehensive naval networks among the [US-designated] foreign terrorist organizations&lt;ref name="asiantribune"&gt;http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/16950&lt;/ref&gt;…”.  This branch of operations, called the [[Sea Tigers]], launched a multitude of attacks upon international cargo ships, including several – such as the Greek-registered freighter ''Stillus Limassul'' – that were carrying weapons to be used by the Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name="asiantribune" /&gt;  Like its army, the LTTE’s naval branch actively recruited and deployed child soldiers.  Indeed, there is evidence that during periods of LTTE-sponsored disarmament of child soldiers, underage members of the Sea Tigers were surreptitiously retained, as they had frequently received resource-intensive training that made them particularly strong military assets."&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, C. L. (2006). ''Child Recruitment in South Asian Conflicts''. Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs): UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also very common for “…very young Tamils (some as young as 13) [to be] pressed into service to fill the [naval] ranks as the long-running insurgency depleted LTTE manpower.&lt;ref&gt;Povlock, P. A. (2011, September 9). 'A Guerilla War at Sea: The Sri Lankan Civil War'. ''Small Wars Journal''.

[[File:Cluster-2.svg|thumb|The result of a cluster analysis shown as the coloring of the squares into three clusters.]]
'''Cluster analysis''' or '''clustering''' is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a '''cluster''') are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory [[data mining]], and a common technique for [[statistics|statistical]] [[data analysis]], used in many fields, including [[machine learning]], [[pattern recognition]], [[image analysis]], [[information retrieval]], [[bioinformatics]], [[data compression]], and [[computer graphics]].

Cluster analysis itself is not one specific [[algorithm]], but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small [[Distance function|distances]] between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular [[statistical distribution]]s. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a [[multi-objective optimization]] problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the [[Metric (mathematics)|distance function]] to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of [[knowledge discovery]] or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.

Besides the term ''clustering'', there are a number of terms with similar meanings, including ''automatic [[Statistical classification|classification]]'', ''[[numerical taxonomy]]'', ''botryology'' (from Greek βότρυς "grape") and ''typological analysis''. The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.

Cluster analysis was originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932 and introduced to psychology by Zubin in 1938 and [[Robert Tryon]] in 1939&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bailey  | first = Ken | year = 1994 | title = Typologies and Taxonomies | chapter = Numerical Taxonomy and Cluster Analysis | page = 34 | isbn = 9780803952591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Cluster Analysis: Correlation Profile and Orthometric (factor) Analysis for the Isolation of Unities in Mind and Personality | first = Robert C. | last = Tryon | authorlink = Robert Tryon | publisher = Edwards Brothers | year = 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; and famously used by [[Raymond Cattell|Cattell]] beginning in 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cattell | first = R. B. | date = 1943 | title = The description of personality: Basic traits resolved into clusters | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 476–506 | doi=10.1037/h0054116}}&lt;/ref&gt; for trait theory classification in [[personality psychology]].

== Definition ==

The notion of a "cluster" cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms.&lt;ref name="estivill"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why so many clustering algorithms – A Position Paper | last = Estivill-Castro | first = Vladimir | journal=ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter |date=20 June 2002 | volume= 4 | issue=1 | pages=65–75 | doi=10.1145/568574.568575}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these "cluster models" is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms. Typical cluster models include:
* ''{{vanchor|Connectivity model}}s'': for example, [[hierarchical clustering]] builds models based on distance connectivity.
* ''{{vanchor|Centroid model}}s'': for example, the [[k-means algorithm]] represents each cluster by a single mean vector.
* ''{{vanchor|Distribution model}}s'': clusters are modeled using statistical distributions, such as [[multivariate normal distribution]]s used by the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]].
* ''{{vanchor|Density model}}s'': for example, [[DBSCAN]] and [[OPTICS]] defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.
* ''{{vanchor|Subspace model}}s'': in [[biclustering]] (also known as co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes.
* ''{{vanchor|Group model}}s'': some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information.
* ''{{vanchor|Graph-based model}}s'': a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]], that is, a subset of nodes in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster. Relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement (a fraction of the edges can be missing) are known as quasi-cliques, as in the [[HCS clustering algorithm]].
* ''{{vanchor|Neural model}}s'': the most well known [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[neural network]] is the [[self-organizing map]] and these models can usually be characterized as similar to one or more of the above models, and including subspace models when neural networks implement a form of [[Principal Component Analysis]] or [[Independent Component Analysis]].

A "clustering" is essentially a set of such clusters, usually containing all objects in the data set. Additionally, it may specify the relationship of the clusters to each other, for example, a hierarchy of clusters embedded in each other. Clusterings can be roughly distinguished as:
* ''{{vanchor|Hard clustering}}'': each object belongs to a cluster or not
* ''{{vanchor|Soft clustering}}'' (also: ''{{vanchor|[[fuzzy clustering]]}}''): each object belongs to each cluster to a certain degree (for example, a likelihood of belonging to the cluster)

There are also finer distinctions possible, for example:

* ''{{vanchor|Strict partitioning clustering}}'': each object belongs to exactly one cluster
* ''{{vanchor|Strict partitioning clustering with outliers}}'': objects can also belong to no cluster, and are considered [[Anomaly detection|outliers]]
* ''{{vanchor|Overlapping clustering}}'' (also: ''alternative clustering'', ''multi-view clustering''): objects may belong to more than one cluster; usually involving hard clusters
* ''{{vanchor|Hierarchical clustering}}'': objects that belong to a child cluster also belong to the parent cluster
* ''{{vanchor|[[Subspace clustering]]}}'': while an overlapping clustering, within a uniquely defined subspace, clusters are not expected to overlap

== Algorithms ==
{{main category|Cluster analysis algorithms}}

As listed above, clustering algorithms can be categorized based on their cluster model. The following overview will only list the most prominent examples of clustering algorithms, as there are possibly over 100 published clustering algorithms. Not all provide models for their clusters and can thus not easily be categorized. An overview of algorithms explained in Wikipedia can be found in the [[List of algorithms#Statistics|list of statistics algorithms]].

There is no objectively "correct" clustering algorithm, but as it was noted, "clustering is in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; The most appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular problem often needs to be chosen experimentally, unless there is a mathematical reason to prefer one cluster model over another. It should be noted that an algorithm that is designed for one kind of model will generally fail on a data set that contains a radically different kind of model.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; For example, k-means cannot find non-convex clusters.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt;

=== Connectivity-based clustering (hierarchical clustering) ===
{{Main|Hierarchical clustering}}
Connectivity-based clustering, also known as ''[[hierarchical clustering]]'', is based on the core idea of objects being more related to nearby objects than to objects farther away. These algorithms connect "objects" to form "clusters" based on their distance. A cluster can be described largely by the maximum distance needed to connect parts of the cluster. At different distances, different clusters will form, which can be represented using a [[dendrogram]], which explains where the common name "hierarchical clustering" comes from: these algorithms do not provide a single partitioning of the data set, but instead provide an extensive hierarchy of clusters that merge with each other at certain distances. In a dendrogram, the y-axis marks the distance at which the clusters merge, while the objects are placed along the x-axis such that the clusters don't mix.

Connectivity-based clustering is a whole family of methods that differ by the way distances are computed. Apart from the usual choice of [[distance function]]s, the user also needs to decide on the linkage criterion (since a cluster consists of multiple objects, there are multiple candidates to compute the distance) to use. Popular choices are known as [[single-linkage clustering]] (the minimum of object distances), [[complete linkage clustering]] (the maximum of object distances), and [[UPGMA]] or [[WPGMA]] ("Unweighted or Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean", also known as average linkage clustering). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (starting with single elements and aggregating them into clusters) or divisive (starting with the complete data set and dividing it into partitions).

These methods will not produce a unique partitioning of the data set, but a hierarchy from which the user still needs to choose appropriate clusters. They are not very robust towards outliers, which will either show up as additional clusters or even cause other clusters to merge (known as "chaining phenomenon", in particular with [[single-linkage clustering]]). In the general case, the complexity is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; for agglomerative clustering and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(2^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; for [[divisive clustering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = Cluster analysis | publisher = Wiley | location = Chichester, West Sussex, U.K | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780470749913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes them too slow for large data sets. For some special cases, optimal efficient methods (of complexity &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;) are known: SLINK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = R. | last = Sibson | title=SLINK: an optimally efficient algorithm for the single-link cluster method | journal=The Computer Journal | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=30–34 | year=1973 | publisher=British Computer Society | url=http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~wkim/index_files/papers/sibson.pdf | doi=10.1093/comjnl/16.1.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for single-linkage and CLINK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = D. | last = Defays | title=An efficient algorithm for a complete link method | journal=The Computer Journal | volume=20 | issue=4 | pages=364–366 | year=1977 | publisher=British Computer Society | doi=10.1093/comjnl/20.4.364}}&lt;/ref&gt; for complete-linkage clustering. In the [[data mining]] community these methods are recognized as a theoretical foundation of cluster analysis, but often considered obsolete{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. They did however provide inspiration for many later methods such as density based clustering.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Centroid-based clustering ===
{{Main|k-means clustering}}
In centroid-based clustering, clusters are represented by a central vector, which may not necessarily be a member of the data set. When the number of clusters is fixed to ''k'', [[k-means clustering|''k''-means clustering]] gives a formal definition as an optimization problem: find the ''k'' cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster center, such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized.

The optimization problem itself is known to be [[NP-hard]], and thus the common approach is to search only for approximate solutions. A particularly well known approximate method is [[Lloyd's algorithm]],&lt;ref name="lloyd"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lloyd | first1 = S. | title = Least squares quantization in PCM | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1982.1056489 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–137 | year = 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; often just referred to as "''k-means algorithm''" (although [[k-means clustering#History|another algorithm introduced this name]]). It does however only find a [[local optimum]], and is commonly run multiple times with different random initializations. Variations of ''k''-means often include such optimizations as choosing the best of multiple runs, but also restricting the centroids to members of the data set ([[K-medoids|''k''-medoids]]), choosing [[median]]s ([[k-medians clustering|''k''-medians clustering]]), choosing the initial centers less randomly ([[k-means++|''k''-means++]]) or allowing a fuzzy cluster assignment ([[Fuzzy clustering|fuzzy c-means]]).

Most ''k''-means-type algorithms require the [[Determining the number of clusters in a data set|number of clusters]] – ''k'' – to be specified in advance, which is considered to be one of the biggest drawbacks of these algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithms prefer clusters of approximately similar size, as they will always assign an object to the nearest centroid. This often leads to incorrectly cut borders of clusters (which is not surprising since the algorithm optimizes cluster centers, not cluster borders).

K-means has a number of interesting theoretical properties. First, it partitions the data space into a structure known as a [[Voronoi diagram]]. Second, it is conceptually close to nearest neighbor classification, and as such is popular in [[machine learning]]. Third, it can be seen as a variation of model based clustering, and Lloyd's algorithm as a variation of the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]] for this model discussed below.

File:KMeans-density-data.svg|K-means cannot represent density-based clusters
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Distribution-based clustering ===
The clustering model most closely related to statistics is based on [[Probability distribution|distribution models]]. Clusters can then easily be defined as objects belonging most likely to the same distribution. A convenient property of this approach is that this closely resembles the way artificial data sets are generated: by sampling random objects from a distribution.

While the theoretical foundation of these methods is excellent, they suffer from one key problem known as [[overfitting]], unless constraints are put on the model complexity. A more complex model will usually be able to explain the data better, which makes choosing the appropriate model complexity inherently difficult.

One prominent method is known as Gaussian mixture models (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]). Here, the data set is usually modeled with a fixed (to avoid overfitting) number of [[Gaussian distribution]]s that are initialized randomly and whose parameters are iteratively optimized to better fit the data set. This will converge to a [[local optimum]], so multiple runs may produce different results. In order to obtain a hard clustering, objects are often then assigned to the Gaussian distribution they most likely belong to; for soft clusterings, this is not necessary.

Distribution-based clustering produces complex models for clusters that can capture [[correlation and dependence]] between attributes. However, these algorithms put an extra burden on the user: for many real data sets, there may be no concisely defined mathematical model (e.g. assuming Gaussian distributions is a rather strong assumption on the data).

Similar to linkage based clustering, it is based on connecting points within certain distance thresholds. However, it only connects points that satisfy a density criterion, in the original variant defined as a minimum number of other objects within this radius. A cluster consists of all density-connected objects (which can form a cluster of an arbitrary shape, in contrast to many other methods) plus all objects that are within these objects' range. Another interesting property of DBSCAN is that its complexity is fairly low – it requires a linear number of range queries on the database – and that it will discover essentially the same results (it is [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] for core and noise points, but not for border points) in each run, therefore there is no need to run it multiple times.

The key drawback of [[DBSCAN]] and [[OPTICS]] is that they expect some kind of density drop to detect cluster borders. On data sets with, for example, overlapping Gaussian distributions – a common use case in artificial data – the cluster borders produced by these algorithms will often look arbitrary, because the cluster density decreases continuously. On a data set consisting of mixtures of Gaussians, these algorithms are nearly always outperformed by methods such as [[Expectation–maximization algorithm|EM clustering]] that are able to precisely model this kind of data.

[[Mean-shift]] is a clustering approach where each object is moved to the densest area in its vicinity, based on [[kernel density estimation]]. Eventually, objects converge to local maxima of density. Similar to k-means clustering, these "density attractors" can serve as representatives for the data set, but mean-shift can detect arbitrary-shaped clusters similar to DBSCAN. Due to the expensive iterative procedure and density estimation, mean-shift is usually slower than DBSCAN or k-Means. Besides that, the applicability of the mean-shift algorithm to multidimensional data is hindered by the unsmooth behaviour of the kernel density estimate, which results in over-fragmentation of cluster tails.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Recent developments ===
In recent years, considerable effort has been put into improving the performance of existing algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = D. | last = Sculley |title=Web-scale k-means clustering |conference=Proc. 19th WWW |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = Z. | year = 1998 | title = Extensions to the ''k''-means algorithm for clustering large data sets with categorical values | url = | journal = Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 283–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are ''CLARANS'' (Ng and Han, 1994),&lt;ref&gt;R.

"An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases." In: Proc. Int'l Conf. on Management of Data, ACM SIGMOD, pp. 103–114.&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent need to process larger and larger data sets (also known as [[big data]]), the willingness to trade semantic meaning of the generated clusters for performance has been increasing. This led to the development of pre-clustering methods such as [[canopy clustering algorithm|canopy clustering]], which can process huge data sets efficiently, but the resulting "clusters" are merely a rough pre-partitioning of the data set to then analyze the partitions with existing slower methods such as [[k-means clustering]].

For [[high-dimensional data]], many of the existing methods fail due to the [[curse of dimensionality]], which renders particular distance functions problematic in high-dimensional spaces. This led to new [[clustering high-dimensional data|clustering algorithms for high-dimensional data]] that focus on [[subspace clustering]] (where only some attributes are used, and cluster models include the relevant attributes for the cluster) and [[correlation clustering]] that also looks for arbitrary rotated ("correlated") subspace clusters that can be modeled by giving a [[correlation]] of their attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kriegel|first1=Hans-Peter|authorlink1=Hans-Peter Kriegel|last2=Kröger|first2=Peer|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|authorlink3=Arthur Zimek|title=Subspace clustering|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=July 2012|volume=2|issue=4|pages=351–364|doi=10.1002/widm.1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples for such clustering algorithms are CLIQUE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Agrawal | first1 = R. | last2 = Gehrke | first2 = J. | last3 = Gunopulos | first3 = D. | last4 = Raghavan | first4 = P. | title = Automatic Subspace Clustering of High Dimensional Data | doi = 10.1007/s10618-005-1396-1 | journal = Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | volume = 11 | pages = 5–33 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SUBCLU]].&lt;ref&gt;Karin Kailing, [[Hans-Peter Kriegel]] and Peer Kröger.

== Evaluation and assessment ==
Evaluation (or "validation") of clustering results is as difficult as the clustering itself.&lt;ref name="pfitzner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pfitzner|first1=Darius|last2=Leibbrandt|first2=Richard|last3=Powers|first3=David|date=2009|title=Characterization and evaluation of similarity measures for pairs of clusterings|journal=Knowledge and Information Systems|publisher=Springer|volume=19|pages=361–394|doi=10.1007/s10115-008-0150-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular approaches involve "''internal''" evaluation, where the clustering is summarized to a single quality score, "''external''" evaluation, where the clustering is compared to an existing "ground truth" classification, "''manual''" evaluation by a human expert, and "''indirect''" evaluation by evaluating the utility of the clustering in its intended application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Internal evaluation measures suffer from the problem that they represent functions that themselves can be seen as a clustering objective. For example, one could cluster the data set by the Silhouette coefficient; except that there is no known efficient algorithm for this. By using such an internal measure for evaluation, one rather compares the similarity of the optimization problems,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and not necessarily how useful the clustering is.

External evaluation has similar problems: if we have such "ground truth" labels, then we would not need to cluster; and in practical applications we usually do not have such labels. On the other hand, the labels only reflect one possible partitioning of the data set, which does not imply that there does not exist a different, and maybe even better, clustering.

Neither of these approaches can therefore ultimately judge the actual quality of a clustering, but this needs human evaluation,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Text Mining Handbook: Advanced Approaches in Analyzing Unstructured Data|last=Feldman|first=Ronen|last2=Sanger|first2=James|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|year=|isbn=0521836573|location=|pages=|oclc=915286380}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is highly subjective. Nevertheless, such statistics can be quite informative in identifying bad clusterings,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Text Mining: Predictive Methods for Analyzing Unstructured Information|last=Weiss|first=Sholom M.|last2=Indurkhya|first2=Nitin|last3=Zhang|first3=Tong|last4=Damerau|first4=Fred J.|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=0387954333|location=|pages=|oclc=803401334}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one should not dismiss subjective human evaluation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Internal evaluation ===
{{see also|Determining the number of clusters in a data set}}
When a clustering result is evaluated based on the data that was clustered itself, this is called internal evaluation. These methods usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters. One drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is that high scores on an internal measure do not necessarily result in effective information retrieval applications.&lt;ref name="Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan &amp; Hinrich Schutze"&gt;{{Cite book

 | isbn = 978-0-521-86571-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model. For example, k-means clustering naturally optimizes object distances, and a distance-based internal criterion will likely overrate the resulting clustering.

Therefore, the internal evaluation measures are best suited to get some insight into situations where one algorithm performs better than another, but this shall not imply that one algorithm produces more valid results than another.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; Validity as measured by such an index depends on the claim that this kind of structure exists in the data set. An algorithm designed for some kind of models has no chance if the data set contains a radically different set of models, or if the evaluation measures a radically different criterion.&lt;ref name="estivill" /&gt; For example, k-means clustering can only find convex clusters, and many evaluation indexes assume convex clusters. On a data set with non-convex clusters neither the use of k-means, nor of an evaluation criterion that assumes convexity, is sound.

More than a dozen of internal evaluation measures exist, usually based on the intuition that items in the same cluster should be more similar than items in different clusters.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title=Knowledge Discovery in Databases – Part III – Clustering|date=2017|url=https://dbs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/files/Team/eschubert/lectures/KDDClusterAnalysis17-screen.pdf|place=[[Heidelberg University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|115–121}} For example, the following methods can be used to assess the quality of clustering algorithms based on internal criterion:

* '''[[Davies–Bouldin index]]'''
:The [[Davies–Bouldin index]] can be calculated by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
DB = \frac {1} {n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max_{j\neq i}\left(\frac{\sigma_i + \sigma_j} {d(c_i,c_j)}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
:where n is the number of clusters, &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[centroid]] of cluster &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; is the average distance of all elements in cluster &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to centroid &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(c_i,c_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between centroids &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_j&lt;/math&gt;. Since algorithms that produce clusters with low intra-cluster distances (high intra-cluster similarity) and high inter-cluster distances (low inter-cluster similarity) will have a low Davies–Bouldin index, the clustering algorithm that produces a collection of clusters with the smallest [[Davies–Bouldin index]] is considered the best algorithm based on this criterion.

*'''[[Dunn index]]'''
:The Dunn index aims to identify dense and well-separated clusters. It is defined as the ratio between the minimal inter-cluster distance to maximal intra-cluster distance. For each cluster partition, the Dunn index can be calculated by the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | last = Dunn | first = J.
 | title = Well separated clusters and optimal fuzzy partitions
 | journal = Journal of Cybernetics
 | year = 1974
 | volume = 4
 | pages = 95–104
 | doi = 10.1080/01969727408546059
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
D = \frac{\min_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} d(i,j)}{\max_{1 \leq k \leq n} d^{\prime}(k)} \,,
&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''d''(''i'',''j'') represents the distance between clusters ''i'' and ''j'', and ''d'' '(''k'') measures the intra-cluster distance of cluster ''k''. The inter-cluster distance ''d''(''i'',''j'') between two clusters may be any number of distance measures, such as the distance between the [[centroids]] of the clusters. Similarly, the intra-cluster distance ''d'' '(''k'') may be measured in a variety ways, such as the maximal distance between any pair of elements in cluster ''k''. Since internal criterion seek clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity, algorithms that produce clusters with high Dunn index are more desirable.
* [[Silhouette (clustering)|Silhouette coefficient]]
:The silhouette coefficient contrasts the average distance to elements in the same cluster with the average distance to elements in other clusters. Objects with a high silhouette value are considered well clustered, objects with a low value may be outliers. This index works well with k-means clustering, and is also used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

=== External evaluation ===
In external evaluation, clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering, such as known class labels and external benchmarks. Such benchmarks consist of a set of pre-classified items, and these sets are often created by (expert) humans. Thus, the benchmark sets can be thought of as a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for evaluation.&lt;ref name="pfitzner"/&gt; These types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes. However, it has recently been discussed whether this is adequate for real data, or only on synthetic data sets with a factual ground truth, since classes can contain internal structure, the attributes present may not allow separation of clusters or the classes may contain [[Anomaly detection|anomalies]].&lt;ref name="Faerberetal2010"&gt;{{Cite conference

A number of measures are adapted from variants used to evaluate classification tasks. In place of counting the number of times a class was correctly assigned to a single data point (known as [[true positive]]s), such ''pair counting'' metrics assess whether each pair of data points that is truly in the same cluster is predicted to be in the same cluster.&lt;ref name="pfitzner"/&gt;

As with internal evaluation, several external evaluation measures exist,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|125–129}} for example:
* '''Purity''': Purity is a measure of the extent to which clusters contain a single class.&lt;ref name="Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan &amp; Hinrich Schutze"/&gt; Its calculation can be thought of as follows: For each cluster, count the number of data points from the most common class in said cluster. Now take the sum over all clusters and divide by the total number of data points. Formally, given some set of clusters &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and some set of classes &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, both partitioning &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data points, purity can be defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{m\in M}\max_{d\in D}{|m \cap d|}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Note that this measure doesn't penalize having many clusters. So for example, a purity score of 1 is possible by putting each data point in its own cluster. Also purity doesn't work well for imbalanced data: if a size 1000 dataset consists of two classes, one class contains 999 points and the other has only 1 point. No matter how bad a clustering algorithm performs, it will always give a very high purity value. 
* '''[[Rand measure]]''' (William M. Rand 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:The Rand index computes how similar the clusters (returned by the clustering algorithm) are to the benchmark classifications. One can also view the Rand index as a measure of the percentage of correct decisions made by the algorithm. It can be computed using the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
RI = \frac {TP + TN} {TP + FP + FN + TN}
&lt;/math&gt;
:where  &lt;math&gt;TP&lt;/math&gt; is the number of true positives, &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[true negative]]s, &lt;math&gt;FP&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[false positives]], and &lt;math&gt;FN&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[false negatives]]. One issue with the [[Rand index]] is that [[false positive]]s and [[false negative]]s are equally weighted. This may be an undesirable characteristic for some clustering applications. The F-measure addresses this concern,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018|reason=it does not achieve the same for chance correction as ARI}} as does the chance-corrected [[adjusted Rand index]].
*'''[[F-measure]]'''
:The F-measure can be used to balance the contribution of [[false negative]]s by weighting [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] through a parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Let '''[[precision (information retrieval)|precision]]''' and '''[[recall (information retrieval)|recall]]''' (both external evaluation measures in themselves) be defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac {TP } {TP + FP }
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
R = \frac {TP } {TP + FN}
&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[precision (information retrieval)|precision]] rate and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] rate. We can calculate the F-measure by using the following formula:&lt;ref name="Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan &amp; Hinrich Schutze"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
F_{\beta} = \frac {(\beta^2 + 1)\cdot P \cdot R } {\beta^2 \cdot P + R}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Notice that when &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_{0}=P&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] has no impact on the F-measure when &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;, and increasing &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; allocates an increasing amount of weight to recall in the final F-measure.
:Also note that &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; is not taken into account and can vary from 0 upward without bound.
* '''[[Jaccard coefficient|Jaccard index]]'''
:The Jaccard index is used to quantify the similarity between two datasets. The [[Jaccard coefficient|Jaccard index]] takes on a value between 0 and 1. An index of 1 means that the two dataset are identical, and an index of 0 indicates that the datasets have no common elements. The Jaccard index is defined by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
J(A,B) = \frac {|A \cap B| } {|A \cup B|} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP + FN}
&lt;/math&gt;
:This is simply the number of unique elements common to both sets divided by the total number of unique elements in both sets.
:Also note that &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; is not taken into account and can vary from 0 upward without bound.
* '''[[Sørensen–Dice coefficient|Dice index]]'''
:The Dice symmetric measure doubles the weight on &lt;math&gt;TP&lt;/math&gt; while still ignoring &lt;math&gt;TN&lt;/math&gt; and is equivalent to F1 – the F-measure with &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
DSC = \frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}
&lt;/math&gt;
* '''[[Fowlkes–Mallows Index|Fowlkes–Mallows index]]''' (E. B. Fowlkes &amp; C. L. Mallows 1983)&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Fowlkes &amp; C. L. Mallows (1983), "A Method for Comparing Two Hierarchical Clusterings", Journal of the American Statistical Association 78, 553–569.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Fowlkes–Mallows index computes the similarity between the clusters returned by the clustering algorithm and the benchmark classifications. The higher the value of the Fowlkes–Mallows index the more similar the clusters and the benchmark classifications are. It can be computed using the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
FM = \sqrt{ \frac {TP}{TP+FP} \cdot \frac{TP}{TP+FN}  }
&lt;/math&gt;
:where  &lt;math&gt;TP&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[true positive]]s, &lt;math&gt;FP&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[false positives]], and &lt;math&gt;FN&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[false negatives]]. The &lt;math&gt;FM&lt;/math&gt; index is the geometric mean of the [[precision (information retrieval)|precision]] and [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and is thus also known as the G-measure, while the F-measure is their harmonic mean.&lt;ref name="powers"&gt;{{cite conference | last = Powers | first = David | date = 2003 | conference = International Conference on Cognitive Science | pages = 529–534 | title = Recall and Precision versus the Bookmaker }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arabie | first1 = P. | year = | title = Comparing partitions | url = | journal = Journal of Classification | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[precision (information retrieval)|precision]] and [[recall (information retrieval)|recall]] are also known as Wallace's indices &lt;math&gt;B^I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^{II}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = D. L. | year = 1983 | title = Comment | url = | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 78 | issue = 383| pages = 569–579 | doi=10.1080/01621459.1983.10478009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance normalized versions of recall, precision and G-measure correspond to [[Informedness]], [[Markedness]] and [[Matthews correlation coefficient|Matthews Correlation]] and relate strongly to [[Cohen's kappa|Kappa]].&lt;ref name="kappa"&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Powers | first1 = David | title = The Problem with Kappa | conference = European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics | date = 2012 | pages = 345–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''[[mutual information]]''' is an [[information theory|information theoretic]] measure of how much information is shared between a clustering and a ground-truth classification that can detect a non-linear similarity between two clusterings. [[Adjusted mutual information|Normalized mutual information]] is a family of corrected-for-chance variants of this that has a reduced bias for varying cluster numbers.&lt;ref name = "pfitzner"/&gt;
* '''[[Confusion matrix]]'''
:A confusion matrix can be used to quickly visualize the results of a classification (or clustering) algorithm. It shows how different a cluster is from the gold standard cluster.

=== Cluster tendency ===

To measure cluster tendency is to measure to what degree clusters exist in the data to be clustered, and may be performed as an initial test, before attempting clustering. One way to do this is to compare the data against random data. On average, random data should not have clusters.

*'''[[Hopkins statistic]]'''
:There are multiple formulations of the [[Hopkins statistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; data points in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensional space. Consider a random sample (without replacement) of &lt;math&gt;m \ll n&lt;/math&gt; data points with members &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Also generate a set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; uniformly randomly distributed data points. Now define two distance measures, &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the distance of &lt;math&gt;y_i \in Y&lt;/math&gt; from its nearest neighbor in X and &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the distance of &lt;math&gt;x_i \in X&lt;/math&gt; from its nearest neighbor in X. We then define the Hopkins statistic as:
:&lt;math&gt;
H=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^m{u_i^d}}{\sum_{i=1}^m{u_i^d}+\sum_{i=1}^m{w_i^d}} \,,
&lt;/math&gt;
:With this definition, uniform random data should tend to have values near to 0.5, and clustered data should tend to have values nearer to 1.
:However, data containing just a single Gaussian will also score close to 1, as this statistic measures deviation from a ''uniform'' distribution, not [[Multimodal distribution|multimodality]], making this statistic largely useless in application (as real data never is remotely uniform).

== Applications ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

===Biology, computational biology and bioinformatics===
; [[Plant]] and [[animal]] [[ecology]]
:Cluster analysis is used to describe and to make spatial and temporal comparisons of communities (assemblages) of organisms in heterogeneous environments. It is also used in [[Systematics|plant systematics]] to generate artificial [[Phylogeny|phylogenies]] or clusters of organisms (individuals) at the species, genus or higher level that share a number of attributes.
; [[Transcriptomics]]
:Clustering is used to build groups of [[genes]] with related expression patterns (also known as coexpressed genes) as in [[HCS clustering algorithm]]. Often such groups contain functionally related proteins, such as [[enzyme]]s for a specific [[metabolic pathway|pathway]], or genes that are co-regulated. High throughput experiments using [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs) or [[DNA microarray]]s can be a powerful tool for [[genome annotation]]—a general aspect of [[genomics]].
; [[Sequence analysis]]
:[[Sequence clustering]] is used to group homologous sequences into [[list of gene families|gene families]]. This is a very important concept in [[bioinformatics]], and [[evolutionary biology]] in general. See evolution by [[gene duplication]].
; High-throughput [[genotype|genotyping]] platforms
:Clustering algorithms are used to automatically assign genotypes.
; [[Human genetic clustering]]
:The similarity of genetic data is used in clustering to infer population structures.

===[[Medicine]]===

:On [[PET scan]]s, cluster analysis can be used to differentiate between different types of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in a three-dimensional image for many different purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Filipovych |first1=Roman |last2=Resnick |first2=Susan M. |last3=Davatzikos |first3=Christos|title=Semi-supervised Cluster Analysis of Imaging Data |journal=NeuroImage |date=2011|volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=2185–2197 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.074|pmc=3008313 |pmid=20933091}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Analysis of antimicrobial activity
:Cluster analysis can be used to analyse patterns of antibiotic resistance, to classify antimicrobial compounds according to their mechanism of action, to classify antibiotics according to their antibacterial activity.
; IMRT segmentation
:Clustering can be used to divide a fluence map into distinct regions for conversion into deliverable fields in MLC-based Radiation Therapy.

===Business and marketing===
; [[Market research]]
:Cluster analysis is widely used in market research when working with multivariate data from [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and test panels. Market researchers use cluster analysis to partition the general [[population]] of [[consumer]]s into market segments and to better understand the relationships between different groups of consumers/potential [[customers]], and for use in [[market segmentation]], [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]], [[new product development]] and selecting test markets.
; Grouping of shopping items
:Clustering can be used to group all the shopping items available on the web into a set of unique products. For example, all the items on eBay can be grouped into unique products (eBay does not have the concept of a [[Stock-keeping unit|SKU]]).

===[[World wide web]]===
; Social network analysis
:In the study of [[social network]]s, clustering may be used to recognize [[communities]] within large groups of people.
; Search result grouping
:In the process of intelligent grouping of the files and websites, clustering may be used to create a more relevant set of search results compared to normal search engines like [[Google]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. There are currently a number of web-based clustering tools such as [[Clusty]]. It also may be used to return a more comprehensive set of results in cases where a search term could refer to vastly different things. Each distinct use of the term corresponds to a unique cluster of results, allowing a ranking algorithm to return comprehensive results by picking the top result from each cluster.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"&gt;Antonio Di Marco - Roberto Navigili,[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/COLI_a_00148#.VW4sDc_tmko "Clustering and Diversifying Web Search Results with Graph Based Word Sense Induction"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
; Slippy map optimization
:[[Flickr]]'s map of photos and other map sites use clustering to reduce the number of markers on a map. This makes it both faster and reduces the amount of visual clutter.

===[[Computer science]]===
; [[Software evolution]]
:Clustering is useful in software evolution as it helps to reduce legacy properties in code by reforming functionality that has become dispersed. It is a form of restructuring and hence is a way of direct preventative maintenance.
; [[Image segmentation]]
:Clustering can be used to divide a [[Digital data|digital]] [[image]] into distinct regions for [[border detection]] or [[object recognition]].&lt;ref name="panSearch"&gt;Bewley, A., &amp; Upcroft, B.

In Australian Conference on Robotics and Automation [http://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2013/papers/pap148s1-file1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Evolutionary algorithms]]
:Clustering may be used to identify different niches within the population of an evolutionary algorithm so that reproductive opportunity can be distributed more evenly amongst the evolving species or subspecies.
; [[Recommender systems]]
:Recommender systems are designed to recommend new items based on a user's tastes.  They sometimes use clustering algorithms to predict a user's preferences based on the preferences of other users in the user's cluster.
; [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Markov chain Monte Carlo methods]]
:Clustering is often utilized to locate and characterize extrema in the target distribution.
; [[Anomaly detection]]
:Anomalies/outliers are typically – be it explicitly or implicitly – defined with respect to clustering structure in data.
; [[Natural language processing]]
:Clustering can be used to resolve [[lexical ambiguity]].&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals.org"/&gt;

===Social science===
; Crime analysis
:Cluster analysis can be used to identify areas where there are greater incidences of particular types of crime. By identifying these distinct areas or "hot spots" where a similar crime has happened over a period of time, it is possible to manage law enforcement resources more effectively.
; [[Educational data mining]]
:Cluster analysis is for example used to identify groups of schools or students with similar properties.
; Typologies
:From poll data, projects such as those undertaken by the Pew Research Center use cluster analysis to discern typologies of opinions, habits, and demographics that may be useful in politics and marketing.

A '''''Compton telescope''''' (also known as Compton camera or Compton imager) is a [[gamma-ray]] detector which utilizes [[Compton scattering]] to determine the origin of the observed gamma rays.

Compton cameras are usually applied to detect gamma rays in the energy range where Compton scattering is the dominating interaction process, from a few hundred keV to several MeV. They are applied in fields such as [[astrophysics]], [[nuclear medicine]], and nuclear threat detection.

In astrophysics, the most famous Compton telescopes was [[CGRO#COMPTEL|COMPTEL]] aboard the [[CGRO|Compton Gamma-ray Observatory]], which pioneered the observation of the gamma-ray sky in the energy range between 0.75 and 30 MeV. A potential successor is [[Nuclear Compton Telescope|NCT]] - the Nuclear Compton Telescope.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7356">'''Cybernetic Serendipity''' was an exhibition of [[cybernetic art]] curated by [[Jasia Reichardt]], shown at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], London in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Gere]], ‘Minicomputer Experimentalism in the United Kingdom from the 1950s to 1980’ in [[Hannah Higgins]], &amp; [[Douglas Kahn]] (Eds.), Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press (2012), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and then touring the United States. Two stops in the US were the Corcoran Annex (Corcoran Gallery of Art), Washington, D.C., and the newly opened [[Exploratorium]]&lt;ref&gt;Acceptance speech for the AAM Distinguished Service Award - June 21, 1982, transcript, Frank Oppenheimer, Exploration and Discovery magazine, p9, San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; in San Francisco.

==Content==
One part of the exhibition was concerned with [[algorithm]]s and devices for generating music. Some exhibits were pamphlets describing the algorithms, whilst others showed [[musical notation]] produced by computers. Devices made musical effects and played tapes of sounds made by computers. [[Peter Zinovieff]] lent part of his studio equipment - visitors could sing or whistle a tune into a microphone and his equipment would improvise a piece of music based on the tune.

Another part described ''computer projects'' such as [[Gustav Metzger]]'s self-destructive ''Five screens with computer'', a design for a new hospital, a computer programmed structure, and dance choreography.

The machines and installations were a very noticeable part of the exhibition. [[Gordon Pask]] produced a collection of large mobiles with interacting parts that let the viewers join in the conversation. Many machines formed [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] environments or displayed moving images. [[Bruce Lacey]] contributed his radio-controlled robots and a light-sensitive owl. [[Nam June Paik]] was represented by ''Robot K-456'' and televisions with distorted images. [[Jean Tinguely]] provided two of his painting machines. [[Edward Ihnatowicz]]'s [[biomorphic]] hydraulic ear turned toward sounds and John Billingsley's ''Albert 1967'' turned to face light.  [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] presented his interactive cybernetic sculptures of vibrating stainless-steel rods, [[stroboscope|stroboscopic light]], and audio [[feedback control]].  Several artists exhibited machines that drew patterns that the visitor could take away, or involved visitors in games.  Cartoonist [[Rowland Emett]] designed the mechanical computer ''Forget-me-not'', which was commissioned by [[Honeywell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chrisbeetles.com/gallery/cartoon/honeywell-emett-forget-me-not-pheripheral-pachyderm-computer.html | title = THE HONEYWELL-EMETT 'FORGET-ME-NOT' (PHERIPHERAL PACHYDERM) COMPUTER | accessdate = 2013-11-18 | publisher = Chris Beetles Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another section explored the computer's ability to produce text - both essays and [[poetry]]. Different programs produced [http://www.in-vacua.com/cgi-bin/haiku.pl Haiku], children's stories, and [http://www.in-vacua.com/cgi-bin/mendoza.pl essays].

Computer generated movies were represented by [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]]'s ''permutations'' and a [[Bell Labs]] movie on their technology for producing movies. Some samples included images of [[teseract]]s rotating in four dimensions, a satellite orbiting the earth, and an animated [[data structure]].

[[Computer graphics]] were also represented, including pictures produced on [[cathode ray oscilloscope]]s and [[plotter|digital plotters]]. There was a variety of posters and graphics demonstrating the power of computers to do complex (and apparently random) calculations. Other graphics showed a simulated [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] and the iconic decreasing squares spiral that appeared on the exhibition's poster and book.  The [[Boeing Corporation]] exhibited their use of wireframe graphics.

[[Keith Albarn]] &amp; Partners contributed to the design of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/2/25/Reichardt_Jasia_ed_Cybernetic_Serendipidity_The_Computer_and_the_Arts.pdf Reichardt, J. ed 1968 ''a Studio International Special Issue'' London, Studio International p5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance==
''[[TIME]]'' magazine noted that there had been 40,000 visitors to the London exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838821,00.html | date = 1968-10-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | publisher = TIME | title = Cybernetic Serendipity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggested visitor numbers were as high as 44,000 to 60,000. However, ICA did  not accurately count visitors.&lt;ref name=daDA&gt;{{cite web|title=compArt database Digital Art (University of Bremen, Germany)|url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/exhibition/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After-Effects==
The exhibition provided the energy for the formation of British [[Computer Arts Society]] which continued to explore the interaction between science, technology and art, and put on exhibitions (for example "Event One" at the [[Royal College of Art]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hosted/cache/archive/PAGE/PAGE%201%20April%201969.pdf | date = 1969-04-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | publisher = BCS | title = PAGE 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). Several pieces were purchased by Exploratorium in 1971, some of which are on display to this day.

The '''Department of International Relations''' at [[Sakarya University]], located at the Esentepe campus, Serdivan, [[Sakarya Province|Sakarya]], provides undergraduate and graduate education about international politics. As a department within [[Faculty of Political Sciences at Sakarya University|Faculty of Political Sciences]], it has an integrated curriculum with other departments of this faculty such as public administration, and economics. Established in 1997, the department of international relations has more than 4.000 alumni including business leaders, journalists, diplomats, district governors, and academics. The department has 14 full-time faculty and 11 research assistants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.sakarya.edu.tr/tr&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Department of International Relations established in 1996 under the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. It admitted its first students during the academic year of 1997-1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.sakarya.edu.tr/en/icerik/7173/8384/tarihce&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the department inaugurated its PhD program. At the same year, the department started to send its students to Europe and receive students from European universities as part of [[Erasmus Programme]]. The Department of International Relations has continued to evolve, adding online graduate programs such as International Relations and European Union and Middle Eastern Studies in 2012. When the Faculty of Political Science was established in 2015, the department moved to this new faculty.

==Academics==
The Department of International Relations offers a standard graduate program with an option of a %30 English-language courses. Students can choose English-language equivalence of basic courses. The department also provides evening undergraduate education with same curriculum. In addition to graduate programs, the department offers MA, PhD and online graduate programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37440">'''Description logics''' ('''DL''') are a family of formal [[knowledge representation]] languages. Many DLs are more expressive than [[propositional logic]] but less expressive than [[first-order logic]]. In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) [[Decision problem|decidable]], and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy descriptions logics, and each description logic features a different balance between DL expressivity and [[Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning|reasoning]] [[Complexity_class|complexity]] by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DLs are used in [[artificial intelligence]] to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as ''terminological knowledge''). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and the [[Semantic Web]]: the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) and its profile is based on DLs. The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in [[biomedical informatics]] where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge.

==Introduction==
A description logic (DL) models ''concepts'', ''roles'' and ''individuals'', and their relationships.

The fundamental modeling concept of a DL is the ''axiom''—a logical statement relating roles and/or concepts.&lt;ref name="GHMPPS"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grau | first1 = B. C.  | last2 = Horrocks | first2 = I. | authorlink2 = Ian Horrocks| last3 = Motik | first3 = B. | last4 = Parsia | first4 = B. | last5 = Patel-Schneider | first5 = P. F. | last6 = Sattler | first6 = U. | authorlink6 = Ulrike Sattler| doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2008.05.001 | title = OWL 2: The next step for OWL | journal = Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–322 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/boris.motik/pubs/ghmppss08next-steps.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a key difference from the  [[semantic frames|frame]]s paradigm where a ''frame specification'' declares and completely defines a class.&lt;ref name="GHMPPS"/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
===Terminology compared to FOL and OWL===
The description logic community uses different terminology than the [[first-order logic]] (FOL) community for operationally equivalent notions; some examples are given below. The [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) uses again a different terminology, also given in the table below.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|+ Synonyms
|-
! FOL
! OWL
! DL
|-
| constant
| individual
| individual
|-
| unary predicate
| class
| concept
|-
| binary predicate
| property
| role
|}

===Naming convention===
There are many varieties of description logics and there is an informal naming convention, roughly describing the operators allowed. The [[Expressive power (computer science)|expressivity]] is encoded in the label for a logic starting with one of the following basic logics:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{AL}&lt;/math&gt; ||Attributive language. This is the base language which allows:
|-
| ||
* Atomic negation (negation of concept names that do not appear on the left-hand side of axioms)
* Concept intersection
* Universal restrictions
* Limited existential quantification
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FL}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Frame based description language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levesque | first1 = Hector J. | author1-link = Hector Levesque | last2 = Brachmann | first2 = Ronald J. | author2-link = Ronald Brachman | title = Expressiveness and tractability in knowledge representation and reasoning | journal = Computational Intelligence | year = 1987 | number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows:
|-
| ||
* Concept intersection
* Universal restrictions
* Limited existential quantification
* Role restriction
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{EL}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Existential language, allows:
|-
| ||
* Concept intersection
* Existential restrictions (of full existential quantification)
|}
Followed by any of the following extensions:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Functional properties, a special case of [[uniqueness quantification]].
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Full existential qualification (existential restrictions that have fillers other than &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Concept union.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Complex concept negation.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Role hierarchy (subproperties: &lt;code&gt;rdfs:subPropertyOf&lt;/code&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Limited complex role inclusion axioms; reflexivity and irreflexivity; role disjointness.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Nominals. (Enumerated classes of object value restrictions: &lt;code&gt;owl:oneOf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;owl:hasValue&lt;/code&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Inverse properties.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Cardinality restrictions (&lt;code&gt;owl:cardinality&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;owl:maxCardinality&lt;/code&gt;), a special case of [[counting quantification]]
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Qualified cardinality restrictions (available in OWL 2, cardinality restrictions that have fillers other than &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;).
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;  ||Use of datatype properties, data values or data types.
|}

====Exceptions====
Some canonical DLs that do not exactly fit this convention are:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;  ||An abbreviation for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; with transitive roles.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FL^-}&lt;/math&gt; ||A sub-language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FL}&lt;/math&gt;, which is obtained by disallowing role restriction. This is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{AL}&lt;/math&gt; without atomic negation.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FL}_o&lt;/math&gt;||A sub-language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FL^-}&lt;/math&gt;, which is obtained by disallowing limited existential quantification.
|-
| ||
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{EL^{++}}&lt;/math&gt;||Alias for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ELRO}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Frederick | last1 = Maier | first2 = Raghava | last2 = Mutharaju | first3 = Pascal | last3 = Hitzler | title = Distributed Reasoning with EL++ Using MapReduce | url = http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cse/243/ | year = 2010 | publisher = Technical Report, Kno.e.sis Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio | accessdate = 2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

====Examples====
As an example, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is a centrally important description logic from which comparisons with other varieties can be made. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is simply &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{AL}&lt;/math&gt; with complement of any concept allowed, not just atomic concepts. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; is used instead of the equivalent &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALUE}&lt;/math&gt;.

A further example, the description logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHIQ}&lt;/math&gt; is the logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; plus  extended cardinality restrictions, and transitive and inverse roles. The naming conventions aren't purely systematic so that the logic &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALCOIN}&lt;/math&gt; might be referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALCNIO}&lt;/math&gt; and abbreviations are made where possible,

The Protégé ontology editor supports &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHOIN}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;. Three major biomedical informatics terminology bases, [[SNOMED CT]], GALEN, and GO, are expressible in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{EL}&lt;/math&gt; (with additional role properties).

OWL 2 provides the expressiveness of  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SROIQ}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, OWL-DL is based on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHOIN}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, and for OWL-Lite it is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{SHIF}^\mathcal{(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
Description logic was given its current name in the 1980s. Previous to this it was called (chronologically): ''terminological systems'', and ''concept languages''.

===Knowledge representation===
[[semantic frames|Frame]]s and [[semantic network]]s lack formal (logic-based) semantics.&lt;ref name="DLHB"&gt;Franz Baader, Ian Horrocks, and Ulrike Sattler ''Chapter 3 Description Logics''. In Frank van Harmelen, Vladimir Lifschitz, and Bruce Porter, editors, ''Handbook of Knowledge Representation''. Elsevier, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; DL was first introduced into [[knowledge representation]] (KR) systems to overcome this deficiency.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

The first DL-based KR system was [[KL-ONE]] (by [[Ronald J. Brachman]] and Schmolze, 1985). During the '80s other DL-based systems using ''structural subsumption algorithms''&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; were developed including KRYPTON (1983), [[LOOM (ontology)|LOOM]] (1987), BACK (1988), K-REP (1991) and CLASSIC (1991). This approach featured DL with limited expressiveness but relatively efficient (polynomial time) reasoning.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

In the early '90s, the introduction of a new ''tableau based algorithm'' paradigm allowed efficient reasoning on more expressive DL.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; DL-based systems using these algorithms - such as KRIS (1991) - show acceptable reasoning performance on typical inference problems even though the worst case complexity is no longer polynomial.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

From the mid '90s, reasoners were created with good practical performance on very expressive DL with high worst case complexity.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; Examples from this period include FaCT,&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Tsarkov | first1 = D. | last2 = Horrocks | first2 = I. | chapter = FaCT++ Description Logic Reasoner: System Description | doi = 10.1007/11814771_26 | url = http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ian.horrocks/Publications/download/2006/TsHo06a.pdf| title = Automated Reasoning | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 4130 | pages = 292–297 | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-3-540-37187-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RACER system|RACER]] (2001), CEL (2005), and [[KAON|KAON 2]] (2005).

==Modeling==
In DL, a distinction is drawn between the so-called [[Tbox|TBox]] (terminological box) and the [[Abox|ABox]] (assertional box). In general, the TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies (i.e., relations between [[concept]]s) while the ABox contains [[ground sentence]]s stating where in the hierarchy individuals belong (i.e., relations between individuals and concepts). For example, the statement:

{{NumBlk|:|Every employee is a person|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

belongs in the TBox, while the statement:

{{NumBlk|:|Bob is an employee|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

belongs in the ABox.

Note that the TBox/ABox distinction is not significant, in the same sense that the two "kinds" of sentences are not treated differently in first-order logic (which subsumes most DL). When translated into first-order logic, a subsumption [[axiom]] like ({{EquationNote|1}}) is simply a conditional restriction to [[unary operation|unary]] [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s (concepts) with only variables appearing in it. Clearly, a sentence of this form is not privileged or special over sentences in which only constants ("grounded" values) appear like ({{EquationNote|2}}).

So why was the distinction introduced? The primary reason is that the separation can be useful when describing and formulating decision-procedures for various DL. For example, a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately, in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one ('classification' is related to the TBox, 'instance checking' to the ABox). Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decision-procedure for a certain DL, independently of the ABox. Thus, it is useful to have a way to talk about that specific part of the [[knowledge base]].

The secondary reason is that the distinction can make sense from the knowledge base modeler's perspective. It is plausible to distinguish between our conception of terms/concepts in the world (class axioms in the TBox) and particular manifestations of those terms/concepts (instance assertions in the ABox). In the above example: when the hierarchy within a company is the same in every branch but the assignment to employees is different in every department (because there are other people working there), it makes sense to reuse the TBox for different branches that do not use the same ABox.

There are two features of description logic that are not shared by most other data description formalisms: DL does not make the [[Unique name assumption]] (UNA) or the [[Closed-world assumption]] (CWA). Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent. Not having CWA, or rather having the [[Open world assumption]] (OWA) means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact.

==Formal description==
Like [[first-order logic]] (FOL), a [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]] defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a description logic, and [[semantics]] determine meaning. Unlike FOL, a DL may have several well known syntactic variants.&lt;ref name="HS"/&gt;

===Syntax===
The syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition, in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated. Some constructors are related to logical constructors in [[first-order logic]] (FOL) such as ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' or ''[[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[union (set theory)|union]]'' or ''[[disjunction]]'' of concepts, ''[[negation]]'' or ''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]'' of concepts, ''[[Universal quantifier|universal restriction]]'' and ''[[Existential quantifier|existential restriction]]''. Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example, inverse, [[transitive relation|transitivity]] and functionality.

====Notation====
Let C and D be concepts, a and b be individuals, and R be a role.

If a is R-related to b, then b is called an R-successor of a.

====The description logic ALC====
The prototypical DL ''Attributive Concept Language with Complements'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt;) was introduced by Manfred Schmidt-Schauß and Gert Smolka in 1991, and is the basis of many more expressive DLs.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;N_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_O&lt;/math&gt;  be (respectively) [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of ''concept names'' (also known as ''atomic concepts''), ''role names'' and ''individual names'' (also known as ''individuals'', ''nominals'' or ''objects''). Then the ordered triple (&lt;math&gt;N_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_O&lt;/math&gt;) is the ''signature''.

=====Concepts=====
The set of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ALC}&lt;/math&gt; ''concepts'' is the smallest set such that:

* The following are ''concepts'':
** &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (''top'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; (''bottom'' is a ''concept'')
** Every &lt;math&gt;A \in N_C&lt;/math&gt; (all ''atomic concepts'' are ''concepts'')
* If &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are ''concepts'' and &lt;math&gt;R \in N_R&lt;/math&gt; then the following are ''concepts'':
** &lt;math&gt;C\sqcap D&lt;/math&gt; (the intersection of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;C\sqcup D&lt;/math&gt; (the union of two ''concepts'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\neg C&lt;/math&gt; (the complement of a ''concept'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\forall R.C&lt;/math&gt; (the universal restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'')
** &lt;math&gt;\exists R.C&lt;/math&gt; (the existential restriction of a ''concept'' by a ''role'' is a ''concept'')

=====Terminological axioms=====
A ''general concept inclusion'' (GCI) has the form &lt;math&gt;C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are ''concepts''. Write &lt;math&gt;C \equiv D&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D \sqsubseteq C&lt;/math&gt;. A ''TBox'' is any finite set of GCIs.

=====Assertional axioms=====
{{Anchor|concept_assertion}}
* A ''concept assertion'' is a statement of the form &lt;math&gt;a : C&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;a \in N_O&lt;/math&gt; and C is a ''concept''.
* A ''role assertion'' is a statement of the form &lt;math&gt;(a,b) : R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a, b \in N_O&lt;/math&gt;  and R is a ''role''.

An ''ABox'' is a finite set of assertional axioms.

=====Knowledge base=====
A ''knowledge base'' (KB) is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; for [[Tbox|TBox]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Abox|ABox]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Semantics===
The [[semantics]] of description logics are defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of ordered pairs of individuals. Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain. The semantics of non-atomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles. This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax.

====The description logic ALC====
The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

A ''terminological interpretation'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}=(\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}, \cdot^{\mathcal{I}})&lt;/math&gt; over a ''signature'' &lt;math&gt;(N_C,N_R,N_O)&lt;/math&gt; consists of
* a non-empty set &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; called the [[domain of discourse|''domain'']]
* a ''interpretation function'' &lt;math&gt;\cdot^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; that maps:
** every ''individual'' &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to an element &lt;math&gt;a^{\mathcal{I}} \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
** every ''concept'' to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
** every ''role name'' to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{\mathcal{I}}  \times \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
such that
* &lt;math&gt;\top^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\bot^{\mathcal{I}} = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(C \sqcup D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cup D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; ''([[union (set theory)|union]] means [[disjunction]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(C \sqcap D)^{\mathcal{I}} = C^{\mathcal{I}} \cap D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt; ''([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] means [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(\neg C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} \setminus C^{\mathcal{I}} &lt;/math&gt; ''([[complement (set theory)|complement]] means [[negation]])''
* &lt;math&gt;(\forall R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \text{for} \; \text{every} \; y, (x,y) \in R^{\mathcal{I}} \;  \text{implies} \; y \in C^{\mathcal{I}} \} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\exists R.C)^{\mathcal{I}} = \{x \in \Delta^{\mathcal{I}} | \text{there} \; \text{exists} \; y, (x,y) \in R^{\mathcal{I}} \; \text{and} \; y \in C^{\mathcal{I}}\} &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models&lt;/math&gt; (read ''in I holds'') as follows

=====TBox=====
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models C \sqsubseteq D&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;C^{\mathcal{I}} \subseteq D^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \Phi&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\Phi \in \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;

=====ABox=====
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models a : C&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a^{\mathcal{I}} \in C^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models (a,b) : R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;(a^{\mathcal{I}},b^{\mathcal{I}}) \in R^{\mathcal{I}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;

=====Knowledge base=====
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K} = (\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; be a knowledge base.

* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \models \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Inference==
===Decision problems===
In addition to the ability to describe concepts formally, one also would like to employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described. The most common decision problems are basic database-query-like questions like ''instance checking'' (is a particular instance (member of an A-box) a member of a given concept) and ''relation checking'' (does a relation/role hold between two instances, in other words does '''a''' have property '''b'''), and the more global-database-questions like ''subsumption'' (is a concept a subset of another concept), and ''concept consistency'' (is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions). The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the T-box (having cycles, allowing non-atomic concepts to include each other), usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems (see [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ezolin/dl/ Description Logic Complexity Navigator] for examples).

==Relationship with other logics==
===First-order logic===
Many DLs are [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] [[fragment (logic)|fragments]] of [[first-order logic]] (FOL)&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; and are usually fragments of [[two-variable logic]] or [[guarded logic]]. In addition, some DLs have features that are not covered in FOL; this includes ''concrete domains'' (such as integer or strings, which can be used as ranges for roles such as ''hasAge'' or ''hasName'') or an operator on roles for the transitive closure of that role.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

===Fuzzy description logic===
Fuzzy description logics combines [[fuzzy logic]] with DLs. Since many concepts that are needed for [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent systems]] lack well defined boundaries, or precisely defined criteria of membership, fuzzy logic is needed to deal with notions of vagueness and imprecision. This offers a motivation for a generalization of description logic towards dealing with imprecise and vague concepts.

===Modal logic===
Description logic is related to—but developed independently of—[[modal logic]] (ML).&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt; Many—but not all—DL are syntactic variants of ML.&lt;ref name="DLHB"/&gt;

In general, an object corresponds to a [[Kripke semantics|possible world]], a concept corresponds to a modal proposition, and a role-bounded quantifier to a modal operator with that role as its accessibility relation.

Operations on roles (such as composition, inversion, etc.) correspond to the modal operations used in [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].&lt;ref name=CTTL&gt;{{cite web|last=Schild|first=Klaus|title=Correspondence theory for terminological logics: Preliminary Report|url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ezolin/dl/bib/Correspondence_theory_for_terminological_logics_%28IJCAI_1991%29.pdf|work=KIT Report 91|publisher=KIT-BACK|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTTL"/&gt;

===Temporal description logic===
Temporal description logic represents—and allows reasoning about—time dependent concepts and many different approaches to this problem exist.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Artale and Enrico Franconi "Temporal Description Logics". In "Handbook of Temporal Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a description logic might be combined with a [[modal logic|modal]] [[temporal logic]] such as [[linear temporal logic]].

The '''Digital Writing and Research Lab (DWRL)''' is a research lab at [[The University of Texas at Austin]], United States, dedicated to the identification and promotion of twenty-first-century literacies. These literacies range from navigating online newsfeeds and participating in social networking sites to composing multimedia texts that require producing, sampling, and/or remixing media content.

The lab is staffed by graduate student researchers and instructors at The University of Texas at Austin who participate in research groups, teach in computer classrooms, and hold workshops on digital pedagogy. ''"Staff work involves both routine classroom support and participation in on-going Lab projects such as the development of computer-based instructional materials (courseware) and documentation, as well as identification and documentation of successful pedagogical practices and research into other pedagogical applications of computer technology."''&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1985 as the Computer Research Lab (CRL), the lab was known as the Computer Writing and Research Lab (CWRL) from the 1990s to 2010, when it became the Digital Writing and Research Lab (DWRL).

== Programs ==
The DWRL launches yearly programs offering instructors tools to teach communicative competencies. These competencies include: proficiency in software packages and technological devices; the ability to collaborate across barriers; confidence in producing, analyzing and sharing information in various digital formats; and skills to manage, analyze, and synthesize multiple streams of simultaneous information.

== Publications ==

* "'[http://jump.dwrl.utexas.edu/ The Journal for Undergraduate Multimedia Projects]'" - "TheJUMP" publishes submissions from undergraduate students that display successful engagement with digital technologies and use rhetorical elements to make an argument, tell a story, or share research. Essential to the mission of "TheJUMP" is the promotion of discourse about multimedia pedagogy and student learning. To that end, each piece is published alongside course and assignment information as well as reflections from the student author and his/her instructor and responses from two members of "TheJUMP" editorial collective.

== Initiatives ==
Each year, the DWRL designs and implements research projects.  These year-long initiatives enhance graduate instructors' professional and teaching portfolios. The research produced results in [[white papers]], conference presentations, [[video clip|videos]], and pedagogical resources like lesson plans. Project leaders, members and [[lab specialists]] also offer [[workshops]] throughout the year which share tools for pedagogical innovation.  The results of the research conducted in the project groups is presented every year at the [[DWRL Final Showcase]] as well as archived online.

=== Research initiatives ===
* '''Gaming Pedagogy''' - The group is researching the potential and applicability of a games in the classroom, whether those be tabletop games, educational games, commercial video games, or games made by independent groups and will publish an eBook to showcase their findings. They are building on the work of the Immersive Environments group, which has explores the intersections among gaming, pedagogy, and virtual worlds and which designed and implemented two games in the rhetoric classroom: "Rhetorical Peaks'' and "Battle Lines".
* '''Audio Video Research''' - Now in its second year, the ARVG group is creating an audio podcast series spotlighting intersections of rhetoric and technology. The 2011-12 group collaborated with the Undergraduate Writing Center on the WRITE series—videos that feature writers at all levels talking about their writing processes—as well as a prototype for an online tutorial series.
* '''Currents in Electronic Literacy''' - In addition to soliciting, editing, and publishing the [[annual issue]] of the DWRL’s e-journal Currents in Electronic Literacy, members of the group research digital publication platforms and optimization strategies for mobile viewing.
* '''Visual Rhetoric''' - In addition to producing the DWRL’s award-winning visual rhetoric blog, viz., the Visual Rhetoric group have collaborated with the Harry Ransom Center (HRC). The group will engage with the HRC's collections and exhibitions to extend their research in visual rhetoric.
* '''The Journal for Undergraduate Multimedia Projects (TheJUMP)''' - This group publishes TheJUMP twice annually and serves as a resource for other DWRL members on issues of accessibility and undergraduate publication.

== Courses and classrooms ==
The courses taught throughout the DWRL are Rhetoric and English classes which benefit from a computer-learning environment. Computer classrooms allow students access to learning technologies including their own Mac desktop computer. Instructors control a teacher station through which they are able to project images, websites and video.  All students enrolled in courses conducted in computer classrooms have access to a computer lab.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The DWRL began in 1985 with the acquisition of twelve [[IBM]] microcomputers as a result of a Project QUEST grant to the University of Texas at Austin.  English department faculty member Jerome Bump and his graduate students later arranged for the machines to be moved from the University Writing Center (housed in the English department) to vacant space in the basement of the Undergraduate Library.  This space was deemed the Computer Research Lab (CRL) and marked the beginning of the research into computer-based writing at The University of Texas at Austin.

In fall 1986 Bump offered a graduate seminar on rhetoric and computers, which he co-taught with Lt. Col. Hugh Burns.  Burns, who worked in the Intelligent Systems Division at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, had written the first dissertation in what became the academic field of Computers and Writing.  Graduate students in this seminar sought to advance Burns’s efforts to explore how the computer could serve less as a “teaching machine” and more as a constructive partner in dialogue with student-writers.&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Theoretically, this work aligned well with the emerging “process” model of writing instruction, and Burns’s presence lent national credibility to the group. Burns coined the name of the new Computer Research Lab.

Participants in the newly established lab dedicated their efforts to finding alternative models for the writing classroom. The lab’s first [[local area network (LAN)]] allowed computers in the lab to be linked to one another, as well as to machines in an adjacent instructional room.  This arrangement eventually enabled colleagues from the English department to teach first-year English courses in the CRL’s first "computational classroom" as Bump and his graduate students called it.

=== Early products ===
Graduate student Fred Kemp’s software ''Idealog'' focused on invention or pre-writing, while his colleague Paul Taylor’s ''Descant'' assisted revision. Other students, moving away from the “process” instructional model that underpinned these two, developed programs of their own that prioritized social interaction.  These included Locke Carter’s ''In-Class Mail'' and Paul Taylor’s ''Forum5''.  Even though the programs emerged from different theoretical assumptions, they could be used together.&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

They also supplied the foundation for the most notable achievement of the lab’s formative years, the [http://www.daedalus.com/products_diwe_overview.asp ''Daedalus Integrated Writing Environment'' (DIWE)], a suite of applications that integrated elements of the writing process. DIWE included four major modules: ''Invent, Respond, Mail'' (an asynchronous, internal messaging system), and ''InterChange'' (a conferencing system that allowed for synchronous—real-time—interaction among students and instructors). Several scholars went on to praise ''InterChange'', in particular, for its capacity to transform the dynamics of a writing classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998.p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focus on Digital Pedagogy ===
In January 1989, under the leadership of director John Slatin, the lab’s staff began to assemble an archive of pedagogical texts—materials associated with the lab’s attempts to conduct writing instruction in computer classrooms—and co-hosted the sixth Conference on Computers and Writing.

Slatin wrote a funding proposal that increased the university-wide visibility of the CRL, eventually establishing computer labs and networks and disseminating new DIWE software across departments on UT-Austin’s campus.  Funding for additional labs and multimedia hardware also tightened the ties between the CRL and the English department and, later, the new Division of Rhetoric and Composition (which, upon its creation in 1993, assumed administrative oversight of the CRL).&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. pp. 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lab’s institutional growth continued with the hiring in 1994 of faculty member Margaret Syverson, trained in Computers and Writing, and the recruitment of additional graduate students. Syverson directed the rechristened Computer Writing and Research Lab from 1994 to 2004.

From 2004 to 2008 Clay Spinuzzi directed the CWRL. In 2004 the CWRL hired current systems administrator D. Hampton Finger, who facilitated the lab's switch to [[Drupal]] for its web content management.  This shift allowed for greater accessibility and made personal [[Drupal]] installations available for instructors.  As a result of a university pilot program using WebXM to ensure web accessibility, in October 2006 the CWRL lowered its webpage's structural accessibility violations from 3100 pages to zero.

During 2004-2005, the CWRL created a workgroup model in which workgroup leaders assemble small teams to work on particular projects, allowing for greater continuity from year to year.  From 2006 to 2008, the CWRL pursued outside partnerships. The lab redeveloped and rationalized archives of English and rhetoric exercises in a system called eFiles, and developed [http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu viz.], a blog about visual rhetoric.

'''Edwardian Baroque''' is the [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] architectural style of many public buildings built in the [[British Empire]] during the [[Edwardian era]] (1901–1910).

==Description==
The characteristic features of the Edwardian Baroque style were drawn from two main sources: the architecture of France during the 18th century and that of Sir [[Christopher Wren]] in [[England]] during the 17th—part of the [[English Baroque]]. [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] was a major exponent, designing many commercial buildings in what he termed 'the Grand Style' during the later 1910s and 1920s. This period of British architectural history is considered a particularly retrospective one, since it is contemporary with [[Art Nouveau]].

Typical details of Edwardian Baroque architecture include extensive [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]], usually more extreme at ground level, often running into and exaggerating the [[voussoir]]s of arched openings (derived from French models); domed corner rooftop pavilions and a central taller tower-like element creating a lively rooftop silhouette; revived Italian Baroque elements such as exaggerated keystones, segmental arched pediments, columns with engaged blocks, attached block-like rustication to window surrounds; [[colonnades]] of (sometimes paired) columns in the [[Ionic order]] and domed towers modelled closely on Wren's for the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]]. Some Edwardian Baroque buildings include details from other sources, such as the [[Dutch gable]]s of [[Norman Shaw]]'s [[Le Meridien Hotel Piccadilly|Piccadilly Hotel]] in [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12262">'''Eye music''' (often referred to in English by its exact German translation ''Augenmusik'') describes graphical features of [[Sheet music|score]]s that when performed are unnoticeable by the listener.

==Difficulties in defining eye music==
A clear definition of eye music is elusive, for the border between eye music, [[word painting]], and representations of melody and form depends on the relationships of composer, performer, and listener.&lt;ref name="dart"&gt;Dart, Thurston. "Eye music." New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Stanley Sadie, ed. London:Macmillan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye music and puzzle-solving===
The difficulty in definition is also apparent with border-line cryptographic [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] works such as [[Canon (music)#Puzzle canon|puzzle canons]], which appear in the score entirely as a bare line of notes with [[clefs]], [[Rest (music)|rests]], [[time signature]]s, or [[key signatures]] as clues to reveal multiple lines of music in canon. (Closer to true cryptographic works would be those with [[soggetto cavato]], where letters are embedded in the work using their [[solfège]] names.)&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; As an example, a puzzle canon might be notated as one line of music with two key signatures and clefs, where the worked-out result will be a two-voice canon with one voice the [[Canon (music)#Retrograde|retrograde]] (reverse) of the other. In itself the score with the clues alone is not eye music. But represent the same work "graphically spelled out," however, say with a drawing of the clued score facing a mirror, and the score/drawing becomes eye music.&lt;ref&gt;For many such figures of music graphically portrayed in mirrors, helixes, etc. ''see'' Hofstadter, Douglas R. Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (New York: Basic Books [1979] 1999. {{ISBN|0-394-75682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''type'' of puzzle canon is also a factor. A four-voiced circular canon, when notated as a puzzle canon, may remain an un-worked-out single line of notes, and be inadmissible as eye music. When that single line of notes is inscribed in a graphical shape it becomes eye music, even if the [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] puzzle remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt;

An even finer use of graphical conceit is when the canon does not have any musical way to end, and are in a sense "infinite"—classically referred to as ''canon perpetuus,'' more commonly as "circular canons," and even more commonly as "[[round (music)|rounds]]." When an infinite (circular) canon is inscribed in a circle, and the ''circle itself'' is a  clue that means "play me as a round," a different type of eye music entails.

===Eye music for the performer===
Another class of eye music is when the score is purposely made difficult for the performer.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; For example, in [[Benedetto Marcello]]'s cantata ''Stravaganze d’amore,'' the [[Figured bass|continuo]] part is written entirely in [[enharmonic]] chords, that is, "puns" of chord indications spelled with no regard to the key of the rest of the ensemble, but (in [[equal temperament]]) indistinguishable audibly from those spelled in the appropriate way. Here, the perverse spelling (whether humorous or annoying to the trained continuo player) is not unusual graphically, but represents a score writing unmotivated except as an inside joke between composer and performer, and is unhearable by the listener.

The ''Gulliver Suite'' by [[Telemann]] discussed below, shows a combination of three eye music features. The score is made difficult "unnecessarily," is eye-catching for its graphics, and has a clever external reference, all unnoticeable to the listener.

==The Renaissance==
[[Image:Cordier circular canon.gif|170 px|thumb|right|[[Baude Cordier]]'s ''Tout par compas suy composés.'']] 
[[Image:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|left|Cordier's ''Belle, bonne, sage'' with a red notation heart of notes within the larger heart.]]Two examples of eye music from the early Renaissance are from [[Baude Cordier]], (ca. 1380-ca.1440). Cordier's chanson about love ''Belle, bonne, sage'' is in a heart shape, with red notes ([[Ars subtilior#Notational characteristics|coloration]]) indicating rhythmic alterations. Eye-music-within-eye music is in the small group of notes hanging like a locket in the upper left, also all in red and in the shape of a heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icking-music-archive.org/ByComposer/Cordier.php A modern transcription and music media file of "''Belle, bonne, sage.''"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another work of Cordier, this time inscribed in circles, ''Tout par compas suy composés'' ("With a compass was I composed"), goes out of its way to identify itself as eye music.&lt;ref&gt;Bergsagel, John. "Cordier's Circular Canon." ''The Musical Times,'' 113:1558 (Dec., 1972), pp. 1175-1177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josquin des Prez]], the most important composer of the next generation, used [[Mensural notation#Note values|black note notation]] eye music in his well-known ''Nymphes des bois,'' a lament over the death of the composer [[Ockeghem]], as well as another lament, this time for the composer [[Jacob Obrecht]], ''Absolve, quaesumus, Domine.''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Elders, Willem. "Zeichen und Symbol in der altniederländischen Totenklage." In Zeichen und Struktur in der Musik der Renaissance: Ein Symposium aus Anlaß der Jahrestagung der Gesellschaft für Musikforschung Münster. Westfalen (1987) pp. 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It can be seen that words of death and lament are associated with black notes, a [[mannerism]] made even simpler to achieve in light of the contemporaneous simplification to [[Mensural notation#Note values|white note]] notation. This feature of eye music would extend through the [[Humanism|Humanist]] period.

[[Image:Dosi_allegory_canon.png|thumb|left|A detail from [[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Allegory of Music'' with an anonymous [[canon (music)|canon]] notated in a circle and a canon by [[Josquin]] notated in a triangle. (The notes of the triangular canon can be seen on the original painting under raking light.)]] Another instance of eye music in the Renaissance is apparently unique—the representation of a triangle for a canonic piece, which appears in juxtaposition with an anonymous canon written in a circle—in [[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Allegory of Music.''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Slim, H. Colin. "Dosso Dossi's Allegory at Florence about Music." ''Journal of the American Musicological Society.'' 43:No. 1 (April 1990), pp. 43–98.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the two types of representation—the circle and the inherent symbolism of the tenets of Christianity in the triangle—are both suggestive of a sense of the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;A transcription of the canon written as a circle is in Slim, pp. 53-55. The triangle canon is transcribed on p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The work represented in the triangle, is part of a "rough" version of a puzzle canon in Josquin's Agnus Dei II from his ''[[Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales]]'' canonic mass. It has the superscript "trinitas in un[um]" ("three in one") as a clue to its solution, is a [[Canon (music)#Mensuration and tempo canons|mensuration canon]] of 3:1, and has one voice take part at the interval of a fifth, that is, 3:2. Its relation to the Christian [[Holy Trinity]] is clear, suggesting the use of a triangular representation. The representation is unique, although possibly from a copy used by Dossi.&lt;ref&gt;On the implication of "transcendance" expressed by the theoretically infinite repetition in many canons, ''see'' Chafe, Eric. " Allegorical Music: The "Symbolism" of Tonal Language in the Bach Canons." ''The Journal of Musicology'' 3:4 (Autumn, 1984), pp. 340-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanism==
[[Image:John bull sphera mundi.gif|thumb|[[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]]'s 6-part circular canon ''Sphera mundi.'' (From an 18th-century MS.)]]With the significant shift of style of composers of the [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] movement—the rediscovery and translation of Greek texts in the mid-16th century—eye music flourished. The change in musical practice, particularly with the [[madrigal (music)|madrigalists]] and their focus on text declamation, at a word-by-word basis, was fertile ground for eye music. Words that suggest "blackness," such as "death" or "night," receive "black" notes (e.g. [[quarter note]]s, [[eighth note]]s); "white words" such as "light" or "pale" receive "white" notes (e.g. [[whole note]]s, [[half note]]s).&lt;ref name="einstein1"&gt;Einstein, Alfred. "Augenmusik im Madrigal." ''Zeitschrift für internationazional Musikgesellschaft,'' XIX (1912–13), pp. 8–21; partly trans. in The Italian Madrigal, transl. Krappe, [[Roger Sessions|Sessions]], and [[Oliver Strunk|Strunk]]. 3 Vol. Princeton:Princeton University Press, (1949) 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Italian madrigalists from the 1580s until the early 17th century (whose style was almost literally imported to England), eye music reached its apogee until its transformation in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="einstein2"&gt;''See'' Einstein, Alfred. The Italian Madrigal, transl. Krappe, [[Roger Sessions|Sessions]], and [[Oliver Strunk|Strunk]]. 3 Vol. Princeton:Princeton University Press, (1949) 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luca Marenzio]] is considered the composer most fond of eye music.&lt;ref name="einstein2"/&gt; For example, in the madrigal ''Senza il mia sole'' from his ''Madrigali a quattro, cinque e sei voci'' (1588), black notes are used for "chiuser le luci" ("close their eyes")&lt;ref&gt;Steele, John. "Lamenting Marenzio." ''The Musical Times,'' 120:1636 (June, 1979), pp. 497 and 499.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Marenzio's standing among madrigalists and his use of eye music, ''see'' Lang, Paul Henry. "Editorial." ''The Musical Quarterly '' 35:3 (July 1949), pp. 437-447.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reaction by theorists of the time was mixed. A leading musical humanist, [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (the father of the physicist), was opposed to it but [[Zarlino]] approved.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; In the 20th century, [[Alfred Einstein]], a groundbreaking scholar of the Humanist madrigal, wrote that eye music is "the most extreme and (for our aesthetic convictions) most horrible testimony of naturalism, of ''imitazione,'' in the madrigal."&lt;ref&gt;''Das übertriebenste und (für unser ästhetisches Empfinden) grausamste Zeugnis des Naturalismus, der imitazione, im Madrigal.'' Einstein,'' Op. cit.'', p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque==
[[Image:Telemann Gulliver Suite.jpg|thumb|right|The notes for scampering Lilliputians and ponderous Brobdingnag in [[Telemann]]'s ''Gulliver Suite.'' {{audio|Telemann Gulliver Suite Lilliputian.mid|Play Chaconne}} and {{audio|Telemann Gulliver Suite Brobigdinian.mid|Play gigue}}]]

In [[Telemann]]'s ''Gulliver Suite'' for two violins the note values in the [[chaconne]] are "[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputian]]",  and, in the [[gigue]], are [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|"Brobdingnagian"]] ones. Because the Lilliputian movement is written in the bizarre [[time signature]] of {{music|time|3|32}}, and the Brobdingnagian one in the equally obtuse {{music|time|24|1}} (which is doubly humorous because gigues are generally light and brisk), the time signatures reduce to {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|12|8}}, perfectly normal ones for each movement, as are the tempos associated with them and the type of dance of each.

==20th century==
Post-tonal music has seen an expansion of eye music in line with its expansion and experimentalism of musical techniques. The last examples using a rigorous scoring system rooted in standard practice are the finely turned circles and spirals (as well as a peace symbol and a crucifix) in the works of [[George Crumb]].

===Graphic notation===
The beauties of many examples of [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] are not, in fact, a feature of eye music. As novel and attractive as the graphics may be in these scores, they function entirely as performance indications or true records of compositional method (such as the Steiner score shown here). Also often seen are graphical or [[conceptual art]] works that use the symbols of music notation but are not performing scores at all, such as  [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s 1919 ''In futurum (Zeitmaß-zeitlos).''{{cn|date=August 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7325">'''The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse''' is a term for [[internet]] [[criminal]]s, or the [[image]]ry of internet criminals.

==Popular usage==
A play on [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], it refers to types of criminals who use the internet to facilitate crime and consequently jeopardize the rights of honest internet users. There does not appear to be an exact definition for who the Horsemen are, but they are usually described as [[Terrorism|terrorist]]s, [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]s, [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Other sources use slightly different descriptions but generally refer to the same types of criminals. The term was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Timothy C. May]] in 1988, who referred to them as "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The term seems to be used less often in discussions about online criminal activity, but more often in discussions about the negative, or [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effects]] such activity has had on regular users' daily experiences online.
It is also used frequently to describe the political tactic "[[Think of the children]]".  A message from the [[Cypherpunk|same]] mailing list states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quotation|How to get what you want in 4 easy stages:
# Have a target "thing" you wish to stop, yet lack any moral, or practical reasons for doing so?
# Pick a fear common to lots of people, something that will evoke a gut reaction: terrorists, pedophiles, serial killers.
# Scream loudly to the media that "thing" is being used by perpetrators.  (Don't worry if this is true, or common to all other things, or less common with "thing" than with other long established systems—payphones, paper mail, private hotel rooms, lack of bugs in all houses etc.)
# Say that the only way to stop perpetrators is to close down "thing", or to regulate it to death, or to have laws forcing en masse tapability of all private communications on "thing".  Don't worry if communicating on "thing" is a constitutionally protected right, if you have done a good job in choosing and publicising the horsemen in 2, no one will notice, they will be too busy clamouring for you to save them from the supposed evils.

==Examples==

In 2013, the director of the Safe Internet League (a voluntary [[Internet censorship in Russia|censorship group in Russia]]) claimed that pedophiles, perverts, drug dealers “and other creeps”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia’s FSB mulls ban on ‘Tor’ online anonymity network|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/russia-tor-anonymizer-ban-571/|website=Russia Today|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; were using the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] anonymity software, as a reason why the software should be outlawed.  This list did not mention terrorists or money-launderers directly, but did use the catch-all phrase "other creeps" that potentially includes them.

In 2015, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative party]] claimed that their proposed “new communications data legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming gangs”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Right to privacy 'could be meaningless in 10 years under Tory and Labour plans'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/22/right-to-privacy-could-be-meaningless-in-10-years-under-tory-and-labour-plans|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc." quote of Timothy C. May.

Later in 2015, [[Gamma Group]] released a statement claiming that their surveillance technology is used "against terrorist threats, drug cartels, other major organised crime, and paedophile rings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nick Hopkins|author2=Jake Morris|title=UK firm's surveillance kit 'used to crush Uganda opposition'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34529237|website=BBC News|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as justification for concerns that it was being used to target opposition politicians and media groups in [[Uganda]].  With money-laundering treated as a major organised crime, this quote matches very closely with the list given in the Cypherpunk FAQ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9120">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy measure theory''' considers generalized [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s in which the additive property is replaced by the weaker property of monotonicity.  The central concept of fuzzy measure theory is the fuzzy measure (also ''capacity'', see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author         = Gustave Choquet
|author-link         = Gustave Choquet
|title          = Theory of Capacities

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which was introduced by [[Gustave Choquet|Choquet]] in 1953 and independently defined by Sugeno in 1974 in the context of [[Sugeno integral|fuzzy integrals]].  There exists a number of different classes of fuzzy measures including [[Dempster-Shafer theory|plausibility/belief]] measures; [[Possibility theory|possibility/necessity]] measures; and [[probability measure|probability]] measures which are a subset of [[measure (mathematics)|classical]] measures.

==Definitions==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[universe of discourse]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Class (mathematics)|class]] of [[subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E,F\in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where

# &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \in \mathcal{C} \Rightarrow g(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq F \Rightarrow g(E)\leq g(F)&lt;/math&gt;

is called a ''fuzzy measure''. 
A fuzzy measure is called ''normalized'' or ''regular'' if &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{X})=1&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Adding some examples of fuzzy measures--&gt;

==Properties of fuzzy measures==

For any &lt;math&gt; E,F \in \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, a fuzzy measure is:

* '''additive''' if  &lt;math&gt; g(E \cup F) = g(E) + g(F). &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt;  E \cap F = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;;
* '''supermodular''' if &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) + g(E \cap F) \geq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt;;

Understanding the properties of fuzzy measures is useful in application.  When a fuzzy measure is used to define a function such as the [[Sugeno integral]] or [[Choquet integral]], these properties will be crucial in understanding the function's behavior.  For instance, the Choquet integral with respect to an additive fuzzy measure reduces to the [[Lebesgue integral]].  In discrete cases, a symmetric fuzzy measure will result in the [[Ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator|ordered weighted averaging]] (OWA) operator.  Submodular fuzzy measures result in convex functions, while supermodular fuzzy measures result in concave functions when used to define a Choquet integral.

==Möbius representation==
Let ''g'' be a fuzzy measure, the Möbius representation of ''g'' is given by the set function ''M'', where for every &lt;math&gt; E,F \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;M(E) = \sum_{F \subseteq E} (-1)^{|E \backslash F|} g(F).&lt;/math&gt;
The equivalent axioms in Möbius representation are:

# &lt;math&gt; M(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; \sum_{F \subseteq E|i \in F} M(F) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt; i \in E &lt;/math&gt;

A fuzzy measure in Möbius representation  ''M'' is called ''normalized''
if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{E \subseteq \mathbf{X}}M(E)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Möbius representation can be used to give an indication of which subsets of '''X''' interact with one another.  For instance, an additive fuzzy measure has Möbius values all equal to zero except for singletons.    The fuzzy measure ''g'' in standard representation can be recovered from the Möbius form using the Zeta transform:

:&lt;math&gt;  g(E) = \sum_{F \subseteq E} M(F), \forall E \subseteq \mathbf{X} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Simplification assumptions for fuzzy measures==

Fuzzy measures are defined on a [[semiring|semiring of sets]] or [[monotone class]] which may be as granular as the [[power set]] of '''X''', and even in discrete cases the number of variables can as large as 2&lt;sup&gt;|'''X'''|&lt;/sup&gt;.  For this reason, in the context of [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] and other disciplines, simplification assumptions on the fuzzy measure have been introduced so that it is less computationally expensive to determine and use.  For instance, when it is assumed the fuzzy measure is ''additive'', it will hold that &lt;math&gt; g(E) = \sum_{i \in E} g(\{i\}) &lt;/math&gt; and the values of the fuzzy measure can be evaluated from the values on '''X'''.  Similarly, a ''symmetric'' fuzzy measure is defined uniquely by |'''X'''| values.  Two important fuzzy measures that can be used are the Sugeno- or &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-fuzzy measure and ''k''-additive measures, introduced by Sugeno&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

===Sugeno ''&amp;lambda;''-measure===

The Sugeno &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-measure is a special case of fuzzy measures defined iteratively. It has the following definition:

====Definition====
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \left\lbrace x_1,\dots,x_n  \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;  be a finite set and let &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (-1,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. A '''Sugeno &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-measure''' is a function &lt;math&gt;g:2^X\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that

# &lt;math&gt;g(X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
# if &lt;math&gt;A, B\subseteq \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; (alternatively &lt;math&gt;A, B\in 2^{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g(A \cup B) =g(A)+g(B)+\lambda g(A)g(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

As a convention, the value of g at a singleton set &lt;math&gt;\left\lbrace x_i \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
is called a density and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;g_i = g(\left\lbrace x_i \right\rbrace)&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, we have that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the property

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda +1 = \prod_{i=1}^n (1+\lambda g_i) &lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wang and Klir have showed that once the densities are known, it is possible to use the previous [[polynomial]] to obtain the values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; uniquely.

===''k''-additive fuzzy measure===

The ''k''-additive fuzzy measure limits the interaction between the subsets &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; to size &lt;math&gt;|E|=k&lt;/math&gt;.  This drastically reduces the number of variables needed to define the fuzzy measure, and as ''k'' can be anything from 1 (in which case the fuzzy measure is additive) to '''X''', it allows for a compromise between modelling ability and simplicity.

====Definition====

A discrete fuzzy measure ''g'' on a set '''X''' is called ''k-additive'' (&lt;math&gt; 1 \leq k \leq |\mathbf{X}|&lt;/math&gt;) if its Möbius representation verifies &lt;math&gt;M(E) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt; |E| &gt; k &lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a subset ''F'' with ''k'' elements such that &lt;math&gt; M(F) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Shapley and interaction indices==

In [[game]] theory, the [[Shapley value]] or Shapley index is used to indicate the weight of a game.  Shapley values can be calculated for fuzzy measures in order to give some indication of the importance of each singleton.  In the case of additive fuzzy measures, the Shapley value will be the same as each singleton.

For a given fuzzy measure ''g'', and &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{X}|=n&lt;/math&gt;, the Shapley index for every &lt;math&gt; i,\dots,n \in X &lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi (i) = \sum_{E \subseteq \mathbf{X} \backslash \{i\}} \frac{(n-|E|-1)!|E|!}{n!} [g(E \cup \{i\}) - g(E)]. &lt;/math&gt;

The Shapley value is the vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\phi}(g) = (\psi(1),\dots,\psi(n)).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[general relativity]], a point mass deflects a light ray with [[impact parameter]] &lt;math&gt;b~&lt;/math&gt; by an angle approximately equal to

&lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha} = \frac{4GM}{c^2b}&lt;/math&gt;

where G is the [[gravitational constant]], M the mass of the deflecting object  and c the [[speed of light]]. A naive application of [[Newtonian gravity]] can yield exactly half this value, where the light ray is assumed as a massed particle and scattered by the gravitational potential well.  This approximation is good when &lt;math&gt;4GM/c^2b&lt;/math&gt; is small.

In situations where general relativity can be approximated by [[linearized gravity]], the deflection due to a spatially extended mass can be written simply as a vector sum over point masses.  In the [[continuum limit]], this becomes an integral over the density &lt;math&gt;\rho~&lt;/math&gt;, and if the deflection is small we can approximate the gravitational potential along the deflected trajectory by the potential along the undeflected trajectory, as in the [[Born approximation]] in quantum mechanics. The deflection is then

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\hat{\alpha}}(\vec{\xi})=\frac{4 G}{c^2} \int d^2\xi^{\prime} \int dz \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime},z)  \frac{\vec{b}}{|\vec{b}|^2}, ~ \vec{b} \equiv \vec{\xi}  - \vec{\xi^{\prime}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the line-of-sight coordinate, and &lt;math&gt; \vec{b} &lt;/math&gt; is the vector impact parameter of the actual ray path from the infinitesimal mass &lt;math&gt;  d^2\xi^{\prime}  dz\rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime},z) &lt;/math&gt; located at the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\vec{\xi}^{\prime}, z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bartelmann| first = M. |author2=Schneider, P. |date=January 2001 | title=Weak Gravitational Lensing| journal = Physics Reports | volume=340 | issue = 4–5 |pages = 291–472 | bibcode = 2001PhR...340..291B | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00082-X|arxiv = astro-ph/9912508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thin lens approximation ==

In the limit of a "thin lens", where the distances between the source, lens, and observer are much larger than the size of the lens (this is almost always true for astronomical objects), we can define the projected mass density

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma(\vec{\xi})=\int \rho(\vec{\xi},z) dz &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in the plane of the sky.  The deflection angle is then

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\hat{\alpha}}= 
\frac{4 G}{c^2} \int \frac{(\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime})\Sigma(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|^2}d^2 \xi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Gravitational-lensing-angles.png|right|frame|Angles involved in a thin gravitational lens system.]]

As shown in the diagram on the right, the difference between the unlensed angular position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and the observed position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is this deflection angle, reduced by a ratio of distances, described as the lens equation

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}=\vec{\theta}-\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \vec{\theta} - \frac{D_{ds}}{D_s} \vec{\hat{\alpha}}(\vec{D_d\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_{ds}~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the lens to the source &lt;math&gt;D_s~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the source, and &lt;math&gt;D_d~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the lens.  For extragalactic lenses, these must be [[angular diameter distance]]s.

In strong gravitational lensing, this equation can have multiple solutions, because a single source at &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; can be lensed into multiple images.

=== Convergence and deflection potential ===

It is convenient to define the ''convergence''

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{\Sigma(D_d\vec{\theta})}{\Sigma_{cr}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''critical surface density'' (not to be confused with the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of the universe)

&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma_{cr} = \frac{c^2 D_s}{4\pi G D_{ds}D_d}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced deflection angle &lt;math&gt;\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; can now be written as

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2 \theta^{\prime} \frac{(\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime})\kappa(\vec{\theta}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime}|^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

We can also define the ''deflection potential''

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2 \theta^{\prime} \kappa(\vec{\theta}^{\prime}) \ln |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime}|
&lt;/math&gt;

such that the scaled deflection angle is just the [[gradient]] of the potential and the convergence is half the [[Laplacian]] of the potential:

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \vec{\nabla} \psi(\vec{\theta})
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \psi(\vec{\theta})
&lt;/math&gt;

The deflection potential can also be written as a scaled projection of the Newtonian gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi~&lt;/math&gt; of the lens&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite arxiv | last = Narayan| first = R. | last2 = Bartelmann |first2=M. |date=June 1996 | title=Lectures on Gravitational Lensing |arxiv = astro-ph/9606001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{2 D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2} \int \Phi(D_d\vec{\theta},z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lensing Jacobian ===

The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] between the unlensed and lensed coordinate systems is

&lt;math&gt;A_{ij}=\frac{\partial \beta_i}{\partial \theta_j}=\delta_{ij} - \frac{\partial \alpha_i}{\partial \theta_j}
= \delta_{ij} - \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].  Because the matrix of second derivatives must be symmetric, the Jacobian can be decomposed into a diagonal term involving the convergence and a [[matrix trace|trace]]-free term involving the ''shear'' &lt;math&gt;\gamma~&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A=(1-\kappa)\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]-\gamma\left[\begin{array}{ c c } \cos 2\phi &amp; \sin 2\phi \\ \sin 2\phi &amp; -\cos 2\phi \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi~&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and the x-axis.  The term involving the convergence magnifies the image by increasing its size while conserving surface brightness.  The term involving the shear stretches the image [[tangent]]ially around the lens, as discussed in [[#Weak lensing observables|weak lensing observables]].

The shear defined here is ''not'' equivalent to the [[shear mapping|shear]] traditionally defined in mathematics, though both stretch an image non-uniformly.

[[Image:shear-components.svg|right|thumb|300px|Effect of the components of convergence and shear on a circular source represented by the solid green circle. The complex shear notation is defined [[#Shear and reduced shear|below]].]]

=== Fermat surface ===

There is an alternative way of deriving the lens equation, starting from the photon arrival time (Fermat surface) 	

&lt;math&gt;
t =  \int_{0}^{z_s}   { n dz \over c \cos \alpha(z) } 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; dz/c &lt;/math&gt; is the time to travel an infinitesimal line element along the source-observer straight line in vacuum, which is 
then corrected by the factor

&lt;math&gt;
1/\cos(\alpha(z))  \approx 1 + {\alpha(z)^2 \over 2}
&lt;/math&gt;

to get the line element along the bended path &lt;math&gt; dl = {dz \over c \cos \alpha(z) } &lt;/math&gt;  with a varying small pitch angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z), &lt;/math&gt; and the refraction index  
{{math|''n''}} for the "aether", i.e., the gravitational field.  The last can be obtained from the fact that a photon travels on a null geodesic of a weakly perturbed static Minkowski universe

&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = 0  = c^2 dt^2 \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right) -  \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right)^{-1} dl^2
&lt;/math&gt;
 
where  the uneven gravitational potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi \ll c^2 &lt;/math&gt; drives a changing the speed of light

&lt;math&gt;
c' = {dl/dt} = \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right)  c.
&lt;/math&gt;

So the refraction index
 
&lt;math&gt;
 n \equiv {c \over c'} \approx  \left(1 -  {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right). 
&lt;/math&gt;

The refraction index greater than unity because of the negative gravitational potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt;.

Put these together and keep the leading terms we have the time arrival surface

&lt;math&gt; 
t \approx \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c}  +  \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c} {\alpha(z)^2 \over 2} -  \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c} {2 \Phi \over c^2} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is the straight path travel time, the second term is the extra geometric path, and the third is the gravitational delay. 
Make the triangle approximation that &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z) = \theta - \beta &lt;/math&gt; for the path between the observer and the lens, 
and &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z) \approx (\theta - \beta) {D_d \over D_{ds}} &lt;/math&gt; for the path between the lens and the source.  
The geometric delay term becomes

&lt;math&gt;
    {D_d \over c}   { (\vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta})^2 \over 2} 
+ {D_{ds} \over c}  { \left[ (\vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta} )  {D_d \over D_{ds}} \right]^2 \over 2}
= {D_d D_s \over D_{ds} }    { ( \vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta} )^2 \over 2} .
&lt;/math&gt;
(How? There is no D_s on the left. Angular diameter distances don't add in a simple way, in general.)
So the Fermat surface becomes

&lt;math&gt;
 t = constant + {D_d D_s \over D_{ds} c} \tau, ~ \tau \equiv \left[  { (\vec{\theta}-\vec{\beta})^2 \over 2} -  \psi \right] 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is so-called dimensionless time delay, and the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{2 D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2} \int \Phi(D_d\vec{\theta},z) dz.
&lt;/math&gt;
 
The images lie at the extrema of this surface, so the variation of t with &lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;  is zero,

&lt;math&gt;
0 = \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \tau  =  \vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta}  - \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \psi(\vec{\theta}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the lens equation.  Take the Poisson's equation for 3D potential 
&lt;math&gt;
\Phi(\vec{\xi})  = - \int  \frac{d^3\xi^{\prime} \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|} 
&lt;/math&gt;

and we find the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{\theta})   = - \frac{2 G D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2}   \int dz  \int  \frac{d^3\xi^{\prime} \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|}
 =  -  \sum_i \frac{2 G M_i D_{is} }{D_s D_i c^2}   \left[  \sinh^{-1}  { |z -D_i| \over D_i |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |  }  \right ] |_{D_i}^{D_s}  + |_{D_i}^{0} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here we assumed the lens is a collection of point masses &lt;math&gt; M_i &lt;/math&gt; at angular coordinates &lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta}_i &lt;/math&gt; and distances &lt;math&gt; z=D_i .&lt;/math&gt;  
Use &lt;math&gt; \sinh^{-1} 1/x = \ln(1/x + \sqrt{1/x^2+1}) \approx -\ln(x/2) &lt;/math&gt; for very small {{math|''x''}} we find

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta})   \approx   \sum_i  \frac{2 GM_i D_{is} }{D_s D_i c^2}   \left[   \ln\left( { |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |^2 \over 4}  { D_i \over D_{is} } \right)     \right]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

One can  compute the ''convergence'' by applying the 2D Laplacian of the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} \nabla_{\vec{\theta}}^2 \psi(\vec{\theta}) =  \frac{4\pi G D_{ds}D_d} {c^2 D_s} \int dz \rho( D_d \vec{\theta},z) 
== {\Sigma \over \Sigma_{cr} } == \sum_i { 4\pi G M_i D_{is} \over c^2 D_i D_s}  \delta(\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

in agreement with earlier definition &lt;math&gt; \kappa(\vec{\theta}) =  {\Sigma \over \Sigma_{cr} }&lt;/math&gt; as the ratio of projected density with the critical density.  
Here we used &lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 1/r = - 4 \pi \delta(r) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} = D_d \nabla. &lt;/math&gt;

We can also confirm the previously defined reduced deflection angle

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\theta} -\vec{\beta}   =  \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \psi(\vec{\theta}) =  \sum_i   {  \theta_{Ei}^2  \over |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |} , ~ 
\pi \theta_{Ei}^2 \equiv  {4 \pi GM_i D_{is}  \over c^2 D_s  D_i } 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \theta_{Ei} &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called Einstein angular radius of a point lens Mi.   For a single point lens at the origin we recover the standard result 
that there will be two images at the two solutions of the essentially quadratic equation

&lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta} -\vec{\beta}   =   {\theta_{E}^2  \over |\vec{\theta} |}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The amplification matrix can be obtained by double derivatives of the dimensionless time delay

&lt;math&gt;
A_{ij} = {\partial \beta_j \over \partial \theta_i} = {\partial \tau \over \partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j } = \delta_{ij} -  {\partial \psi \over \partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j } 
= \left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1-\kappa -\gamma_1 &amp; \gamma_2 \\ \gamma_2 &amp; 1-\kappa +\gamma_1 \end{array}\right]  &lt;/math&gt;

where we have define the derivatives

&lt;math&gt; \kappa = {\partial \psi \over 2 \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_1 } +  {\partial \psi \over 2\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_2 } , 
~ \gamma_1 \equiv  {\partial \psi \over 2 \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_1 } -  {\partial \psi \over 2\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_2 } ,   
~ \gamma_2 \equiv  {\partial \psi \over \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_2 }    &lt;/math&gt;

which takes the meaning of convergence and shear.   The amplification is the inverse of the Jacobian

&lt;math&gt;   A = 1/det(A_{ij}) = {1 \over (1-\kappa)^2 -\gamma_1^2 -\gamma_2^2}  &lt;/math&gt;

where a positive A means either a maxima or a minima, and a negative A means a saddle point in the arrival surface.

For a single point lens, one can show (albeit a lengthy calculation) that

&lt;math&gt; \kappa =0, ~ \gamma = \sqrt{\gamma_1^2 + \gamma_2^2} = {\theta_E^2 \over |\theta|^2}, ~ \theta_E^2= {4GM D_{ds} \over c^2 D_dD_s}.
&lt;/math&gt;

So the amplification of a point lens is given by

&lt;math&gt;
A = \left( 1 - {\theta_E^4 \over \theta^4} \right)^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note A diverges for images at the Einstein radius &lt;math&gt; \theta_E. &lt;/math&gt;

In cases there are multiple point lenses plus a smooth background of (dark) particles of surface density &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{\rm cr} \kappa_{\rm smooth}, &lt;/math&gt; the time arrival surface is

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta})   \approx   {1 \over 2} \kappa_{\rm smooth} |\theta|^2 +  \sum_i  \theta_E^2  \left[   \ln\left( { |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |^2 \over 4}  { D_d \over D_{ds} } \right)     \right]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

To compute the amplification, e.g., at the origin (0,0), due to identical point masses distributed at &lt;math&gt;  (\theta_{xi},\theta_{yi} ) &lt;/math&gt; 
we have to add up the total shear, and include a convergence of the smooth background, 
&lt;math&gt;
A = \left[ (1 - \kappa_{\rm smooth})^2  
                  - \left( \sum_i {  (\theta_{xi}^2 - \theta_{yi}^2 ) \theta_E^2 \over (\theta_{xi}^2 + \theta_{yi}^2)^2 }\right) ^2  
                  - \left( \sum_i {  (2 \theta_{xi} \theta_{yi}) \theta_E^2 \over (\theta_{xi}^2 + \theta_{yi}^2)^2 }  \right)^2   \right] ^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

This generally creates a network of critical curves, lines connecting image points of infinite amplification.

== General weak lensing ==

In [[Weak gravitational lensing#Cosmic shear|weak lensing by large-scale structure]], the thin-lens approximation may break down, and low-density extended structures may not be well approximated by multiple thin-lens planes.  In this case, the deflection can be derived by instead assuming that the gravitational potential is slowly varying everywhere (for this reason, this approximation is not valid for strong lensing).
This approach assumes the universe is well described by a Newtonian-perturbed [[FRW metric]], but it makes no other assumptions about the distribution of the lensing mass.

As in the thin-lens case, the effect can be written as a mapping from the unlensed angular position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; to the lensed position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the transform can be written as an integral over the gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi~&lt;/math&gt; along the line of sight
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|date=2003|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-12-219141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \beta_i}{\partial \theta_j} = \delta_{ij} + \int_0^{r_\infty} dr 
  g(r) \frac{\partial^2  \Phi(\vec{x}(r))}{\partial x^i
    \partial x^j}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], &lt;math&gt;x^i~&lt;/math&gt; are the transverse distances, and

&lt;math&gt;
g(r) = 2 r \int^{r_\infty}_r dr'
    \left(1-\frac{r^\prime}{r}\right)W(r^\prime)
&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''lensing kernel'', which defines the efficiency of lensing for a distribution of sources &lt;math&gt;W(r)~&lt;/math&gt;.

The Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}~&lt;/math&gt; can be decomposed into convergence and shear terms just as with the thin-lens case, and in the limit of a lens that is both thin and weak, their physical interpretations are the same.

== Weak lensing observables ==

In [[weak gravitational lensing]], the [[Gravitational Lensing Formalism#Lensing Jacobian|Jacobian]] is mapped out by observing the effect of the shear on the ellipticities of background galaxies.  This effect is purely statistical; the shape of any galaxy will be dominated by its random, unlensed shape, but lensing will produce a spatially coherent distortion of these shapes.

=== Measures of ellipticity ===

In most fields of astronomy, the ellipticity is defined as &lt;math&gt;1-q~&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the axis ratio of the [[ellipse]].  In [[weak gravitational lensing]], two different definitions are commonly used, and both are complex quantities which specify both the axis ratio and the position angle &lt;math&gt;\phi~&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{1-q^2}{1+q^2}e^{2i\phi} = \frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2+b^2}e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{1-q}{1+q}e^{2i\phi} = \frac{a-b}{a+b}e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

Like the traditional ellipticity, the magnitudes of both of these quantities range from 0 (circular) to 1 (a line segment).  The position angle is encoded in the complex phase, but because of the factor of 2 in the trigonometric arguments, ellipticity is invariant under a rotation of 180 degrees.  This is to be expected; an ellipse is unchanged by a 180° rotation.  Taken as imaginary and real parts, the real part of the complex ellipticity describes the elongation along the coordinate axes, while the imaginary part describes the elongation at 45° from the axes.

The ellipticity is often written as a two-component vector instead of a complex number, though it is not a true [[Coordinate vector|vector]] with regard to transforms:

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \{\left|\chi\right|\cos 2\phi, \left|\chi\right|\sin 2\phi\}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \{\left|\epsilon\right|\cos 2\phi, \left|\epsilon\right| \sin 2\phi\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Real astronomical background sources are not perfect ellipses.  Their ellipticities can be measured by finding a best-fit elliptical model to the data, or by measuring the second moments of the image about some [[centroid]] &lt;math&gt;(\bar{x},\bar{y})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = \frac{\sum (y-\bar{y})^2 I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The complex ellipticities are then

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{q_{xx}-q_{yy} + 2 i q_{xy}}{q_{xx}+q_{yy}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{q_{xx}-q_{yy} + 2 i q_{xy}}{q_{xx}+q_{yy} + 2\sqrt{q_{xx}q_{yy}-q_{xy}^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used to relate the second moments to traditional ellipse parameters:

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = a^2 \cos^2 \theta + b^2 \sin^2 \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = a^2 \sin^2 \theta + b^2 \cos^2 \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = (a^2-b^2)\sin \theta \cos \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

and in reverse:

&lt;math&gt;
a^2 = \frac{q_{xx}+q_{yy} + \sqrt{(q_{xx}-q_{yy})^2 + 4q_{xy}^2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
b^2 = \frac{q_{xx}+q_{yy} - \sqrt{(q_{xx}-q_{yy})^2 + 4q_{xy}^2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2q_{xy}}{q_{xx}-q_{yy}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The unweighted second moments above are problematic in the presence of noise, neighboring objects, or extended galaxy profiles, so it is typical to use [[apodization|apodized]] moments instead:

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = \frac{\sum (y-\bar{y})^2 w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;w(x,y)~&lt;/math&gt; is a weight function that typically goes to zero or quickly approaches zero at some finite radius.

Image moments cannot generally be used to measure the ellipticity of galaxies without correcting for [[Weak gravitational lensing#Methodology|observational effects]], particularly the [[point spread function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bernstein| first = G. |author2=Jarvis, M. |date=February 2002 | title=Shapes and Shears, Stars and Smears: Optimal Measurements for Weak Lensing| journal = Astronomical Journal | volume=123 | issue = 2 |pages = 583–618 | bibcode = 2002AJ....123..583B | doi = 10.1086/338085|arxiv = astro-ph/0107431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shear and reduced shear ===

Recall that the [[Gravitational Lensing Formalism#Lensing Jacobian|lensing Jacobian]] can be decomposed into shear &lt;math&gt;\gamma~&lt;/math&gt; and convergence &lt;math&gt;\kappa~&lt;/math&gt;.
Acting on a circular background source with radius &lt;math&gt;R~&lt;/math&gt;, lensing generates an ellipse with major and minor axes

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{R}{1-\kappa-\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{R}{1-\kappa+\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

as long as the shear and convergence do not change appreciably over the size of the source (in that case, the lensed image is not an ellipse).  Galaxies are not intrinsically circular, however, so it is necessary to quantify the effect of lensing on a non-zero ellipticity.

We can define the ''complex shear'' in analogy to the complex ellipticities defined above

&lt;math&gt;
\gamma = \left|\gamma\right| e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

as well as the ''reduced shear''

&lt;math&gt;
g \equiv \frac{\gamma}{1-\kappa}
&lt;/math&gt;

The lensing Jacobian can now be written as

&lt;math&gt;
A=\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1 - \kappa - \mathrm{Re}[\gamma] &amp; -\mathrm{Im}[\gamma] \\ -\mathrm{Im}[\gamma] &amp; 1 -\kappa + \mathrm{Re}[\gamma]\end{array}\right]
=(1-\kappa)\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1-\mathrm{Re}[g] &amp; -\mathrm{Im}[g] \\ -\mathrm{Im}[g] &amp; 1+ \mathrm{Re}[g]\end{array}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

For a reduced shear &lt;math&gt;g~&lt;/math&gt; and unlensed complex ellipticities &lt;math&gt;\chi_s~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_s~&lt;/math&gt;, the lensed ellipticities are

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{\chi_s+2g+g^2\chi_s^*}{1+|g|^2 + 2\mathrm{Re}(g\chi_s^*)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{\epsilon_s+g}{1+g^*\epsilon_s}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the weak lensing limit, &lt;math&gt;\gamma \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, so

&lt;math&gt;
\chi \approx \chi_s+2g \approx \chi_s+2\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon \approx \epsilon_s+g \approx \epsilon_s+\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

If we can assume that the sources are randomly oriented, their complex ellipticities average to zero, so
&lt;math&gt; \langle \chi \rangle = 2\langle \gamma \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle \epsilon \rangle = \langle \gamma \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the principal equation of weak lensing: the average ellipticity of background galaxies is a direct measure of the shear induced by foreground mass.

=== Magnification ===

While gravitational lensing preserves surface brightness, as dictated by [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]], lensing does change the apparent [[solid angle]] of a source. The amount of [[magnification]] is given by the ratio of the image area to the source area. For a circularly [[symmetry|symmetric]] lens, the magnification factor μ is given by

&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{\theta}{\beta} \frac{d\theta}{d\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of convergence and shear

&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{1}{\det A} = \frac{1}{[(1-\kappa)^2-\gamma^2]}
&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason, the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A~&lt;/math&gt; is also known as the "inverse magnification matrix".

The reduced shear is invariant with the scaling of the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A~&lt;/math&gt; by a scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda~&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to the transformations
&lt;math&gt;
1-\kappa^{\prime} = \lambda(1-\kappa)
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;
\gamma^{\prime} = \lambda \gamma
&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; can only be determined up to a transformation &lt;math&gt;\kappa \rightarrow \lambda \kappa+(1-\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, which is known as the "mass sheet degeneracy." In principle, this degeneracy can be broken if an independent measurement of the magnification is available because the magnification is not invariant under the aforementioned degeneracy transformation. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;\mu~&lt;/math&gt; scales with &lt;math&gt;\lambda~&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\mu \propto \lambda^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Harvard College Observatory''' ('''HCO''') is an institution managing a complex of buildings and multiple instruments used for [[astronomy|astronomical]] research by the [[Harvard University]] Department of Astronomy. It is located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], USA, and was founded in 1839. With the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], it forms part of the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]].

HCO houses a collection of approximately 500,000 [[Photographic_plate#Astronomy|astronomical plates]] taken between the mid-1880s and 1989 (with a gap from 1953–68).&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Great Refractor.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Harvard's [[Great Refractor]] telescope]]
In 1839, the Harvard Corporation voted to appoint [[William Cranch Bond]], a prominent Boston clockmaker, as "Astronomical Observer to the University" (at no salary). This marked the founding of the Harvard College Observatory. HCO's first telescope, the 15-inch [[Great Refractor]], was installed in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web 
| url = http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hco/grref.html 
| title = The Great Refractor 
| accessdate = 2008-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That telescope was the largest in the United States from installation until 1867.&lt;ref name=TDA&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drout|first1=Maria|title=A Big Step Backward for Time Domain Astronomy|journal=Astrobites|date=12 November 2012|url=http://astrobites.org/2012/11/12/a-big-step-backward-for-time-domain-astronomy/|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1847 and 1852 Bond and pioneer photographer [[John Adams Whipple]] used the [[Great Refractor]] telescope to produce images of the moon that are remarkable in their clarity of detail and aesthetic power. This was the largest telescope in North America at that time, and their images of the moon took the prize for technical excellence in photography at the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]]. On the night of July 16–17, 1850, Whipple and Bond made the first [[daguerreotype]] of a star (Vega).

Harvard College Observatory is historically important to astronomy, as many women including [[Annie Jump Cannon]], [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]], [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]], and [[Williamina Fleming]] performed pivotal [[stellar classification]] research.  Cannon and Leavitt were hired initially  as "[[Harvard Computers|computer]]s" to perform calculations and examine stellar photographs, but later made insightful connections in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Publications==
From 1898 to 1926, a series of ''Bulletin''s were issued containing many of the major discoveries of the period.  These were then replaced by ''Announcement Card''s which continued to be issued until 1952.

In 1908, the observatory published the [[Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue]], which gave rise to the ''HR'' star catalogue, now maintained by the [[Yale University Observatory]] as the [[Bright Star Catalogue]].

[[File:Male impala profile.jpg|thumb|A pair of horns on a male [[impala]]]]
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals A horn.jpg|thumb|Anatomy and physiology of animal's horn]]
A '''horn''' is a permanent pointed projection on the head of various animals consisting of a covering of [[keratin]] and other [[protein]]s surrounding a core of live [[bone]]. Horns are distinct from [[antlers]], which are not permanent. In mammals, true horns are found mainly among the [[ruminant]] [[artiodactyl]]s{{Citation needed lead|date=December 2007}}, in the families [[Antilocapridae]] ([[pronghorn]]) and [[Bovidae]] ([[cattle]], [[goat]]s, [[antelope]] etc.).

One pair of horns is usual; however, two or more pairs occur in a few wild species and [[Domestication|domesticated]] breeds of sheep. [[Polycerate]] (multi-horned) sheep breeds include the [[Hebridean (sheep)|Hebridean]], [[Icelandic sheep|Icelandic]], [[Jacob (sheep)|Jacob]], [[Manx Loaghtan]], and the [[Navajo-Churro sheep|Navajo-Churro]].

Horns usually have a curved or [[spiral]] shape, often with ridges or fluting. In many species only males have horns. Horns start to grow soon after birth, and continue to grow throughout the life of the animal (except in pronghorns, which shed the outer layer annually, but retain the bony core). Partial or deformed horns in livestock are called ''scurs''. Similar growths on other parts of the body are not usually called horns, but [[Spur (zoology)|spur]]s, [[claw]]s or [[hoof]]s depending on the part of the body on which they occur.

==Other hornlike growths==
The term "horn" is also popularly applied to other hard and pointed features attached to the head of animals in various other families:
* [[Giraffidae]]: [[Giraffe]]s have one or more pairs of bony bumps on their heads, called [[ossicone]]s.  These are covered with furred skin.
* [[Cervidae]]: Most [[deer]] have [[antler]]s, which are not true horns.  When fully developed, antlers are dead bone without a horn or skin covering; they are borne only by adults (usually males, except for [[reindeer]]) and are shed and regrown each year.
* [[Rhinocerotidae]]: The [[rhinoceros horn|"horns" of rhinoceroses]] are made of [[keratin]], the same substance as fingernails, and grow continuously, but do not have a bone core.
*[[Chamaeleonidae]]: Many [[chameleons]], most notably the [[Jackson's Chameleon]], possess horns on their skulls, and have a keratin covering.
* [[Ceratopsidae]]: The "horns" of the ''[[Triceratops]]'' were extensions of its skull bones although debate exists over whether they had a keratin covering.
* [[Abelisauridae]]: various abelisaurid theropods, such as ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' and ''[[Majungasaurus]]'' possessed extensions of the [[frontal bone]] which were likely covered in some form of keratinous integument.
* [[Horned lizard]]s (''Phrynosoma''): These lizards have horns on their heads which have a hard keratin covering over a bony core, like mammalian horns.
* Insects: Some insects (such as [[rhinoceros beetle]]s) have horn-like structures on the head or [[thorax]] (or both).  These are pointed outgrowths of the hard [[chitin]]ous [[exoskeleton]].  Some (such as [[stag beetle]]s) have greatly enlarged jaws, also made of chitin.
* [[Canidae]]: [[Golden jackal]]s are known to occasionally develop a [[Jackal's Horn|horny growth]] on the skull, which is associated with magical powers in south-eastern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Sketches of the natural history of Ceylon'' by Sir James Emerson Tennent, published by Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1861&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mammals of Nepal: (with reference to those of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan)'' by Tej Kumar Shrestha, published by Steven Simpson Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-9524390-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Azendohsauridae]]: the skull of the triassic azendohsaurid [[archosauromorph]] ''[[Shringasaurus]]'' possessed two massive, forward-facing conical horns, which were likely covered in cornified sheaths in life.
* [[Anhimidae]]: The [[horned screamer]] possesses an entirely keratinous spine which is loosely connected to its skull. 

Many mammal species in various families have [[tusk]]s, which often serve the same functions as horns, but are in fact oversized teeth. These include the [[Moschidae]] (Musk deer, which are ruminants), [[Suidae]] ([[Wild Boar]]s), [[Proboscidea]] ([[Elephant]]s), [[Monodontidae]] ([[Narwhal]]s) and [[Odobenidae]] ([[Walrus]]es).
[[Polled livestock|Polled]] animals or ''pollards'' are those of normally-horned (mainly [[domesticated]]) species whose horns have been removed, or which have not grown.  In some cases such animals have small horny growths in the skin where their horns would be – these are known as ''scurs''.

===On humans===
[[Cutaneous horn]]s are the only examples of horns growing on people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrU7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Cutaneous+horns+are+the+only+examples+of+horns+growing+on+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGxpm4mbXXAhVS8mMKHSaVDZEQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Cutaneous%20horns%20are%20the%20only%20examples%20of%20horns%20growing%20on%20people&amp;f=false|title=Anatomical Anomalies|last=Alston|first=Isabella|date=2014-08-01|publisher=TAJ Books International|isbn=9781844063789|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are most often benign growths and can be removed by a razor.

Cases of people growing horns have been historically described, sometimes with mythical status.  Researchers have not however discovered photographic evidence of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Tubbs"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tubbs|first=R.

The phenomenon of humans with horns has been observed in countries lacking advanced medicine. There are living people, several in China, with cases of cutaneous horns, most common in the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=DEAD LINK! http://www.stern.de/wissen/mensch/ungewoehnliche-operation-aerzte-befreien-frau-von-horn-1682189.html |title=Bundestagswahl 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509222112/http://www.stern.de/wissen/mensch/ungewoehnliche-operation-aerzte-befreien-frau-von-horn-1682189.html |archivedate=2011-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people, notably [[The Enigma (performer)|The Enigma]], have horn implants; that is, they have implanted silicone beneath the skin as a form of [[body modification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/mar/11/health.lifeandhealth|title=Johann Hari on the bizarre world of radical plastic surgery|first=Hari|last=Johann|publisher=Guardian News and Media | location=London | date=2002-03-11 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The erect penis is sometimes referred to in slang use as a "horn", but it normally contains no keratin. However, a cutaneous horn can grow ''on'' the penis, which may indicate [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="hornpenis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0190962290703159|title=Cutaneous horn of the penis: Its association with squamous cell carcinoma and HPV-16 infection|doi=10.1016/0190-9622(90)70315-9 | volume=23|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|pages=969–972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal uses of horns==
[[File:Goat skull (MAV FMVZ USP).jpg|thumb|left|Goat skull piece]]
[[File:Serengeti Bueffel2.jpg|thumb|right|[[African buffalo]] (both sexes have horns)]]
Animals have a variety of uses for horns and antlers, including defending themselves from predators and fighting members of their own species (''horn fighting'') for territory, dominance or [[mating]] priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valerius Geist|author2=Fritz R. Walther|author3=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources|title=The Behaviour of Ungulates and Its Relation to Management: The Papers of an International Symposium Held at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 2-5 November 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQcpAQAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward O. Wilson|title=Sociobiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9ofvKZAmpEC&amp;pg=PA119|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-81624-4|pages=119–}})&lt;/ref&gt; Horns are usually present only in males but in some species, females too may possess horns. It has been theorized by researchers that taller species living in the open are more visible from longer distances and more likely to benefit from horns to defend themselves against predators. Female bovids that are not hidden from predators due to their large size or open [[savannah]] like habitat are more likely to bear horns than small or camouflaged species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.physorg.com/news172428997.html|title= Why Female Water Buffalo Have Horns but Impala Do Not? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, horns may be used to root in the soil or strip bark from trees.  In animal [[courtship]] many use horns in displays. For example, the male [[blue wildebeest]] reams the bark and branches of trees to impress the female and lure her into his [[territory (animal)|territory]]. Some animals with true horns use them for cooling. The blood vessels in the bony core allow the horns to function as a [[radiator]].

After the death of a horned animal, the keratin may be consumed by the larvae of the [[Ceratophaga vastella|Horn Moth]].

==Human uses of horns==
[[File:Water buffalo horn 01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Water buffalo]] horn used as a hammer with cleaver to cut fish in southeast China.]]
*Horned animals are sometimes hunted so their mounted head or horns can be displayed as a [[Trophy hunting|hunting trophy]] or as decorative objects.
*Some cultures use bovid horns as [[musical instrument]]s, for example, the [[shofar]].  These have evolved into [[brass instrument]]s in which, unlike the [[trumpet]], the bore gradually increases in width through most of its length—that is to say, it is [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] rather than [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]].  These are called [[French horn|horn]]s, though now made of [[metal]].
*[[Drinking horn]]s are bovid horns removed from the bone core, cleaned and polished and used as [[drinking vessel]]s. (See also the legend of the ''Horn of plenty'', or ''[[Cornucopia]]''). It has been suggested that the shape of a natural horn was also the model for the [[rhyton]], a horn-shaped drinking vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Chusid, ''Hearing Shofar: The Still Small Voice of the Ram's Horn'', 2009, Chapter 3-6 - Ram's Horn of Passover &lt;http://www.hearingshofar.com&gt;. The book also posits that the ancient Hebrews and neighboring tribes used horns as weapons and as utensils.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Powder horn]]s were originally bovid horns fitted with lids and carrying straps, used to carry [[gunpowder]]. [[Powder flask]]s of any material may be referred to as powder horns.
*[[Shoehorn]]s were originally made from slices of bovid horn, which provided the right curving shape and a smooth surface.
*Antelope horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine.
*Horns consist of [[keratin]], and the term "horn" is used to refer to this material, sometimes including similarly solid keratin from other parts of animals, such as [[hoof]]s.  Horn may be used as a material in tools, [[Horn furniture|furniture]] and decoration, among other uses.  In these applications, horn is valued for its hardness, and it has given rise to the expression ''hard as horn''.  Horn is somewhat [[thermoplastic]] and (like [[Tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]]) was formerly used for many purposes where [[plastic]] would now be used.  Horn may be used to make [[glue]].
*[[Composite bow|Horn bows]] are bows made from a combination of horn, [[sinew]] and usually wood. These materials allow more energy to be stored in a short bow than wood alone.
*Horns and horn tips from various animals have been used for centuries in the manufacture of scales, grips, or handles for [[knives]] and other weapons, and beginning in the 19th century, for the handle scales of [[handgun]]s.
*Horn [[Button (clothing)|button]]s may be made from horns, and historically also hooves which are a similar material. The non-bony part of the horn or hoof may be softened by heating to a temperature just above the boiling point of water, then molded in metal dies, or the hollow lower part of the horn may be slit spirally lengthwise and then flattened in a vise between wood boards, again after heating, and later cut with a holesaw or similar tool into round or other shaped blanks which are finished on a lathe or by hand. Toggle buttons are made by cutting off the solid tips of horns and perforating them. Antler buttons, and buttons made from hooves are not technically horn buttons, but are often referred to as such in popular parlance. Horns from cattle, water buffaloes, and sheep are all used for commercial button making, and of other species as well, on a local and non-commercial basis. 
*Horn combs were common in the era before replacement by plastic, and are still made. 
*Horn needle cases and other small boxes, particularly of water buffalo horn, are still made. One occasionally finds horn used as a material in antique snuff boxes. 
*Horn strips for inlaying wood are a traditional technique.
*Carved horn hairpins and other jewelry such as brooches and rings are manufactured, particularly  in Asia, including for the souvenir trade.
*Horn is used in artwork for small, detailed carvings. It is an easily worked and polished material,is strong and durable, and in the right variety, beautiful.
*Horn Chopsticks are found in Asian countries from highland Nepal and Tibet to the Pacific coast. Typically they are not the common material, but rather are higher quality decorative articles. Similarly other horn flatware, notably spoons, continues to be manufactured for decorative and other purposes. 
*Horn [[Long dice]] of a rodlike elongated shape with four numbered faces, and two small unnumbered end faces continue to be manufactured in Asia where they are traditionally used in games like [[Chaupar]] (Pachisi) and many others.
*Horn is sometimes a material found in walking stick and cane handles and shafts. In the latter use, the horn elements may be cut into short cylindrical segments held together by a metal core.

===Hungarian Space Camp ===
====History====
The camp was founded by Aunt Magdi, the "Space Granny" in 1994. Her intent was to introduce space research and astronautics to the youth. That time the program of the camp consisted mostly of lectures presented by the best-known Hungarian scientists in the field. Later the camp had a younger leadership, leading to a shift to more active and creative programs. From 2010 the duration of the camp is one week, from Sunday to Saturday. 
The participants are students between the age of 13 and 18, all interested in sciences and space topics. About quarter of the students return next year and every fifth student becomes a regular camper. Some acknowledged space researchers started their "space career" in the Space Camp, like the present (2017) Secretary General and several Members of Board.

====Locations====
1994 - Kecskemét, 1995 - Eger, 1996 - Veszprém, 1997 - Veszprém, 1998 - Győr, 1999 - Kecskemét, 2000 - Sopron, 2001 - Debrecen, 2002 - Székesfehérvár, 2003 - Budapest, 2004 - Kiskunhalas, 2005 - Gyulaháza, 2006 - Szentlélek, 2007 - Hollóstető, 2008 - Szentlélek, 2010 - Gyomaendrőd, 2011 - Sátoraljaújhely, 2012 - Kecskemét, 2013 - Alsómocsolád, 2014 - Felsőtárkány, 2015 - Sopron, 2016 - Debrecen, 2017 - Bakonybél

====Lectures and Activities====
In the camp space researchers and astronautical experts give '''lectures'''. Topics cover a wide range, from the basics of astronomy through problems of space debris to deciding the dilemma if Pluto is a planet or not. Other '''activities''' include several practical exercises make the camp exciting, e.g. water rocketry, underwater assembly, creating stereo pictures, astronomical observation, excursions, bathing, etc.  There is a main topic every year which meets the topic of the Student Competition.

====Mentor Program====
Since 2015 private individuals and companies are invited to co-finance the ''Hungarian Space Camp'' as '''Mentors'''. HAS welcomes financial support of participation of needy students from Hungary and from the Hungarian diaspora in the surrounding countries. In the past years about one fifth of the participants was able to join the Camp by favor of a Mentor.

===Student competition===
HAS yearly announces a '''Student Competition''' for primary and secondary school students, since 1992. The topics announced around October are always different, but focus on a current aspect of space research and exploration. The topic of the Student Competition is going to be the main topic of the Space Camp of that year. E.g. title of the Competition was "Civilians in Space" in 2014, "Beyond Mars" in 2015 and "Cleaning in Space" in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;
Categories: writing essay; drawing; preparing project plan; creating video, website, Facebook page or blog. &lt;br /&gt;
Small teams of two or three students are also welcome. Applications are evaluated in two age classes: age between 11-14 and 15-18. The competition is open for visually impaired students as well. Their works are evaluated separately.&lt;br /&gt;
Prizes include participation in the Space Camp for free or for a reduced fee; science books and magazines; a visit to a selected space research institute or company; free one-year membership in the society.

===Space Academy ===
''Hungarian Astronautical Society'' in collaboration with the international ''[[Space Generation Advisory Council]]'' initiated a yearly event called '''Space Academy'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://urakademia.hu Space Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 for university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. .&lt;ref&gt;http://spacegeneration.org/sgac-regions/europe/hungary.html  SGAC Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a four-day workshop in August where the participants outline a solution for a given task or problem together. 
* 2015: Voice of Youth - Which Way Now in the European Space Agency?
* 2016: Design Experiment to the International Space Station!

===Space Academy Club===
'''Space Academy Club''' is a lecture series organized by the '''Hungarian Astronautical Society''' and the Hungarian organizers of '''Space Generation Advisory Council'''. It takes place usually in February, April, September and November, during university semesters. It targets primarily university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. The series is connected with Space Academy in their name and their target groups.

===Hungarian Space Studies Annuary (alias Space Brochure, Hun: Űrtan évkönyv)===
HAS has been publishing its Astronautical Brochure since 1961, presenting the recent activities of HAS and summarizing the globally most significant affairs of space research. Hungarian researchers working in space research and its interdisciplinary fields present their latest results.

===Space Research Day===
Space Research Day is organized yearly. It joins the International Space Week in October. It usually takes place at one of the universities of Budapest. The program consists of lectures on actual space activities and space related results and exchange of views. There are blocks for professionals, interested amateurs and students.

===Hungarian Space Research Forum (Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physics Seminar) ===
'''Hungarian Space Research Forum''' is a traditional biennial conference of researchers of the field, to be held for the 30th time in 2017. Its former title and now subtitle '''Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physical Seminar''' expresses its original specialty which gained a broader horizon in the past decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/scostep/scostep_eng.html  Hungarian National Committee of SCOSTEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/ionmagnszem/ionmagnszem.html  List of Ionospheric-Magnetopheric Seminars from 1972-2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Hungarian physicists, geophysicists, astronomers, meteorologists etc. take part in this seminar by presenting their latest researches through lectures and posters.

===School Day===
HAS is willing to provide lectures for schools in various fields related to space activities titled '''School Day'''. Every year our members give several lectures in Budapest and around the country in (mainly secondary) schools on fresh and exciting scientific topics like the last results on Mars exploration, development of equipments for spacecraft, planetary discoveries, etc.

===Radio Connection between Students and Charles Simonyi on board of ISS [2007]===
'''[[Charles Simonyi|Dr. Charles Simonyi]]''', the first repeat ''[[Space Tourists|space tourist]]'' launched on April 7, 2007 (GMT), on board Soyuz TMA-10 to the International Space Station and returned on April 21, 2007 on his first space flight. The Hungarian-born Simonyi is a licensed amateur radio operator (KE7KDP) and he contacted students of Puskás Tivadar Távközlési Technikum (Puskás Tivadar Telecommunications Polytechnic, Budapest) on April 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.termeszetvilaga.hu/radiokapcsolat_text.html#kozlemeny_apr14_1200 Simonyi, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; This occasion of radio contact was organized in collaboration with HAS.

'''Information-based complexity''' ('''IBC''') studies optimal [[algorithms]] and [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] for the continuous problems which arise in [[physical science]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematical finance]]. IBC has studied such continuous problems as [[path integration]], [[partial differential equations]], systems of [[ordinary differential equations]], nonlinear equations, [[integral equations]], [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]], and very-high-dimensional [[numerical integration|integration]]. All these problems involve functions (typically multivariate) of a real or complex variable. Since one can never obtain a closed-form solution of the problems of interest one has to settle for a numerical solution. Since a function of a real or complex variable cannot be entered into a digital computer, the solution of continuous problems involves ''partial'' information. To give a simple illustration, in the numerical approximation of an integral, only samples of the integrand at a finite number of points are available. In the numerical solution of partial differential equations the functions specifying the boundary conditions and the coefficients of the differential operator can only be sampled. Furthermore, this partial information can be expensive to obtain. Finally the information is often ''contaminated'' by noise.

The goal of information-based complexity is to create a theory of computational complexity and optimal algorithms for problems with partial, contaminated and priced information, and to apply the results to answering questions in various disciplines. Examples of such disciplines include [[physics]], economics, mathematical finance, [[computer vision]], [[control theory]], [[geophysics]], [[medical imaging]], [[weather forecasting]] and [[Numerical weather prediction|climate prediction]], and [[statistics]]. The theory is developed over abstract spaces, typically [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] or [[Banach space|Banach]] spaces, while the applications are usually for multivariate problems.

Since the information is partial and contaminated, only approximate solutions can be obtained. IBC studies computational complexity and optimal algorithms for approximate solutions in various settings. Since the worst case setting often leads to negative results such as unsolvability and intractability, settings with weaker assurances such as average, probabilistic and randomized are also studied. A fairly new area of IBC research is continuous quantum computing.

==Overview==
We illustrate some important concepts with a very simple example, the computation of

::::&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx. &lt;/math&gt;

For most integrands we can't use the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] to compute the integral analytically; we have to approximate it numerically. We compute the values of &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; at ''n'' points

::::&lt;math&gt;[f(t_1),\dots,f(t_n)].&lt;/math&gt;

The ''n'' numbers are the partial information about the true integrand &lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt; We combine these ''n'' numbers by a combinatory algorithm to compute an approximation to the integral. See the monograph [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521485061/ Complexity and Information] for particulars.

Because we have only partial information we can use an ''adversary argument'' to tell us how large ''n'' has to be to compute an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approximation. Because of these information-based arguments we can often obtain tight bounds on the complexity of continuous problems. For discrete problems such as [[integer factorization]] or the [[travelling salesman problem]] we have settle for conjectures about the complexity hierarchy. The reason is that the input is a number or a vector of numbers and can thus be entered into the computer. Thus there is typically no adversary argument at the information level and the complexity of a discrete problem is rarely known.

The univariate integration problem was for illustration only. Significant for many applications is multivariate integration. The number of variables is in the hundreds or thousands. The number of variables may even be infinite; we then speak of path integration. The reason that integrals are important in many disciplines is that they occur when we want to know the expected behavior of a continuous process. See for example, the application to mathematical finance below.

Assume we want to compute an integral in ''d'' dimensions (dimensions and variables are used interchangeably) and that we want to guarantee an error at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any integrand in some class. The computational complexity of the problem is known to be of order &lt;math&gt;\epsilon^{-d}.&lt;/math&gt; (Here we are counting the number of function evaluations and the number of arithmetic operations so this is the time complexity.) This would take many years for even modest values of &lt;math&gt;d.&lt;/math&gt; The exponential dependence on ''d'' is called the ''[[curse of dimensionality]]''. We say the problem is intractable.

We stated the curse of dimensionality for integration. But exponential dependence on ''d'' occurs for almost every continuous problem that has been investigated. How can we try to vanquish the curse? There are two possibilities:

* We can weaken the guarantee that the error must be less than &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; (worst case setting) and settle for a stochastice assurance. For example, we might only require that the expected error be less than &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; (average case setting.) Another possibility is the randomized setting. For some problems we can break the curse of dimensionality by weakening the assurance; for others, we cannot. There is a large IBC literature on results in various settings; see Where to Learn More below.
* We can incorporate [[domain knowledge]]. See An Example: Mathematical Finance below.

==An example: mathematical finance==
Very high dimensional integrals are common in finance. For example, computing expected cash flows for a [[collateralized mortgage obligation]] (CMO) requires the calculation of a number of &lt;math&gt;360&lt;/math&gt; dimensional integrals, the &lt;math&gt;360&lt;/math&gt; being the number of months in &lt;math&gt;30&lt;/math&gt; years. Recall that if a worst case assurance is required the time is of order &lt;math&gt;\epsilon^{-d}&lt;/math&gt; time units. Even if the error is not small, say &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=10^{-2},&lt;/math&gt; this is &lt;math&gt;10^{720}&lt;/math&gt; time units. People in finance have long been using the [[Monte Carlo method]] (MC), an instance of a randomized algorithm. Then in 1994 a research group at [[Columbia University]] ([http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ap Papageorgiou], Paskov, [http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~traub Traub], Woźniakowski) discovered that the [[quasi-Monte Carlo method|quasi-Monte Carlo]] (QMC) method using [[low-discrepancy sequence|low discrepancy sequences]] beat MC by one to three orders of magnitude. The results were reported to a number of Wall Street finance to considerable initial skepticism. The results were first published by Paskov and [[Joseph F Traub|Traub]], ''Faster Valuation of Financial Derivatives'', Journal of Portfolio Management 22, 113-120. Today QMC is widely used in the financial sector to value financial derivatives.

These results are empirical; where does computational complexity come in? QMC is not a panacea for all high dimensional integrals. What is special about financial derivatives? Here's a possible explanation. The &lt;math&gt;360&lt;/math&gt; dimensions in the CMO represent monthly future times. Due to the discounted value of money variables representing times for in the future are less important than the variables representing nearby times. Thus the integrals are non-isotropic. Sloan and Woźniakowski introduced the very powerful idea of weighted spaces which is a formalization of the above observation. They were able to show that with this additional domain knowledge high dimensional integrals satisfying certain conditions were tractable even in the worst case! In contrast the Monte Carlo method gives only a stochastic assurance. See Sloan and Woźniakowski ''When are Quasi-Monte Carlo Algorithms Efficient for High Dimensional Integration?'' J. Complexity 14, 1-33, 1998. For which classes of integrals is QMC superior to MC? This continues to be a major research problem.

==Brief history==
Precursors to IBC may be found in the 1950s by Kiefer, Sard, and Nikolskij. In 1959 [[Joseph F Traub|Traub]] had the key insight that the optimal algorithm and the computational complexity of solving a continuous problem depended on the available information. He applied this insight to the solution of [[nonlinearity|nonlinear equations]] which started the area of optimal iteration theory. This research was published in the 1964 monograph ''Iterative Methods for the Solution of Equations.''

The general setting for information-based complexity was formulated by Traub and Woźniakowski in 1980 in ''A General Theory of Optimal Algorithms.'' For a list of more recent monographs and pointers to the extensive literature see To Learn More below.

The '''Instituto de Astronomía Teórica y Experimental''' (IATE) is a scientific institute funded by the [[Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas|Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones en Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET)]] and the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC)]], located in the city of Córdoba, Argentina, and dedicated to the study of different topics in astronomy. The headquarters of the institute are located at the [[:es:Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba]].

== History ==
In the 1960s, [[:es:José Luis Sérsic|Dr. José Luis Sérsic]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/b1038-l-Jose%20Luis-Sersic&lt;/ref&gt; (argentinian scientist mainly known for his empirical law for the intensity of a galaxy called [[Sersic profile|Sersic's Law]])  created the extragalactic astronomy department at the [[:es:Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba]], where he developed his academic and research activities, forming his first disciples. In 1983, the department became the "Programa de Investigaciones en Astronomía Teórica y Experimental" (IATE), funded by [[CONICET]], under Dr. Sérsic direction. Following the death of Dr. Sérsic on July 19, 1993, the program was discontinued. However, those graduates and PhD who were trained under his tutelage were ordered to continue with the group IATE as research group within the Observatorio Astronómico, under the leadership of Dr. Diego Garcia Lambas, one of the main disciples of Dr. Sérsic. After more than 10 years of hard work forming graduates, PhD and researchers, and to become one of the most numerous research groups within the Observatorio Astronómico, the IATE group has become one of the institutes of [[CONICET]] in 2006, with Dr. Diego Garcia Lambas being its first director. The institute then took the name of Instituto de Astronomía Teórica y Experimental, retaining the acronym IATE.

== Scientific Areas ==
The lines of research are:

* Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy
* Large Scale Structure of the Universe
* Planetary Systems
* Astrophysical Plasmas
* Instrumental Astronomy and Site Testing

=== Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy ===
[[File:Seyfert Sextet cut out.jpg|170x170px|thumbnail|right|The Seyfert's Sextet]]
The 13.8 billion years of the Universe is enough time to form giant objects, being the galaxies one of the most interesting. Galaxies are truly island universes where dark matter, billions of stars and huge amounts of gas and dust coexist in equilibrium, and yet, they are an environment suitable for the formation of new stars. Galaxies also tend to cluster in a network of cosmic proportions which highlights fabulous large structures formed by thousands of galaxies.
At the IATE, the study of galaxies has been a constant challenge, which has allowed to consolidate over the years different methods for the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies. Some of the most important are:
* Numerical Simulations: the physical processes that govern the evolutionary history of one or many galaxies are recreated by using supercomputers:
* Statistical Studies: properties of galaxies are inferred and analysed from large data surveys;
* Astronomical Observations: classic observations and the most modern and sophisticated techniques are combined by using the telescope facilities around the world.

These and other tools are used by different scientists at the IATE to perform original and reliable astronomical research.

=== Large Scale Structure of the Universe ===
[[File:Large-scale structure formation.gif|thumbnail|right|Numerical simulation of a CDM universe with dark energy (Andrey Kravtsov and Anatoly Klypin)]]
The large-scale structure of the Universe is the field of cosmology that studies the distribution of the matter in the Universe on the largest scales. This field has grown remarkably since the '80s, with the development of three-dimensional maps of galaxies in several bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, and with the observation of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)]].
The increasing flow of information generated by observations has allowed to obtain reliable characterization of the content of the universe comprising
* 74% of [[Dark energy|vacuum or dark energy]],
* 26% [[dark matter]] and
* 4% [[Baryonic matter|ordinary baryonic matter]],
as well as its distribution.
The distribution of the structures seems to follow a hierarchical model where the upper level is dominated by a network of clusters and filaments. On top of that, the universe appears to be isotropic and homogeneous in accordance with the [[cosmological principle]].
From the analysis of catalogs and the development of numerical simulations, the distribution is characterized through the implementation of different statistics that allow the study of the spatial distribution as well as the dynamics by means of the velocity field of the matter distribution.

=== Planetary Systems ===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|280x150px|thumbnail|left|Artist's concept of a protoplanetary disk.]]
The question of the existence of other worlds has been present in the history of mankind for centuries, but only recent scientific evidence has confirmed that planets could exist and are common outside the Solar System. Since the first discovery in 1992, over 850 new exoplanets have been cataloged.
Contrary to the Solar System, exoplanets' population presents several examples of exoplanets at very small distances from its stars, highly eccentric planetary orbits, and they are frequently found in configurations not previously imagined. This led to the development of new theories and areas of research, which ultimately can help us to better understand the Solar System.
Some of the projects that are currently being developed at the IATE include:
* Analyses of observational data for exoplanets (radial velocity and transit);
* Models of tidal interaction with the central star to study the origin of the population of "hot" exoplanets
* Study of the dynamics of extrasolar planets in mean motions resonances;
* Development of hydrodynamic codes to describe the interaction between planets and the protoplanetary disk;
* Analyses of the formation of planets in binary stellar systems.

=== Astrophysical Plasmas ===
[[File:EruptiveProminence.gif|170x170px|thumbnail|right|An eruptive prominence on the surface of the sun.]]
The plasma is the most common state of the baryonic matter in the Universe (99%). Most of a star, the interplanetary and interstellar medium, and the ionosphere, are plasmas. The plasma can also be generated in terrestrial laboratories for industrial applications such as producing surface coatings, precision cuts in lamps, micro-motors, and plasma reactors.
A plasma is a fluid consisting of a large number of free charged particles (globally neutral and whose kinetic energy is larger than the electrostatic potential energy between them). The charges and currents that conform a plasma are sources of the electromagnetic fields and, in turn, these fields affect the distribution of charges and currents which makes its dynamics highly nonlinear and very different from that of a neutral gas. When the magnetic fields are capable of modifying an individual particle trajectory, it is said that the plasma is magnetized. The corona is highly magnetized and therefore, several structures are observed, some of which can maintain its stability for relatively long times as dark filaments on the surface of the sun.
In the group of astrophysical plasmas, our scientist perform studies about the dynamic configuration and structures of the corona through the analysis of magnetic arcs and prominences, the formation of voids that remain in the plasma due to the interaction of nonlinear waves, the formation of very energetic shock wave capable of sweeping the chromosphere along a whole quadrant, etc. The team also analyse the interaction of stellar winds with the magnetosphere of exoplanets, and they model the morphology of supernova remnants affected by instabilities and the influence of the magnetic field.

=== Site Testing ===
The IATE also performs site testing for the installation of large astronomical facilities in the Argentinian territory.
During the 90's (1989-1998), the IATE began the first work on astronomical site testing performing seeing measurements in the Antarctic Base Belgrano II. In 1998, measurements of seeing were performed in the Llano de Chajnantor, Atacama (Chile), as part of a project aimed at installing a liquid mercury telescope in Toco volcano. This project was not successful but the group learnt the use of the most modern technologies for measuring sky parameters. Through this experience, the IATE made contact with Dr. Marc Sarazin, of the [[European Southern Observatory|European Southern Observatory (ESO)]], with whom, since the year 2000, the IATE began the searching and characterization of candidate sites to install the [[European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu.ar/seccion/novedades/2008/mayo/cientificos-de-la-unc-estudian-la-puna-saltena&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archivo.lavoz.com.ar/08/05/09/secciones/sociedad/nota.asp?nota_id=188054&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSJeKmqsmYs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlmHTEC8CGQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeJ9m6vPRc4&lt;/ref&gt; which will be finally installed in Chile, at the Cerro Armazones. During that work, a suitable candidate site was preselected at the Cordón Macón, close to Tolar Grande town. Because of its excellent conditions, the IATE decided to install observational facilities at this site,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoylauniversidad.unc.edu.ar/2012/junio/argentina-tendra-su-cuarto-observatorio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomiadecordoba.blogspot.com.ar/2010/08/el-instituto-de-astronomia-teorica-y.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is the most important project to date for the instrumentation team.
The project also involves the development of a program committed to the educational public outreach in astronomy at the town of Tolar Grande, named Ñawi Puna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secyt.unc.edu.ar/unc/boletin_contenido.php?idNota=271&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The New Astronomical Complex ====
[[File:Observatory at the Cordon Macon.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first observatory building at the Macón peak (May, 2012).]]
The IATE is building an astronomical complex on the Cordón Macón, located at 10&amp;nbsp;km from the town of [[Tolar Grande]], [[Salta]], Argentina. The site is located at latitude 24.61 South and longitude 67.32 West and at an altitude of 4,650 meters. The location has ideal conditions of humidity and air turbulence, which create almost perfect astronomical seeing. The site infrastructure will enable the development of several observational projects:

* The '''ABRAS''' project: The Argentina-Brasil Astronomical Center is a project involving both Latin-American countries. The main institutions behind the project are the IATE, from Argentina, and the [http://www.iag.usp.br/ IAG (Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciencias Atmosféricas)], from Sao Paulo, Brasil, while the funding institutions are the [http://www.mincyt.gov.ar/ Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva] and the [[University of Sao Paulo]] ([http://www5.usp.br/ Universidade de Sao Paulo, USP]). The project involves the installation of an astronomical observational facility in the Cordón Macón. The 1 meter telescope will be installed in an 8-meter diameter dome. The building and the installation of the dome was performed during 2011-2012, while the 1 meter telescope arrived to Córdoba (Argentina) during October 2015. One of the main goals of the project is to optimize the telescope for performing astronomical observations in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The first observations with this telescope is expected to be perform for the year 2016.
* The '''TOROS''' project: The Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South (TOROS) project is a collaboration among scientists from [[The University of Texas]] at Brownsville, the [[Universidad Nacional de Cordoba|Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (UNC)]], [[CALTECH]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. The project intend to construct a dedicated optical follow-up instrument for Advanced [[LIGO]] (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo ([[Virgo interferometer|AdVirgo]]) in order to surveying the sky for even very dim afterglows of gravitational waves events. The project also pursuit the aim of detecting nearby supernovas. The [http://toros.phys.utb.edu/TOROS/First_TOROS_Workshop.html first workshop] of the TOROS collaboration was held in the city of Salta, Argentina, in June, 2013.
* The '''ISON''' project: The International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) program is an international effort that intend to understand and catalogue the space debris population in the near-Earth space and of potentially hazardous [[Near-Earth object|Near Earth Objects (NEOs)]]. In order to contribute to this program, the [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics|Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics (KIAM)]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS), of the [[Russian Federation]], will work together with the [[Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE)]], the IATE, the [[Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba (OAC)]] and the Goberment of the [[:es:Provincia de Salta|Provincia de Salta]] in Argentina, to install and operate two small telescopes of 20 and 25&amp;nbsp;cm of diameter, that will be operated remotely via Internet connection. The aim of this cooperation is to perform observations of orbital debris, asteroids, comets and optical counterparts of gamma-ray bursts.

== FoF meetings ==
Yearly, the IATE organizes the astronomical meeting named "Friends-of-Friends", usually carried out during the first fortnight of April. The meeting is aimed at stretching the bounds between the astronomers that work at the IATE and their external collaborators, as well as sharing the state-of-the-art of works that are being developed by the IATE members.
The talks are split into two different modes: invited speakers present talks of 45+15 minutes, while there are several short talks of 15+5 minutes long.

'''Internet Security Awareness Training''' (ISAT) consists of the training of members of an organization regarding the protection of various information assets of that organization. Organizations that need to comply with government regulations (i.e. [[GLBA]], [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI]], [[HIPAA]], [[Sarbox]]) normally require formal ISAT for all employees, usually once or twice a year. Many Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's) do not require ISAT for regulatory compliance, but train their employees to prevent [[Cyberheist|a cyberheist]]. Internet Security Awareness Training at this point in time is usually provided via online courses. ISAT is a subset of general [[security awareness]] Training.

Topics covered in ISAT include:

*Appropriate methods for protecting sensitive information on personal [[computer]] systems, including [[password policy]]
*Various computer security concerns, including [[Spam (electronic)|spam]], [[malware]], [[phishing]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], etc.
*Consequences of failure to properly protect information, including potential job loss, economic consequences to the firm, damage to individuals whose private records are divulged, and possible civil and criminal law penalties.

Being Internet Security Aware means you understand that there are people actively trying to steal data that is stored within your organization's computers.  (This often focuses on user names and passwords, so that criminal elements can ultimately get access to bank accounts and other high-value IT assets.) That is why it is important to protect the assets of the organization and stop that from happening.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

According to Microsoft,
* End User Internet Security  Awareness Training  resides in the Policies, Procedures, and Awareness layer of the Defense in Depth security model.
* User security awareness can affect every aspect of an organization’s security profile.
* End User Security awareness is a significant part of a comprehensive security profile because many attack types rely on human intervention (Social Engineering) to succeed.

The focus of ISAT is to achieve an immediate and lasting change in the attitude of employees towards Internet Security, making it clear that security policies and Acceptable Use policies are vital for the survival of the organization, and not as rules that restrict the employee being efficient at work.

Security awareness training for employees is one of the most effective means of reducing the potential for costly errors in handling sensitive information and protecting company information systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Training can be conducted through a number of means and certain approaches are more effective than others:
* The Do-Nothing Approach: The organization conducts no security awareness training and relies on automated systems to protect against phishing and malware.
* The Breakroom Approach: Employees are gathered during lunches or meetings and are told what to look out for in emails, web surfing, etc.
* The Monthly Security Video Approach: Employees are shown short videos that explain how to keep the organization safe and secure.
* The [[simulated phishing|Phishing Test]] Approach: Certain employees are pre-selected and sent [[simulated phishing]] attacks, IT determines whether they fell prey to the attack, and those employees get remedial training.
* The Human Firewall Approach: Everyone in the organization is tested, the percentage of employees who are prone to phishing attacks is determined, and then everyone is trained on major attack vectors. Simulated phishing attacks are sent to all employees on a regular basis.

Security Awareness Training can ensure personnel have a solid understanding of their employer’s security practices and policies. In contrast, an uninformed employee is susceptible to malware, phishing attacks, and other forms of social engineering. They can do substantial harm to an organization’s systems and place its data at risk.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Key aspects of any awareness training program should include the following:
* Train on an ongoing basis. Avoid limiting training to when an employee is first hired or assigned to a new role in the organization.
* Train creatively, not just in a non-interactive class-room setting.
* Look for means to introduce interactivity into the training process.
* Have a means of measuring progress and Phish-prone percentage of employees.

'''''Journal Citation Reports''''' ('''''JCR''''') is an [[annual publication]] by [[Clarivate Analytics]] (previously the intellectual property of [[Thomson Reuters]]). It has been integrated with the [[Web of Science]] and is accessed from the Web of Science-Core Collections. It provides information about [[academic journal]]s in the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]], including [[impact factor]]s. The ''JCR'' was originally published as a part of ''[[Science Citation Index]]''. Currently, the ''JCR'', as a distinct service, is based on [[citation]]s compiled from the ''[[Science Citation Index Expanded]]'' and the ''[[Social Science Citation Index]]''.&lt;ref name=evolves&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |year=2007 |title=The evolution of the Science Citation Index |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |doi=10.2436/20.1501.01.10 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=65–69 |url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/barcelona2007a.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCRhome&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Overview |work=Journal Citation Reports |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625025211/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |archivedate=2010-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=About Us |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/about/ |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VenSep2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venkatraman |first=Archana |date=Sep 2009 |title=Journals cherish IF status symbol: but impact factor is not the only citation metric that matters |newspaper=[[Information World Review]] |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic journal information==
The information given for each journal includes:
* the basic bibliographic information of publisher,  title abbreviation, language, ISSN
* the subject categories (there are 171 such categories in the sciences and 54 in the social sciences)

==Citation information==
* Basic citation data:
** the number of articles published during that year and
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
* detailed tables showing
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
** the number of citations made from articles published in the journal that year to it and other specific individual journals during each of the most recent ten years (the 20 journals most cited are included)
** the number of times articles published in the journal during each of the most recent 10 years were cited by individual specific journals during the year (the twenty journals with the greatest number of citation are given)
* and several measures derived from these data for a given journal: its ''[[impact factor]]'', ''[[immediacy index]]'', etc.

There are separate editions for the sciences and the social sciences; the 2013 science edition includes 8,411 journals, and the 2012 social science edition contains 3,016 titles. The issue for each year is published the following year, after the citations for the year have been published and the information processed.

The publication is available online (''JCR on the Web''), or in CD format (''JCR on CD-ROM''); it was originally published in print, with the detailed tables on [[microfiche]].

==Release schedule==
In recent years, it is often released in the middle of June. For example, the 2017 Journal Citation Reports, based on 2016 data, was released on Jun 14, 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clarivate.com/blog/the-2017-jcr-release-is-here/|title=The 2017 JCR Release is Here! - Clarivate|date=14 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Mathematics and architecture''' are related, since, [[mathematics and art|as with other arts]], [[architect]]s use [[mathematics]] for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering [[building]]s, architects use [[geometry]]: to define the spatial form of a building; from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, [[aesthetic]] and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In &lt;!--[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient China]], Needs section in article before we put this here--&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Architecture of India|India]], and the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]], buildings including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, mosques, palaces and [[mausoleum]]s were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric tiling patterns]] are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a [[fractal]]-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in [[Hindu cosmology]]. In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In [[Renaissance architecture]], [[symmetry]] and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], influenced by [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' from [[Ancient Rome]] and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in [[Russia]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] in [[Barcelona]] pioneered the use of [[hyperboloid structures]]; in the [[Sagrada Família]], Gaudí also incorporated [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s, tessellations, [[catenary arch]]es, [[catenoid]]s, [[helicoid]]s, and [[ruled surface]]s. In the twentieth century, styles such as [[modern architecture]] and [[Deconstructivism]] explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. [[Minimal surface]]s have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at [[Denver International Airport]], while [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered the use of the strong [[thin-shell structure]]s known as [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Connected fields==
[[File:CdM, presunto autoritratto di leon battista alberti, white ground.jpg|thumb|upright|In the [[Renaissance]], an [[architect]] like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was expected to be knowledgeable in many disciplines, including [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]].]]

The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between [[architecture]] and [[mathematics]], note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure [[Number theory|study of number]] and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Ancient Rome, [[Vitruvius]] described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily [[geometry]], to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the [[Middle Ages]], where graduates learnt [[arithmetic]], geometry and [[aesthetics]] alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the [[trivium]]) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the [[Renaissance]], the [[quadrivium]] of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the [[Renaissance man]] such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Similarly in England, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.&lt;ref name=Ostwald1&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: from Antiquity to the 1500s |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00136-4 |pages=chapter 1. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be [[revolutionary]], introducing wholly new ideas; [[reactionary]], failing to introduce change; or [[revivalist artist|revivalist]], actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian [[Mannerism]] of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century [[Baroque]] and [[Palladian]] movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as [[Futurism]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to [[Modernist]] architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, [[fractal]] geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was [[aperiodic tiling]], to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume II: The 1500s to the Future |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00142-5 |pages=chapter 48. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The interior of the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], 1758]]

The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and ''symmetria''. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. ''Symmetria'' in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at [[Fano]], he uses ratios of small integers, especially the [[triangular number]]s (1, 3, 6, 10,&amp;nbsp;...) to proportion the structure into [[Vitruvian module|(Vitruvian) modules]].{{efn|In Book 4, chapter 3 of ''[[De architectura]]'', he discusses modules directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitruvius |title=VITRUVIUS, BOOK IV, CHAPTER 3 On the Doric order |url=http://www.vitruvius.be/boek4h3.htm|website=Vitruvius.be |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitruvius |title=On Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBLNbOp46CYC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-193195-1 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dehio 1 Pantheon Floor plan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Pantheon]]

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his ''[[De architectura]]'', c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or "Commodity" in [[Henry Wotton]]'s 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsOstwald2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Kim |last2=Ostwald |first2=Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: Antiquity to the 1500s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |date=9 February 2015 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-319-00137-1 |pages=42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Pantheon====
{{main article|Pantheon (Rome)}}

The [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] in Rome has survived intact, illustrating classical Roman structure, proportion, and decoration. The main structure is a dome, the apex left open as a circular [[oculus]] to let in light; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, {{convert|43.3|m|ft}}, so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube, and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book | last=Roth | first=Leland M. | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, And Meaning | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder | year=1992 | isbn=0-06-438493-4 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions make more sense when expressed in [[ancient Roman units of measurement]]: The dome spans 150 [[Roman foot|Roman feet]]{{efn|A [[Roman foot]] was about {{convert|0.296|m|ft}}.}}); the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high.&lt;ref name=Claridge&gt;{{cite book | last=Claridge | first=Amanda | title=Rome | series= Oxford Archaeological Guides |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford Oxfordshire | year=1998| isbn=0-19-288003-9 |pages=204–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pantheon remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite book | last=Lancaster | first=Lynne C. | title=Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome: Innovations in Context | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=2005 | isbn=0-521-84202-6 |pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===

[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]], 1470. The frieze (with squares) and above is by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].]]

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:{{radic|2}}, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:{{radic|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=March |first1=Lionel |title=Renaissance mathematics and architectural proportion in Alberti's De re aedificatoria |journal=Architectural Research Quarterly |date=1996 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–65 |doi=10.1017/S135913550000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sphere circumscribing a cube |url=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/solid-mensuration-solid-geometry/013-insciribed-and-circumscribed-sphere-about-cube-volume- |website=Mathalino.com Engineering Math Review |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also documented [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s discovery of [[linear perspective]], developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The next major text was [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Two of Serlio's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong, but this did not stop his work being widely used.&lt;ref name="Andersen2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Kirsti |title=The Geometry of an Art: The History of the Mathematical Theory of Perspective from Alberti to Monge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8B_JeMxNUIkC&amp;pg=PA120 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-48946-9 |pages=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa Pisani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrea Palladio]]'s plan and elevation of the [[Villa Pisani (Bagnolo)|Villa Pisani]]]]
In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] published the influential ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture) in [[Venice]]. This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe, assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 ''The Elements of Architecture''.&lt;ref name=Ruhl&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruhl |first1=Carsten |title=Palladianism: From the Italian Villa to International Architecture |url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/educational-journey-grand-tour/carsten-ruhl-palladianism |publisher=European History Online |accessdate=3 October 2015 |date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Copplestone, Trewin |year=1963 |title=World Architecture |publisher=Hamlyn |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio permitted a range of ratios in the ''Quattro libri'', stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wassell |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Mathematics Of Palladio's Villas: Workshop '98 |url=http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/Wassell.html |publisher=Nexus Network Journal |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Palladio, Andrea |title=I quattro libri dell'architettura |author2=Tavernor, Robert; Schofield, Richard (trans.) |publisher=MIT Press |year=1997 |origyear=1570 |page=book I, chapter xxi, page 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There are seven types of room that are the most beautiful and well proportioned and turn out better: they can be made circular, though these are rare; or square; or their length will equal the diagonal of the square of the breadth; or a square and a third; or a square and a half; or a square and two-thirds; or two squares.{{efn|In modern algebraic notation, these ratios are respectively 1:1, {{radic|2}}:1, 4:3, 3:2, 5:3, 2:1.}}&lt;!--end efn--&gt;}}

In 1615, [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] published the late Renaissance treatise ''L'Idea dell'Architettura Universale'' (The Idea of a Universal Architecture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scamozzi, Vincenzo |title=The Idea of a Universal Architecture |origyear=1615 |year=2003 |author2=Vroom, W.

[[File:Mathematical Pyramid.svg|thumb|Base:hypotenuse (b:a) ratios for pyramids like the [[Pyramid of Khufu]] could be: 1:φ ([[Kepler triangle]]), 3:5 ([[3-4-5 triangle]]), or 1:4/π]]

The [[pyramid]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]] are [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|tombs]] constructed with deliberately chosen proportions, but which these were has been debated. The face angle is about 51°85’, and the ratio of the slant height to half the base length is 1.619, less than 1% from the [[golden ratio]]. If this was the design method, it would imply the use of [[Kepler triangle|Kepler's triangle]] (face angle 51°49’).&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markowsky, George | url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | title=Misconceptions About the Golden Ratio | journal=The College Mathematics Journal |volume=23 | issue=1 | date=January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Socrates G. | last=Taseos | title=Back in Time 3104 B.C. to the Great Pyramid | publisher=SOC Publishers | date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is more likely that the pyramids' slope was chosen from the [[Special right triangles|3-4-5 triangle]] (face angle 53°8’), known from the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 1650 – 1550 BC); or from the triangle with base to hypotenuse ratio 1:4/π (face angle 51°50’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Midhat | last=Gazale | title=Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals | publisher=Princeton University Press | date=1999 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaastu Shastra]], the ancient [[India]]n canons of architecture and town planning, employs symmetrical drawings called [[mandala]]s. Complex calculations are used to arrive at the dimensions of a building and its components. The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns ([[yantra]]), symmetry and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|directional]] alignments.&lt;ref&gt;Kramrisch, Stella (1976), The Hindu Temple Volume 1 &amp; 2, {{isbn|81-208-0223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson |title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City |date=2004 |isbn=978-1-86189-137-2 |pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, early builders may have come upon mathematical proportions by accident.

[[File:Plan of Meenakshi Amman Temple Madurai India.jpg|thumb|upright|Plan of [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]], [[Madurai]], from 7th century onwards. The four gateways (numbered I-IV) are tall [[gopuram]]s.]]

The mathematics of [[fractals]] has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall [[gopuram]] gatehouses of [[Hindu]] temples such as the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]] built in the seventh century, and others such as the [[Kandariya Mahadev Temple]] at [[Khajuraho]], the parts and the whole have the same character, with [[fractal dimension]] in the range 1.7 to 1.8. The cluster of smaller towers (''shikhara'', lit. 'mountain') about the tallest, central, tower which represents the holy [[Mount Kailash]], abode of Lord [[Shiva]], depicts the endless repetition of universes in [[Hindu cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Rian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web |title=Fractals in Indian Architecture |url=https://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/Architecture/IndianArch/IndianArch.html |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious studies scholar William J. Jackson observed of the pattern of towers grouped among smaller towers, themselves grouped among still smaller towers, that:

The [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] is a large complex with multiple shrines, with the streets of [[Madurai]] laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras.

===Ancient Greece===
{{further information|Greek architecture|golden ratio|Pythagoreanism|Euclidean geometry}}
[[File:The Parthenon Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] was designed using [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ratios.]]

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that "all things are numbers". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word ''symmetria'' originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

[[File:Parthenon-top-view.svg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]
The [[Parthenon]] is {{convert|69.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|30.9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight&lt;ref name="Maor2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12526-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pythagoreans 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This sets the module as 0.858&amp;nbsp;m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ({{convert|21.44|m|ft}} wide by 48.3&amp;nbsp;m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, {{convert|1.905|m|ft}}, and the spacing of their centres, {{convert|4.293|m|ft}}, is also 4:9.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as [[John Julius Norwich]] "the most perfect Doric temple ever built".&lt;ref name=Norwich/&gt; Its elaborate architectural refinements include "a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns".&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{cite book |author=Norwich, John Julius |title=Great Architecture of the World |publisher=Artists House |year=2001 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penrose, Francis |title=Principles of Athenian Architecture |publisher=Society of Dilettanti |year=1973 |origyear=1851 |page=ch. II.3, plate 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Gorham P. |title=Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=66 |issue=3 |date=July 1962 |pages=337–338 |doi=10.2307/501468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when [[Euclid]] described the method of geometric construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid's Elements|Euclid. ''Elements'']]. Book 6, Proposition 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Archibald, R.

The [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]], Turkey, was built by [[Mimar Sinan]] to provide a space where the [[mihrab]] could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of {{convert|31.25|m|ft}} diameter and {{convert|43|m|ft}} high.

The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz.

The number five is used "exuberantly"&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"/&gt; in the 1721 [[Pilgrimage Church of St John of Nepomuk]] at Zelená hora, near [[Žďár nad Sázavou]] in the Czech republic, designed by [[Jan Santini Aichel|Jan Blažej Santini Aichel]]. The nave is circular, surrounded by five pairs of columns and five oval domes alternating with ogival apses.

[[Antoni Gaudí]] used a wide variety of geometric structures, some being minimal surfaces, in the [[Sagrada Família]], [[Barcelona]], started in 1882 (and not completed as of 2015). These include hyperbolic [[paraboloid]]s and [[hyperboloid|hyperboloids of revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Drawing Together Euclidean and Topological Threads (pdf) | last=Burry | first=M.C., J.R.

This varied mix of geometries is creatively combined in different ways around the church. For example, in the Passion Façade of Sagrada Família, Gaudí assembled stone "branches" in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids, which overlap at their tops (directrices) without, therefore, meeting at a point. In contrast, in the colonnade there are hyperbolic paraboloidal surfaces that smoothly join other structures to form unbounded surfaces. Further, Gaudí exploits [[patterns in nature|natural patterns]], themselves mathematical, with [[column]]s derived from the shapes of [[tree]]s, and [[lintel]]s made from unmodified [[basalt]] naturally cracked (by cooling from molten rock) into [[List of places with columnar jointed volcanics|hexagonal columns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Geometry of Antoni Gaudi |url=http://euler.slu.edu/escher/index.php/The_Geometry_of_Antoni_Gaudi |website=Math &amp; the Art of MC Escher |publisher=Saint Louis University Mathematics and Computer Science |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Usvat |first1=Liliana |title=Antony Gaudi and Mathematics |url=http://www.mathematicsmagazine.com/Articles/AntonyGaudiandMathematics.php#.VhFZ7WtUWHg |publisher=Mathematics Magazine |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burry&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.C.

==Mathematical decoration==

===Islamic architectural decoration===
{{main article|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Islamic buildings are often decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] which typically make use of several mathematical [[tessellations]], formed of ceramic tiles ([[girih]], [[zellige]]) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns. Some of these are based on the 'Khatem Sulemani' or Solomon's seal motif, which is an eight-pointed star made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre.&lt;ref name=Ronning&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/ronning%20_geometry_and_Islamic_patterns.pdf | title=Islamic Patterns And Symmetry Groups | publisher=University of Exeter | accessdate=18 April 2014 | author=Rønning, Frode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible [[wallpaper groups]]; as early as 1944, Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations, while in 1986 [[Branko Grünbaum]] claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra, asserting controversially that the remaining 4 groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament.&lt;ref name=Ronning/&gt;

{{further information|Ornament (art)|Contemporary architecture}}

Towards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48/&gt; In 1913, the Modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] had declared that "Ornament is a crime",&lt;ref name=Gibberd&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibberd |first1=Matt |last2=Hill |first2=Albert |title=The Return of Ornamentation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/7279/the-return-of-ornamentation.html |accessdate=12 October 2015 |work=The Telegraph |date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century. In the 21st century, architects are again starting to explore the use of [[Ornament (art)|ornament]]. 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse. Henning Larsen's 2011 [[Harpa Concert and Conference Centre]], Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass.&lt;ref name=Gibberd/&gt; Foreign Office Architects' 2010 [[Ravensbourne College]], London is tessellated decoratively with 28,000 anodised aluminium tiles in red, white and brown, interlinking circular windows of differing sizes.

==Defence==

===Europe===
{{further information|Star fort}}

The architecture of [[fortification]]s evolved from [[medieval fortification|medieval fortresses]], which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical [[star fort]]s able to resist [[artillery]] bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include [[Michelangelo]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] and [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, C. |year=1975 |title=Fire &amp; Stone, The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660–1860 |publisher=Booksales |isbn=978-0-7858-2109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler |first1=David |title=The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough |date=1990 |publisher=Spellmount |isbn=978-0-946771-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural historian [[Siegfried Giedion]] argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance [[Urban planning|ideal city]]: "The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giedion, Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Giedion |title=Space, Time and Architecture |publisher=Harvard University Press |origyear=1941 |date=1962 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:HakkaYongding.jpg|thumb|A [[tulou]] in [[Yongding County]], [[Fujian province]]]]

In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tom |title=China's Remote Fortresses Lose Residents, Gain Tourists |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150102-hakka-china-tulou-fujian-world-heritage-culture-housing/ |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=6 January 2017 |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental goals==

Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals.&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simitch |first1=Andrea |last2=Warke |first2=Val |title=The Language of Architecture: 26 Principles Every Architect Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2v-1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191 |year=2014 |publisher=Rockport Publishers |isbn=978-1-62788-048-0 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Foster and Partners]]' [[30 St Mary Axe]], London, known as "[[#Top|The Gherkin]]"&lt;!--links to top (lead image)--&gt; for its [[cucumber]]-like shape, is a [[solid of revolution]] designed using [[Computer aided design|parametric modelling]]. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are [[quadrilateral]]s, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.&lt;ref name=Freiberger&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freiberger |first1=Marianne |title=Perfect buildings: the maths of modern architecture |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/perfect-buildings-maths-modern-architecture|publisher=Plus magazine|accessdate=5 October 2015|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[yakhchal]] (ice pit) of [[Iran|Persia]] functioned as an [[evaporative cooler]]. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with [[windcatcher]]s. The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert [[faloodeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahdavinejad |first=M. |author2=Javanrudi, Kavan |title=Assessment of Ancient Fridges: A Sustainable Method to Storage Ice in Hot-Arid Climates |journal=Asian Culture and History |date=July 2012 |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.5539/ach.v4n2p133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Modern Painters''''' (1843–60) is a five-volume work by the eminent Victorian art critic, [[John Ruskin]], begun when he was 24 years old.  Ruskin argues that recent painters emerging from the tradition of the [[picturesque]] are superior in the art of landscape to the [[old master]]s. The book was primarily written as a defence of the later work of [[J.M.W. Turner]]. Ruskin used the book to argue that art should devote itself to the accurate documentation of nature. In Ruskin's view, Turner had developed from early detailed documentation of nature to a later more profound insight into natural forces and atmospheric effects. It was in his 1842 visit to Switzerland that Ruskin collected material used to form the basis of Vol One. &lt;ref&gt;''The Diaries of John Ruskin Vol I. (1835-1847)'' Ed. Joan Evans and John Howard Whitehouse, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ruskin added later volumes in subsequent years. Volume two (1846) placed emphasis on symbolism in art, expressed through nature. The second volume was influential on the early development of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. He produced three more volumes, with the fifth and final volume appearing in 1860.

When analysing the regularities and structure of [[music]] as well as the processing of music in the [[brain]], certain findings lead to the question of whether music is based on a [[syntax]] that could be compared with [[linguistic syntax]]. To get closer to this question it is necessary to have a look at the basic aspects of syntax in [[language]], as language unquestionably presents a complex syntactical system. If music has a matchable syntax, noteworthy equivalents to basic aspects of linguistic syntax have to be found in musical structure. By implication the processing of music in comparison to language could also give information about the structure of music.

==Comparison to linguistic syntax==
Syntax in general can be referred to as a study of the principles and rules needed for the construction of a language or as a term in particular describing these principles and rules for a special language.

===Linguistic syntax – three principles&lt;ref name=Patel2008&gt;Patel, A.D. (2008). Music, Language, and the Brain. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt;===
Linguistic syntax is especially marked by its structural richness, which becomes apparent in its multi layered organization as well as in the strong relationship between syntax and meaning. That is that there are special linguistic syntactic principles that define how the language is formed out of different subunits, such as words out of [[morphemes]], phrases out of words and sentences out of phrases. Furthermore, linguistic syntax is featured by the fact that a word can take on abstract [[grammatical functions]] that are less defined through properties of the word itself and more through the context and structural relations. This is for example that every [[noun]] can be used as a [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]] or [[indirect object]], but without a sentence as the normal context of a word, no statement about its [[grammatical function]] can be made. At last, linguistic syntax is marked by abstractness. This means that only conventional structural relations and not psychoacoustic relationships are the basis for the linguistic syntax.

===Musical syntax&lt;ref name=Patel2008/&gt;===
Concerning musical syntax these three aspects of richness in linguistic syntax as well as the abstractness should be found in music too, if one wants to claim that music has a comparable syntax. An annotation that has to be made concerns the fact that most of the studies dealing with musical syntax are confined to the consideration of Western European tonal music. Thus this article can also only focus on [[tonality|Western tonal music]].

====Multilayered organization====
Considering the multilayered organization of music, three levels of [[pitch organization]] can be found in music.

=====Scale degrees=====
The lowest level are [[musical scales]], which consist of seven tones or "scale degrees" per [[octave]] and have an asymmetric pattern of [[interval (music)|intervals]] between them (for example the C-major scale). They are built up out of the 12 possible [[pitch class]]es per octave (A, A{{music|#}},B, C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E, F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}) and the different scale tones are not equal in their structural stability. Empirical evidence indicates that there is a hierarchy concerning the stability of the single tones. The most stable one is called the "[[tonic (music)|tonic]]" and embodies the tonal centre of the scale. The most unstable tones were the ones closest to the tonic (scale degrees 2 and 7), which are called the "[[supertonic]]" and the "[[leading tone]]". In studies scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 have been judged as closely related. It was also shown that an implicit knowledge of scale structure has to be learned and developed in childhood and is not inborn.

=====Chord structure=====
The next superordinate level of pitch organization is the [[chord (music)|chord]] structure, which means that three scale tones with a distance of two scale steps each are played simultaneously and are therefore combined into chords. When building up chords on the basis of a musical scale there are three different kinds of chords resulting, namely "major"(e.g. C-E-G), "minor" (e.g. D-F-A) and "diminished" (e.g. B-D-F) triads. This is due to the asymmetric intervals between the scale tones. These asymmetric intervals effect, that a distance of two scale steps can comprise either three or four semitones and therefore be an interval of a minor (with three semitones) or a major (with four semitones) third. A [[major triad]] consists of a major third followed by a minor third and is built on scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 (or 4, 6 and 1, for the subdominant, and 5, 7 and 2, for the dominant, the other two major triads that can be formed from the major scale). A [[minor triad]] consists of a minor third followed by a major third and is built on scale degrees 2, 4 and 6 (or 3, 5 and 7, for the mediant, and 6, 1 and 4, for the submediant). Only on scale degree 7 the triad consists of two minor thirds and is therefore defined as a [[diminished triad]].
Chordal syntax touches mainly four basic aspects. The first is, that the lowest [[Musical note|note]] in each triad functions as a fundament of the chord and therefore as the structural most important pitch. The chord is named after this note as well as the chord's harmonic label is grounded on it. The second aspect is, that chord syntax provides norms for altering chords by additional tones. One example is the addition of a fourth tone to a triad, which is the seventh tone of the scale (e.g. in a C-major scale the addition of F to the triad G-B-D would lead to a so-called "[[dominant seventh chord]]"). Concerning norms for the progression of chords in time the third aspect focuses on the relationship between chords. The patterning of chords in a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] for example indicates a movement from a V chord to a I chord. The fact that the I chord is perceived as a resting point in a musical phrase implicates, that the single chords built up on notes of a scale are not equal in there stability but show the same differences in stability as the notes of the scale do. This describes the fourth basic aspect of chordal syntax. The tonic chord (the one built on the tonic, C-E-G in C-major, for example) is the most stable and central chord, followed by the dominant chord (built on the 5th scale degree) and the subdominant chord (built on the 4th scale degree).
"

=====Key structure=====
The highest level of pitch organization can be seen in [[key (music)|key structure]]. In Western European tonal music the key is based on a scale with its associated chords and chord relations. Scales can be built up as minor or major scales (differing in the succession of intervals between the scale tones) on each of the 12 pitch classes and therefore there are 24 possible keys in tonal music. Analysing [[key (music)|key]] structure in context of musical syntax means to examine the relationship between keys in a piece of music. Usually, not only one key is used to build up a composition, but also so-called key "[[modulation]]s" (in other words the alteration of keys) are utilized. In these modulations a certain recurring pattern can be perceived. Switches from one key to another are often found between related keys. Three general principles for relationship between keys can be postulated on the basis of perceptual experiments and also neural evidence for implicit knowledge of key structure. Looking at the C-major key as an example, there are three close related keys: G-major, A-minor and C-minor. C-major and G-major are keys whose 1st scale degrees are separated by a musical fifth (the pattern of relations is represented in the [[circle of fifths]]" for major keys). A-minor and C-major share the same notes of the scale but with a different tonic (so-called [[relative minor key]], i.e. C-major and A-minor). And C-major and C-minor have the same tonic in their scales.
All in all it can be said that music like the human language has a considerable multi layered organization.

====Hierarchical structure====
Considering the last two basic aspects of linguistic syntax, namely the considerable significance of the order of subunits for the meaning of a sentence as well as the fact that words undertake abstract grammatical functions defined through context and structural relations, it seems to be useful to analyse the hierarchical structure of music to find correlations in music.

=====Ornamentation=====
One aspect of hierarchical structure of music is the [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]]. The meaning of the word "ornamentation" points to the fact that there are events in a musical context that are less important to form an idea of the general gist of a sequence than others. The decision on the importance of events not only comprises harmonic considerations, but also rhythmic and motivic information. But a classification of events simply into ornamental and structural events would be too superficial. In fact the most common hypothesis implies, that music is organized into structural levels, which can be pictured as branches of a tree. A pitch that is structural at a higher level may be ornamental at a deeper level. This can be compared with the hierarchical syntactic structure of a [[sentence (music)|sentence]] in which there are structural elements that are necessary to build up a sentence like the noun phrase and the verb phrase but looking at a deeper level the structural elements also contain additional or ornamental constituents.

=====Tension and resolution=====
Searching for other aspects of hierarchical structure of music there is a controversial discussion, if the organization of [[Tension (music)|tension]] and [[Resolution (music)|resolution]] in music can be described as hierarchical structure or only as a purely sequential structure. According to [[Patel]]&lt;ref name =Patel2008/&gt; research in this area has produced apparently contradictory evidence, and more research is needed to answer this question.
The question concerning the kind of structure that features tension and resolution in music is linked very close to the relationship between order and meaning in music. Considering tension and resolution as one possible kind of meaning in music a hierarchical structure would imply that a change of order of musical elements would have an influence on the meaning of the music.

====Abstractness====
The last aspect to examine is the [[abstraction|abstractness]] of linguistic syntax and its correlate in music. There are two contradicting points of views. The first one claims that the foundation for musical scales and for the existence of a [[tonal centre]] in music can be seen in the physical basis of [[overtone]] series or in the psychoacoustic properties of chord in tonal music respectively. But in recent time there is strong evidence for the second point of view that syntax reflects abstract cognitive relationships.

All in all the consideration of syntax in music and language shows, that music has a syntax comparable to the linguistic syntax especially concerning a great complexity and a hierarchical organization. Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized, that musical syntax is not a simple variant of linguistic syntax, but a similar complex system with its own substance. That means that it would be the wrong way just to search for musical analogies of linguistic syntactic entities such as nouns or verbs.

==Neuronal processing of musical and linguistic syntax==

Investigating the neuronal processing of musical syntax can serve two proposed aspects.'''&lt;ref&gt;Patel, A.D. (2003). Language, music, syntax and the brain. Nature Neuroscience. 6(7):674-681&lt;/ref&gt;''' The first is to learn more about the processing of music in general. That is, which areas of the [[brain]] are involved and if there are specific markers of brain activity due to the processing of music and musical syntax. The second aspect is to compare the processing of musical and linguistic syntax to find out, if they have an effect upon each other or if there even is a significant overlap. The verification of an overlap would support the thesis, that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular. "Modular" means, that the complex system of processing is decomposed into subsystems with modular functions. Concerning the processing of syntax this would mean, that the [[domain knowledge|domain]] of music and language each have specific syntactic representations, but that they share [[neural resources]] for activating and integrating these representations during [[syntactic processing]].

===Processing of music and musical syntax===

====Requirements====

Processing of music and musical syntax comprises several aspects concerning melodic, rhythmic, metric, timbral and harmonic structure. For the processing of [[Diatonic function|chord functions]] four steps in processing can be described.
(1)Primarily, a tonal centre has to be detected out of the first chords of a sequence. Often the first chord is interpreted as the tonal centre of a sequence and a reevaluation is necessary, if the first chord has another harmonic function.
(2)Successive chords are related to this tonal centre concerning their [[harmonic distance]] from the tonal centre.
(3)As described above (Does music have a syntax?), music has a hierarchical structure in terms of pitch organization and organization of tensioning and releasing in music. Pitch organization concerning chords means, that in a musical phrase the tonic is the most stable chord and experienced as the resting point. The dominant and subdominant anon are more stable than the submediant and the supertonic. The progression of chords in time forms a tonal structure based on pitch organization, in which moving away from the tonic is perceived as tensioning and moving towards the tonic is experienced as releasing. Therefore, hierarchical relations may convey organized patterns of meaning.
(4)Concerning harmonic aspects of major-minor tonal music, Musical syntax can be characterized by statistical regularities in the succession of chord functions in time, that is probabilities of chord transitions. As these regularities are stored in a [[long-term memory]], predictions about following chords are made automatically, when listening to a musical phrase.

====MMN and ERAN&lt;ref&gt;Koelsch, S. (2009). "Music-syntactic Processing and Auditory Memory – Similarities and Differences between ERAN and MMN". Psychophysiology, 46(1): 179-190.&lt;/ref&gt;====

The violation of these automatically made predictions lead to the observation of so-called [[Event-related potential|ERPs]] (event related potential, a stereotyped electrophysiological response to an internal or external stimulus). Two forms of ERPs can be detected in the context of processing music. One is the [[Mismatch negativity|MMN]] (mismatch negativity), which has first been investigated only with physical deviants like [[frequency]], [[sound intensity]], [[timbre]] deviants (referred to as [[phMMN]]) and could now also be shown for changes of abstract auditory features like tone pitches (referred to as [[afMMN]]). The other one is the so-called [[Electroencephalography|ERAN]] (early right anterior negativity), which can be elicited by syntactic irregularities in music. Both the ERAN and the MMN are ERPs indicating a mismatch between predictions based on regularities and actually experienced acoustic information. As for a long time it seemed to be, that the ERAN is a special variant of the MMN, the question arises, why they are told apart today. There are several differences between the MMN and the ERAN found in the last years:

=====Differences – occurrence=====
Even though music syntactic regularities are often simultaneously acoustical similar and music syntactic irregularities are often simultaneously acoustical different, an ERAN but not an MMN can be elicit, when a chord does not represent a physical but a syntactic deviance. To demonstrate this, so-called "Neapolitan sixth chords" are used. These are consonant chords when played solitary, but which are added into a musical phrase of in which they are only distantly related to the harmonic context. Added into a chord sequence of five chords, the addition of a [[Neapolitan sixth chord]] at the third or at the fifth position evokes different amplitudes of ERANs in the [[EEG]] with a higher [[amplitude]] at the fifth position. Nevertheless, when creating a chord sequence in which the [[Neapolitan chord]] at the fifth position is music-syntactically less irregular than a Neapolitan chord at the third position, the amplitude is higher at the third position (see figure 4...). In opposition to the MMN, a clear ERAN is also elicited by using syntactically irregular chords, which are acoustically more similar to a proceeding harmonic context than syntactically regular chords. Therefore, the MMN seems to be based on an on-line establishment of regularities. That means, that the regularities are extracted on-line from the acoustic environment. In opposition, the ERAN rests upon representations of music-syntactic regularities which exist in a [[long-term memory]] format and which are learned during early childhood.

=====Differences – development=====
This is represented in the development of the ERAN and MMN. The ERAN cannot be verified in newborn babies, whereas the MMN can actually be demonstrated in [[fetus]]. In two-year-old children, the ERAN is very small, in five-year-old children a clear ERAN is found, but with a longer latency than in adults. With the age of 11 years children show an ERAN similar to ERANs in adults. Out of these observation the thesis can be built that the MMN is essential for the establishment and maintenance of representations of the acoustic environment and for processes of the auditory scene analysis. But only the ERAN is completely based on learning to build up a structural model, which is established with reference to representations of syntactic regularities already existing in a long-term memory format. Considering effects of [[training]] both the ERAN and the MMN can be modulated by training.

=====Differences – neural sources=====
Differences between the ERAN and the MMN also exist in the [[neural sources]] for the main contributions to the ERPs. The sources for the ERAN are located in the [[pars opercularis]] of the [[inferior fronto-lateral cortex]] (inferior [[Brodmann's area]] with contributions from the ventrolateral [[premotor cortex]] and the [[anterior superior temporal gyrus]], whereas the MMN receives its main contributions from and within the vicinity of the [[primary auditory cortex]] with additional sources in the [[frontal cortex|frontal cortical areas]]. Therefore, the sources for the ERAN basically lie in the frontal cortex whereas the sources for the MMN are located in the [[temporal lobe]]. Other hints for this thesis emerge from the fact that under a [[propofol]] sedation which mainly affects the frontal cortex, the ERAN is abolished while the MMN is only reduced. At last, the amplitude of the ERAN is reduced under ignore conditions whereas the MMN is largely unaffected by attentional modulations.

=====Processes to elicit the MMN or ERAN=====

(1)First, a separation of sound sources, an extraction of sound features and the establishment of representations of auditory objects of the incoming acoustic input have to be made. The same processes are required for the MMN and ERAN.

(2)For the MMN regularities are filtered on-line out of the input to create a model of the acoustic environment. At this point, there is a difference to the ERAN as for the ERAN representations of regularities already exist in a long-term memory format and the incoming sound is integrated into a pre existent model of [[musical form|musical structure]].

(3)According to the model of musical structure, predictions concerning forthcoming auditory events are formed. This process is similar for the ERAN and for the MMN.

(4)At least a comparison between the actually incoming sound and the predictions based on the model is made. This process is partly the same for the MMN and the ERAN as well.

=== Comparison of the processing of musical and linguistic syntax&lt;ref name=Patel2008/&gt;===

As the ERAN is similar to an ERP called [[Early Left Anterior Negativity|ELAN]] which can be elicited by violation of linguistic syntax it seems to be obvious that the ERAN really represents syntactic processing. Deduced from this thought an interaction between music-syntactic and language-syntactic processing would be very likely.There are different possibilities in [[neuroscience]] to approach to an answer to the question of an overlap between the neuronal processing of linguistic and musical syntax.

====Neuropsychological approach====
This method deals with the question, how structure and function of the [[brain]] relate to outcomes in behaviour and other psychological processes. From this area of research there has been evidence for the dissociation between musical and linguistic syntactic abilities. In case reports it was possible to show that [[amusia]] ( a deficiency in fine-grainded perception of pitch which leads to musical tone-deafness and can be congenital or acquired later in life as from brain damage) is not necessarily linked to [[aphasia]] (severe language impairments following brain damage) and vice versa. This means that individuals with normal speech and language abilities showed musical tone-deafness as well as individuals with language impairments had sufficient means of musical syntactic abilities. The problem of neuropsychologic research is that there has not been a former case report which showed that aphasia does not necessarily entail amusia in non-musicians, to the contrary newer findings suggest that amusia is almost always linked to aphasia.

====Neuroimaging====
Furthermore, results from [[neuroimaging]] led to the "[[shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis]]" (SSIRH), which supports the presumption, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and that syntactic operations are modular. Furthermore, research using the method of [[electroencephalography]] has shown that a difficulty or irritation in musical as well as in linguistic syntax elicit ERPs which are similar to each other.

How can the discrepancy between [[neuropsychology]] and neuroimaging be explained?

====Modularity====
In fact, the concept of modularity itself can help to understand the different and apparently contradicting findings in neuropsychologic research and neuroimaging. Introducing the concept of a dual system, in which there is a distinction between syntactic representation and syntactic processing, this could mean, that there is a distinction between long-term structural knowledge in a [[domain knowledge|domain]] (representation) and operations conducted on that knowledge (syntactic processing). A damage in an area representing long-term musical knowledge would lead to amusia without aphasia, but a damage in an area representing syntactic processing would cause an impairment of both musical and linguistic syntactic processing.

====Comparison of syntactic processing-three theories====
The comparison of the syntactic processing of language and music is based on three theories which should be mentioned but which are not explained in detail. The first two, the "dependency locality theory" and the "expectancy theory" refer to syntactic processing in language, whereas the third one, the "tonal pitch space theory", relates to the syntactic processing in music.

The language theories contribute to the concept that in order to conceive the structure of a sentence, resources are consumed. If the conception of a this structure is difficult due to the fact that distant words belong to each other or an expected structure of the sentence is violated, more resources, namely the ones for activating low-activation items, are consumed.

Violating an anticipated structure in music could mean a harmonically unexpected note or chord in a musical sequence. As in language this is associated with a "processing cost due to the tonal distance" (Patel, 2008) and therefore means that more resources are needed for activating low-activation items.

====SSIRH – the leading concept====
Overall these theories lead to the "shared syntactic integration resources hypothesis" as the areas from which low-activation items are activated could be the correlate to the overlap between linguistic and musical syntax.
Strong evidence for the existence of this overlap comes from studies, in which music-syntactic and a linguistic-syntactic irregularities were presented simultaneously. They showed an interaction between the ERAN and the [[LAN]] (left anterior negativity;ERP which is elicited by linguistic-syntactic irregularities). The LAN elicited was reduced when an irregular word was presented simultaneously with an irregular chord compared to the condition when an irregular word was presented with a regular chord. Contrary to this finding the phMMN elicited by frequency deviants did not interact with the LAN.

From this facts it can be reasoned that the ERAN relies on neural resources related to syntactic processing (Koelsch 2008). Furthermore, they give strong evidence for the thesis, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and therefore that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular.

The database was established as collaboration between the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] and [[Nature Publishing Group]] in 2005 and was launched in November 2006. In September 2012, active curation was stopped but the data will be available for one year after that date.

==Database content==
As of November 2007, the database contained 59 pathways (comprising 3309 molecular interactions) curated by the NCI-Nature editorial team. New pathways are added each month. The database also contains 254 pathways (comprising 3003 interactions) imported from the June 2004 edition of the [[BioCarta]] pathway database.

The NCI-Nature curated data is gathered from published research literature and reviewed by expert scientists before publication. Evidence codes are assigned to each molecular interaction, which allows users to evaluate the reliability of the interactions or to search for interactions identified by particular experimental techniques.

==Data output and download==
The database content can be viewed in self-contained, pre-defined pathways. The database can also dynamically generate interaction networks to visualize the results of database searches. Pathways and dynamically generated networks are displayed in GIF and SVG images and can be downloaded as [[XML]] (including the standard pathway interchange format, [[BioPAX]]). The entire database is also available for download.

W. | authorlink1 = George W. Hart| title = Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring | doi = 10.1109/5.192069 | journal = [[Proceedings of the IEEE]]| volume = 80 | issue = 12 | pages = 1870 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a process for analyzing changes in the voltage and current going into a house and deducing what appliances are used in the house as well as their individual energy consumption. [[Electric meter]]s with NILM technology are used by utility companies to survey the specific uses of electric power in different homes. NILM is considered a low-cost alternative to attaching individual monitors on each appliance. It does, however, present privacy concerns.

==Background and theory==
Nonintrusive load monitoring was invented by [[George W. Hart]], Ed Kern and Fred Schweppe of [[MIT]] in the early 1980s with funding from the [[Electric Power Research Institute]].&lt;ref name="hart"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = G. W. | authorlink = George W. Hart| title = Residential energy monitoring and computerized surveillance via utility power flows | doi = 10.1109/44.31557 | journal = IEEE Technology and Society Magazine | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 12–16 | year = 1989 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgehart.com/research/nalmrefs.html NALM bibliography 1980–1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NILM fig 1.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1 from US patent 4858141 showing basic process for NILM]]
The basic process is described in {{US patent|4858141}}. As shown in figure 1 from the patent, a digital AC monitor is attached to the single-phase power going into a residence.  Changes in the voltage and current are measured (i.e. admittance measurement unit), normalized (scaler) and recorded (net change detector unit). A [[cluster analysis]] is then performed to identify when different appliances are turned on and off. If a 60-watt bulb is turned on, for example, followed by a 100-watt bulb being turned on, followed by the 60-watt bulb being turned off followed by the 100-watt bulb being turned off, the NIALM unit will match the on and off signals from the 60-watt bulb and the on and off signals from the 100-watt bulb to determine how much power was used by each bulb and when. The system is sufficiently sensitive that individual 60-watt bulbs can be discriminated due to the normal variations in actual power draw of bulbs with the same nominal rating (e.g. one bulb might draw 61 watts, another 62 watts).

[[Image:NILM fig 8.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 8 from US patent 4858141 showing how differences in reactive power can help distinguish one appliance from another]]
The system can measure both [[reactive power]] and [[real power]]. Hence two appliances with the same total power draw can be distinguished by differences in their [[complex impedance]]. As shown in figure 8 from the patent, for example, a refrigerator electric motor and a pure resistive heater can be distinguished in part because the electric motor has significant changes in reactive power when it turns on and off, whereas the heater has almost none.

NILM systems can also identify appliances with a series of individual changes in power draw.  These appliances are modeled as [[finite state machines]]. A dishwasher, for example, has heaters and motors that turn on and off during a typical dish washing cycle. These will be identified as clusters, and power draw for the entire cluster will be recorded. Hence “dishwasher” power draw can be identified as opposed to “resistor heating unit” and “electric motor”.

==Privacy concerns==
NILM can detect what types of appliances people have and their behavioral patterns. Patterns of energy use may indicate behavior patterns, such as routine times that nobody is at home, or embarrassing or illegal behavior of residents. It could, for example, reveal when the occupants of a house are using the shower, or when individual lights are turned on and off.&lt;ref name="hart" /&gt;

If the NILM is running remotely at a utility or by a third party, the homeowner may not know that their behavior is being monitored and recorded. 

A stand-alone in-home system, under the control of the user, can provide feedback about energy use, without revealing information to others. Drawing links between their behavior and energy consumption may help reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency, flatten peak loads, save money, or balance appliance use with green energy availability. However the use of a stand-alone system does not protect one from remote monitoring.

The accuracy and capability of this technology is still developing and is not 100% reliable in near-real-time, such that complete information is accumulated and analyzed over periods ranging from minutes to hours.

The '''philosophy of statistics''' involves the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], [[Theory of justification|justification]], [[utility]], use and abuse of [[statistics]] and its [[methodology]], and [[ethical]] and [[epistemological]] issues involved in the consideration of choice and interpretation of data and methods of [[statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jan-Willem |last=Romijn |year=2014 |title=Philosophy of statistics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics of interest==
* [[Foundations of statistics]] involves issues in [[theoretical statistics]], its goals and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods to meet these goals, [[Parametric statistics|parametric]] assumptions or lack thereof considered in [[nonparametric statistics]], [[model selection]] for the underlying [[probability distribution]], and interpretation of the meaning of inferences made using statistics, related to the [[philosophy of probability]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. Discussion of the selection of the goals and the meaning of optimization, in foundations of statistics, are the subject of the philosophy of statistics.  Selection of distribution models, and of the means of selection, is the subject of the philosophy of statistics, whereas the mathematics of optimization is the subject of nonparametric statistics.
* [[Sir David Cox (statistician)|David Cox]] makes the point {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} that any kind of interpretation of evidence is in fact a statistical model, although it is known through Ian Hacking's work {{Citation needed|reason=Which of Hacking's works are being referred to here|date=July 2016}} that many are ignorant of this subtlety.
* Issues arise involving [[sample size]], such as cost and efficiency, are common, such as in polling and pharmaceutical research.
* Extra-mathematical considerations in the design of experiments and accommodating these issues arise in most actual experiments.{{elucidate|date=July 2016}}
* The motivation and justification of [[data analysis]] and [[experimental design]], as part of the [[scientific method]] are considered.
* Distinctions between [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[logical deduction]] relevant to inferences from [[data]] and [[evidence]] arise, such as when [[frequentist]] interpretations are compared with [[Confidence Interval|degrees of certainty]] derived from [[Bayesian inference]]. However, the difference between induction and ordinary reasoning is not generally appreciated.{{sfn|Hacking|2006}}
* Leo Breiman exposed the diversity of thinking in his article on 'The Two Cultures', making the point that statistics has several kinds of inference to make, modelling and prediction amongst them.{{sfn|Breiman|2001}}
* Issues in the philosophy of statistics arise throughout the [[history of statistics]].  [[Causality]] considerations arise with interpretations of, and definitions of, [[correlation]], and in the [[theory of measurement]].
* Objectivity in statistics is often confused with truth whereas it is better understood as replicability, which then needs to be defined in the particular case. [[Theodore Porter]] develops this as being the path pursued when trust has evaporated, being replaced with criteria.{{sfn|Porter|1995}}
* [[Ethics]] associated with [[epistemology]] and [[medical]] applications arise from potential abuse of statistics, such as selection of method or [[Data transformation (statistics)|transformations]] of the data to arrive at different probability conclusions for the same data set.  For example, the meaning of applications of a [[statistical inference]] to a single person, such as one single cancer patient, when there is no frequentist interpretation for that patient to adopt.
* Campaigns for [[statistical literacy]] must wrestle with the problem that most interesting questions around individual risk are very difficult to determine or interpret, even with the computer power currently available.

The ''Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment'' ('''Scientific and Technical Center for Building''') CSTB, is the French national organisation providing research and innovation, consultancy, testing, training and certification services in the construction industry.

It was founded in 1947 after the [[World War II|Second World War]] to support the reconstruction effort.

The mission of the CSTB is to ensure the quality and safety of buildings, and support innovation from the idea to the market. It brings together multidisciplinary skills to develop and share essential scientific and technical knowledge, and to provide stakeholders with answers to the challenges of their professional practice.

The CSTB focuses on four key activities: research and consulting, assessment, certification and dissemination of knowledge. Its field of expertise covers construction products, buildings, and their integration into neighborhoods and cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institut-carnot.cstb.fr/en/about-us/missions/ Official website, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sea surface temperature''' (SST) is the water [[temperature]] close to the [[ocean]]'s surface. The exact meaning of ''surface'' varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between {{convert|1|mm|in|sigfig=1}} and {{convert|20|m|ft|sigfig=1}} below the [[sea]] surface.  [[Air mass]]es in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore.  Localized areas of heavy [[snow]] can form in [[rainband|bands]] downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass.  Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of [[tropical cyclogenesis]] over the [[Earth]]'s oceans.  Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper {{convert|30|m|ft|sigfig=1}} of the ocean.  SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days.  In addition, [[ocean current]]s such as the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]] (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-05-global-climate-verge-multi-decadal.html|doi=10.1038/nature14491|authors=Gerard D.

Smeed|date=27 May 2015|journal=Nature|title=Ocean impact on decadal Atlantic climate variability revealed by sea-level observations|bibcode = 2015Natur.521..508M|volume=521|pages=508–510|pmid=26017453}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major impact results from the global [[thermohaline]] circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.

'''Ocean temperature''' is related to [[ocean heat content]], an important topic in the debate over [[global warming]]. 

Coastal SSTs can cause offshore winds to generate [[upwelling]], which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses, but shallower waters over a [[continental shelf]] are often warmer.  Onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant, such as the northwest coast of [[South America]].  Its values are important within [[numerical weather prediction]] as the SST influences the atmosphere above, such as in the formation of [[sea breeze]]s and [[advection fog#Types|sea fog]].  It is also used to calibrate measurements from [[weather satellite]]s.

==Measurement==
[[File:MODIS and AIRS SST comp fig2.i.jpg|right|thumb|Temperature profile of the surface layer of the ocean (a) at night and (b) during the day]]
There are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured.  Away from the immediate sea surface, general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement.  This is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths, especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean's surface and strong vertical temperature gradients (a diurnal [[thermocline]]).&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;   Sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean, known as the near-surface layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tZary8a4HMwC&amp;dq=ocean+layers+book&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=ocean%20layers%20book&amp;f=false|page=xi|author1=Alexander Soloviev |author2=Roger Lukas |title=The near-surface layer of the ocean: structure, dynamics and applications|isbn=978-1-4020-4052-8|year=2006|publisher=シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermometers===
SST was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured.  [[Benjamin Franklin]] suspended a [[mercury thermometer]] from a ship while travelling between the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] in his survey of the [[Gulf stream]] in the late eighteenth century.  SST was later measured by dipping a [[thermometer]] into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface.  The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963.  These observations have a warm bias of around {{convert|0.6|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}} due to the heat of the engine room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A6ew-bJDIDIC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=measurement+of+sea+surface+temperature+bucket+of+water+book#v=onepage&amp;q=measurement%20of%20sea%20surface%20temperature%20bucket%20of%20water%20book&amp;f=false|pages=24–25|title=Data analysis methods in physical oceanography|author1=William J.

Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burroughs|first=William James|title=Climate change : a multidisciplinary approach|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

There are several difficulties with satellite-based absolute SST measurements. First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates from the [[Sea surface microlayer|top "skin" of the ocean]], approximately the top 0.01 [[millimetre|mm]] or less, which may not represent the [[bulk temperature]] of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth &lt;!-- clarify --&gt;efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jk1fIo51uwMC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=measurement+of+sea+surface+temperature+book#v=onepage&amp;q=measurement%20of%20sea%20surface%20temperature%20book&amp;f=false|page=279|author=Ian Stuart Robinson|title=Measuring the oceans from space: the principles and methods of satellite oceanography|publisher=Springer|year=2004|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-3-540-42647-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, the satellite cannot look through clouds, creating a cool bias in satellite-derived SSTs within cloudy areas.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;  However, passive microwave techniques can accurately measure SST and penetrate cloud cover.&lt;ref name="John"/&gt;  Within atmospheric sounder channels on [[weather satellite]]s, which peak just above the ocean's surface, knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

{{Main article|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
El Niño is defined by prolonged differences in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures when compared with the average value. The accepted definition is a warming or cooling of at least 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C (0.9&amp;nbsp;°F) averaged over the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean.  Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 2–7 years and lasts nine months to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|title=ENSO FAQ: How often do El Niño and La Niña typically occur?|accessdate=2009-07-26|date=2005-12-19|author=[[Climate Prediction Center]]|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average period length is 5 years. When this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña "conditions"; when it occurs for more than that period, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña "episodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/enso/?year=2009&amp;month=6&amp;submitted=true|title=El Niño / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) June 2009|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign of an El Niño in the sea surface temperature pattern is when warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east Pacific. It takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific.  El Niño's warm rush of nutrient-poor tropical water, heated by its eastward passage in the Equatorial Current, replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the [[Humboldt Current]]. When El Niño conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in Easterly Trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic impact to local fishing for an international market can be serious.&lt;ref name="deadfish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/eln/home.rxml|title=El Niño|date=1998-04-28|accessdate=2009-07-17|author=WW2010|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While sea surface temperature is important for [[tropical cyclogenesis]], it is also important in determining the formation of sea fog and sea breezes.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hH2NkL_318wC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=sea+surface+temperature+forecasting+numerical+weather+prediction+book#v=onepage&amp;q=sea%20surface%20temperature%20forecasting%20numerical%20weather%20prediction%20book&amp;f=false|page=263|title=Oceanography from Space: Revisited|author=Vittorio Barale|year=2010|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-90-481-8680-8|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as {{convert|35|km|mi}} to {{convert|40|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/fm26377722407422/|author=Jun Inoue, Masayuki Kawashima, Yasushi Fujiyoshi and Masaaki Wakatsuchi|title=Aircraft Observations of Air-mass Modification Over the Sea of Okhotsk during Sea-ice Growth|issue=1|date=October 2005|doi=10.1007/s10546-004-3407-y|pages=111–129|issn=0006-8314|volume=117| journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology|bibcode = 2005BoLMe.117..111I }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, southwest of Northern Hemisphere [[extratropical cyclone]]s, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow [[lake-effect snow]] (or sea effect) bands. Those bands bring strong localized [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], often in the form of [[snow]], since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences—larger than {{convert|13|C-change|F-change|sigfig=2}}—between the water surface and the air above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=B.

Ocean temperature of at least 26.5[[degrees Celsius|°C]] (79.7[[degrees Fahrenheit|°F]]) spanning through at minimum a 50-[[metre]] depth is one of the precursors needed to maintain a [[tropical cyclone]] (a type of [[mesocyclone]]).&lt;ref name="A15"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|title=Subject: A15) How do tropical cyclones form?|accessdate=2011-01-27|year=2011|publisher=[[Hurricane Research Division]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SST&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster|first=PJ|title=Changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA136847986&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=mnastbens&amp;it=r&amp;p=PROF&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=335992f2037df3339c5901f7981d2045|publisher=Gale Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These warm waters are needed to maintain the [[Tropical cyclone#Mechanics|warm core]] that fuels tropical systems.  This value is well above 16.1&amp;nbsp;°C (60.9&amp;nbsp;°F), the long term global average surface temperature of the oceans.&lt;ref name="SSTMEAN"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Matt Menne | publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cmb-faq/anomalies.php#mean | title = Global Long-term Mean Land and Sea Surface Temperatures | date = March 15, 2000 | accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this requirement can be considered only a general baseline because it assumes that the ambient atmospheric environment surrounding an area of disturbed weather presents average conditions. Tropical cyclones have intensified when SSTs were slightly below this standard temperature.

Tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500&amp;nbsp;[[hPa]] level, or 5.9&amp;nbsp;km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain [[lapse rate]] is required to force the atmosphere to be [[Baroclinic instability|unstable]] enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5&amp;nbsp;°C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% [[relative humidity]], the required lapse rate is 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C/km.&lt;ref name="TCS EESC"&gt;{{cite web|year=2000|last=Kushnir|first=Yochanan|title=The Climate System|url=http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/atm_phys.html|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level, the air temperature averages −7&amp;nbsp;°C (18&amp;nbsp;°F) within the tropics, but air in the tropics is normally dry at this height, giving the air room to [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet-bulb]], or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500&amp;nbsp;hPa in a tropical atmosphere of {{convert|-13.2|C|F}} is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is {{convert|26.5|C|F}}, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1&amp;nbsp;°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1&amp;nbsp;°C change at 500&amp;nbsp;hpa.
Inside a [[cold-core low|cold cyclone]], 500&amp;nbsp;hPa temperatures can fall as low as {{convert|-30|C|F}}, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the [[troposphere]], roughly at the 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500&amp;nbsp;hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author1=John M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2761">'''SOUP''' stands for '''[[software]] of unknown''' (or '''uncertain''') '''pedigree''' (or '''provenance'''), and is a term often used in the context of [[safety-critical]] and [[safety-involved]] systems such as [[medical software]].  SOUP is software that has not been developed with a known [[software development process]] or [[software development methodology|methodology]], or which has unknown or no safety-related properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Felix Redmill|booktitle=Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security, SAFECOMP 2001, Budapest, Hungary, September 26&amp;ndash;28, 2001|editor=Udo Voges|pages=122|title=The COTS Debate in Perspective|publisher=Springer|date=2001|isbn=978-3-540-42607-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, engineering projects are faced with economic or other pressure to embody SOUP into their high integrity systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The problem with SOUP is that it cannot be relied upon to perform safety-related functions, and it may prevent other software, hardware or firmware from performing their safety-related functions.  The SOUP problem is therefore one of insulating the safety-involved parts of a system from the SOUP and its undesirable effects.&lt;ref name="emdt"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.emdt.co.uk/article/developing-medical-device-software-iso-62304 |title=Developing Medical Device Software to IEC 62304 |last=Hall |first=Ken |work=EMDT - European Medical Device Technology |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOUP is now a defined term ("Software Of Unknown Provenance") in some medical device regulations through the standard [[IEC 62304|IEC 62304:2006 "medical device software –
software life cycle processes"]]. It is not prohibited to use SOUP but additional controls are needed and the risk needs to be taken into account. Specific practices to take when using SOUP as part of a [[medical device]] may include review of the vendor's software development process, use of [[static program analysis]] by the vendor, design artifacts, and safety guidance.&lt;ref name="meddevice"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://medicaldesign.com/engineering-prototyping/software/device-cots-soup-1111/ |title=Device makers can take COTS, but only with clear SOUP |last=Hobbs |first=Chris |work=Medical Design |date=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Ichiji Tasaki]] pioneered a thermodynamic approach to the phenomenon of nerve pulse propagation which identified several phenomena that were not included in the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]].&lt;ref name=Tasaki&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasaki|first1=Ichiji|title=Physiology and Electrochemistry of Nerve Fibers|date=1982|publisher=Academic Press Inc. (London)|location=Bethesda, Maryland|isbn=0-12-683780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with measuring various non electrical components of a nerve impulse, Tasaki investigated the physical chemistry of [[phase transition]]s in nerve fibers and its importance for nerve pulse propagation. Based on Tasaki's work, Konrad Kaufman proposed sound waves as a physical basis for nerve pulse propagation in an unpublished manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Konrad|title=Action Potentials and Electrochemical Coupling in the Macroscopic Chiral Phospholipid Membrane|date=1989|location=Caruaru, Brazil|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/1VAr_GwfXY4kOlNSuvtvJAIsvRmfc1U8Txl4_iO3aL-XPAS7qqQJmooAu9t0F/edit?authkey=CIqrlMgK&amp;ddrp=1&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic idea at the core of the soliton model is the balancing of intrinsic dispersion of the two dimensional sound waves in the membrane by nonlinear elastic properties near a phase transition.

==Justification==
The model starts with the observation that cell membranes always have a [[melting point|freezing point]] (the temperature below which the consistency changes from fluid to gel-like) only slightly below the organism's body temperature, and this allows for the propagation of solitons. An action potential traveling along a mixed nerve results in a slight increase in temperature followed by a decrease in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1958.0012 |author=Abbott, B.C., Hill, A.V., Howarth, J.V. |title=The positive and negative heat associated with a nerve impulse |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=148 |issue=931 |pages=149–187 |year=1958 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/148/931/149.abstract?sid=55350fa9-13b9-4280-90f3-99a1fc01b2c5|bibcode = 1958RSPSB.148..149A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soliton model proponents claim that no net heat is released during the overall pulse and that the observed temperature changes are inconsistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model. However, this is untrue: the Hodgkin Huxley model predicts a biphasic release and absorption of heat.&lt;ref name="Howarth Heat Review" /&gt; In addition, the AP causes a slight local thickening of the membrane and a force acting outwards;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iwasa, K., Tasaki I., Gibbons, R. |title=Swelling of nerve fibres associated with action potentials |journal=Science |volume=210 |issue=4467 |pages=338–9 |year=1980 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;210/4467/338?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;author1=Iwasa%2C+K&amp;andorexacttitle=or&amp;andorexacttitleabs=or&amp;andorexactfulltext=or&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=1/1/1980&amp;tdate=12/31/1980&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT,HWELTR |pmid=7423196 |doi=10.1126/science.7423196 |bibcode=1980Sci...210..338I}}&lt;/ref&gt; this effect is not predicted by the Hodgkin–Huxley model but does not contradict it, either.

The soliton model attempts to explain the electrical currents associated with the action potential as follows: the traveling soliton locally changes density and thickness of the membrane, and since the membrane contains many charged and [[chemical polarity|polar]] substances, this will result in an electrical effect, akin to [[piezoelectricity]]. Indeed, such nonlinear sound waves have now been shown to exist at lipid interfaces that show superficial similarity to action potentials (electro-opto-mechanical coupling, velocities, biphasic pulse shape, threshold for excitation etc.).&lt;ref name="shrivastava" /&gt; Furthermore, the waves remain localized in the membrane and do not spread out in the surrounding due to an impedance mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griesbauer|first1=J|last2=Wixforth|first2=A|last3=Schneider|first3=M F|title=Wave Propagation in Lipid Monolayers|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=15 Nov 2009|volume=97|issue=10|pages=2710–2716|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.049|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0006349509013150/1-s2.0-S0006349509013150-main.pdf?_tid=af52937a-e9cf-11e4-8cfd-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1429804073_add2909d02a98a7343eb4804fe059cf0|pmid=19917224|pmc=2776282|bibcode=2009BpJ....97.2710G}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these mechanical waves differ in fundamental ways from the properties described by the [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]] in that they do not exhibit the very specific ionic selectivity, voltage sensitivity, time-course, or sensitivity to toxins that are integral to the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

==Formalism==

The soliton representing the action potential of nerves is the solution of the [[partial differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 \Delta \rho}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[\left(c_0^2 + p\Delta \rho + q\Delta \rho^2\right)\frac{\partial \Delta \rho}{\partial x}\right] - h\frac{\partial^4 \Delta\rho}{\partial x^4}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''t''}} is time and {{math|''x''}} is the position along the nerve axon. {{math|Δ''ρ''}} is the change in membrane density under the influence of the action potential,  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the sound velocity of the nerve membrane, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} describe the nature of the phase transition and thereby the nonlinearity of the elastic constants of the nerve membrane. The parameters {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are dictated by the thermodynamic properties of the nerve membrane and cannot be adjusted freely. They have to be determined experimentally. The parameter {{math|''h''}} describes the frequency dependence of the sound velocity of the membrane ([[dispersion relation]]). The above equation does not contain any fit parameters. It is formally related to the [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq approximation]] for solitons in water canals. The solutions of the above equation possess a limiting maximum amplitude and a minimum propagation velocity that is similar to the pulse velocity in myelinated nerves. Under restrictive assumptions, there exist periodic solutions that display hyperpolarization and refractory periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Villagran Vargas, E., Ludu, A., Hustert, R., Gumrich, P., Jackson, A.D., Heimburg, T. |title=Periodic solutions and refractory periods in the soliton theory for nerves and the locust femoral nerve |year=2010 |pmid=21177017 |doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2010.11.001 |volume=153 |issue=2–3 |pages=159–167 |journal=Biophysical Chemistry |arxiv=1006.3281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of ion channels==
Advocates of the soliton model claim that it explains several aspects of the action potential, which are not explained by the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Since it is of thermodynamic nature it does not address the properties of single macromolecules like [[ion channel]] proteins on a molecular scale. It is rather assumed that their properties are implicitly contained in the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the nerve membranes. The soliton model predicts membrane current fluctuations during the action potential. These currents are of similar appearance as those reported for ion channel proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2010.02.018 |author=Heimburg, T. |title=Lipid Ion Channels |journal=Biophys. Chem. |volume=150 |issue=1–3 |pages=2–22 |year=2010 |arxiv=1001.2524 |pmid=20385440}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thought to be caused by lipid membrane pores spontaneously generated by the thermal fluctuations. Such thermal fluctuations cannot explain the specific ionic selectivity or the specific time-course of the response to voltage changes.

==Application to anesthesia==
The authors claim that their model explains the previously obscure mode of action of numerous [[anesthetic]]s. The [[Minimum alveolar concentration#Meyer-Overton hypothesis|Meyer–Overton observation]] holds that the strength of a wide variety of chemically diverse anesthetics is proportional to their [[lipid]] solubility, suggesting that they do not act by binding to specific [[protein]]s such as ion channels but instead by dissolving in and changing the properties of the lipid membrane. Dissolving substances in the membrane lowers the membrane's freezing point, and the resulting larger difference between body temperature and freezing point inhibits the propagation of solitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heimburg, T., Jackson, A.D. |title=The thermodynamics of general anesthesia |journal=Biophys. J. |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=3159–65 |url=http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495(07)71124-4 |year=2007 |pmid=17293400 |pmc=1852341 |doi=10.1529/biophysj.106.099754 |bibcode=2007BpJ....92.3159H|arxiv = physics/0610147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By increasing pressure, lowering [[pH]] or lowering temperature, this difference can be restored back to normal, which should cancel the action of anesthetics: this is indeed observed. The amount of pressure needed to cancel the action of an anesthetic of a given lipid solubility can be computed from the soliton model and agrees reasonably well with experimental observations.

==Differences between model predictions and experimental observations==
[[File:BBM equation - overtaking solitary waves animation.gif|thumb|208px|Collision of solitons]]
The following is a list of some of the disagreements between experimental observations and the "Soliton model":

;Antidromic invasion of soma from axon: An action potential initiated anywhere on an axon will travel in an antidromic (backward) direction to the neuron soma (cell body) without loss of amplitude and produce a full-amplitude action potential in the soma. As the membrane area of the soma is orders of magnitude larger than the area of the axon, conservation of energy requires that an adiabatic mechanical wave decrease in amplitude. Since the absence of heat production is one of the claimed justifications of the 'soliton model', this is particularly difficult to explain within that model.&lt;ref&gt;Rall, W and Shepherd, GM (1968) Theoretical reconstructions of dendrodendritic synaptic interactions in the olfactory bulb. ''J Neurophysiol'' 31, 884-915.http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/31/6/884.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

;Persistence of action potential over wide temperature range: An important assumption of the soliton model is the presence of a phase transition near the ambient temperature of the axon ("Formalism", above). Then, rapid change of temperature away from the phase transition temperature would necessarily cause large changes in the action potential. Below the phase transition temperature, the soliton wave would not be possible. Yet, action potentials are present at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. The time course is slowed in a manner predicted by the measured opening and closing kinetics of the Hodgkin-Huxley ion channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodgkin | first1 =  | last2 = Katz | first2 =  | year = 1949 | title = The Effect of Temperature on the Electrical Activity of the Giant Axon of the Squid | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392577/pdf/jphysiol01472-0254.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J.

;Collisions:  Nerve impulses traveling in opposite directions annihilate each other on collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tasaki|first1=Ichiji|title=Collision of two nerve impulses in the nerve fiber.|journal=Biochim Biophys Acta|date=1949|volume=3|pages=494–497|doi=10.1016/0006-3002(49)90121-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006300249901213}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, mechanical waves do not annihilate but pass through each other.

;Ionic currents under voltage clamp: The voltage clamp, used by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) ([[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]]) to experimentally dissect the action potential in the squid giant axon, uses electronic feedback to measure the current necessary to hold membrane voltage constant at a commanded value. A silver wire, inserted into the interior of the  axon, forces a constant membrane voltage along the length of the axon. Under these circumstances, there is no possibility of a traveling 'soliton'. Any thermodynamic changes are very different from those resulting from an action potential. Yet, the measured currents accurately reproduce the action potential. (citation needed)

;Single channel currents: The patch clamp technique isolates a microscopic patch of membrane on the tip of a glass pipette. It is then possible to record currents from single ionic channels. There is no possibility of propagating solitons or thermodynamic changes. Yet, the properties of these channels (temporal response to voltage jumps, ionic selectivity) accurately predict the properties of the macroscopic currents measured under conventional voltage clamp.&lt;ref name="Hille, Bertil 2001"&gt;Hille, Bertil (2001). Ion channels of excitable membranes (3. ed. ed.). Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer. {{ISBN|9780878933211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (citation needed)

;Selective ionic conductivity: The current underlying the action potential depolarization is selective for sodium. Repolarization depends on a selective potassium current. These currents have very specific responses to voltage changes which quantitatively explain the action potential. Substitution of non-permeant ions for sodium abolishes the action potential. The 'soliton model' cannot explain either the ionic selectivity or the responses to voltage changes. ( [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]] )(citation needed)

;Pharmacology: The drug tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocks action potentials at extremely low concentrations. The site of action of TTX on the sodium channel has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Catterall | first1 = WA | year = 2014 | title = Structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels at atomic resolution | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/expphysiol.2013.071969/full | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 35–51 | doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2013.071969| pmc = 3885250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrotoxins block the potassium channels. These drugs produce quantitatively predictable changes in the action potential.&lt;ref name="Hille, Bertil 2001"/&gt; The 'soliton model' provides no explanation for these pharmacological effects.

==Action waves==

A recent theoretical model, proposed by Ahmed El Hady and Benjamin Machta, proposes that there is a mechanical surface wave which co-propagates with the electrical action potential. These surface waves are called "action waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms7697 |author=El Hady, A., Machta, B.|title=Mechanical surface waves accompany action potential propagation |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=6 |year=2015 |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150330/ncomms7697/full/ncomms7697.html |pages=6697|arxiv=1407.7600 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6697E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the  El Hady–Machta's model, these co-propagating waves are driven by voltage changes across the membrane caused by the action potential.

A '''swamp''' is a [[wetland]] that is forested.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations.&lt;ref name="Hughes, F.M.R. 2003"&gt;Hughes, F.M.R. (ed.). 2003. The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests.

USGS Circular 1311. 25 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some swamps have [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]], or dry-land protrusions, covered by [[aquatic vegetation]], or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/fringe/glossary.html Swamp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610150754/http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/fringe/glossary.html |date=2007-06-10 }} (from glossary web page of the [[United States Geological Survey]])&lt;/ref&gt; or soil saturation. The two main types of swamp are "true" or [[Freshwater swamp forest|swamp forest]]s and "transitional" or [[shrub swamp]]s. In the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a [[bog]], [[fen]], or [[muskeg]]. The water of a swamp may be [[fresh water]], [[brackish water]] or [[seawater]]. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and the [[Congo River|Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., L.H. Fraser, A.I. Solomeshch, W.J. Junk, D.R. Campbell, M.T.K. Arroyo and C.J.R. Alho. 2009. Wet and wonderful: the world's largest wetlands are conservation priorities. BioScience 59: 39–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between marshes and swamps==

A [[marsh]] is a wetland composed mainly of grasses and reeds found near the fringes of lakes and streams, serving as a transitional area between land and aquatic ecosystems. A swamp is a wetland composed of trees and shrubs found along large rivers and lake shores.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-difference-between-marshes-and-swamps.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomorphology and hydrology==

Swamps are characterized by slow-moving to stagnant waters. Many adjoin [[river]]s or [[lake]]s. Swamps are features of areas with very low [[Terrain#Relief|topographic relief]].

==Draining==

Historically, humans have drained swamps to provide additional land for [[agriculture]] and to reduce the threat of diseases borne by swamp insects and similar animals.{{clarify|date=November 2013}}&lt;!--diseases borne by...similar animals??--&gt;&lt;ref name="Dugan, P. 2005"&gt;Dugan, P. (ed.) 2005. Guide to Wetlands. Buffalo, New York. Firefly Books. 304 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Many swamps have also undergone intensive logging, requiring the construction of drainage ditches and canals. These ditches and canals contributed to drainage and, along the coast, allowed salt water to intrude, converting swamps to [[marsh]] or even to open water.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt;  Large areas of swamp were therefore lost or degraded. [[Louisiana]] provides a classic example of wetland loss from these combined factors.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., D. Campbell, T. McFalls, G. Shaffer, R. Moreau, C. Dranguet, and R. Heleniak.  2007. The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future.  Environmental Reviews 15: 1- 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe has probably lost nearly half its wetlands.&lt;ref name="Dugan, P. 2005"/&gt; New Zealand lost 90 percent of its wetlands over a period of 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, M. and Clarkson, B. 2010. Wetland Restoration: A Handbook for New Zealand Freshwater Systems. Manaaki Whenua Press, Lincoln, N.Z. {{ISBN|978-0-478-34707-4}} (online)&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists recognise that swamps provide valuable ecological services including flood control, fish production, water purification, carbon storage, and wildlife habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In many parts of the world authorities protect swamps.  In parts of Europe and North America, swamp restoration projects are becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Hughes, F.M.R. 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Environment Canada. 2004. How Much Habitat is Enough? A Framework for Guiding Habitat Rehabilitation in Great Lakes Areas of Concern. 2nd ed. 81 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the simplest steps to restoring swamps involve plugging drainage ditches and removing [[levee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Land value, productivity and conservation==

Swamps and other [[wetlands]] have traditionally held a very low [[property value]] compared to fields, [[prairie]]s, or [[woodland]]s. They have a reputation for being unproductive land that cannot easily be utilized for human activities, other than perhaps [[hunting]] and [[animal trapping|trapping]]. Farmers, for example, typically drained swamps next to their fields so as to gain more land usable for planting crops.

Many societies now realize that swamps are critically important to providing [[fresh water]] and [[oxygen]] to all life, and that they are often breeding grounds for a wide variety of species. Indeed, floodplain swamps are extremely important in fish production.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe-McConnell, R. H. (1975). Fish Communities in Tropical Fresh waters: Their Distribution, Ecology and Evolution. London: Long man&lt;/ref&gt; Government environmental agencies (such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]) are taking steps to protect and preserve swamps and other wetlands. In Europe, major effort is being invested in the restoration of swamp forests along rivers.&lt;ref name="Hughes, F.M.R. 2003"/&gt; Conservationists work to preserve swamps such as those in northwest Indiana in the United States [[Midwest]] that were preserved as part of the [[Indiana Dunes]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, S. &amp; Mark, S.

In Asia, tropical peat swamps are located in mainland East Asia and Southeast Asia. In Southeast Asia, peatlands are mainly found in low altitude coastal and sub-coastal areas and extend inland for distance more than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} along river valleys and across watersheds. They are mostly to be found on the coasts of East Sumatra, Kalimantan (Central, East, South and West Kalimantan provinces), West Papua, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Peninsular Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak, Southeast Thailand, and the Philippines (Riley ''et al.'',1996). Indonesia has the largest area of tropical peatland. Of the total {{convert|440000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} tropical peat swamp, about {{convert|210000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} are located in Indonesia (Page, 2001; Wahyunto, 2006).

The [[Vasyugan Swamp]] is a large swamp in the western [[Siberia]] area of the [[Russian Federation]]. This is one of the largest swamps in the world, covering an area larger than [[Switzerland]].

The Okefenokee is located in extreme southeastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and extends slightly into northeastern [[Florida]]. The [[Great Cypress Swamp]] is mostly in [[Delaware]] but extends into [[Maryland]] on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]]. [[Point Lookout State Park]] on the southern tip of Maryland contains a large amount of swamps and marshes. The [[Great Dismal Swamp]] lies in extreme southeastern [[Virginia]] and extreme northeastern [[North Carolina]]. Both are [[National Wildlife Refuge]]s. Another swamp area, [[Reelfoot Lake]] of extreme western [[Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky]], was created by the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes]]. [[Caddo Lake]], the Great Dismal and Reelfoot are swamps that are centered at large lakes. Swamps are often called ''[[bayou]]s'' in the [[southeastern United States]], especially in the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] region.

The '''Swiss cheese model''' of accident causation is a model used in [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and [[risk management]], including [[aviation safety]], [[engineering]], [[healthcare]], emergency service organizations, and as the principle behind [[layered security]], as used in [[computer security]] and [[Defense in depth (computing)|defense in depth]]. It likens human systems to multiple slices of [[swiss cheese]], stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the differing layers and types of defenses which are "layered" behind each other.  Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a [[single point of failure]]. The model was originally formally propounded by Dante Orlandella and James T. Reason of the [[University of Manchester]],{{sfn|Reason|1990}} and has since gained widespread acceptance.  It is sometimes called the '''cumulative act effect'''.

Although the Swiss cheese model is respected and considered to be a useful method of relating concepts, it has been subject to criticism that it is used too broadly, and without enough other models or support.&lt;ref name="eurocontrol"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Eurocontrol| title=Revisiting the Swiss cheese model of accidents| date= October 2006| url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/eec/gallery/content/public/document/eec/report/2006/017_Swiss_Cheese_Model.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure domains==
Reason hypothesized that most accidents can be traced to one or more of four failure domains: organizational influences, supervision, preconditions, and specific acts.&lt;ref&gt;1. J.A. Doran (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.)  |G.C. van der Graaf (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.) Tripod-BETA: Incident investigation and analysis, Proceedings of the SPEE Health, Safety and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Conference, 9-12 June, New Orleans, Louisiana Publication Date1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2. A.D. Gower-Jones (Shell International Exploration and Production)  |  G.C. van der Graf (Shell International Exploration and Production) Experience with Tripod BETA Incident Analysis Proceedings of the SPE International Conference on Health, Safety, and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, 7-10 June, Caracas, Venezuela Publication Date1998&lt;/ref&gt;For example, in aviation, preconditions for unsafe acts include fatigued air crew or improper communications practices.  Unsafe supervision encompasses for example, pairing inexperienced pilots on a night flight into known adverse weather. Organizational influences encompass such things as reduction in expenditure on pilot training in times of financial austerity.&lt;ref name=Wieg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stranks /&gt;

==Holes and slices==
In the Swiss cheese model, an organisation's defenses against failure are modeled as a series of barriers, represented as slices of cheese. The holes in the slices represent weaknesses in individual parts of the system and are continually varying in size and position across the slices. The system produces failures when a hole in each slice momentarily aligns, permitting (in Reason's words) "a trajectory of accident opportunity", so that a hazard passes through holes in all of the slices, leading to a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controlling Pilot Error|author1=Daryl Raymond Smith |author2=David Frazier |author3=L W Reithmaier |author4=James C Miller  |last-author-amp=yes |pages=10|year=2001|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=0071373187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=4&amp;ndash;6|title=Clinical Risk Management in Midwifery: the right to a perfect baby?|author1=Jo.

Frosch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeds of Disaster, Roots of Response: How Private Action Can Reduce Public Vulnerability|editor1=Philip E Auerswald |editor2=Lewis M Branscomb |editor3=Todd M La Porte |editor4=Erwann Michel-Kerjan |author=Robert A. Frosch|pages=88|chapter=Notes toward a theory of the management of vulnerability|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521857961}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Reason's model in mathematical terms as a model in [[percolation theory]], which he analyses as a [[Bethe lattice]].

==Active and latent failures==
The model includes both active and latent failures.  Active failures encompass the unsafe acts that can be directly linked to an accident, such as (in the case of aircraft accidents) a [[navigation]] error. Latent failures include contributory factors that may lie dormant for days, weeks, or months until they contribute to the accident. Latent failures span the first three domains of failure in Reason's model.&lt;ref name=Wieg&gt;{{cite book|title=A human error approach to aviation accident analysis: the human factors analysis and classification system|author1=Douglas A. Wiegmann |author2=Scott A. Shappell |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=48&amp;ndash;49|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=0754618730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the Swiss Cheese model, late 1980 to about 1992, attempts were made to combine two theories: James Reason multi-layer defence model and Willem Albert Wagenaar’s [[Tripod Beta|Tripod theory of accident causation]]. This resulted in a period where the Swiss Cheese diagram was represented with the slices of cheese labels as Active Failures, Preconditions and latent failures. 

These attempts to combine both theories still causes confusion today. A more correct version of the combined theories is shown with the Active Failures (now called immediate causes) Precondition and Latent Failure (now called underlying causes) shown as the reason each barrier (slice of cheese) has a hole in it and the slices of cheese as the barriers.

==Applications==
The same framework can be applicable in some areas of healthcare. For example, a latent failure could be the similar packaging of two drugs that are then stored close to each other in a pharmacy. Such a failure would be a contributory factor in the administration of the wrong drug to a patient. Such research led to the realization that [[medical error]] can be the result of "system flaws, not character flaws", and that greed, ignorance, malice or laziness are not the only causes of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Review of Nursing Research Volume 24: Focus on Patient Safety|editor1=Joyce J.

Westrum models latent failures as voids within this envelope, and active failures as factors external to the envelope that are acting to breach it.

In [[political anthropology]], a '''theatre state''' is a political [[state (polity)|state]] directed towards the performance of [[drama]] and [[ritual]] rather than more conventional ends such as [[welfare state|welfare]]. Power in a theatre state is exercised through [[spectacle]]. The term was coined by [[Clifford Geertz]] in 1980 in reference to political practice in the nineteenth-century Balinese [[Negara, Bali|Negara]],&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1980) ''Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali''. [[Princeton University Press]]. {{ISBN|0691007780}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but its usage has since expanded. Hunik Kwon and Byung-Ho Chung, for example, argue that contemporary [[North Korea]] is a theatre state.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, H. &amp; Chung, B-H. (2012) ''North Korea: Beyond Charismatic Politics''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Chapter 2. {{ISBN|1442215771}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Geertz's original usage, the concept of the theatre state contests the notion that [[precolonial]] society can be analysed in the conventional discourse of [[Oriental despotism]].&lt;ref&gt;Heder, S. "Political Theatre in the 2003 Cambodian Elections", in Strauss, J. C. &amp; O'Brien, D. C. (eds.) (2007) ''Staging Politics: Power and Performance in Asia and Africa''. [[I. B. Tauris]], p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Third gender''' or '''third sex''' is a concept in which individuals are categorized, either by themselves or by society, as neither [[man]] nor [[woman]]. It is also a social category present in [[gender systems|societies]] that recognize three or more [[gender]]s.

The community of third gender may also face discrimination from within the gay community. Despite having been legalized in the majority of South Asia, sexual minorities in Sri Lanka are hesitant to fight for third gender rights as departing from the traditional binary gender concept might make it harder to push through other aspects of LGBT rights.  It's notably that the island's two neighboring Indian states were among the first in the post-colonial world to legally recognize third gender.

==Sex and gender==
Since at least the 1970s, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] have described [[gender role|gender categories]] in some cultures which they could not adequately explain using a two-gender framework.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; At the same time, [[Feminism|feminists]] began to draw a distinction between (biological) [[sex]] and (social/psychological) [[gender]]. Contemporary [[gender studies|gender theorists]] usually argue that a two-gender system is neither innate nor universal. A sex/gender system which recognizes only the following two social [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] has been labeled "[[heteronormative]]".{{By whom|date=May 2018}}

Anthropologist Michael G. Peletz believes our notions of different types of genders (including the attitudes toward the third gender) deeply affect our lives and reflects our values in society. In Peletz' book, "Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia", he describes:&lt;ref name=Gender&gt;{{cite book|last=Peletz|first=Michael G.|title=Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia|year=2007|publisher=Association for Asian Studies|location=Michigan|isbn=9780924304507}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For our purposes, the term "gender" designates the cultural categories, symbols, meanings, practices, and institutionalized arrangements bearing on at least five sets of phenomena: (1) females and femininity; (2) males and masculinity; (3) Androgynes, who are partly male and partly female in appearance or of indeterminate sex/gender, as well as intersexed individuals, also known as hermaphrodites, who to one or another degree may have both male and female sexual organs or characteristics; (4) transgender people, who engage in practices that transgress or transcend normative boundaries and are thus by definition "transgressively gendered"; and (5) neutered or unsexed/ungendered individuals such as eunuchs.}}

=== Intersex people and third gender ===
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people|Intersex and LGBT}}
[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sex and gender distinction]] is not universal, and Peletz's description of gender as designating biological variations as well as cultural practices is not unique. In a study of arguments that intersex people fit into a third gender classification, intersex scholar [[Morgan Holmes]] argues that much analysis of a third sex or third gender is simplistic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Holmes |date=July 2004 |title=Locating Third Sexes |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |journal=Transformations Journal |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1444-3775 |accessdate=2014-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110091545/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|much of the existing work on cultural systems that incorporate a 'third sex' portray simplistic visions in which societies with more than two sex/gender categories are cast as superior to those that divide the world into just two. I argue that to understand whether a system is more or less oppressive than another we have to understand how it treats its various members, not only its 'thirds'.}}

The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and thirdly it is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population but it is, instead, about self-determination.&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender people and third gender ===
Gender may be organized differently in different cultures. In some non-Western cultures, gender is not binary and one can cross freely between male and female. This is seen as a mediation between the spirit and mundane worlds.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.132&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a positive and is almost revered in many Eastern cultures, whereas in Western culture, people who don’t conform to [[heteronormative]] ideals are often seen as sick, disordered, or insufficiently formed.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid" /&gt;

To the Indigenous [[Māhū]] of Hawaii, it is an intermediate state between man and woman, or to be a "person of indeterminate gender";&lt;ref name="vargas2015" /&gt; While the traditional [[Navajo|Dineh]] of the Southwestern US acknowledge four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man.&lt;ref name=Estrada/&gt; The term "third gender" has also been used to describe [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s of South Asia&lt;ref name="agrawal1997" /&gt; who have gained legal identity, [[fa'afafine]] of Polynesia, and [[Albanian sworn virgins|sworn virgins]] of the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

In Africa{{Vague|date=August 2018}}, a woman can be recognized as a “female husband” who enjoys all of the privileges of men and is recognized as such, but whose femaleness, while not openly acknowledged, is not forgotten either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=E Mark|last2=Marchesani|first2=Robert B|title=Saints and Rogues: Conflicts and Convergence in Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-71804-8|page=135|chapter=Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s, of India, are one of the most recognized and socially accepted groups of third genders. This may be a result of the notion of [[reincarnation]], which reduces not only gender categorization but also sex and species, allowing for more fluid and mutable categorization. There are countless other cultures in which the third gender is seen as an intermediate being rather than as a movement from one conventional sex to the other, either male to female or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, Sally, and Tam Sanger. Transgender Identities: Towards a Social Analysis of Gender Diversity. New York: Routledge, 2010. Print. p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of people in the United States who thought themselves to be members of a third gender, Ingrid M. Sell found that they typically felt different from the age of 5.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.139&lt;/ref&gt; Because of both peer and parental pressure, those growing up with the most ambiguous appearances had the most troubled childhoods and difficulties later in life. Sell also discovered similarities between the third genders of the East and those of the West. Nearly half of those interviewed were healers or in the medical profession. A majority of them, again like their Eastern counterparts, were artistic enough to make a living from their abilities. The capacity to mediate between men and women was a common skill, and third genders were oftentimes thought to possess an unusually wide perspective and the ability to understand both sides.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a" /&gt; A notable result of Sell's study is that 93% of the third genders interviewed, again like their Eastern counterparts, reported “paranormal”-type abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, some Western societies have begun to recognize genderqueer or non-binary identities. Some years after Alex MacFarlane, Australian [[Norrie May-Welby]] was recognized as having unspecified status.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/03/16/2010-03-16_no_sex_for_me_please_extranssexual_briton_is_first_legally_genderless_person.html "No sex for me, please!

The [[Open Society Foundations]] published a report, ''License to Be Yourself'' in May 2014, documenting "some of the world's most progressive and rights-based laws and policies that enable trans people to change their gender identity on official documents".&lt;ref name=License&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jack |author-link= |title= License to Be Yourself |year=2014|publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]] |location=New York |isbn=9781940983103 |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/license-be-yourself | accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report comments on the recognition of third classifications, stating:
{{quote|
From a rights-based perspective, third sex / gender options should be voluntary, providing trans people with a third choice about how to define their gender identity. Those identifying as a third sex / gender should have the same rights as those identifying as male or female.}}

The document also quotes [[Mauro Cabral]] of [[Global Action for Trans Equality]]:
{{quote|
People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned to a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker.}}

The report concludes that two or three options are insufficient: "A more inclusive approach would be to increase options for people to self-define their sex and gender identity."&lt;ref name="License" /&gt;

=== Third gender and sexual orientation ===
[[Image:Thirdsex bookcover 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of Artemis Smith's 1959 [[lesbian pulp fiction]] novel ''The Third Sex'']]

Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; terms such as "third gender" trace back to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duc, Aimée 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E. Wayne |title=The Social Studies Curriculum: Purposes, Problems, and Possibilities |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6909-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4qFMqjxte9IC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) ''The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs'', Journal of Homosexuality. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;

One such term, [[Uranian]], was used in the 19th century to a person of a third sex—originally, someone with "a female psyche in a male body" who is sexually attracted to men. Its definition was later extended to cover [[homosexual]] [[gender variant]] females and a number of other sexual types. It is believed to be an [[English language|English]] adaptation of the [[German language|German]] word ''Urning'', which was first published by activist [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] (1825–95) in a series of five booklets (1864–65) that were collected under the title ''Forschungen über das Räthsel der mannmännlichen Liebe'' ("Research into the Riddle of Man-Male Love"). Ulrich developed his terminology before the first public use of the term "homosexual", which appeared in 1869 in a pamphlet published anonymously by [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]] (1824–82). The word Uranian (''Urning'') was derived by Ulrichs from the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Aphrodite Urania]], who was created out of [[Uranus (mythology)|the god Uranus' testicles]]; it stood for homosexuality, while Aphrodite Dionea (''Dioning'') represented heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmkaylor.com Michael Matthew Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde'' (Brno, CZ: Masaryk University Press, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian activist [[Anna Rueling]] used the term in a 1904 speech, "What Interest Does the Women's Movement Have in Solving the Homosexual Problem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAny0qfa6qsC&amp;pg=PA79|title=Finding Out: An Introduction to LGBT Studies|first1=Deborah T.|last1=Meem|first2=Michelle|last2=Gibson|first3=Michelle A.|last3=Gibson|first4=Jonathan|last4=Alexander|date=28 May 2018|publisher=SAGE|via=Google Books|isbn=9781412938655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the West is trying to reinterpret and redefine ancient third-gender identities to fit the Western concept of [[sexual orientation]]. In ''Redefining [[Fa'afafine]]: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa'', Johanna Schmidt argues that the Western attempts to reinterpret fa'afafine, the third gender in Samoan culture, make it have more to do with sexual orientation than gender. She also argues that this is actually changing the nature of fa'afafine itself, and making it more "homosexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html|title=Intersections: Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa|website=intersections.anu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Samoan fa'afafine said, "But I would like to pursue a master's degree with a paper on homosexuality from a Samoan perspective that would be written for educational purposes, because I believe some of the stuff that has been written about us is quite wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa Johanna Schmidt]; Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context; Issue 6, August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity'', Will Roscoe writes that "this pattern can be traced from the earliest accounts of the Spaniards to present-day ethnographies. What has been written about berdaches reflects more the influence of existing Western discourses on gender, sexuality and the Other than what observers actually witnessed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity] Will Roscoe  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226235121/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Towle and Morgan:

{{quote|Ethnographic examples [of ‘third genders’] can come from distinct societies located in Thailand, Polynesia, Melanesia, Native America, western Africa, and elsewhere and from any point in history, from Ancient Greece, to sixteenth century England to contemporary North America. Popular authors routinely simplify their descriptions, ignoring...or conflating dimensions that seem to them extraneous, incomprehensible, or ill suited to the images they want to convey (484).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html The Great Third Gender Debate; BELOW THE BELT, theory-q] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222350/http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html |date=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western scholars often do not make a distinction between people of the third gender and males; they are often lumped together. The scholars usually use gender roles as a way to explain sexual relations between the third gender and males. For example, when analyzing the non-normative sex gender categories in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], Peter A. Jackson says it appears that within early Buddhist communities, men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and were thought to be [[hermaphrodite]]s. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures]

Some writers suggest that a third gender emerged around 1700 AD in [[England]]: the male [[sodomy|sodomite]].&lt;ref name="Trumbach"&gt;Trumbach, Randolph. (1998) ''Sex and the Gender Revolution. Volume 1: Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London''. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1998. (Chicago Series on Sexuality, History &amp; Society)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these writers, this was marked by the emergence of a [[subculture]] of [[effeminate]] males and their meeting places ([[molly house]]s), as well as a marked increase in hostility towards effeminate or [[homosexual]] males. People described themselves as members of a third sex in Europe from at least the 1860s with the writings of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1300/J082v06n01_10 | title=The "Third Sex" Theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs | year=1981 | last1=Kennedy | first1=Hubert | journal=Journal of Homosexuality | volume=6 | pages=103–111 | pmid=7042820 | issue=1–2  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing in the late nineteenth century with [[Magnus Hirschfeld]],&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904.

''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt; and others. These writers described themselves and those like them as being of an "inverted" or "intermediate" sex and experiencing homosexual desire, and their writing argued for social acceptance of such sexual intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, James W. (1990). ''"We of the third sex” : homo Representations of Homosexuality in Wilhelmine Germany.'' (German Life and Civilization v. 7) New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8204-1209-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cited precedents from classical Greek and Sanskrit literature (see below).

Throughout much of the twentieth century, the term "third sex" was a common descriptor for homosexuals and gender nonconformists, but after the [[gay liberation]] movements of the 1970s and a growing separation of the concepts of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], the term fell out of favor among [[LGBT communities]] and the wider public. With the renewed exploration of gender that feminism, the modern [[transgender]] movement and [[queer theory]] has fostered, some in the contemporary West have begun to describe themselves as a third sex again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sell |first1= Ingrid |year=2001 |title=Not man, not woman: Psychospiritual characteristics of a Western third gender |journal= [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages= 16–36 }} (Complete doctoral dissertation: Sell, Ingrid. (2001). ''Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman.'' (Doctoral Dissertation, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology). UMI No. 3011299.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern identities that cover similar ground include [[pangender]], [[bigender]], [[genderqueer]], [[androgyne]], [[intergender]], "other gender" and "differently gendered".

=== Third gender and feminism ===

In [[German Empire#Wilhelmine era|Wilhelmine Germany]], the terms ''drittes Geschlecht'' ("third sex") and ''Mannweib'' ("man-woman") were also used to describe [[feminist]]s – both by their opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=407320 | pages=582–599 | last1=Wright | first1=B. D. | title="New Man," Eternal Woman: Expressionist Responses to German Feminism | volume=60 | issue=4 | journal=[[The German Quarterly]] | year=1987 | doi=10.2307/407320  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes by feminists themselves. In the 1899 novel ''Das dritte Geschlecht'' (''The Third Sex'') by Ernst Ludwig von Wolzogen, feminists are portrayed as "neuters" with external female characteristics accompanied by a crippled male [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

==History==

===Mesopotamia===
[[Image:Sumerian creation myth.jpg|thumb|upright|Stone tablet from 2nd millennium BC Sumer containing a myth about the creation of a type of human who is neither man nor woman.]]
In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], among the earliest written records of humanity, there are references to types of people who are not men and not women. In a [[Sumer]]ian [[creation myth]] found on a stone tablet from the [[second millennium BC]], the goddess [[Ninmah]] fashions a being "with no male organ and no female organ", for whom [[Enki]] finds a position in society: "to stand before the king". In the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] myth of [[Atra-Hasis]] (ca. 1700 BC), Enki instructs [[Nintu]], the goddess of birth, to establish a “third category among the people” in addition to men and women, that includes demons who steal infants, women who are unable to give birth, and priestesses who are prohibited from bearing children.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stephen O., and Roscoe, Will (1997). ''Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature.'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Babylonia]], [[Sumer]] and [[Assyria]], certain types of individuals who performed religious duties in the service of [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] have been described as a third gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1062813 | accessdate=2 April 2011 | pages=195–230 | last1=Roscoe | first1=W. | title=Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion | volume=35 | issue=3 | journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]] | year=1996 | url=http://www.willsworld.org/priests.html | doi=10.1086/463425}} Roscoe identifies these temple staff by the names ''kalû'', ''kurgarrû'', and ''assinnu''.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[sacred prostitute]]s or [[Hierodule]]s, performed ecstatic dance, music and plays, wore masks and had gender characteristics of both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Nissinen, Martti (1998).

In addition, he defines another kind of gender-variant prostitute, ''sinnisānu'', as (literally) "woman-like".&lt;/ref&gt;

A third sex is discussed in ancient [[Hindu law]], medicine, [[linguistics]] and [[astrology]]. The foundational work of Hindu law, the [[Manu Smriti]] (c. 200 BC–200 AD) explains the biological origins of the three sexes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A male child is produced by a greater quantity of male seed, a female child by the prevalence of the female; if both are equal, a third-sex child or boy and girl twins are produced; if either are weak or deficient in quantity, a failure of conception results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manu Smriti]], 3.49. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu03.htm Text online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indian linguist [[Patañjali]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the [[Patañjali]] who was the author of the ''[[Yoga sutras]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; work on [[Sanskrit]] grammar, the [[Mahābhāṣya]] (c. 200 BC), states that Sanskrit's three [[grammatical genders]] are derived from three natural genders. The earliest [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar, the [[Tolkappiyam]] (3rd century BC) refers to hermaphrodites as a third "neuter" gender (in addition to a feminine category of unmasculine males). In [[Vedic astrology]], the nine planets are each assigned to one of the three genders; the third gender, ''tritiya-prakrti'', is associated with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]] and (in particular) [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. In the [[Puranas]], there are references to three kinds of [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s of music and dance: [[apsaras]] (female), [[gandharva]]s (male) and [[kinnar]]s (neuter).

The two great [[Sanskrit]] [[epic poem]]s, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;Lord [[Arjuna]] takes a "vow of eunuchism" to live as the third sex for a year: "O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as one of the neuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide the marks of the bowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both my [[Scarification|cicatrized]] arms with bangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears and [[conch]]-bangles on my wrists and causing a braid to hang down from my head, I shall, O king, appear as one of the third sex, Vrihannala by name. And living as a female I shall (always) entertain the king and the inmates of the inner apartments by reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the women of Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and in musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the various excellent acts of men..." [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15475 Mahabharata (Virata-parva)], Translated by Ganguli, Kisari Mohan. [[Project Gutenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; indicate the existence of a third gender in ancient Indic society. Some versions of [[Ramayana]] tell that in one part of the story, the hero [[Rama]] heads into exile in the forest. Halfway there, he discovers that most of the people of his home town [[Ayodhya]] were following him. He told them, "Men and women, turn back", and with that, those who were "neither men nor women" did not know what to do, so they stayed there. When Rama returned from exile years later, he discovered them still there and blessed them, saying that there will be a day when they, too, will have a share in ruling the world.

In the Buddhist [[Vinaya]], codified in its present form around the 2nd century BC and said to be handed down by oral tradition from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself, there are four main sex/gender categories: males, females, ''ubhatobyañjanaka'' (people of a dual sexual nature) and ''[[Pandaka|paṇḍaka]]'' (people of non-normative sexual natures, perhaps originally denoting a deficiency in male sexual capacity).&lt;ref name="Jackson10996" /&gt; As the Vinaya tradition developed, the term ''paṇḍaka'' came to refer to a broad third sex category which encompassed intersex, male and female bodied people with physical or behavioural attributes that were considered inconsistent with the natural characteristics of man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3176712 | pages=89–115 | last1=Gyatso | first1=J. | title=One Plus One Makes Three: Buddhist Gender, Monasticism, and the Law of the Non-Excluded Middle | volume=43 | issue=2 | journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]] | year=2003 | doi=10.1086/423006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what is often portrayed in the West, sex with male (specifically receptive oral and anal sex) was the gender role of the third gender, not their defining feature. Thus, in ancient India, as in present-day India, the society made a distinction between a third gender having sex with a man, and a man having sex with a man. The latter may have been viewed negatively, but he would be seen very much as a man (in modern western context, as 'straight'), not a third gender (in modern western context 'gay').&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures], compiled by Peter A. Jackson; quote: "it appears that among the early Buddhist communities men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and thought to be hermaphrodites. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediterranean culture===
[[Image:Hermaphroditus Louvre face.jpg|thumb|right|2nd century Roman copy of a Greek sculpture. The figure is [[Hermaphroditus]], from which the word [[hermaphrodite]] is derived.]]

In Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', written around the 4th century BC, Aristophanes relates a creation myth involving three original sexes: female, male and androgynous. They are split in half by Zeus, producing four different contemporary sex/gender types which seek to be reunited with their lost other half; in this account, the modern heterosexual man and woman descend from the original androgynous sex. The myth of [[Hermaphroditus]] involves heterosexual lovers merging into their primordial androgynous sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/symposium.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive – Symposium by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=June 2016}}

Other [[creation myth]]s around the world share a belief in three original sexes, such as those from northern Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter A. (1995) ''Kathoey: The third sex.'' In Jackson, P., "Dear Uncle Go: Male homosexuality in Thailand." Bangkok, Thailand: Bua Luang Books&lt;br&gt;See also: Peltier, Anatole-Roger (1991). ''Pathamamulamuli: The Origin of the World in the Lan Na Tradition''. Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books. The Yuan creation myth in the book is from Pathamamulamuli, an antique Buddhist palmleaf manuscript. Its translator, Anatole-Roger Peltier, believes that this story is based on an oral tradition which is over five hundred years old.

Many have interpreted the "[[eunuch]]s" of the Ancient Eastern Mediterranean world as a third gender that inhabited a [[liminality|liminal]] space between women and men, understood in their societies as somehow neither or both.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tougher, ed., (2001) ''Eunuchs in Antiquity and Beyond'' (London: Duckworth Publishing, 2001).&lt;br&gt;Ringrose, Kathryn M. (2003). ''The Perfect Servant: Eunuchs and the Social Construction of Gender in Byzantium.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Historia Augusta]], the eunuch body is described as a ''tertium genus hominum'' (a third human gender),&lt;ref&gt;[[Historia Augusta]], ''[[Severus Alexander]]'' xxiii.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 77 BC, a eunuch named Genucius was prevented from claiming goods left to him in a [[will (law)|will]], on the grounds that he had voluntarily mutilated himself (''amputatis sui ipsius'') and was neither a woman or a man (''neque virorum neque mulierum numero'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], (7.7.6).&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have argued that the eunuchs in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] were understood in their time to belong to a third gender, rather than the more recent interpretations of a kind of emasculated man, or a metaphor for [[chastity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hester |first1= J.

And elsewhere: "The Lord Himself opened the kingdom of heaven to eunuchs and He Himself lived as a eunuch. The apostle [Paul] also, following His example, made himself a eunuch..."&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian also noted the existence of a third sex (''tertium sexus'') among heathens: "a third race in sex... made of male and female in one."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'', 1.20.4. [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian06.html Text online].&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been referring to the [[Galli]], "eunuch" devotees of the [[Phrygia]]n goddess [[Cybele]], who were described as belonging to a third sex by several [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. "Both sexes are displeasing to her holiness, so [the gallus] keeps a middle gender (''medium genus'') between the others." [[Prudentius]], Peristephanon, 10.1071-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In old Israel there were:
*''Zachar'': male
*''Nekeva'': female
*''[[Androgynos]]'': both male and female genitalia (eternal doubt of legal gender)
*''[[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]]'': genitalia concealed by skin (unknown gender, unless skin removed)
*''Aylonit'': Barren female. Female genitalia, barren.
*''Saris'': castrated or naturally infertile male (often translated as "eunuch")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transtorah.org/PDFs/Classical_Jewish_Terms_for_Gender_Diversity.pdf] Classic Jewish terms for Gender Diversity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transtorah.org/PDFs/Gender_Diversity_In_Halacha.pdf] Gender Diversity in Halakha&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

====Mesoamerica====

The ancient [[Maya civilization]] may have recognised a third gender, according to historian Matthew Looper. Looper notes the androgynous [[Maize]] Deity and masculine [[Lunar deity|Moon goddess]] of [[Maya mythology]], and iconography and inscriptions where rulers embody or impersonate these deities. He suggests that the third gender could also include two-spirit individuals with special roles such as healers or [[divination|diviners]].&lt;ref&gt;Looper, Matthew G. (2001). ''Ancient Maya Women-Men (and Men-Women): Classic Rulers and the Third Gender'', In: "Ancient Maya Women", ed. Traci Ardren. Walnut Creek, California: Alta Mira, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist and archaeologist Miranda Stockett notes that several writers have felt the need to move beyond a two-gender framework when discussing prehispanic cultures across [[mesoamerica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=40025092 | pages=566–578 | last1=Stockett | first1=M.

Austin, TX: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes that the [[Olmec]], [[Aztec]] and [[Maya peoples]] understood "more than two kinds of bodies and more than two kinds of gender." Anthropologist Rosemary Joyce agrees, writing that "gender was a fluid potential, not a fixed category, before the Spaniards came to Mesoamerica. Childhood training and ritual shaped, but did not set, adult gender, which could encompass third genders and alternative sexualities as well as "male" and "female." At the height of the Classic period, Maya rulers presented themselves as embodying the entire range of gender possibilities, from male through female, by wearing blended costumes and playing male and female roles in state ceremonies." Joyce notes that many figures of mesoamerican art are depicted with male genitalia and female breasts, while she suggests that other figures in which chests and waists are exposed but no sexual characteristics (primary or secondary) are marked may represent a third sex, ambiguous gender or androgyny.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A.

====Inca====
Andean Studies scholar Michael Horswell writes that third-gendered ritual attendants to ''chuqui chinchay'', a [[jaguar]] deity in [[Incan mythology]], were "vital actors in Andean ceremonies" prior to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonisation]]. Horswell elaborates: "These ''quariwarmi'' (men-women) [[shaman]]s mediated between the symmetrically dualistic spheres of Andean cosmology and daily life by performing rituals that at times required same-sex erotic practices. Their transvested attire served as a visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dead. Their shamanic presence invoked the androgynous creative force often represented in Andean mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Horswell, Michael J. (2006).

{{quote|And in each important temple or house of worship, they have a man or two, or more, depending on the idol, who go dressed in women's attire from the time they are children, and speak like them, and in manner, dress, and everything else they imitate women.

''Sex and Conquest.'' Cornell University Press: Ithaca. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Illiniwek====
Historically, the [[Illinois Confederation|Indigenous people of Illinois]] have decided the gender of their members based on their childhood behavior. If a male child used tools considered to be "women's tools", such as a spade or ax instead of a bow, they were considered to be third gender, feminine men. The modern, [[Pan-Indianism|pan-Indian]] term for this role is "[[Two-Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Joyce. 2000. Gender and Power in Prehispanic Mesosamerica. University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

George, Quote: Siva: The Hermaphrodite

The Lord [[Shiva]] is the underlying neutral and changeless reality, the undifferentiated absolute Consciousness, who is the foundation of every change and becoming. The hermaphrodite reality is one which is independent of all distinctions of male and female, the phenomenal and the non-phenomenal, and yet forms the basis of all such distinctions. The Puranas speak of Lord Shiva as the Hermaphrodite reality, though distinctionless within Himself, letting the distinctions of the manifold world spring up from Him. The Puranic thinkers interpreted and represented this hermaphrodite aspect of the Lord Siva in various ways. One such symbol expression is the figure of His Sakti. Another such symbol is the Phallus *(the male reproductive part) and the Yoni (the female reproductive part). A third, a more anthropomorphic metaphor, is that of the union between Siva and His many consorts, such as, Parvati, Uma and others. All these symbolisms express the truth that the variety of this universe stems from the lord Siva through his Sakti. To explain this point very picturesquely, the Puranas apply the mythological story of creation by way of the sexual union between Prajaapati and his daughter to Siva who, by His eternal union with His Sakti creates the world. The Puraanas also use another more sacrificial symbollism to expound the hermaphrodite characteristic of Shiva, according to which the male principle is represented as Fire, the devourer of the offering, and the female principle is the Soma, the devoured offering. In this symbolism, the hermaphrodite is the embodiment of the cosmic sacrifice, through which the universe emerges from the Lord Siva.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the [[common era]], male cults devoted to a goddess that flourished throughout the broad region extending from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to [[South Asia]]. While [[galli]] were missionizing the Roman Empire, [[Gala (priests)|kalū]], kurgarrū, and assinnu continued to carry out ancient rites in the temples of Mesopotamia, and the third-gender predecessors of the hijra were clearly evident. It should also be mentioned of the eunuch priests of Artemis at Ephesus; the western Semitic qedeshim, the male "temple prostitutes" known from the Hebrew Bible and Ugaritic texts of the late second millennium; and the keleb, priests of Astarte at Kition and elsewhere. Beyond India, modern ethnographic literature document gender variant shaman-priests throughout [[Southeast Asia]], [[Borneo]], and [[Sulawesi]]. All these roles share the traits of devotion to a goddess, gender transgression and receptive anal sex, ecstatic ritual techniques (for healing, in the case of kalū and Mesopotamian priests, and fertility in the case of hijra), and actual (or symbolic) castration. Most, at some point in their history, were based in temples and, therefore, part of the religious-economic administration of their respective city-states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willsworld.org/priests.html Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion] by Will Roscoe&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Charles Spearman # Theory of Intelligence}}

[[Charles Spearman]] developed his '''two-factor theory of intelligence''' using [[factor analysis]].&lt;ref name= "Weiten"/&gt; His research not only led him to develop the concept of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g factor'']]  of general intelligence, but also the ''s'' factor of specific intellectual abilities.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt; [[Louis Leon Thurstone|L. L. Thurstone]], [[Howard Gardner]], and [[Robert Sternberg]] also researched the structure of intelligence, and in analyzing their data, concluded that a single underlying factor was influencing the general intelligence of individuals. However, Spearman was criticized in 1916 by [[Godfrey Thomson]], who claimed that the evidence was not as crucial as it seemed.&lt;ref name= "Godfrey"/&gt; Modern research is still expanding this theory by investigating Spearman's law of diminishing returns,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and adding connected concepts to the research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Spearman's two-factor theory of intelligence ==

In 1904,&lt;ref name="Kalat"&gt;Kalat, J.W. (2014). ''Introduction to Psychology, 10th Edition.'' Cengage Learning. pg. 295&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Spearman]] had developed a statistical procedure called [[factor analysis]]. In factor analysis, related variables are tested for correlation to each other, then the correlation of the related items are evaluated to find clusters or groups of the variables.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;Weiten, W. (2013). ''Psychology: Themes and Variations'' (9th ed.). Thomson Wadsworth Publishing. pg. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Spearman tested how well people performed on various tasks relating to [[intelligence]]. Such tasks include: distinguishing [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], perceiving weight and colors, directions, and mathematics.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt; When analyzing the data he collected, Spearman noted that those that did well in one area also scored higher in other areas. With this data, Spearman concluded that there must be one central factor that influences our cognitive abilities. Spearman termed this general intelligence [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'']].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Myers, D.G. (2009). ''Psychology: Ninth Edition in Modules.'' Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|1-4292-1638-7}}. pg. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = G.H. | year = 1947 | title = Charles Spearman. 1863-1945 | url = | journal = Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume = 5 | issue = 15| pages = 373–385 | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1947.0006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure of intelligence debate ==

Due to the controversy of the structure of intelligence, other psychologists also published their relevant research. Other than [[Charles Spearman]], three others developed a hypothesis regarding the structure of intelligence. [[Louis Leon Thurstone|L. L. Thurstone]] tested subjects on 56 different abilities; from his data he established seven primary mental abilities relating to intelligence. He categorized them as: spatial ability, numerical ability, word fluency, memory, perceptual speed, verbal comprehension, and inductive reasoning. Other researchers, interested in this new research study, analyzed Thurstone's data, discovering that those that scored high in one category often did well in the others.&lt;ref name= "Myers"/&gt; This finding gives support that there is an underlying factor influencing them, namely [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'']].

[[Howard Gardner]] suggested in his [[theory of multiple intelligences]] that intelligence is formed out of multiple abilities. He recognized eight intelligences: linguistic, musical, spatial, intrapersonal, interpersonal, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, and naturalist. He also considered the possibility of a ninth intelligent ability, existential intelligence.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Gardner proposed that individuals who excelled in one ability would lack in another. Instead, his results showed that each of his eight intelligences correlate positively with each other. After further analysis, Gardner found that logic, spatial abilities, language, and mathematics are all linked in some way, giving support for an underlying [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] that is prominent in almost all intelligence in general.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt;

[[Robert Sternberg]] agreed with Gardner that there were multiple intelligences, but he narrowed his scope to just three in his [[triarchic theory of intelligence]]: analytical, creative, and practical. He classified analytical intelligence as problem-solving skills in tests and academics. Creative intelligence is considered how people react adaptively in new situations, or create novel ideas. Practical intelligence is defined as the everyday logic used when multiple solutions or decisions are possible.&lt;ref name= "Myers"/&gt; When Sternberg analyzed his data the relationship between the three intelligences surprised him. The data resembled what the other psychologists had found. All three mental abilities correlated highly with one another, and evidence that one basic factor, [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'']], was the primary influence.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt;

Not all psychologists agreed with Spearman and his general intelligence. In 1916,&lt;ref name= "Godfrey"/&gt; [[Godfrey Thomson]] wrote a paper criticizing Spearman's ''g'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The object of this paper is to show that the cases brought forward by Professor Spearman in favor of the existence of General Ability are by no means "crucial." They are it is true not inconsistent with the existence of such a common element but neither are they inconsistent with its non-existence. The essential point about Professor Spearman's hypothesis is the existence of this General Factor. Both he and his opponents are agreed that there are Specific Factors peculiar to individual tests, both he and his opponents agree that there are Group Factors which run through some but not all tests. The difference between them is that Professor Spearman says there is a further single factor which runs through all tests, and that by pooling a few tests the Group Factors can soon be eliminated and a point reached where all the correlations are due to the General Factor alone. (pp. 217)&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = G. H. | year = 1916 | title = A hierarchy without a general factor | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 271–281 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1916.tb00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Development of Spearman's theory ==

=== Experimental Evidence ===
Spearman originally came up with the term General Intelligence, or as he called it, [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'']], to measure intelligence in his Two  Theory on Intelligence. Spearman first researched in an experiment with 24 children from a small village school measuring three intellectual measures, based on teachers rankings, to address intellectual and sensory as the two different sets of measure: School Cleverness, Common Sense A and Common Sense B.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fancher | first1 = R. E. | year = 1985 | title = Spearman's original computation of ''g'': A model for Burt? | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 341–352 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1985.tb01957.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His results showed the average [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] between intellectual and sensory measures to be +.38, School Cleverness and Commonsense to be at +0.55, and the three tasks intercorrelated at +0.25.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This data was looked at other populations including high school. Spearman proposed that intellectual and sensory measure be combined as assessment of general intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''g'' and ''s''===

Spearman proposed that his two-factor theory has two components. The general intelligence, ''g'', influences the performance on all mental tasks, while another component influences abilities on a particular task.&lt;ref name= "Thomson"/&gt; To explain the differences in performance on different tasks, Spearman hypothesized that this other component was specific to a certain aspect of intelligence. This second factor he named ''s'', for specific ability.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt; Regarding ''g'', Spearman saw individuals as having more or less general intelligence, while ''s'' varied from person to person on a task.&lt;ref name= "Thomson"/&gt; In 1999, behavior geneticist [[Robert Plomin]] described ''g'' by saying: "''g'' is one of the most reliable and valid measures in the behavioral domain... and it predicts important social outcomes such as educational and occupational levels far better than any other trait."&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

To visualize ''g'', imagine a [[Venn diagram]] with four circles overlapping. In the middle of the overlapping circles, would be ''g'', which influences all the specific intelligences, while ''s'' is represented by the four circles. Though the specific number of ''s'' factors are unknown, a few have been relatively accepted: mechanical, spatial, logical, and arithmetical.&lt;ref name= "Kalat"/&gt;

Rising interest in the debate on the structure of intelligence prompted Spearman to elaborate and argue for his hypothesis. He claimed that ''g'' was not made up of one single ability, but rather two genetically influenced, unique abilities working together. He called these abilities "eductive" and "reproductive". He suggested that future understanding of the interaction between these two different abilities would drastically change how individual differences and cognition are understood in psychology, possibly creating the basis for wisdom.&lt;ref name= "Spearman"&gt;Spearman, C. (2005). The Abilities of Man: Their Nature and Measurement. The Blackburn Press. {{ISBN|1-932846-10-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on psychology ==

=== Intelligence testing ===

Many researches are currently using Spearman's form of intelligence testing in their current studies. Although not all of the studies are currently using Spearman's exact model for intelligence testing, they are adding some modern concepts to that study. Spearman described that there was a functional relationship between intelligence and Sensory Discriminatory Abilities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sensory Discrimination, Working Memory and Intelligence in 9-Year-Old and 11-Year-Old Children |url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/icd.1803|journal = Infant and Child Development|access-date = 2015-04-12|doi=10.1002/icd.1803|volume=22|pages=523–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has determined that there is an overlap between [[Working Memory]], General Discriminatory Abilities, and [[Fluid Intelligence]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His work has been built on, expanded, and linked to many other factors related to intelligence.

Intelligence testing measuring the ''g'' factor has been studied recently to re-explore Spearman's law of diminishing returns.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = M. R. | year = 2013 | title = Interpreting the g Loadings of Intelligence Test Composite Scores in Light of Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns | url = | journal = School Psychology Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 63–76 | doi = 10.1037/spq0000013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study investigates how ''g'' test scores will most likely decrease as ''g'' increases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research has been done to investigate if ''g'' scores are made up of scores from [[Differential Ability Scales]], ''s'' factors, and how the law of diminishing returns compare to [[g factor (psychometrics)|Spearman's Law of diminishing returns]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the use of linear and nonlinear [[Confirmatory Factor Analysis]], it is showing that the nonlinear model best described the data.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The nonlinear model suggests that as ''g'' increases, the ''s'' factor lowers the overall score and inaccurately represents general intelligence.

=== Modern psychology ===

This theory is still greatly present in today's modern psychology. Researchers are examining this theory and recreating it in modern research. The [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] is still frequently studied in current research. For example, a study could use and be compared with various other similar intelligence measures. Scales such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] has been compared with Spearman's ''g'', which shows that there has a decrease in statistic significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = H. | last2 = Oakland | first2 = T. D. | year = 2000 | title = Secular Declines in Spearman's g: Some Evidence From the United States | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 161 | issue = 3| pages = 337–345 | doi=10.1080/00221320009596716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has been adapted to incorporate modern psychological topics into Spearman's Two Factor Theory of Intelligence. [[Nature versus Nurture]] is one topic that has been cross studied with Spearman's ''g'' factor. Research shows that although [[environmental factor]]s influence the ''g'' factor differently, it has been found that it is affected if influenced early in life, rather than adulthood where there is little to no impact.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bouchard | first1 = J. J. | year = 2009 | title = Genetic influence on human intelligence (Spearman's g): How much?. | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 527–544 | doi = 10.1080/03014460903103939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic influence has been documented to greatly influence ''g'' factor on intelligence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Accreditation===
In December 21, 2011 the University of Chile was notified by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA) of the positive evaluation in all obligatory areas (institutional management and undergraduate teaching) and electives (research, teaching graduate and linkage with medium). Thus the University is accredited by seven years, the maximum awarded by the agency, for the period between 2011 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchile.cl/reacreditacion|title=Reacreditación institucional – Universidad de Chile|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Chile, the Catholic University and the University of Concepción are the only institutions in this country that have the highest accreditation.

== History ==
[[Image:AndresBello cropped.png|thumb|left|200px| Andrés Bello, founder and first president of the institution]]
[[Image:U de Chile 1872.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Main House in 1872]]
In 1841 the minister of public education, [[Manuel Montt]], conceived the idea of funding a corporation for the "advancement and development of sciences and humanities". [[Andrés Bello]] a Venezuelan poet and humanist, formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on November 19, 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The foundation answered the need to modernize the country which a little more than two decades before had become independent from Spain. It replaced the Real Universidad de San Felipe, which was established in 1738.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The University was formally opened on September 17, 1843. During this period, the university consisted of five faculties (facultades): '''Humanities &amp; Philosophy''', '''Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences''', '''Law &amp; Political Sciences''', '''Medicine''', and '''Theology'''. During its first years the University gave considerable support to education, institutional organization (such as the "Civil Code", a model for America), the building of the road network to join together the territory, and the energy and production infrastructure.

By 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy &amp; Education Sciences, Legal &amp; Social Sciences, Biology &amp; Medical Sciences, Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Agronomy &amp; Veterinary, and Fine Arts.

The institution has also contributed to the formation of the intellectual elites and leaders of the country. Most of the Chilean presidents have studied in its lecture halls, as well as people with prominent roles in politics, business and culture.

=== Major reforms during the military regime of 1973–1989 ===

During [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On October 2, 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated that the University's presidents would be designated by the military regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-58112004001500015&amp;script=sci_arttext Jorge Baeza Correa, Referencias para un análisis del discurso del gobierno militar chileno sobre el movimiento estudiantil universitario: 1973–1980. Santiago, 2014] www.scielo.cl&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major change came on January 3, 1981, when another decree completely restructured the University. All of its provincial campuses were separated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://anales.uchile.cl/index.php/ANUC/article/viewFile/25264/28654 Francisco Javier Pinedo Castro. "El nacimiento de una Universidad en el valle central y la amputación de las sedes regionales de la U. de Chile: El caso de la U. de Talca". Revista Anales, Séptima serie n°4, noviembre 2012. Pág 73 y 63] www.anales.uchile.cl&lt;/ref&gt; cojoined with provincial campuses of the Universidad Técnica del Estado (now [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile]] and [[Universidad de Atacama]]) and designated as separate universities, such as the [[Universidad de Talca]], [[Universidad de Valparaiso]], the Instituto Pedagógico (Pedagogical Institute, now the [[Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación]]), the [[Universidad de Antofagasta]], the [[Universidad de Tarapacá]], Instituto Professional de Osorno (now [[Universidad de los Lagos]]), Instituto Professional de Chillán (now [[Universidad del Bío-Bío]]), [[Universidad de la Frontera]], and [[Universidad de la Serena]]. Some faculties, such as the one located in avenida Portugal and which now belongs to the Universidad Mayor, were privatized and sold at bargain prices to Pinochet cronies.

These changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the dictatorship as a way to moderate the University's influence on the nation's politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements, considered leftist by Augusto Pinochet and other right-wing government officials.

In spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains Chile's most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
