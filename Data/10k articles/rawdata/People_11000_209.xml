'''Arthur David Jacobs''' (14 June 1922 – 13 December 1996) was an English musicologist, music critic, teacher, librettist and translator. Among his many books, two of the best known are his ''Penguin Dictionary of Music'', which was reprinted in several editions between 1958 and 1996, and his biography of [[Arthur Sullivan]], which was praised by critics in Britain and America. As an academic, Jacobs taught at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], at [[University of Huddersfield|Huddersfield Polytechnic]], and at universities in the US, Canada, and Australia.

==Life and career==
Jacobs was born in [[Manchester]], England, to Jewish parents, Alexander Susman Jacobs and his wife Estelle (''née'' Isaacs).&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, William D., Michael Jolles and Hilary L. Rubinstein. ''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011), pp. 464–465&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]]&lt;ref name=ind&gt;Sadie, Stanley. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-arthur-jacobs-1315344.html "Obituary: Professor Arthur Jacobs"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 20 December 1996, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Merton College, Oxford]], taking an honours degree in 1946. In World War II he served in India and Burma with the British Army, reaching the rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900–1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he married the writer Betty Upton Hughes. They had two sons, Michael Jacobs and Julian Jacobs.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/GLD/hits?r=d&amp;origSearch=true&amp;o=DataType&amp;n=10&amp;l=d&amp;c=2&amp;locID=wes_ttda&amp;secondary=false&amp;u=CA&amp;t=KW&amp;s=2&amp;TI=Gilbert+and+Sullivan&amp;SU=%22Music%22 "Arthur Jacobs"], ''Contemporary Authors Online'', Galenet (subscription required), accessed 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs was music critic of ''The [[Daily Express]]'' from 1947 to 1952, of ''The Sunday Citizen'' from 1959 to 1965, and of ''The [[Jewish Chronicle]]'' from 1963 to 1975. He reviewed records for ''Hi-Fi News and Record Review'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and wrote for the arts section of ''[[The Financial Times]]''.  He was deputy editor of ''[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]'' magazine from 1961 to 1971 and served on its editorial board from 1971 until his death.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Arthur Jacobs", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 December 1996, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[The Musical Times]]'', between 1949 and 1996, Jacobs wrote on a wide variety of musical topics, including the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Three Choirs Festival]], Russian song, ''[[The Gypsy Baron]]'', ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]], [[Otto Klemperer]], and composers from [[Handel]] to [[César Franck]] to [[Elgar]] to [[Janáček]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1964 to 1979, Jacobs was a lecturer at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], teaching the history of opera.  He was head of the music department of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the [[University of Huddersfield]]) 1979–84, where he was appointed to a personal professorship in 1984. Overseas, Jacobs was visiting professor at [[Temple University]] ([[Philadelphia]]) in 1970 and 1971, at [[McMaster University]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario]]) in 1975 and 1983, and at the [[University of Queensland]] ([[Brisbane]]) in 1985.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; After the Queensland post ended, he retired to [[Oxford]], where he died at the age of 74.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Librettist and translator==
Jacobs wrote the libretto for [[Nicholas Maw]]'s 1964 opera, ''One Man Show'', based on a short story by [[Saki]].&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; His colleague [[Stanley Sadie]] said of him, "Opera was always at the centre of his interests. He was a firm believer that it was meant to be fully understood, and that meant it should be presented in English to English-speaking audiences. He was a good linguist himself and translated more than 20 operas … in a fluent and direct style that sometimes betrayed (though not often inaptly) his early love of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]."&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; He made English translations of German, Italian, French and Russian opera libretti, including [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', [[Berlioz]]'s, ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'', [[Donizetti]]'s, ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', [[Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigenie en Aulide]]'', [[Handel]]'s ''[[Riccardo Primo]]'', [[Monteverdi]]'s, ''[[L'Incoronazione di Poppea]]'', [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'', [[Rossini]]'s ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'', and ''[[Il Turco in Italia]]'', [[Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Erwartung]]'', [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'',&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; and [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlos]]''.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. "On Translating Opera",''The Musical Times'', January 1961, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1961, Jacobs gave examples of stilted translations and contrasted them with vital and natural-sounding ones. He instanced a line from ''[[Tosca]]'', "Ah, finalmente! Nel terror mio stolto/ Vedea ceffi di birro in ogni volto!", gave a literal translation ("Ah! at last! In my stupid terror I saw those ugly police snouts in every face") and contrasted it with the original early-20th-century English translation: "Ah! I have baulked them! Dread imagination/ Made me quake with uncalled for perturbation."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39437">A '''cause lawyer,''' also known as a '''public interest lawyer''' or '''social lawyer''', is a [[lawyer]] dedicated to the usage of [[law]] for the promotion of [[social change]] to address a [[Social cause|cause]].  '''Cause lawyering''' is commonly described as a practice of "lawyering for the good" or using law to empower members of the weaker layers of society. It may or may not be performed [[pro bono]]. Cause lawyering is frequently practiced by individual lawyers or lawyers employed by associations that aim to supply a public service to complement state-provided [[legal aid]].

Cause lawyering is performed by a [[lawyer]] or a firm that is "most frequently directed at altering some aspect of the social, economic, and political status quo."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas NeJaime, Cause Lawyers Inside the State, 81 Fordham L. Rev. 649, 656 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the issue is not particularly relevant, only the advocacy of an issue and the attempt to bring about [[social change]] through legal or even quasi-legal avenues.&lt;ref&gt;NeJaime, 81 Fordham L. Rev. 649, 656 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Cause lawyering can include dedicated advocacy by public interest firms, [[pro bono]] work by attorneys in private practice and other non-traditional forms of law practice that advocates a cause.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Laura Beth Nielsen &amp; Catherine R. Albiston, The Organization of Public Interest Practice: 1975-2004, 84 N.C. L. Rev. 1591, 1603 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers who work for the government, whether federal, state, or local, can also be cause lawyers; although the majority of cause lawyering tends to be adversarial towards the state.&lt;ref&gt;NeJaime at 654.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
As coined by experts Stuart Scheingold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/obituary-uw-professor-renowned-for-work-on-law-politics/|title=Obituary: UW professor renowned for work on law, politics|date=26 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austin Sarat]] in their work ''Something to Believe In: Politics, Professionalism, and Cause Lawyering'',&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Scheingold and [[Austin Sarat]] Something to Believe In: Politics, Professionalism, and Cause Lawyering Stanford Law and Politics (2004). {{ISBN|978-0804749473}}&lt;/ref&gt; cause lawyering consists of "using legal skills to pursue ends and ideals that transcend client service – be those ideals social, cultural, political, economic or indeed, legal".&lt;ref&gt;Austin Sarat and Stuart Scheingold, Cause Lawyering: Political Commitments and Professional Responsibilities. New York: Oxford University Press (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no single "correct" way to define what Cause Lawyering is or who is a cause lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Anna-Maria Marshall, Daniel Crocker Hale, Cause Lawyering, 10 Ann. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Sci. 301, 302 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  Cause lawyering is particularly hard to put limits around because it encompasses so much in the legal world and almost any issue can be considered an issue or cause that is being advocated for, and thereby qualifying as cause lawyering.  Cause lawyering does not require a particular political side, but does require a "determination to take sides in political and moral struggle without making distinctions between worthy and unworthy causes".&lt;ref&gt;Scheingold and Sarat at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cause lawyering is less about the client and more about the issue the client represents. &amp;nbsp;Cause lawyering is about the belief in a cause or issue and the will/desire to advance that cause.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Hilbink, You Know the Type...: Categories of Cause Lawyering, 29 Law &amp; Soc. Inquiry 657, 659 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Cause lawyers tend to choose clients on the basis of their own ideological grounds, no matter where they fall on the political, social, economic, and /or legal spectrum.&lt;ref name="''id.''"&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;What ultimately separates the cause lawyer from other types of lawyers is the advancement of the cause through the client to transform the status quo in service to a cause that is just as important, or more important, than the client.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

In a 2004 [[American Bar Foundation]] essay, Thomas M. Hilbink outlined the "typolog[ies]" of cause lawyering.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;In this essay, cause lawyers are broken into three typologies: (1) Proceduralist Lawyering; (2) Elite-Vanguard Lawyering; and (3) Grassroots Lawyering.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;Proceduralist lawyering is "marked by a belief in the separation of law and politics, and a belief that the legal system is essentially fair and just".&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 668&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Elite-Vanguard lawyering focuses on law as a superior form of politics that uses the law to render substantive justice in a way that will change substantive law and thereby change society.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 673&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Grassroots lawyering, however, approaches law as "just" another form of politics, a venue that is corrupt, unjust, or unfair, and aims to achieve substantive social justice through using the law in combination of other social movements, but refraining from using the law as a primary method for social change.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 681&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
What is now known as cause lawyering grew when the idea of "legal science", a 19th-century belief of legal objectivity in which law could be determined through the application of scientific principles and methodologies, was challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hilbink, Constructing Cause Lawyering: Professionalism, Politics, and Social Change in 1960's America, New York University (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 19th century, the legal field worked to separate law and politics, precluding the idea that the law could be used as a force for political or social change.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; The first organizations to break into cause lawyering and tear down the idea came into existence in the 20th century, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU).&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Through intermixing political progressivism and the law, these two organizations paved the way for politically themed legal entities to use the law in a way that would advance the cause they represented.

In applying the broad encompassing cause lawyering definition from above, cause lawyering has existed as long as legal advocacy has existed. &amp;nbsp;As long as an advocate has advocated for a client and against a perceived social or legal wrong, although the term was not coined until 1998, cause lawyering has been active. &amp;nbsp;In the late 1800s it was [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and state's rights, in the early 1900s it was women's suffrage and civil rights. &amp;nbsp;In the 1960s and the non-profit law firm was born.&lt;ref&gt;Louise G. Trubek, Public Interest Law: Facing the Problems of Maturity, 33 U. Ark. Little Rock L. Rev. 417, 418 (2011).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The creation of non-profit law firms ushered in an era of progressive public interest firms modeled after already established like the NAACP and the ACLU to advance progressive causes from the environmental protection to consumer advocacy. &amp;nbsp;These beginning organizations of cause lawyering, and the ones that followed scored major legal victories that have lasting effects to this day; see ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''

In the 1960s, the [[Ford Foundation]] began funding legal services programs as a component of anti-poverty programs helping fund some of the forerunners of legal services for indigent clients: Mobilization for Youth in New York, Action for Boston Community Development, the Legal Assistance Association in New Haven, and the United Planning Organization in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;National Legal Aid and Defender Association, History of Civil Legal Aid, http://www.nlada.org/About/About_HistoryCivil (2011), (Accessed April 4, 2016).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;While not identified as cause lawyers at the time, these early programs explicitly fit the mold of using the legal system to advance their cause.

Once the newly minted non-profit law firms were established as charitable organizations eligible for IRS tax-deduction, they began to advocate on behalf of disadvantaged and underrepresented groups, advancing the civil rights and poverty legal work from decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek at 418.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, feminist law firms began to emerge with the growing [[Second-wave feminism|Women's Movement]] and with each newly emerging social movement, new cause lawyering organizations sprung up to compliment them.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbink at 384.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;By the mid to late 1970s the explosion of progressive cause lawyering organization was being followed by the creation of more conservative cause lawyering firms.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 385.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The face of cause lawyering has ebbed and flowed just as political movements, social movements, and economic movements have from the 1970s through today. &amp;nbsp;Major events, like the establishment of the [[Legal Services Corporation]] and subsequent restriction; decisions in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', ''[[Citizens United v. FEC|Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'', ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'', ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges|Obergfel v. Hodges]]''; along with everyday victories and defeats of cause lawyers all over the United States have shaped our last one hundred years and will continue to shape the legal landscape to come. &amp;nbsp;As Dean F. Michael Higginbotham said in his Keynote Speech at the [[University of La Verne]] Law Review Symposium in 2014:

"Make no mistake ... there is no better feeling in this life than to know that you have helped to improve the lives of those around you. Nice to make some money, nice to have material things, but there is nothing better than knowing that you have helped the impoverished, that you have helped the hungry, that you have helped the politically powerless, and that you have helped the undereducated to gain at least a semblance of dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Dean F. Michael Higginbotham, Keynote Speech: A Letter from the Original Cause Lawyer, 35 U. La Verne L. Rev. 205, 208 (2014)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public interest lawyering ==
[[Public interest law]] is "the legal practice that advances [[social justice]] or other causes for the public good".&lt;ref&gt;Public Interest Law, ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 612 &amp;nbsp; (Fourth Pocket Edition, 2011).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; In its most simple form, [[public interest]] is defined as "(1) the general welfare of the public that warrants recognition and protection" and "(2) [s]omething in which the public has a stake ..."&lt;ref&gt;Public Interest, ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 612 &amp;nbsp; (Fourth Pocket Edition, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
The public interest notation was first given to a group of lawyers in the 1960s who fought to address the social injustice that existed in American society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Southworth, What Is Public Interest Law? Empirical Perspectives on an Old Question, 62 DePaul L. Rev. 493 (2013)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the late 20th century, many lawyers self-defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to gain legitimacy and respect as they sought to change complex social, political, environmental, and educational problems. As a result of many attorney's desire to participate in public interest law, organizations, such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/about/aclu-history|title=ACLU History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/our-mission|title=NAACP - What Does NAACP Stand For?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were formed to develop a collaborative approach to addressing these societal problems. Today, public interest lawyering has expanded greatly to include free [[legal aid]] groups, liberal and conservative public interest organizations, partisan environmental groups, and individual lawyers who choose to represent the underrepresented.

=== Definition and debate ===
[[File:Logo of the Ford Foundation.png|thumb|Ford Foundation]]
With the increase in self-proclaimed public interest lawyers, the definition and categorization of public interest lawyering continues to be a debated topic. &amp;nbsp;In attempt to narrow the categorization of public interest lawyering, many scholars and researchers have attempted to create a more precise definition of "public interest law". The [[Ford Foundation]] was one of the first groups to attempt to define public interest law as an "[a]ctivity that (1) is undertaken by an organization in the voluntary sector; (2) provides fuller representation of underrepresented interests (would produce external benefits if successful); and (3) involves the use of law instruments, primarily litigation."&lt;ref&gt;Burton A. Weisbrod, Conceptual Perspective on the Public Interest: An Economic Analysis, in Public Interest Law: An Economic and Institutional Analysis 22&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking at the role of [[public interest law]] groups, Laura Beth Nielsen and Catherine Albiston defined public interest law groups as "organizations in the voluntary sector that employ at least one lawyer at least part time, and whose activities (1) seek to produce significant benefits for those who are external to the organization's participants, and (2) involve at least one adjudicatory strategy."&lt;ref&gt;Laura Beth Nielsen &amp; Catherine R. Albiston, [http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&amp;serNum=0325249491&amp;pubNum=0001199&amp;originatingDoc=Ib8b7d554bd4311e28578f7ccc38dcbee&amp;refType=LR&amp;originationContext=document&amp;vr=3.0&amp;rs=cblt1.0&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default) The Organization of Public Interest Practice: 1975-2004, 84 N.C. L. Rev. 1591 (2006)]&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at public interest law as a more broad category, Scott Cummings suggests that public interest law is the legal means that advance the interest of disadvantaged people by way of challenging corporate or governmental policies and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Scott L. Cummings, [http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&amp;serNum=0337797184&amp;pubNum=0001133&amp;originatingDoc=Ib8b7d554bd4311e28578f7ccc38dcbee&amp;refType=LR&amp;originationContext=document&amp;vr=3.0&amp;rs=cblt1.0&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default) The Internationalization of Public Interest Law, 57 Duke L.J. 891, 1034-35 (2008)]&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have defined public interest laws not by what a lawyer does but by a lawyer's financial self-sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Howard M. Erichson, Doing Good, Doing Well, 57 Vand. L. Rev. 2087, 2092 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing young lawyers who are influencing change, Karen Dillon stated that public interest lawyers are those who "have followed their hearts, not necessarily their wallets, into careers that they are convinced will make a difference in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Karen Dillon &amp; Jim Schroeder, The Public Sector 45: Forty-five Young Lawyers Outside the Private Sector Whose Vision and Commitment are Changing Lives, Am. Law., Jan./Feb. 1997, at 80.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pro bono]] work of lawyers has become synonymous with the public good, and there is no debate that a majority of pro bono attorneys do contribute to the public good.

=== Public interest and politics ===
There are multiple ideological groups that unite on specific issues and work towards advances the causes that they believe are in the public interest. The early successes of the public interest movements prompted the emergence of public interest law firms, advocating on divisive political issues. In their discussion of cause lawyering, Scheingold and Sarat suggest that cause lawyering, "conveys a determination to take sides in political or moral struggle without making distinctions between worthy and unworthy cause".&lt;ref&gt;Scheingold and Sarat&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Today, public interest law firms are at the forefront of public interest groups and political advocacy organizations.

When partisan public interest organizations first gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s it was the liberal groups that bound together to promote significant social change. Drawing from the strategies developed by previous groups to advance specific causes, like the NAACP, ACLU and [[Legal defense fund|LDF]], these public interest groups expanded their role to substantive law reform, litigation, and administrative and legislative advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Mark V. Tushnet, The NCAAP's Legal Strategy Against Segregated Education, 1925-1950 at 105-137 (1987).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this expansion in services offered, these groups began employing lawyers to create more lasting substantive change through legal reform.

In response to the success of liberal groups advancing their partisan agendas, conservatives began to adopt this type of organization and developed public interest groups of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Southworth at 493&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the first conservative public interest groups (the [[National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation|National Right to Work Committee]], [[National Right to Life Committee]], [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]]), were created to advance very specific policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 497 - 501&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups do not necessarily advance the public's interest but are intertwined with corporations and lobbying efforts to advance the interest that benefit their clients and result in financial gain for them. Since their inception, the role in public interest groups in politics has increased drastically, with many of them funding [[political action committee]] (PACs) with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting campaigns based on the candidate's stance on important issues. Public interest groups on both sides of the aisle have expanded their roles tremendously and can even be attributed to the divisive political arena that exist today. While their roles have expanded, their overall goals have not. Partisan public interest groups continue pursuing the causes that connect with their ideological beliefs and continue to have successes in advancing these interests.

== Community economic development lawyering ==
Community economic development work includes building coalitions of interested parties to create social policies that improve affordable housing opportunities, increases access to affordable financing options, develops workforce skills, and generally produces more economic production within suffering urban and rural communities.&lt;ref name="Roger A 2009"&gt;Roger A. Clay and Susan R Jones, Building Healthy Communities, A guide to Community Economic Development for Advocates, Lawyers, and Policymakers, American Bar Association, 10, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to serve their client, CED lawyers are required to be proficient in many areas of the law which include: business, finance, environmental studies, real estate, architecture, public policy, education, employment and human resources, community organizing, organizational development, and change theory among other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Susan R Jones, Current Issues in the Changing Roles and Practices of Community Economic Development Lawyers, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, 1, (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Community economic development efforts have been traced back to the early 1900s to the [[Tuskegee Institute]]. During that time [[Booker T. Washington|Booker &amp;nbsp;T. Washington]] believed that the best way to advance African Americans interests was through encouraging economic self-sufficiency through encouraging job training and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;Scott L. Cummings, Community Economic Development as Progressive Politics: Toward a Grassroots Movement for Economic Justice, 54 Stan. L. Rev. 399, 410 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that through economic self-sufficiency, hard work, and property ownership, African American communities would, on their own, create greater levels of wealth accumulation within the African community. To achieve his vision, Washington created vocational training programs and presided over the [[National Negro Business League|National Business League]] with the goal of supporting African American business networks, products, and services.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

In the 1960s, the Civil Rights movement brought about changes to Community Economic Developments advocacy by focusing on grassroots programs in order to achieve greater levels of equality in poor urban and rural communities.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt; Groups like the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] and [[Poor People's Campaign|Poor People's Movement]] began lobbying the Federal Government to create an economic bill of rights which demanded, among other things, improving the economic conditions within underrepresented urban and rural communities.In response, the Federal government created focused programs that targeted disadvantaged communities by providing increased education, job training, and family services.

Beginning with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, both state and federal governments began to reinvest in struggling urban and rural communities through the creation of [[Enterprise Zone]]s.&lt;ref name="Roger A 2009"/&gt; The purpose of the newly created Enterprise Zones was to stimulate job creation within urban communities through tax breaks to relocating companies, job training and ultimately economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Hirasuna, D. &amp; J. Michael. Enterprise Zones: A Review of the Economic Theory and Empirical Evidence. House Research Department. January (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their good intentions, empirical studies have concluded that unless the underlying conditions are ready for economic development, the net benefit of the economic zone program is minimal. According to these studies, the underlying conditions needed to improve an economic zones chances of success are: low unemployment, high levels of investment and suburbs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Criticisms of CED ===

According to Audrey G. McFarlane, CED lawyering efforts have fallen short of their intended goals of building economic development within a community.&lt;ref&gt;Jones at 25&lt;/ref&gt; McFarlane asserts that the economic transformation within Economic Zones has failed in three ways. First, the structure of the economic stimulus has been designed to benefit large corporations that generally do not require high paying jobs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Second, the very fact that the programs are assigned to a geographical location further strengths the stigma associated with investing in "ghettos". Finally, simply providing a job does not address the entire problem facing a community and should include housing programs, workforce development, and food security among other things.

== Organizations ==
A significant portion of cause lawyering is done through special interest groups or legal advocacy organizations. Cause lawyering groups are a type of public interest law organization (PILO).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These organizations are generally structured as 501(c)(3) nonprofits. These organizations are generally tied to specific [[social movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra R. Levitsky, To Lead with Law: Reassessing the Influence of Legal Advocacy Organizations in Social Movements, in Cause Lawyers and Social Movements 145 (Scheingold and Sarat eds. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are legal advocacy organizations for a wide range of causes such as [[environmentalism]], [[Racial equality|racial justice]], [[feminism]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]], [[consumer]]s, the poor, and [[civil liberties]]. These organizations allow cause lawyers to pool time and resources to develop complex [[Litigation strategy|litigation strategies]] for their causes. They often employ staff, have formal members, rely on grant or foundation funding, and even operate on a national scale.
[[File:American Civil Liberties Union .jpg|left|thumb|330x330px|American Civil Liberties Union]]
These groups may use "[[Test case (law)|test cases]]" to change the law to reach the group's political goal. For example, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) famously defended [[John T. Scopes|John Scopes]] in the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]]. In 1925, Tennessee passed the [[Butler Act]] which outlawed the teaching of evolution. The ACLU offered to defend anyone arrested for teaching evolution in violation of the Butler Act. High school biology teacher. Scopes urged students to testify against him and he was eventually arrested under the Butler Act. [[Clarence Darrow]] defended Scopes on behalf of the ACLU. Although Scopes lost at trial, the proceedings were heavily publicized and changed public opinion on the role of faith in public schools. Legal advocacy groups also educate the public and political leaders about their causes, sometimes through litigation.

=== Notable legal advocacy groups ===
[[File:SPLC Logo.jpg|thumb|Southern Poverty Law Center]]
While the ACLU concerns itself with a broad array of civil rights issues, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) share a narrower focus on racial justice issues. Spearheaded by lawyer and future Supreme Court justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], the NAACP used planned litigation to reverse the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Other prominent legal advocacy groups include the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]], [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], [[Innocence Project]], [[Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law|Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under Law]], [[Legal Momentum]], and the [[Sylvia Rivera Law Project]].

Legal advocacy organizations span the political spectrum. Originally, these groups tended to support politically liberal causes. Today, there are many politically conservative legal advocacy organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;Den Dulk, ''In Legal Culture but Not of it: The Role of Cause Lawyers in Evangelical Legal Mobilization'' in Cause Lawyers and Social Movements 197 (Scheingold and Sarat eds. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of such groups are called Christian conservative legal organizations (CCLOs).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bennett, The Rise of Christian Conservative Legal Organizations, Religion &amp; Politics (June 10, 2015), http://religionandpolitics.org/2015/06/10/the-rise-of-christian-conservative-legal-organizations/.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] and [[American Center for Law &amp; Justice|American Center for Law and Justice]] are also prominent CCLOs. CCLOs tend to focus their litigation on [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], opposing same-sex marriage, and the right to life movement.

=== Criticisms of legal advocacy groups ===
Some grassroots organizations criticize national legal advocacy groups for dominating social movements. Legal advocacy groups may set the political agendas of  social movements because legal advocacy groups generally have significantly more resources than grassroots activist groups. Additionally, legal advocacy groups may use a "top-down" approach to identifying and solving social problems without considering the actual needs of groups at the grassroots level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Trends ==

=== United States trends ===
In 2004, Joel F. Handler conducted research that focused on how public interest law firms have changed over time. Citing a 1978 Weisbrod study,&lt;ref&gt;Burton A. Weisbrod et al., &lt;u&gt;Public Interest Law: An Economic and Institutional Analysis&lt;/u&gt;, 1-3, 50-60, University of California Press (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Handler surveyed other cause lawyers to determine how cause lawyering has changed over time.  According to the study, cause lawyer organizations have become multi-issue driven as opposed to the single issue focus held in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen at 1615&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to expanding the scope of a public interest practice, Handler cites that this shift has also included the expansion into other non-legal advocacy which includes: researching, writing and, conducting education and outreach programs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the diversification of public interest organizations, the focus of most public interest organizations has become more diluted. Handler found that since 1975, the historically liberal public interest topics have, for the most part, experienced a decline in the percent of effort expended.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1616&lt;/ref&gt; Offsetting this decrease, Handler notes that growth has primarily been experienced within conservative public interest issues and addressing housing issues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== International trends ===
Cause lawyering has recently taken on a more international emphasis with lawyers working to produce social change most notably within the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Primarily focused on expanding the recognition of human rights, Chinese public interest lawyers have attempted to change the government by litigating high-profile cases and organizing public gatherings demanding government reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-35289978|title=China charges human rights lawyers with 'subversion'|last=|first=|date=January 12, 2016|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Chinese government has attempted to silence the cause lawyers by limiting their efficacy &amp;nbsp;through "law based" restrictions and "extra-legal" measures.&lt;ref&gt;The Leitner Center for International Law and Justice, Plight and Prospects: The Landscape for Cause Lawyers in China, Committee to Support Chinese Lawyers (2015), http://inthumrights.blogspot.com/2015/10/plight-prospects-landscape-for-cause.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Leitner Center]], the [[Communist Party of China]] has been instrumental in passing laws that limit Chinese lawyers ability to effectively practice law by restricting access to clients, charging registration fees and coercing lawyers to drop unpopular cases in exchange for more favorable licensing treatment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to these "law based" restrictions, the Leitner Center has documented cases where lawyers have been detained and even disappeared after refusing to drop unpopular cases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Cause lawyers in South American countries have begun to advocate more effectively by forming cause-lawyering networks. Covering a wide range of issues, these networks primarily focus on issues surrounding human rights and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Sarat Stuart Scheingold, &lt;u&gt;Latin American Cause Lawyering Networks in Cause Lawyering and the State in a Global Era&lt;/u&gt;, 307 (Oxford Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dennis and Gnasher''''' (previously titled '''''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher''''', and originally titled '''''Dennis the Menace''''') is a long-running [[comic strip]] in the British children's [[comic book|comic]] ''[[The Beano]]'', published by [[DC Thomson]], of [[Dundee]], Scotland. The comic stars a boy named Dennis the Menace and his Abyssinian wire-haired tripe hound [[Gnasher]].

The strip first appeared in issue 452, dated 17 March 1951 (on sale 12 March 1951), and is the longest-running strip in the comic. The idea and name of the character emerged when the comic's editor heard a British [[music hall]] song with the chorus "I'm Dennis the Menace from Venice".&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dennis the Menace at 60|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12770341|agency=BBC|date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of Dennis in the 1950s saw sales of ''The Beano'' soar.&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"/&gt; From issue 1678 onwards (dated 14 September 1974) Dennis the Menace replaced [[Biffo the Bear]] on the front cover, and has been there ever since. 

Coincidentally, on 12 March 1951, another comic strip named ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]]'' debuted in the US. As a result of this, the US series has initially been retitled ''Dennis'' for UK audiences, while the British character's appearances are often titled ''Dennis and Gnasher'' outside the UK.

Dennis is the archetypal badly behaved schoolboy. The main recurring storyline throughout the years features his campaign of terror against a gang of 'softies' ([[effeminate]], well-behaved boys), particularly Walter. Walter finds himself in unfavourable circumstances on many occasions, although he sometimes gets the last laugh. Author [[Michael Rosen]] states, “In most children's books a bad child gets made good – but the great thing about Dennis is he never gets better.”&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"/&gt;

''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher'' was first drawn by [[David Law]] (1951–1970), then [[David Sutherland (comics artist)|David Sutherland]] (1970–1998). [[David Parkins]] took over in 1998, but due to his other work commitments, [[Nigel Parkinson]] and Jimmy Hansen have drawn the lion's share of the strips for some years, and Parkins has not drawn Dennis since 2006. More recently, [[Tom Paterson]] has drawn some second Dennis strips for the comic's rear pages. [[Barrie Appleby]] did the artwork for the ''Beano Superstars'' series, which, towards the end of its run, resorted mostly to strips based on the [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher (1996 TV series)|TV series]]. In 2011, he took over as Dennis's main artist. Upon the November revamp of The Beano, Nigel Parkinson took over as Dennis artist as Barrie Appleby had moved back to drawing new episodes of [[Roger the Dodger]]. During this revamp, Dennis was returned to his previous appearance and personality – [[Nigel Auchterlounie]] began writing for Dennis a month after and made Dennis (and the other characters) have wider personalities. Nigel Auchterlounie has proven to be a very popular writer since taking over Dennis. Dennis and Gnasher have remained mascots of ''The Beano''.

==Strip history==

===Creation and concept===
The idea and name of the character emerged when ''The Beano'' editor George Moonie heard a British [[music hall]] song with the chorus "I'm Dennis the Menace from Venice".&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"/&gt; The character of Dennis was initially a struggle for artist Davey Law and then ''Beano'' chief sub Ian Chisholm to develop. Chisholm described the character to Law but was dissatisfied with every sketch the artist showed him. Out of frustration, Chisholm grabbed a pencil and quickly sketched out his creation to Law in the back of his cigarette packet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1211390/Scrawled-pack-Players-Dennis-Menace.html | title = Scrawled on a pack of Players, Dennis the very first Menace | first = Jonathan | last = Petre | newspaper = Mail on Sunday | location = London | date = 6 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawing consisted of Dennis's trademark messy hair cut, knobbly knees and menacing scowl. Adapting Chisholm's doodle, Law set to work on the character in the strip which would appear in the 17 March 1951 issue of The Beano. Two months later, Law gave the mischievous boy his distinctive red and black striped jersey, outsized shoes and devilish grin.&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"/&gt;
[[File:Dennis and Gnasher portrayed by Nigel Parkinson.jpg|thumbnail|left|Dennis the Menace, as he appears in the Parkinson years.]]

===David Law strips (1951–1970)===

Dennis's first comic strip appearance consisted of him walking into the park with his father and his dog where a sign is planted informing visitors that they should 'Keep Off The Grass'. Keeping in with his "world's naughtiest boy" tagline,&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"/&gt; Dennis makes many attempts to get onto the grass much to his father's annoyance. Losing his temper, he takes the lead off the dog and puts it on Dennis thus ending the menace's hijinks. This, like many succeeding it, only made up half a page. It wasn't until around 1954 that Dennis was deemed popular enough to gain a full page strip. Untouched by [[political correctness]], many of Law's strips would end with Dennis being punished for his troublemaking with [[corporal punishment]] such as a [[slippering]] or [[caning|use of a cane]]. Throughout the years, Law's Dennis became taller than his debut appearance. It is not known why Law chose to do this, but many believe it was due to Law's [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] nature. In 1954, Dennis replaced [[Big Eggo]] as the character next to The Beano title citing one of many changes of the comic during this period. The following year, Dennis became one of a few characters from [[DC Thomson]] comics to be featured in his [[Dennis the Menace Annual|own annual]] (the 1956 edition) which continued to up to 2011. 

Dennis was also present in the first [[Dandy]]-Beano Summer Special, where he appeared in full colour. This strip featured Dennis begrudgingly selling flags in aid of the Dog's home. Bored, he chooses to make this a perfect aid to his menacing. Dennis continued to gain popularity solo as time moved on. It wasn't until 1968 that his trademark pet, Gnasher, was introduced, marking comic history.

On 31 August, a strip depicted Dennis being informed by his father that many pets look like their owners. Dennis dismisses this as being a load of 'rot!' and goes out. However, upon seeing many different owners looking just like their dogs he begins to consider that it may be true. Upon being informed of a dog-show, Dennis decides to enter but needs a dog to do so. This was when he found the Abyssinian wire-haired tripehound roaming the streets of Beanotown. Menacing the dog show rather than attempting to win it, the duo are eventually caught and punished. Gnasher returned the following week and became a comic favourite as well as the fictional Menace's best friend.

===David Sutherland strips (1970–1998)===

In 1970, Davey Law took ill and retired from the strip, leaving Dennis in need of a new artist. Dave Sutherland, who was already the artist of [[Biffo the Bear]] and [[The Bash Street Kids]], was chosen. Dennis made a cameo in a Biffo the Bear story in 1972 citing his wish to be on the cover. This dialogue proved to be almost prophetic as he became the cover star of the comic in 1974, a position he still holds today. His first cover story consisted of him using the issue's free gift, the Happy Howler to torment people including his Dad and in an Opera House, who gives Dennis's Dad a free gift of his own, a slipper.

Dennis's popularity was emphasised in 1976 when he was awarded his own fan club. Members would get a membership card, a club wallet and two badges. This later became the foundation of The Beano Club years later. The club was well known for being popular amongst [[celebrities]] as well as Beano readers. [[Phil Lynott]], [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Linford Christie]] were among many to join. A strip promoting an all new Dennis T-shirt for club members emerged in 1978. It featured a guest appearance from [[Minnie the Minx]] and consisted of the two fighting over who the red and black jersey image truly belongs to.

1978 also saw The Beano at 40. To celebrate Dennis's weekly comic strip this week featured him celebrating his birthday and his menacing antics with his brand new [[cowboy]] outfit.

In 1980, The Beano reached a landmark 2000th issue. The front cover depicted Dennis offering to show readers the very first issue of the comic. Incidentally and fitting well with the character's menacing nature, the comic was at the bottom of the pile. The character was then featured in one of the very first Beano spin-off comics, ''The Beano Comic Libraries''. He was one of the first Beano characters to get a feature length story which in turn was called 'King Dennis'. Dennis was also a character present in the most successful Beano annual to date in 1983.

In 1986, one of Dennis's very first story arcs appeared. Gnasher, his faithful companion, had gone missing. Distraught, Dennis asked readers to join him on a 'Gnational Gnasher Search'. At first, Dennis's dad was far happier without the tripe hound but as the week wore on he found himself missing him. The story wore on for seven weeks before Gnasher returned, a father with his six daughters and son, Gnipper, who would later become a key character.

On The Beano's 50th Anniversary, Dennis's strip consisted of him saving The Beano's birthday cake which had begun to float away after the rope in which the sailor was pulling it along with was cut by a nearby crab.

A landmark issue for Dennis appeared in 1991, as the Beano announced they were to change his image. The news received much media attention throughout the UK and it was later revealed to be a publicity stunt in the very strip the image was introduced. Dennis's new attire consisted of a blue tracksuit, sunglasses and headphones connected to a [[walkman]]. However, the tracksuit bottoms ripped due to Dennis's knobbly knees and he ditched the jacket as his father could catch him easier after he had menaced. The end of the strip showed Dennis returning in his trademark jersey and shorts and [[Pea shooter (toy)|pea-shooting]] his nemesis [[Walter the Softy|Walter]]. Dennis also played a vital role in the storyline in which The Beano was turned into colour. The front cover of the famous 2674th issue of the comic depicted Dennis spraying other famous Beano characters with a hose of paint.

In 1993, Beano editor [[Euan Kerr]] was becoming concerned at the direction David Sutherland's depiction of the character was taking, with Dennis becoming ever stockier and larger. Kerr, feeling that Dennis was beginning to resemble a thuggish teenager rather than the naughty boy he was intended to be, told Sutherland to make Dennis look younger in appearance. As a result, Dennis was made shorter, with a smaller chin. He retained his familiar outfit, but started to wear trainers. These changes were also made with the intention of making the character easier to animate for the forthcoming ''[[Beano Video]]''.

In 1996, the first [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher (1996 TV series)|Dennis animated series]] was released on the UK station Fox Kids, with a second series following in 1998.

After the Beano's 60th anniversary issue in 1998, David Sutherland stopped drawing the strip, and was replaced by former [[Billy Whizz]] and [[The Three Bears (comic strip)|The Three Bears]] artist, [[David Parkins]].

===David Parkins (1998–2003)===
[[File:Dennis and Gnasher as drawn by Dave Parkins.jpg|thumbnail|Dennis as depicted during the Parkins Years]]
Parkins' first Dennis strips featured a storyline that formally introduced Dennis's younger sister [[Bea (Dennis the Menace)|Bea]] into the comic. The story lasted three issues and consisted of Dennis's fear that a younger sister would ruin his reputation as the toughest menace in Beanotown. However, as it turned out Bea was as much of a menace as her older brother and even gained her own spin-off strip, which Dennis would sometimes cameo in.

Dennis kicked off the new millennium with a strip of him charging 50 pence to access the Menace Dome, a more 'menacing' version of the [[Millennium Dome]]. He also starred as a villain in a feature length Bash Street Kids strip in which he, alongside Minnie the Minx and Roger the Dodger, raced against the Bash Street Kids to find the treasure which was apparently buried underneath the Millennium Dome. It ended with Danny, the Bash Street leader, outwitting Dennis and his cronies and Dennis angrily blaming it on Roger. Whilst a rivalry with The Bash Street Kids was touched on before in other strips, it was this story which made the rivalry far more well known. Several succeeding feature length strips after, usually drawn by Mike Pearse or Kev F. Sutherland, further depicted the rivalry even to the point it would get violent. He also made other appearances in the spin-off [[Bash Street Kids - Singled Out]], where he would take on a similar role.

In the same year, Dennis became a major mascot for the [[Chessington World of Adventures]] section, Beanoland. He was featured prominently throughout the land including a large figure atop of the shop, a member of the squirting water fountain, a character on the [[dodgems]], a silhouette on the entrance and a cast member in the live show located in his treehouse. Later in the park's history, ''Dennis's Madhouse'' was introduced which was a foam ball play area. In 2008, the land was changed into Wild Asia.

In 2001, Dennis turned 50 and celebrated with a house party in which several Beano characters were invited. Humorously, all his gifts consisted of the 2001 Beano Annual, apart from Les Pretend's which was simply a pretend annual. He later participated in several party games which he changed radically to be far more menacing but found that most of the games back-fired onto him. The party was then finalised with a large food fight and then the entrance of The Dandy characters and other celebrities who had brought over a cake as the party continued for several more hours. Dennis's parents then hid and Dennis was forced to tidy up the mess. The same issue also showed readers how Dennis received his trademark jersey which, it reveals, was initially owned by a boy called Tufty. After Tufty asks when someone would [[Moon Landing|land on the moon]], to which Dennis accurately predicts 20 July 1969, Dennis offers to give him the chance right then. He attaches his granny's homemade soda pop to Tufty, shakes him then removes each of the lids which causes Tufty to blast off and fall into a nearby lake. Dennis then grabs the jersey and puts it on remarking it 'feels right somehow!'.

In 2003, Dennis appeared as a playable character in the PC game [[Beanotown Racing]]. He was featured in several strips leading up to the games release depicting how he received his vehicle and races he got into prior to the games events. This includes a rivalry with [[Minnie the Minx]] who had gotten her vehicle before him. Dennis tuned up his Menace-Mobile to make a dune buggy.

===Nigel Parkinson, Jimmy Hansen and Tom Paterson (2004–2009)===

David Parkins' workload meant he was able to draw the strip on an increasingly less frequent basis throughout his time on the strip, and after 2003 he became too busy to continue as full-time artist. Nigel Parkinson, who had previously been drawing the strip as Parkins' understudy, continued as artist, along with Jimmy Hansen coming in to replace Parkins. The pair drew the vast majority of stories between 2004 and 2007, when Tom Paterson also started drawing the strip. In 2008, Dennis was given an extra strip towards the back of the comic, usually a continuing story across a few weeks. These strips were usually drawn by [[Tom Paterson]]. One such story featured the illness of Gnasher's young pup, Gnipper who had been bitten by a poisonous snake. Throughout this story, Dennis and Gnasher called upon help of various past characters of the strips history before finally contacting Gnipper's many sisters who successfully managed to get him out of his coma. Walter also changed in the strip as Dennis was given more reason to belittle and menace him. Instead of being camp and frilly, he was quite rude and obnoxious especially towards Dennis and his friends. However, Dennis seemed to be more of a bully than an anti-hero in this age.

In 2007, Dennis was featured on the front page of a new magazine BeanoMax and was the coverstar until 2008 where he was replaced by Max, an exclusive character. Another landmark issue was met in 2008 where The Beano turned 70. As a celebration, Dennis was seen on the cover sharing a cake with [[Wallace and Gromit]], whose creator was featured heavily in the issue.

===2009 re-launch (2009–2010)===
[[File:Dennis and Gnasher logo.png|thumb|The 2009 logo.]]
When the [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher (Comic Strip)|strip]] was relaunched in 2009, Dennis faced several changes to his character and appearance. It was the first major revamp of the character since his debut over 50 years prior and proved vastly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2583051/Dennis-The-Menace-is-de-menaced-by-BBC.html | title=Dennis The Menace is De-Menaced by the BBC|location=London | work=The Sun | first=Colin | last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkinson, Hansen and Paterson continued to draw the strips, although . Dennis became slightly shorter with a boyish look to him as opposed to the brute, tough guy look the previous artists had established. His behind the nose grin was used far less frequently and most of his menacing was toned down. He also no longer used weapons such as a catapult or peashooter save for a few times, so he became more creative in his mischief. The strip's title was shortened to Dennis and Gnasher during these years, and Dennis rarely used the term 'menacing' to describe his actions. Dennis's idol was revealed to be 'Rat-Bucket' a fictional heavy metal singer introduced in the strip. He was also given more rivals as Athena and Sugar were both introduced to the strip. He was also given a new spin-off called ''Sixty Second Dennis''. This was a single page strip which featured Dennis in a short story, and was usually illustrated by [[Nigel Parkinson]].

The reason behind the re-launch was to promote the new [[Dennis and Gnasher (2009 TV series)|TV series]] which was just about to hit screens in Britain. It followed Dennis, Curly, Pie-Face and Gnasher as they attempt to brighten up the average day in Beanotown through new ideas, adventures and pranks.

On 27 November 2010, The Beano Club was relaunched into The Beano V.I.P. It was officially announced vis a Dennis strip where several British celebrities including [[Ant and Dec]], [[Simon Cowell]] and [[Daniel Radcliffe]] visited Beanotown in an effort to join the club but all failed as they were not deemed tough enough. In the end, Dennis decides its only the reader who can become a Beano V.I.P.  This was the first strip in which Dennis seemed to actually do his 'menacing' intentionally since his re-launch in 2009.

===Barrie Appleby, Nigel Parkinson &amp; Nigel Auchterlounie (2011 – present)===

In early 2011, Dennis's re-launched character slowly and subtly began returning to his 'menacing' ways. He began using his weapons again and referring to his antics as menacing. He also began to do his menacing more intentionally as he did in all previous eras. Barrie Appleby, who had previously drawn Roger the Dodger, became the artist as the strip was extended to three pages rather than the usual two. Sixty Second Dennis was also dropped, being replaced by a Gnasher spin-off strip called Gnashional Treasure, which was later renamed as [[Gnasher's Bit(e)]].
Although the strip continued to be known as ''Dennis and Gnasher'', Dennis was once again overtly referred to as 'the menace', and by his 60th Birthday, Dennis had returned to his original character although he still has the likeness of his 2009 TV series counterpart. Meanwhile, Nigel Parkinson continued with lengthier [[BeanoMAX]] stories which would often feature other Beano characters.

By August 2012, Dennis's 2009 re-launch was reverted following yet another re-launch of the comic. His illustrations were more in tone with David Parkins' era and he partook in genuine naughtiness and disruption again. Barrie Appleby returned to Roger the Dodger, whilst Nigel Parkinson began weekly strips. Like his 2009 re-launch, Dennis faced several new changes mainly due to a new editor. His old behind the nose grin returned and he began to once again refer to himself as a 'menace'. His parents had a make-over, so his traditionally balding father now shared his messy spiked hair and his mother was no longer neatly shaped. Gnasher also returned to normal. A new character called Angel Face was also introduced into the strip, in order to give Dennis more of a rival.

In honour of the [[2012 London Olympic Games]], gold medalist [[Jessica Ennis]] appeared in a strip, much to public attention. Paralympic runner [[Oscar Pistorius]] also appeared, with the current editor, Stirling citing that 'When people told Oscar he couldn't be an athlete due to his disability, he ignored them and, in that respect, he's just like Dennis, who never does as he is told.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9506917/Oscar-Pistorius-to-follow-in-Jessica-Enniss-footsteps-by-appearing-on-front-cover-of-the-Beano-comic.html Oscar Pistorius to follow in Jessica Ennis's footsteps by appearing on front cover of the Beano comic]. ''The Daily Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt; Both strips were extremely well received amongst both the athletes and the public.

During Series 12 of the BBC’s ''[[Mock the Week]]'', host [[Dara Ó Briain]], and comedians [[Hugh Dennis]], [[Andy Parsons]] and [[Chris Addison]] were drawn by Nick Parkinson in a one-off pic with Dennis, which was shown in the second episode, whilst they and guest comedians were discussing about the appearance of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Camilla Parker Bowles]] in ''The Beano''. Each celebrity was drawn holding a weapon – Hugh had a peashooter, Chris had a watergun, Dara had a plunger and bow, and Andy had a catapult, and all four were drawn with Dennis's trademark red and black striped top, shorts, black socks, and brown shoes (except Andy, who had red trainers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downthetubes.tumblr.com/post/53923806236/did-you-see-the-beano-on-last-weeks-mock-the|title=downthetubes-tumblr — Did you see The Beano on last week’s Mock the...|website=downthetubes-tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in November 2012, Dennis was written by former Dandy writer, Nigel Auchterlounie, who gave Dennis and the other characters wider personalities. Auchterlounie's strips have been very well received since taking over the strip. Dennis's younger years in Beanotown Preschool were chronicled in a strip called ''The BamBeanos''.

==Character traits==

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:NightmareOnBashSt1-1-.png|thumbnail|Dennis &amp; Gnasher as depicted by Mike Pearse]] --&gt;
Dennis is an uncontrollable schoolboy who takes pride in causing chaos and mayhem to those around him due to his intolerance for rules and order. Such traits have caused some artists and writers to consider him a villain. In such strips, Dennis would often prove himself to be quite selfish and greedy, often disregarding his friends in favour for treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Bash Street Annual 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis' 50th Birthday&lt;/ref&gt; His misbehaviour stems from what The Beano explains as an attempt to add excitement to an otherwise dull day. Often equipped with a red and black jersey and an array of menacing weaponry (such as a catapult), Dennis is considered to be quite the [[loner]], seeking no solace in anyone's company aside from his faithful pet dog Gnasher. Feature length strips in The Beano reveal that Dennis actually has a rivalling nature with The Bash Street Kids, often brawling and attempting to outwit them. Most notably, he seems to have a particular dislike for Danny, the leader. He has, however, been shown to have a fairly stable friendship with [[Minnie the Minx]] and [[Roger the Dodger]], enough so that the three have been seen to work together often. Dennis has also been shown to be quite heroic, having saved his town on occasion from potential disaster. The Beano Annual 2001–2002, both exemplified this in their stories in which Dennis defeated a race of 'Beanobots'.

Even though many strips depict Dennis as being fairly academically challenged, he is in fact extremely inventive and clever when it comes to mechanics. On occasion, it has been shown that Dennis can make from scratch his very own vehicles including a Menace Dune-Buggy, a working rocket and other such things.

'''8 August 1953''': Walter appeared for the first time. He moved in as Dennis's next-door neighbor. 

'''1954''': David Law's style of drawing Dennis changed dramatically, making the characters tall and thin. Dennis appeared on the back page in full colour for the first time.

'''1955''': The first [[Dennis the Menace Annual|Dennis Annual]] was published, using reprinted stories from previous years.

'''1958''': After four years of being drawn this way, characters become more or less back the way they were. Dennis returned inside the comic.

'''1962''': Dennis returned to the back of the comic.

'''31 August 1968''': Dennis found a dog on the street, Gnasher, on his way to the dog show at the local town hall. Gnasher became a regular from this point onwards.

'''1969''': Walter's dog, Foo-Foo, debuted.

'''22 July 1970''': David Law retired, and one comic was drawn by [[Pup Parade]] artist Gordon Bell.

'''29 July 1970''': [[The Bash Street Kids|Bash Street Kids]] artist [[David Sutherland (comics artist)|Dave Sutherland]] started drawing Dennis, although drawing the strip almost identically to David Law. The strip was renamed "Dennis the Menace &amp; Gnasher" when originally it was just called "Dennis the Menace" as Gnasher had been appearing every week on the strips.

'''14 September 1974''': Dennis took the front cover of ''[[The Beano]]'' replacing [[Biffo the Bear]].

'''1975''': Walter joined "the softies", Bertie Blenkinsop and Algernon "Spotty" Perkins.

'''5 May 1979''': Dennis's pet pig "Rasher" debuted.

''' Early 1980s''': Use of the slipper became increasingly rare in this time, having been very common in earlier strips.

'''1992''': The Menace Car was seen for the first time.

'''February 1993''': David Sutherland, Realising how stocky and bulky he became in recent years, started changing Dennis, making him look young and cute for a few years. The "Gnasher and Gnipper" strip was taken over by Barry Glennard in order to ease Sutherland's workload, though the style remains similar.

'''Early 1996''': Dennis The Menace was looking like he did again, and for the first time ever, the story was drawn in the same style as the [[Bash Street Kids]].

'''April 1996''': The [[Dennis the Menace (1996 TV series)|Dennis the Menace Animated TV series]] appeared for the first time on [[BBC]] and [[The Children's Channel|TCC]]. This year marked the first appearances of The Colonel, Dennis's neighbour, and Sergeant Slipper, the local constable, who had both previously appeared in the television series. From this point onwards the front cover page usually consists of just one frame of the strip rather than several.

'''1998''': Dasher re-appeared with a red mask as the mascot of the Beano site.

'''August–September 1998''': For the 60th anniversary for the Beano, David Parkins started drawing Dennis the Menace, creating [[Bea (Dennis the Menace character)|Bea]] some issues later.

'''October 1998''': Bea got her own strip called '''Beaginnings''' drawn by Nigel Parkinson. She said her first word (Mud) in this strip.

'''1999''': Nigel Parkinson became Dennis artist for the first time.

'''February 2001''' The Gnasher and Gnipper strip was revamped, now being drawn in Barry Glennard's own style.

'''March 2001''' Dennis celebrated his 50th Birthday. A special episode drawn by David Parkins (In the style of David Law) was released in the issue, telling the readers how he got his striped jersey.

'''December 2001''' '''Beaginnings''' got renamed '''Dennis's Little Sister Bea – the Mini-Menace'''.

'''2002''': [[Buster Capp|Buster]] artist Jimmy Hansen drew his first Dennis strip. By this time, Nigel Parkinson was drawing Dennis as often as David Parkins, and effectively became main artist the following year.

'''2004''': David Parkins stopped drawing Dennis altogether, and Jimmy Hansen joined Nigel Parkinson as main artist. Over the next 5 years they each drew about half of the strips. Walter got revamped when drawn by Jimmy Hansen, and he now bears the appearance of an [[Elvis impersonator]] with much bigger glasses.

'''2004''': Dennis the Menace became the longest running strip in the Beano ever, beating [[Lord Snooty]].

'''2007''': [[Tom Paterson]] started drawing Dennis occasionally.

'''2008''': Dennis got a comic strip at the back of the Beano as well as the front. The second strip was usually drawn by [[Tom Paterson]]. It is now clear that Walter has a new personality. Instead of being a gentle, well-behaved boy, he's become camp, considerably meaner, and almost certainly evil.

'''2009''': [[Dennis &amp; Gnasher (2009 TV series)|A brand new series]] was released, again on the [[BBC]]. For the new series, Dennis and Gnasher were revamped, not just for TV but also in the comic. The second Dennis strip was replaced by Sixty Second Dennis, which takes up just one page as opposed to two. The main Dennis strip is now mainly drawn by Hansen, with Sixty Second Dennis usually by Nigel Parkinson.

'''2011''': [[Barrie Appleby]] took over as full-time Dennis artist. The strip isn't as influenced by the 2009 series now, with Dennis behaving more menacingly, the series-style backgrounds being dropped, Dennis being referred to more often as 'the menace' and the return of several characters who disappeared around the time of the new series, such as Foo-Foo.  Also around the same time, Sixty Second Dennis gets replaced by a new Gnasher strip, titled [[Gnasher's Bit(e)]], drawn by Jimmy Hansen.

'''March 2011''': Dennis celebrated his 60th birthday.

'''August 2012''': Changes made by previous relaunch were reverted. Nigel Parkinson begins regular weekly strips.

'''July 2013''': A second season to the 2009 series renamed ''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher'' and the ''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher Megazine'' have both been released to coincide with the 75th anniversary of [[The Beano]].

'''March 2014''': The ''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher Megazine'' was renamed ''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher's EPIC Magazine''.

'''December 2014''': The ''Dennis the Menace'' [[Minecraft]] mod is launched.

'''February 2015''': The ''Blast in Beanotown'' app for the [[iPad]] is launched.

'''September 2017''': Since Curly moved, JJ and Rubi are introduced since they both moved in. Pie-Face has been redesigned.

'''November 2017''': [[Dennis &amp; Gnasher: Unleashed!]] was released on [[BBC]].

==Characters==

Over the years, a variety of subsidiary characters have arisen.

===Dennis' family===
'''Dennis''' is the main character of the strip. Badly behaved and visually rebellious, Dennis uses a wide range of pranks and weaponry in order to cause chaos and mayhem to those around him. He is trademarked by his scruffy, black hair and red &amp; black jersey.

'''Dad''' appeared in the first strip. His real name has never been given (although once it was cited as actually being "Dennis's Dad" in a letter by Dennis). He also appears in both ''Bea'' and ''Gnasher and Gnipper''. The real name of his wife, '''Mum''', has also never been given (again in the same letter, it was stated that her actual name is "Dennis's Mum"). In the 2012 revamp, he was redrawn to look more like Dennis. This was explained in 2015 as '''Dad''' now being the grown up version of the 1980s Dennis the Menace, making the 1980s Dad a Granddad. 

'''[[Bea (Dennis the Menace character)|Bea]]''' is Dennis's little sister, born in issue 2931, dated 19 September 1998. She has her own strip (''Bea'', originally ''Beaginnings'') and sometimes appears in ''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher''. Bea wears a stripy yellow and black vest, this is a pun on her name as the colours are the same as the colours on a [[Bumble bee]].

'''Granny''' is Dennis's and Bea's 80-year-old grandmother. In the late 1980s/early 1990s, she got her own strip ''[[Go, Granny, Go!]]'' drawn by [[Brian Walker (artist)|Brian Walker]]. This transformed her from the indulgent Granny who used the Demon Whacker when necessary to a very active elderly lady who enjoyed motorbikes, similar to [[Cuddles and Dimples]]'s granny, partly because, by this time, characters in The Beano were no longer punished with the slipper. She also appeared regularly in the 2009 TV series, where she is married to a man who is presumed to be Dennis's granddad.

'''Denise'''  is Dennis's cousin, who bears a striking resemblance to [[Beryl the Peril]], although she also wears a red and black striped jumper. She appeared in just a few stories, visiting along with her cat '''Santa Claws'''. She generally managed to out-menace Dennis, showing considerable fortitude against the Softies, and at the local boxing club. Santa Claws also appeared in a [[Roger the Dodger]] strip in the 2008 [[Beano Annual]].

===Animals===
[[Gnasher]] is a black dog (an "''Abyssinian wire-haired tripehound''") who first appeared in issue 1363, dated 31 August 1968. He has extremely strong teeth that can leave teethmarks in seemingly anything, and enjoys chasing postmen. His name comes from the British slang for teeth (gnashers), which in turn comes from the French ''ganache'' meaning "jowl", a word also used in chocolate manufacture. In the first ever Dennis the Menace strip, the family also had a pet [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]], who has not since appeared.

Since 1986, Gnasher has had a son, [[Gnipper]], who appears with him in the separate strip (''[[Gnasher and Gnipper]]''). Gnipper is owned by Dennis the Menace. He first appeared in issue 2286, dated 10 May 1986 after a story arc in which Gnasher went missing, this story arc was reprinted in the [[Dennis the Menace Annual]] 1990 as a 16-page story entitled ''Who's Gnicked Gnasher''. Gnipper's name is a pun since 'to nip' something means to give something a small bite, while 'nipper' is a slang term for a young child.
Gnasher also has several daughters: '''Gnatasha''', '''Gnaomi''', '''Gnanette''', '''Gnorah''' and '''Gnancy''', although these are rarely seen. Gnatasha had her own strip in ''[[The Beezer]]'' and ''[[Topper (comic book)|Topper]]'', and appeared in the Beezer Book 1994. Gnasher also used to have another strip, ''[[Gnasher's Tale]]'', which began in 1977 and continued for nine years until the title was changed to [[Gnasher and Gnipper]] following Gnipper's introduction.

[[Rasher (comics)|Rasher]] is a pig, first seen in issue 1920, dated 5 May 1979. He loves to eat swill and was rescued by Dennis. Rasher also has children: '''Oink''', '''Snort''', '''Grunt''', '''Squeal''', and '''Squeak'''. He used to have his own strip called ''Rasher'', which started in 1984 and appeared regularly for four years before making sporadic appearances until 1995, Rasher's strip also appeared for a few weeks in 2010. He was believed to have been dropped after the strip was revamped in 2009, but he made a surprise return to the strip in 2011. In the 2009 TV series, Rasher and Gnipper are owned by Dennis's Granny.

Dennis has been seen with his pet [[spider]] called '''Dasher'''. He first appeared in about 1987, as a tool to scare Walter, and was the mascot of the Beano [[website]] when it launched in 1997. Originally, the spider was all black, but when it reappeared in 1997, it was red and black, matching Dennis's jersey. He appeared a few times from 1997–2008, and than reappeared in the 2011 and 2016 Halloween issue.

===Other children===
Dennis has two main friends: '''Curly''' (real name '''Crispin Lee Shepherd'''), who has a lot of strawberry-blonde, curly hair, was the first to appear, debuting months after the strip started in 1951. Although Curly and Dennis get into many fights, they still remain the best of friends, and '''Pieface''' (real name '''Kevin Peter Shepherd'''), whose favourite food is pies. Dennis, Gnasher, Curly and Pieface are collectively called "The Menaces". They all are in a band called ''Dennis and the Dinmakers''. Pieface currently has his own strip in [[The Beano]] as well as his 'pet' Paul the Potato. They are both by [[Nigel Auchterlounie]] and [[Diego Jourdan]]. Since the 2017 revamp, however, Curly seems to have largely disappeared when he moved. In his place are two girls, '''Rubidium von Screwtop''' (from The Beano’s ‘Rubi’s Screwtop Science’ strip) and '''Jemima Jones''' (from the comic’s ‘JJ’s Jokes’ strip). Despite Dennis’s previous resentment towards most girls in earlier years, he accepts them as his friends.  During the 1980s, a third boy known as "Toadface McGurty" was also one of Dennis' friends.

The rival gang to the Menaces is the '''Softies''', a group of children who enjoy things such as [[teddy bear]]s, [[doll]]s and [[flower]]s. The most famous, Dennis's greatest sworn enemy, is a character called [[Walter The Softy|Walter]], sometimes called the "Prince of Softies". He has a pet [[poodle]] called '''Foo-Foo'''. The two most other frequently seen Softies are '''Algernon 'Spotty' Perkins''' and '''Bertie Blenkinsop'''. Other softies, seen less often, have included ''' Bennie Benry''', '''Sweet William''', '''Dudley Nightshirt''', '''Jeremy Snodgrass''', '''Softy Matthew''', '''Softy Pal Erasmus''', '''Lisping Lester''', '''Matilda''' (Walter's girlfriend introduced in the 1996 TV series), and '''Nervous Rex''', a character who is scared of everything and everyone. For a brief time in the late 1970s/ early 1980s, '''Curly''' also appeared in the softies.

===Other characters===
The '''Colonel''' is an old army colonel, who is often seen with toy soldiers and often makes references to being in battles which happened hundreds of years ago. In an episode of the animated TV series entitled 'Skull and Crossbones', his first name was revealed to be Godfrey.

'''Sergeant Slipper''' is the police sergeant who is always trying to catch Dennis for menacing. In the 1960s a well-known police officer was known as [[Jack Slipper|Slipper of the Yard]], though "slipper" is also a nod to the instrument with which Dennis's father usually chastised him before corporal punishment was deemed politically incorrect.

'''Dennis's Teacher''' often appeared in ''Dennis the Menace'' strips from the early 1970s and has been replaced, although the character was absent for most of the intervening period, in the 2009 TV Series by another Teacher named '''Mrs Creecher'''.

'''Nasty Norman''' was a bully often seen as Dennis's rival.

'''Stanley Livingstone''' an explorer with a pet crocodile, who lived next door to Dennis. Seemingly replaced by the Colonel, though the character had disappeared a while before the Colonel first appeared. His name alludes to the explorers [[David Livingstone]] and [[H.M. Stanley]].

==Reception and legacy==

BBC News once called Dennis the 'definitive naughty boy'. Matthew Jarron of Dundee University, curator of a Beano exhibition, claimed that the strips 'blatant anti-establishment tone' is what keeps children entertained throughout the decades. Children's author and political columnist [[Michael Rosen]] said he enjoyed the prospect that 'In most children's books a bad child gets made good. But the great thing about Dennis is he never gets better'.&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"/&gt; Nick Newman cited his inspiration for a [[Private Eye]] strip based on the Menace due to the fact Dennis is 'relentless' and has 'no learning curve'. Jarron also argued that Dennis offers a sense of escapism in a modern cotton wool wrapped world stating 'Parents are so fearful of letting their children roam around. So Dennis can provide that vicarious pleasure of going out and doing anything. And it's menacing of a pretty benign kind'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12770341 BBC News – Dennis the Menace at 60]. Bbc.co.uk (2011-03-17). Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Express called Dennis 'the child template for every post-war rebel without a cause'.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Adam. (2011-03-21) [http://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/235737/Dennis-the-Menace-is-still-a-rebel-even-at-60 Dennis the Menace is still a rebel even at 60 | Express Comment | Comment | Daily Express]. Express.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; John McShane, a comic historian further praised the strip calling Dennis 'an original looking character. In the early days it was not in full colour but had a red overlay, but Davy Law, the artist, made a virtue out of this necessity by having the red-and-black striped T-shirt. The mantra in design classes is: 'Black and Red will always be read.' And that spiky hair! Unforgettable. Then that cheeky expression. Cartoonists talk about drawings just 'coming right'; that expression is perfect. Dennis is not actually evil ... Dennis just wants fun and is prepared to accept the consequences'.&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/dennis-the-menace-turns-60-1-1531429 Dennis the Menace turns 60 – News]. The Scotsman (2011-03-13). Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside praise from the press, Dennis encountered controversy amongst the media in the late 1990s and early 2000s for being '[[Homophobia|homophobic]]' and a '[[Bullying|bully]]'. On the criticism, Maurice Heggie, a Dandy editor, stated 'I never saw him as a bully because the characters of the softies were so dreadful, they had no redeeming features either.' He went on to explain that 'if Dennis was bullying them, then there was a punishment. There was never a script out of DC Thomson where a bully succeeded – there was always a punishment – however horrible Dennis was with his water pistol, be sure that round the corner there was an elephant with a trunkful of water for him. He's changed over the years, but he's not changed ... He is essentially out for mischief all the time'.  John McShane also defended the strip stating firmly that 'Dennis never got away with his pranks'. On whether the stories of Walter's homosexuality were true McShane affirmed that he didn't know but argued' He certainly needed to stand up for himself. Our sympathies were never with him because he didn't stand up to Dennis. Bullies have to be stood up to; another good lesson for any society.'&lt;ref name="scotsman1"/&gt; In an article for the Guardian, Dennis is cited as 'Britain's longest surviving comic villain'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/14/netnotes.markoliver Dennis the Menace | World news]. theguardian.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 redesign controversy===

In 2009, the strip gained negative media publicity after it was announced that new issues would draw inspiration from the  [[Dennis and Gnasher (2009 TV series)|TV series]] that aired the same year. In the series, Dennis did not use any weapons such as catapult, peashooter and water guns and his personality was re-established as naively troublesome rather than intentionally so. Gnasher was also forbidden to bite people. Their image was drastically revamped, in an attempt to make them more accessible to younger viewers. This was all to discourage violence and weaponry among children. Fans spoke out against The Beano's decision citing that 'Dennis is supposed to be a little bit edgy and a bit of a lovable rogue'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6013115/Dennis-the-Menace-receives-politically-correct-makeover.html Dennis the Menace receives politically correct makeover]. Telegraph. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kev F Sutherland]], who wrote for The Beano in the early noughties, also spoke out against the makeover saying it was a 'bad idea' and argued 'if you pander too much to over-sensitive parents you will end with not very funny comedy'.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Dennis-menace-bad-idea-says-Beano-illustrator/story-11298289-detail/story.html#ixzz2aoPOG42g Dennis without the menace is a bad idea, says Beano illustrator from Clevedon | News]. This is Bristol (2009-08-15). Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The daughters of ''Dennis the Menace'' creator [[David Law]] further criticized the makeover, saying their father would be 'horrified' with how he was depicted now and said the new design was 'bland' and 'ordinary'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/6076793/Dennis-the-Menace-makeover-angers-family.html Dennis the Menace makeover angers family]. Telegraph. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The change lasted for roughly a year before artist [[Nigel Parkinson]] was sought out to return the character to its roots and original design. What's more, the series aired, but was considerably altered during its second season to suit the tone of the comics, making Dennis closer to his comic book age and personality.

==In popular culture==
[[Darts]] player [[Dennis Priestley]] is known as "The Menace" and wears a shirt with the familiar red and black horizontal bands.

'''Martin Allen''' (born 19 October 1964) is a British teenager who mysteriously disappeared on 5 November 1979. No trace of Allen has been found and his fate remains unknown.

==Background==
Martin Allen and his brothers grew up in a council flat in [[Hornsey]], where their mother was a secretary at Tufnell Park Primary School.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/martin-allen-mystery-how-case-of-london-teenager-missing-for-35-years-could-be-linked-to-the-elm-10249285.html|title=Martin Allen mystery: how case of London teenager missing for 35 years|last=Butter|first=Susannah|date=14 May 2015|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Martin was 12 his father gained employment as a [[chauffeur]] to the Australian High Commissioner and the whole family moved to a cottage in the grounds of the [[High Commission of Australia, London|Australian High Commission]] in [[Kensington]], London.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/paedophile-ring-may-have-killed-boy-15-svgkwh0x7km|title=Paedophile ring may have killed boy, 15|last1=Keate|first1=Georgie|date=26 November 2014|work=The Times|accessdate=12 May 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant change in circumstance and their new neighbours included the [[De Beers]] jewellery family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Edward Heath|Ted Heath]] were regular visitors to the street and Thatcher had a passing acquaintance with Allen's father.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Martin attended the [[Central Foundation Boys' School|Central Foundation]] Grammar School in [[Old Street station|Old Street]] and was described as intelligent, good at French, maths and drawing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Martin was a shy boy, young for his age, and not the type to run away from home.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spotlightonabuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/mirror030480a.jpg|title=WHY THE ALLENS REMEMBER THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER|last=|first=|date=3 April 1980|work=Daily Mirror|access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On 5 November 1979, Allen travelled home from school on the [[London Underground]]. His intention was to go to see his older brother, Bob, who lived near [[Holloway Road tube station|Holloway Road]], but he needed to go home first in order to collect some money.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At around 3:50pm he said goodbye to some school friends on [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] and set off in the direction of the [[Piccadilly line]] platform to travel home.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Initial reports state that this was the last confirmed sighting of Martin. Later reports state that Martin came home around 5pm as witnessed by his brother Kevin but went straight out again.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Allen failed to reach his brother Bob's home.&lt;ref name=":98:"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8427297.stm|title=New clues to missing boy's fate|last=|first=|date=9 November 1998|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family were not alarmed that Martin did not come home that night as they knew that if it got too late Martin would stay at his brother Bob's house.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The next day the family hadn't heard anything. At 7pm Mrs Allen rang Bob.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The parents phoned Martin's best friend, Robert, who told them Martin had not been at school, the parents then called the police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Initial Investigation ==
When he was reported missing, a large-scale police operation was launched supported by a media campaign.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} This failed to locate Allen. The police searched Martin's bedroom in the family cottage for 9 hours but did not find any fingerprints not even any belonging to Martin himself.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/541985/vip-paedos-snatched-my-kid-brother/|title=Big brother searches for missing teen in historic VIP sex club|last=LYNN|first=DAVIDSON|date=2014-11-24|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a TV appeal 5 weeks after the disappearance&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; a male witness came forward to report seeing a man accompanying a boy acting suspiciously at [[Gloucester Road tube station|Gloucester Road]] Tube station at 4:15pm on the day of the disappearance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This was about half an hour after Martin disappeared.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8428785.stm|title=BBC News - Parents' plea over 1979 abduction|date=23 December 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2017|format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt; The witness reported that the man was standing with his arm around the shoulder of a boy resembling Martin.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The boy appeared distressed and both parties appeared to be nervous as they got onto a Tube train.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The witness saw the man prod the boy in the back and overheard him tell the boy not to try to run when the pair left the train at [[Earl's Court]] station.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The witness described the man as 6&amp;nbsp;ft tall, in his 30s, well built, with very blonde hair and moustache and was wearing a denim jacket and trousers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scepticpeg.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/image10.jpg?w=450&amp;h=1024|title=Photofit Clue as Police Fear Lost Boy is Prisoner|last=Sandell|first=Charles|date=9 December 1979|work=News of the World|access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation to find the identity of the man was described at the time as London's biggest ever house-to-house search.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It included a visit to every property in Earls Court, the publication of an artist's impression&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6873001/Parents-of-boy-abducted-30-years-ago-make-final-appeal.html|title=Parents of boy abducted 30 years ago make final appeal|date=23 December 2009|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wide circulation of Identikit pictures of the man.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Investigators eliminated 200 possible suspects, spoke to 50,000 people and collected 600 statements during the inquiry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The identity of the man was never discovered.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Allen's brother Jeffrey alleged that in the early stages of the police investigation the detective responsible for the original 1979 investigation had told the Allen family that there were “high-up people involved” and that they should stop talking and “not take it further because someone will get hurt”.&lt;ref name="indy20141126" /&gt;

==Subsequent events==
In 1984, a book on the case by writer [[Anton Gill]] was published by [[Corgi Books]].&lt;ref&gt;Anton Gill (1984) ''Martin Allen is missing'', Corgi Childrens. {{ISBN|0552124664}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 it was reported that police in [[Liverpool]], acting on an anonymous tip off, had discovered a ‘shrine’ dedicated to Martin at the home of an alleged [[paedophile]].&lt;ref name=":98:" /&gt; Officers reportedly visited the house of the 62-year-old man and found a makeshift shrine including newspaper cuttings, pictures and a headstone engraved "In Memory of Martin Allen".&lt;ref name=":98:" /&gt; This bizarre development prompted a brief resurgence of interest in the case, but no new leads were forthcoming.&lt;ref name="indy19981119"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shrine found to boy missing for 19 years|work=The Independent|date=19 November 1998|accessdate=7 July 2016|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/shrine-found-to-boy-missing-for-19-years-1183748.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, police told Kevin and Jeffrey that the files on the investigation had been destroyed in a flood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2009 Allen's parents conceded they had no hope of seeing him alive again, believing him to have been abducted, they stated their wish simply to know what had happened and why.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Martin's father, Tom, died in 2012.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His mother has since also passed away.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Subsequent investigations==
The case was closed in the 1980s, but reopened in 2009 in light of new information.&lt;ref name="indy20141126" /&gt; The officer leading the new police investigation admitted that police were baffled by the case and that, despite a massive initial inquiry and a good response from the public, they had few leads.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8427297.stm|title=BBC News - Parents make 1979 abduction plea|date=23 December 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police interviewed serial killer [[Dennis Nilsen]] twice about Martin's disappearance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; No evidence of a connection was found.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2012, British police initiated a number of new investigations into child abuse allegations dating back over the previous 20–30 years. This included a re-investigation of claims of child abuse at the [[Elm Guest House child abuse scandal|Elm Guest House]]. Elm House was a London guest house where it was known that exploitation and abuse of children had taken place repeatedly over a prolonged period of time during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="indy20141126"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/kidnapped-boy-may-have-been-abused-and-murdered-by-vip-paedophile-ring-say-police-9883509.html|title='Kidnapped boy may have been abused and murdered by VIP paedophile ring,' say police|work=The Independent|date=26 November 2014|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of Elm Guest House, along with the known predatory activities of the individuals involved there have led to media speculation that Martin and another boy, eight-year-old [[Death of Vishal Mehrotra|Vishal Mehotra]] could have been abducted (and later murdered) by paedophiles active at the guest house around that time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-failings-put-dozens-of-children-at-risk-from-notorious-paedophile-ring-8518522.html "Police failings put dozens of children at risk from notorious pedophile gang", ''Independent'', 3 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015 [[Operation Midland]] officers told Kevin to “prepare for the worst” as they had “credible evidence” from a VIP gang survivor that Martin had been murdered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operation Midland interviewed a man known only as 'Nick' who alleged that he saw three boys being murdered by the paedophile network, one was run over, another strangled by a Conservative MP and the third killed in front of a government minister.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 'Nick' told police that former [[Tory]] MP [[Harvey Proctor]] had been responsible for two of the murders and had been implicated in the third.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Proctor denied any and all allegations and did not recognise an [[E-FIT]] photograph of the boy when questioned.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/12149260/Detectives-did-not-put-name-of-boy-allegedly-murdered-by-VIP-paedophile-ring-to-only-suspect.html|title=Detectives did not put name of boy allegedly murdered by VIP paedophile ring to only suspect|work=Daily Telegraph|date=9 February 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations were proved false and 'Nick' was proved to be a fantasist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lord-janners-son-ready-to-prosecute-sex-accuser-nick-ptxnzkwd0|title=Lord Janner’s son ready to prosecute sex accuser ‘Nick’|last=Gillespie|first=James|date=2018-04-29|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015 it was announced by the police that some of the lost evidence had been rediscovered.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/vip-paedophile-murders-lost-files-5460260|title=VIP paedophile murders: 'Lost' files about missing teenage boy are uncovered|last=Hale|first=Don|date=2015-04-04|work=mirror|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 Operation Malswick superseded Operation Midland and was formed specifically to re-investigate Martin Allen's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cops-quiz-child-killer-sidney-8019844|title=Cops quiz child killer Sidney Cooke as they reopen case of missing boy|work=Daily Mirror|date=21 May 2016|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dmitry Baksheev '''(born January 28, 1982) and '''Natalia Baksheeva '''(born January 25, 1975), are family from [[Krasnodar]] who were accused of killing a local woman. According to rumors, the Baksheevs are also responsible for a series of murders and [[Human cannibalism|cannibalistic acts]]. At the moment, the [[Investigative Committee of Russia]] is verifying the couple's involvement in other crimes that have occurred in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://sledcom.ru/news/item/1166820/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Dmitry was born in 1982, and Natalia in 1975. Natalia worked for some time as a senior nurse in the sanitation department of the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School of AK Serov pilots, but was dismissed due to [[chronic alcoholism]]. Dmitry had been tried for robbery and car theft, but by the time of the murder, all of his convictions had been extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;https://ria.ru/incidents/20170928/1505775256.html&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as an apartment repairman and a general worker. The Baksheevs had lived together since 2012 in a school dormitory, the room being inherited by Natalia from her previous husband. The couple led an antisocial lifestyle.

The Baksheevs' crimes were discovered by accident: Dmitry lost his mobile phone, on which there pictures of him with human remains, even holding a severed human hand in one of them. The phone was later found by road workers and immediately reported to the police. At the interrogation he claimed that he had found the remains in the bushes, but later confessed to killing a woman.

As the investigation later found out, the victim of the Baksheevs was a resident of Krasnodar, Elena Vakhrusheva (born March 5, 1982 in [[Omutninsk]]). The murder occurred on September 8 during a joint alcohol drinking session, when a sudden quarrel began between Natalia and Elena. Natalia then told her husband to kill her rival, also actively participating in the murder herself. Elena died as a result of multiple stab wounds.&lt;ref&gt;https://ria.ru/incidents/20170928/1505784362.html&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Baksheevs dismembered the corpse, keeping some of the remains in their home, and throwing away others in the surrounding area.

During the investigation into the activities in the Baksheev household, fragments of a human body in [[saline solution]], food and frozen meat parts of unknown origin were found. In the basement of the house and the adjoining territory, the remains of the deceased's body were found and seized, while the food and frozen meat fragments were sent for examination.

Initially, the criminal case was initiated with a murder charge, but the Baksheevs were later charged with group murder. The case was referred to the first department for investigation of special importance.&lt;ref&gt;http://kuban.sledcom.ru/news/item/1166808/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, Vadim Bugaenko, the head of the Investigative Department of the Russian Democratic Republic for the [[Krasnodar Krai]], told reporters that the remains found in the Baksheevs' apartment belonged to one person.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interfax-russia.ru/South/news.asp?id=873404&amp;sec=1671&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a procedural check was initiated on the fact of leaked photos from Dmitry's phone, which led to speculations about the family of serial killer-cannibals that operated in the city.

== Rumors and speculation ==
The story quickly overgrew with rumors, according to which the couple had started hunting people since 1999. The cannibals tortured their victims before killing them, and made various dishes from the corpses, keeping the remains canned. According to initial reports, Natalia allegedly supplied the canned food with human meat to the school where she worked at.&lt;ref&gt;https://life.ru/t/новости/1046359/siemia_krasnodarskikh_kannibalov_priznalas_v_ubiistvie_30_chieloviek&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was suggested that the Baksheevs distributed such canned food to the Krasnodar catering establishments, but these rumors were quickly refuted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2936753&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the media published a rumor that Dmitry Baksheev allegedly confessed to a murder committed in 2012, and Natalia - to 30 murders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1933141&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Investigative Committee stated several times that they had no such data on a series of murders for cannibalism by a married couple, and that in the Baksheev case there was only one murder. Finally, it was also rumored that during the search of the Baksheevs' apartment, 19 pieces of human skin, 7 body parts, photos of eerie dishes, canned food with human meat, including mammary glands, and even cooking recipes for humans were seized.&lt;ref&gt;https://lenta.ru/news/2017/09/25/cannibal/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interfax-russia.ru/South/news.asp?id=873390&amp;sec=1671&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[United Kingdom|British]] doctor Ian Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/misc/jambik.html|title=The world's biggest boy|date=8 October 2013|access-date=16 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102111253/http://mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/misc/jambik.html|archive-date=2 November 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the world's leading experts in obesity, visited Dzhambik and performed a series of tests on him at a [[Moscow]] clinic where he is treated every year for his [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="NMN" /&gt; The tests showed that 9 year old Dzhambik's bones were the size of an average 13-year-old boy. He was also tested for [[anabolic steroids]], which can cause abnormal bone growth, but the results were negative. As shown on an episode of ''Body Shock'', Campbell and other health care professionals urged Dzambik's mother to help the boy eat a better diet and lose weight to improve his health, but Nelya rejected their advice and insisted the boy was healthy and capable of becoming a [[sumo]] wrestler or other sportsman. In 2006, journalist Nick Patton Walsh wrote in ''The Guardian'' that Nelya demanded money in order for him to meet Dzambik; Walsh hestitated as such payments were against ''Guardian'' policy but eventually relented, paying £160 or about 8000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/26/russia.health|title=I like to be big|date=26 May 2006|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dzhambik's size has earned him the nickname [[Sosruko]] after an ancient hero from local mythology. Sosruko was a giant, a fierce warrior who protected his people and embodied qualities people in the [[Caucasus]] greatly respect: strength and size. According to Nelya Kabardarkova, her son's grandfather was also known as a [[Bogatyr]], a Russian word for a sort of gentle giant.

Dzhambik has appeared on many Russian TV Shows, but gained world recognition through the UK Channel 4 series [[BodyShock]] in the episode "''World's Biggest Boy''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/bodyshock/episode-guide/series-7/episode-1|title=World's biggest boy|date=26 November 2008|accessdate=25 January 2010|publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aired on many TV channels around the world.

'''Fernando Armindo Lugo Méndez''' ({{IPA-es|feɾˈnando aɾˈmindo ˈluɣo ˈmendes}}; born 30 May 1951) is a Paraguayan politician who was [[President of Paraguay]] from 2008 to 2012. Previously he was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] priest and bishop, serving as Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Pedro|Diocese of San Pedro]] from 1994 to 2005. He was elected as president in 2008, an election that ended 61 years of rule by the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]].

In 2012, he was removed from office through [[Impeachment of Fernando Lugo|an impeachment process]] that neighboring countries deemed a coup d'état.&lt;ref name="csmonitor1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2012/0624/Does-Paraguay-risk-pariah-status-with-president-s-ouster|title=Does Paraguay risk pariah status with president's ouster?|first=Peter|last=Orsi|agency=Associated Press|date=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Senate of Paraguay]] in the [[Paraguayan general election, 2013|2013 general elections]].&lt;ref name="telesurtv1985"&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/articulos/2013/04/22/partido-colorado-se-afianzo-como-primera-fuerza-politica-en-paraguay-1985.html Partido Colorado se alzó como primera fuerza política en Paraguay — teleSUR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frenteguasu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frenteguasu.org.py/el-fg-no-defraudara-la-confianza-del-pueblo-afirma-lugo |title=Frente Guasu |work=frenteguasu.org.py |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503223008/http://frenteguasu.org.py/el-fg-no-defraudara-la-confianza-del-pueblo-afirma-lugo |archivedate=3 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He received his basic education at a religious school in [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]], and sold snacks on the streets.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

His family was not particularly religious; by his own account, he never saw his father set foot in a church.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, they were active in [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] politics. His maternal uncle, [[Epifanio Méndez Fleitas]], was a co-conspirator in the [[1954 Paraguayan coup d'etat]] that helped bring [[Alfredo Stroessner]] to power. However, he later fell out of favor with Stroessner and ultimately left the country. Fernando's father was imprisoned twenty times, and some of his elder siblings were sent into so-called exile.

==Priesthood==
His father wanted Lugo to become a lawyer, but at 18 Lugo entered a [[normal school]], and began teaching in a rural community. He was well accepted by the community, which was very religious, but they had no priest. He said later that he was touched by that experience, and so discovered his [[vocation]] to the Roman Catholic priesthood. At age 19 he entered a seminary operated by the [[Society of the Divine Word]]. He was ordained a priest for the society on 15 August 1977. He was sent to [[Ecuador]], where he served as a missionary for five years. In Ecuador he learned about [[liberation theology]].

Lugo returned to Paraguay in 1982, and after a year, was sent to Rome for further academic studies.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Lugo came back to Paraguay in 1987, two years before the Stroessner dictatorship's fall. Lugo was ordained a bishop on 17 April 1994, and received charge of the nation's poorest [[diocese]], in the [[San Pedro Department, Paraguay|San Pedro diocese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasildefato.com.br/v01/agencia/entrevistas/fernando-lugo-trajetoria-pessoal "Interview with Fernando Lugo, by César Sanson for Agência Brasil de Fato"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329062800/http://www.brasildefato.com.br/v01/agencia/entrevistas/fernando-lugo-trajetoria-pessoal |date=29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugo resigned his [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] from the Diocese of San Pedro on 11 January 2005. He had requested [[laicization]] in order to run for office. However, the [[Holy See]] refused the request on the grounds that bishops could not undergo laicization, and also denied him the requested canonical permission to run for civil elected office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopal.org.py/comunicados/segundanotaalugo.htm Article regarding Lugo's laicization (in Spanish)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215114304/http://www.episcopal.org.py/comunicados/segundanotaalugo.htm |date=15 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Lugo won the presidential election, the Church granted his laicization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=59958 |title=Paraguay's president, ex-bishop, granted lay status |publisher=[[Catholic World News]] |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

{{quote|Without doubt it is possible to resurrect a country like Paraguay. We are people of hope, of faith, and I won't be the one killing that hope of the people. I do believe we will resurrect this country, a country deeply drowned in misery, poverty and discrimination. Because I do believe Paraguay could be different. I do not lack faith in this flock. Where there is a scream coming from the poor people, where there is sweat, where people are shoeless, we will be there. Because in such people there is a resurrection; if that exists there, then there is resurrection for Paraguay.|Fernando Lugo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial&amp;id=691&amp;catID=1 "Rise of the Red Bishop"], The Guardian Weekly, 14 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lugo jumped to the national arena by backing peasant claims for better land distribution. During 2006, opinion polls published by ''[[Diario ABC Color]]'' newspaper showed him as a possible choice for the opposition's presidential candidacy. Known as "the bishop of the poor", Lugo was seen in subsequent months as the most serious threat to the dominance of the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] on Paraguayan politics. Although he said he found the presidency of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela interesting, he made a point to distance himself from leftist leaders in Latin America, focusing more on social inequality in Paraguay.
On 23 February 2007, a ''[[Prensa Latina]]'' article noted that the Paraguayan Interior Ministry offered Lugo protection because of the death threats he received during the course of his political activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID={754FE77C-C350-4C2C-B5F8-41779C905010})&amp;language=EN |title=Noticias de Prensa Latina – Home |publisher=Plenglish.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301064219/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B754FE77C-C350-4C2C-B5F8-41779C905010%7D%29&amp;language=EN |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential candidacy===

According to a poll in February 2007, he was the leading contender in the [[Paraguayan general election, 2008|April 2008 presidential election]], with more than 37% of the voters' intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/14863 |title=Angus Reid Consultants |publisher=Angus-reid.com |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303093828/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/14863 |archivedate=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2007, he registered as member of the small Christian Democratic Party of Paraguay (CDP), which allowed him to file as a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/articulos.php?pid=368460|publisher=ABC Digital|date=31 May 2008|title=El ex obispo Fernando Lugo se afilió al Partido Demócrata Cristiano|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDP became the core of the [[Patriotic Alliance for Change]], a coalition of more than a dozen opposition parties and social movements which backed Lugo for President. [[Federico Franco]] of the [[Authentic Radical Liberal Party]], Paraguay's largest opposition party, was the candidate for Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1484375-federico-franco-sera-el-nuevo-presidente-paraguayo|title=¿Quién es Federico Franco, el nuevo presidente paraguayo?|trans-title=Who is Federico Franco, the new Paraguayan president?|language=Spanish|date=22 June 2012|publisher=[[La Nación]]|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality of Lugo's candidacy was questioned, because Article 235 of the Constitution forbids clerics of any religious denomination to hold elective office, and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] had rejected Lugo's resignation from the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.com.py/articulos.php?pid=388865 "Impugnación de Lugo será tratada por el comité ejecutivo de la ANR"], abc.com.py {{es icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, on 16 November 2007, President [[Nicanor Duarte Frutos]] (also Chairman of the Colorado Party) announced that the Party would not object to Lugo's candidacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=54823 |title=Suspended bishop cleared as presidential candidate in Paraguay |publisher=[[Catholic World News]]|date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, the Pope laicized Lugo, which made the question moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/world/americas/31brief04.html|title=Paraguay: Special Dispensation for President-Elect|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President===
On 20 April 2008, Lugo won the election by a margin of 10%, gaining a 42.3% vote share. The Colorado Party candidate, [[Blanca Ovelar]], acknowledged that Lugo had an unassailable lead and conceded the race that same night at about 9&amp;nbsp;pm local time. Two hours later, President Duarte acknowledged that the Colorados had lost an election for the first time in 61 years. Lugo's swearing in marked the first time in Paraguay's history (the country gained independence in 1811) that a ruling party peacefully surrendered power to an elected member from the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimahora.com/notas/109808-Nicanor-reconoce-la-derrota-del-Partido-Colorado|title=Nicanor reconoce la derrota del Partido Colorado|work=ultimahora}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Paraguay's second leftist president (the first being [[Rafael Franco]], who served from 1936 to 1937), and the first to be freely elected.

Lugo was sworn in as President on 15 August 2008, saying he would not accept the presidential salary because it "belongs to more humble people" and encouraged other politicians to refuse their salaries as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hqFLYrBs7ry_miqB_KSjyiqy2J_Q "Latin America's left wing swells with new Paraguay president"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302142123/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hqFLYrBs7ry_miqB_KSjyiqy2J_Q |date=2 March 2009 }}, AFP, 15 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He initially named [[Alejandro Hamed]] as his foreign minister. During the campaign, Lugo had suggested that he would switch diplomatic relations from the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) to the People's Republic of China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fernando Lugo Méndez|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/fernando_lugo_mendez/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=Fernando%20Lugo&amp;st=cse|work=topics.nytimes.com|date=29 March 2009|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby depriving the ROC of its last diplomatic ally in South America. However, after the inauguration, which had been attended by President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] from Taiwan, Lugo stated that he had no plans to switch recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/1523297/taiwan_president_attends_inauguration_of_paraguayan_president/index.html|title=View|publisher=redOrbit|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August 2008, Lugo named [[Margarita Mbywangi]], a member of the [[Aché]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] ethnic group, as secretary of indigenous affairs, the first indigenous person to hold such a position in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/8/19/inauguration_of_paraguays_new_president_fernando|title=The Bishop of the Poor: Paraguay's New President Fernando Lugo Ends 62 Years of Conservative Rule|publisher=Democracynow.org|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the main promises of Lugo's presidential campaign were tackling corruption and encouraging land reform. A number of initiatives were introduced to improve the lives of Paraguay's poor, such as investments in low-income housing,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rabobank.com/content/images/Paraguay-201101_tcm43-105909.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of free treatment in public hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=44857 |title=PARAGUAY: Mixed Results for Lugo's First 100 Days – IPS |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005044658/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=44857 |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bti-project.org/countryreports/lac/pry/2012/#chap10]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of cash transfers for Paraguay's most impoverished citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13579202?story_id=13579202|work=The Economist|title=The boy and the bishop|date=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impeachment===
{{Main|Impeachment of Fernando Lugo}}
On 15 June 2012, seventeen people were killed in a clash between landless farmers and the police who were trying to evict them; some sources consider that all this was taken as a pretext to expel Lugo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brecha.com.uy/inicio/item/10537-el-golpe-anunciado |title=The announced coup |date=22 June 2012 |publisher=[[Brecha (Montevideo)]] |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630070707/http://www.brecha.com.uy/inicio/item/10537-el-golpe-anunciado |archivedate=30 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay|Chamber of Deputies]] cited this event as well as insecurity, nepotism and a controversial land purchase to vote 76 to 1 to [[impeachment|impeach]] Lugo on 21 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/21/world/americas/paraguay-president/index.html "Paraguay president faces impeachment after deadly clash"], Mariano Castillo, CNN, 21 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Senate of Paraguay|Senate]] took up the case the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18535552 "Paraguay's President Fernando Lugo faces impeachment"], BBC, 21 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The impeachment was attended by a delegation of Foreign Affairs ministers from the other nations of the [[Union of South American Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/06/21/unasur-delegation-travels-to-paraguay-to-ensure-democratic-system-integrity|title=Unasur delegation travels to Paraguay to ensure 'democratic system integrity'|date=21 June 2012|publisher=Mercopress|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote ended with 39 votes for Lugo's removal and four for his continuity, which ended his mandate and turned [[Federico Franco]] into the new president of Paraguay.&lt;ref name="Mercopress"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/06/22/institutional-coup-removes-paraguayan-president-lugo-from-office|title='Institutional coup' removes Paraguayan president Lugo from office|date=22 June 2012|publisher=Merco Press|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lugo announced that he would denounce the case to the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], stating that the time to prepare a legal defence, just two hours, may be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1484248-lugo-se-juega-su-mandato-en-un-sorpresivo-y-veloz-juicio-politico|title=Paraguay: el Congreso destituyó al presidente Lugo|trans-title=Paraguay: the Congress deposed president Lugo|language=Spanish|date=22 June 2012|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of Lugo was followed by demonstrations by his supporters.&lt;ref name="Mercopress"/&gt;

The presidents of Paraguay's neighbouring countries rejected Lugo's removal from office, and compared it to a coup d'état. Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]] proposed suspending Paraguay's membership in [[Mercosur]] and the [[Union of South American Nations]]. [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] of Argentina, [[Rafael Correa]] of Ecuador and [[Leonel Fernández]] of the Dominican Republic announced that they would not recognize Franco as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1484357-unasur-y-mercosur-tomaria-medidas-severas-ante-la-remocion-de-lugo|title=Argentina 'no convalidará el golpe en Paraguay' mientras que Brasil sugirió que quedaría fuera de la Unasur y el Mercosur|trans-title=Argentina 'will not support the coup in Paraguay' and Brazil suggested that it would be left out of Unasur and Mercosur|language=Spanish|date=22 June 2012|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condemnation also came from more conservative governments in the region, such as [[Colombia]] and [[Chile]]. Lugo's removal has drawn comparisons to the ouster of [[Honduras]]' [[Manuel Zelaya]] in 2009; like the ouster of Lugo it was defended as legal and constitutional by its supporters while being denounced as a coup across the Latin American political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/04/20/paraguay-likely-to-return-long-dominant-conservative-party-after-brush-with.html|title=Paraguay likely to return long-dominant conservative party after brush with leftist bishop|agency=Associated Press|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor1"/&gt;

Lugo himself accepted his ouster, saying that any legal and realistic chance of reinstating him ended when the [[Supreme Court of Paraguay]] declared his impeachment and confirmed his removal, and the electoral court recognized Franco as the new president.  However, he denounced it as "a congressional coup."&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;[[Reuters]], 26 June 2012, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/26/us-paraguay-lugo-idUSBRE85P1BQ20120626 Paraguay's Lugo says only miracle can reinstate him]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senatorial candidacy===
In the [[Paraguayan general election, 2013|2013 election]] to replace his interim presidential replacement Lugo ran as a senate candidate.&lt;ref name=AlJazeera/&gt; He was elected as member of Paraguayan Senate representing left-wing coalition [[Guasú Front|Frente Guasú]].&lt;ref name="telesurtv1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frenteguasu1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
As Lugo was unmarried during his presidency, he designated his elder sister, Mercedes Lugo, as [[First Lady of Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/13746-lugo-nombra-primera-dama-su-hermana/|title=Lugo nombra "primera dama" a su hermana|work=El Nuevo Diario|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Lugo was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]. He continued his duties as president of Paraguay while undergoing treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10900677|title=BBC News: Paraguay President Fernando Lugo diagnosed with cancer|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also studied at Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Children===
Lugo fathered several children out of wedlock&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paraguay prez sex scandal widens|url=http://www.upi.com/Paraguay-prez-sex-scandal-widens/40201240461503/|accessdate=2 April 2017|work=UPI|date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including one that was allegedly the result of sexual assault.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paraguay president accused of sex attack|url=http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-world/paraguay-president-accused-of-sex-attack-20090624-cvra.html|accessdate=2 April 2017|work=Sydney Morning  Herald|date=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he conceived one child with a sixteen-year-old girl (Paraguay's [[age of consent]] is 14&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web|url= http://www.glin.gov/view.action?searchDetails.queryType=ALL&amp;newSubjectTerm=&amp;searchDetails.subjectTerms=&amp;searchDetails.queryString=C%C3%B3digo+Penal+de+Paraguay&amp;searchDetails.showSummary=true&amp;searchDetails.publicationJurisdiction=&amp;__checkbox_searchDetails.showSummary=true&amp;searchDetails.issuanceDateToday=01&amp;searchDetails.publicationDateTo=&amp;searchDetails.publicationDateToday=01&amp;searchDetails.sortOrder=rank&amp;searchDetails.issuanceDateFromday=01&amp;searchDetails.issuanceDateFrom=&amp;searchDetails.issuanceDateFromyear=&amp;month=01&amp;month=01&amp;month=01&amp;month=01&amp;search=Buscar&amp;searchDetails.andSubjectTerms=true&amp;searchDetails.publicationDateFromday=01&amp;searchDetails.publicationDateFrom=&amp;request_locale=es&amp;searchDetails.publicationLanguage=&amp;fieldName=&amp;searchDetails.publicationDateToyear=&amp;searchDetails.publicationJurisdictionExclude=false&amp;searchDetails.includeAllFields=true&amp;popupSearch=false&amp;searchDetails.issuanceDateToyear=&amp;searchDetails.summaryLanguage=%27%27&amp;searchDetails.searchAll=true&amp;searchDetails.publicationDateFromyear=&amp;searchDetails.issuanceDateTo=&amp;searchDetails.activeDrills=&amp;searchDetails.hitsPerPage=10&amp;glinID=209226&amp;summaryLang=es&amp;fromSearch=true |title=GLIN.gov – Changes introduced by Law 3440/2008 }} (click on PDF file in “texto completo”)&lt;/ref&gt;) while he was a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paraguayan president admits he fathered child while he was a Catholic bishop|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/14/paraguay-fernando-lugo-catholic-bishop|accessdate=2 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorris|first1=Barbara|title=Ex-bishop admits fathering child; Sex abuse victims respond|url=http://www.snapnetwork.org/snap_statements/2009_statements/041309_ex_bishop_admits_fathering_child_sex_abuse_victims_respond.htm|accessdate=2 April 2017|agency=The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests|date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Antonio Laureana''' (born 1952 in [[Corrientes]] - died in [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires|San Isidro]] on February 27, 1975) was a young [[Argentines|Argentine]] killed by the [[Buenos Aires]] police, who believed him to be a rapist and [[serial killer]] called the "Satyr of San Isidro", who for a period of six months - from 1974 and 1975 - raped 15 women, of whom he murdered 13. He killed most of victims on Wednesdays and Thursdays near 6:00 P.M.

== Crimes ==
The police reconstructed the events based on what they believed to be a series of murders and the psychological profile of the murderer. Francisco Laureana, 22, had been an intern in a Catholic school in the city of Corrientes in northern Argentina.&lt;ref name="El_Identikit"&gt;Palacios, Rodolfo (2010): [http://elidentikit.com/2010/11/francisco-antonio-laureana-el-asesino-puntual "Francisco Antonio Laureana: the punctual killer"], article from November 15, 2010 in the El Identikit website. It shows a photograph of the identikit of Laureana, and two photographs from his autopsy).&lt;/ref&gt;
The police claimed that Laureana had fled Corrientes because he had raped and hanged a nun from the stairs of the school.&lt;ref name="El_Identikit" /&gt; In July 1974, he moved to the city of San Isidro (in the north of the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]), where he worked as an artisan selling hoops, bracelets and necklaces. He married a woman who had three children.&lt;ref name="El_Identikit" /&gt;

Before going to work, he would say to his wife: "Do not let the kids outside because there are many degenerates."

Almost every Wednesday and Thursday, about 6 o'clock in the evening, a woman or girl disappeared in the city. Their bodies were found shortly afterward in vacant lots, with signs of having been raped and killed savagely. Some victims were strangled and others shot with a .32 caliber revolver.
The victims were mainly women who sunbathed in nearby villas or who waited at bus stops. The "satyr" always stole something from his victims, such as rings, bracelets, chains, etc., which he kept as trophies in a boot at home. Sometimes he would return to the crime scene weeks later to relive the experience.

Due to the repeated [[modus operandi]], police and forensics expert Osvaldo Raffo believed that the deaths could be the work of a single individual.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, Rodolfo (2007): [http://www.perfil.com/sociedad/El-Canibal-al-que-se-lo-comio-la-tierra--20070509-0033.html "A serial killer who attacked in 1972: the ‘Cannibal’ who ate the land"], article from May 9, 2007 in the Buenos Aires newspaper "Profile." The article refers to another serial killer, but at the end tells the story of the "Satyr of San Isidro."&lt;/ref&gt;

After committing one of his homicides, a witness saw the perpetrator fleeing on the roof of a house, but he was shot at with a gun. Said witness was unharmed and was key to making an identikit of the suspect that began to circulate around the city.&lt;ref name="Gaceta_Mercantil"&gt;A journalistic note claims that the three children belonged to him, and that he had been married twelve and a half years. Ungaro, Martín: [http://www.gacetamercantil.com/notas/60721/el-caso-del-predador-san-isidro.html "The case of the San Isidro predator"] article from September 8, 2014 in the newspaper "Gaceta Mercantil.”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On Thursday, February 27, 1975, an eight-year-old girl saw Francisco Laureana and thought he looked like the serial killer. After telling her mother, the woman pretended to call her husband but notified the authorities. Laureana passed by, smiled, and continued on.

The police found him a few blocks away and because his characteristics were similar to the idenkit's, they approached the suspect, asking him to accompany them for an interrogation. According to the police report, Laureana then took a gun from his shoulder bag and started firing at the officers, initiating a shootout in which he was shot in the shoulder. The badly injured Laureana escaped, hiding from the police in a chicken coop near a mansion. However, a dog "marked" Laureana's hiding place to its owner, prompting the police to approach the coop and pepper Laureana with bullets.

The authorities regretted killing him, as they wanted to interrogate him about his motives for committing murders. Two hens were found dead in the coop (it is unknown if the police or Laureana with his violent urges killed them). When his wife was informed, she said that "There must have been a mistake. My husband could not have done all that. He was a good father, a good husband, and a craftsman who loved what he did."&lt;ref&gt;Kablan, Pablo (2014): [http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/notas/182535-francisco-laureana-el-serial-san-isidro "Francisco Laureana, the serial of San Isidor"], article from February 2, 2014 in the "Diario Popular."&lt;/ref&gt;

As the killer was a fetishist, many of his crimes were solved when the police found the boot in which the victims' items were stashed, along with firearms.

The case of Francisco Antonio Laureana, one of the most prolific murderers in Argentine history, went relatively unnoticed due to the complex political climate during the government of [[Isabel Perón]].

Landis was a fellow of the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] ("NIAC"), where he worked on a project investigating the use of laser- and particle-beam pushed [[Solar sail|sails]] for propulsion for [[interstellar propulsion|interstellar flight]].&lt;ref name="niac"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/4Landis.html |title=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase I studies |work=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts |location=Atlanta, Georgia |accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Landis addressed the annual convention of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] on the possibilities and challenges of interstellar travel in what was described as the "first serious discussion of how mankind will one day set sail to the nearest star". Dr. Landis said, "This is the first meeting to really consider interstellar travel by humans. It is historic. We're going to the stars. There really isn't a choice in the long term." He went on to describe a star ship with a diamond sail, a few [[nanometres]] thick, powered by solar energy, which could achieve "10 per cent of the speed of light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1385077/Reach-for-the-stars-on-a-beam-of-light.html |title=Reach for the stars on a beam of light |work=Daily Telegraph |location=London |publisher=Telegraph Media Group|last=Highfield|first=Roger|date=February 16, 2002 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Film director|Dr.]] Gregorio Montenemayor-Fernández''' (May 25, 1904 – March 11, 1973) also known as '''Gregorio Fernandez''' was a film actor and director, and father of [[Rudy Fernandez (actor)|Rudy Fernandez]].&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.inquirer.net/13881/gregorio-fernandez-neglected-film-master&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.inquirer.net/2403/daboy%E2%80%99s-son-celebrates-lolo-yoyong%E2%80%99s-legacy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
'''Dr. Gregorio Montemayor-Fernández''' was born in [[Lubao, Pampanga]] on May 25, 1904 to Eugenio Fernández y Araneta and Maria Montemayor. Yoyong practically grew up in the town with a rich Zarzuela tradition that exposed him early to the performance arts.

==Personal life==
His wife, Pilar is a member of the showbiz clan of Padilla whose relative include [[Rommel Padilla]], [[Rustom Padilla]], [[Robin Padilla]]. A physician. Grandfather of [[Mark Anthony Fernandez]], Rap Fernandez and [[Renz Fernandez]]. Father-in-law of [[Lorna Tolentino]]. And father of [[Rudy Fernandez (actor)|Rudy Fernandez]].

==Educational life==
He spent his primary years at the Lubao Elementary School, then enrolled at the Pampanga High School (1921–25). Choosing to be a dental surgeon, he went to the Philippine Dental College. To help finance his studies, he worked at as a tax agent for the Bureau of Internal Revenue. He also started making the rounds of production companies and became an actor for Tomas Lichauco's Mayon Photoplay Corporation after auditioning in March 1928.

==Career==
The movie with Mayon was never finished as Lichauco left for the United States. Undaunted, Yoyong auditioned next for Jose Nepomuceno and won a leading role in a 1928 film. The silent film, “Anak sa Ligaw” started his long and productive career in Philippine moviedom, both as a successful actor and an even more accomplished film director.

Yoyong still managed to make his parents happy by finishing his dentistry course in 1929 and passing the board that same year. After a short private practice in Lubao, he decided he could not resist the lure of the spotlight and went on to pursue a full-time career in acting. He did not find it difficult landing his next role given the resounding success of his first film. Yoyong's next assignment was a starring role in another silent-- “Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow” with Sofia Lotta, under the direction Faustino Lichauco of Mayon Photoplay. The picture was never released though, so Yoyong moved on to team up with Sofia yet again in the movie version of the popular Tagalog poem of Florentino Collantes, “Ang Lumang Simbahan”.

The newbie actor shared his good fortune with his kabalen and nephew, Rogelio Regidor, whom he introduced to Jose Nepomuceno when the “father of Philippine movies” was scouting for new talents. Nepomuceno took one look at the handsome 6-footer and cast him with another Kapampangan-American mestiza, Rosa Stagner. The couple was launched in the 1929 movie hit, “Ligaw ni Bulaklak” as Rogelio de la Rosa and Rosa del Rosario.

Yoyong was a much-sought after actor in the 1930s, appearing as a dandy in the film, “Collegian Love”. As a young sajonista influenced by American ways, he wore a blazer with a hanky sticking out of his pocket, and a white buntal hat that was to become his [[trademark look|signature look]]. He appeared as the hero “Dimasalang” in 1930 and followed that up with “Moro Pirates” with Nena Linda. In the next two years, he was in “Ang Lihim ni Bathala” and “Taong Demonyo”, his first talking film.

Not content with playing leading men and character roles in films, Gregorio transitioned to work behind the camera as a director. His first directorial debut was the movie, “Asahar at Kabaong” (Bridal Garland and Casket, 1937), starring Purita Santamaria, made under Philippine Films. His work was noticed by other film outfits and he steadily found freelance work, directing “Tatlong Pagkabirhen” for X’otic Films (1938), “Celia at Balagtas” and “Señorita” (1939), in which he directed his own nephew Rogelio de la Rosa, by then a big star. It was only shown shortly after World War II at the Life Theater in Quiapo.

Yoyong had an enduring and most productive career at LVN Studios, a film outfit began in 1938 by the legendary grand dame of Philippine movies, Dña. Narcisa de Leon. Dña. Sisang asked Yoyong to make a film out of the hit war drama play, “Garrison 13”, and the subsequent film version (in which he played a co-starring role to Linda Estrella) proved to be a blockbuster hit, earning an unprecedented P145,000 at Dalisay Theater alone. Yoyong became a favorite director of Dña. Sisang thereafter.

His LVN-produced films include “Dalawang Daigdig” ( as director-actor, 1946), “Miss Philippines" (1947), “Puting Bantayog” (1948), “Kampanang Ginto”, “Capas” (1949), “Candaba” (“isang kapanapanabik na pelikula na tanging si G. Fernandez lamang ang maaaring mamahala!”), "Kontrabando” (1950), “Bayan o Pag-ibig”, “Dugo sa Dugo” (1951), “[[Rodrigo de Villa]]” (a color film co-produced with Persari Films of Indonesia, 1952), “Iskwater”, “Philippine Navy”, “Dagohoy” (1953) and “Prinsipe Tiñoso”, “Singsing na Tanso” (1954).

1955 was his best year ever, directing “Dalagang Taring” and the most acclaimed movie of the year, “Higit sa Lahat”, starring Rogelio de la Rosa and Emma Alegre. It garnered 6 awards at the FAMAS, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director. As the Philippine entry to the 1956 [[Asia-Pacific Film Festival|Southeast Asian Film Festival]], “Higit sa Lahat” won for Yoyong a “Best Director” trophy and another “Best Actor” award for Rogelio de la Rosa.&lt;ref&gt;HOURS OF WATER. (1956, Jun 17). South China Sunday Post - Herald&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he was kept busy with the 18th anniversary offering of LVN Pictures, “Medalyang Perlas” and the classic, “Luksang Tagumpay”, which won Best Picture honors at the FAMAS.

The close of the decade saw him megging “Hukom Roldan”, “P10,000 na Pag-ibig”(1957), “Ana Maria” and another critical hit “Malvarosa” (1958). The film won for Rebecca del Rio, a Best Supporting Actress trophy at the Asian Film Festival and a FAMAS International Prestige Award of Merit. He ended the 50s with “Ay , Pepita”, “Casa Grande” and “Panagimpan” (1959) and started the 60s with “Emily” and “Kung Ako’y Mahal Mo” and “Awit ng mga Dukha”.

In 1961, he retired in San Juan together with his family. He had eight children with his beautiful wife, Marie Paz, daughter of Bulacan governor Jose Padilla Sr. whom he married in 1936 in Lubao: Ma. Luisa (aka Merle Fernandez, bold star of the 70s), Maria Paz, Maria Isabel, Jose, Maria Teresita, Emmanuel, Rodolfo (aka the late Rudy “Daboy” Fernandez) and Mary Anne. But he came out of retirement in 1963 to direct “The Macapagal Story”, based on the life of his fellow Lubeño Pres. Diosdado P. Macapagal. He did two more movies (“Ang Nasasakdal”, 1963, “Daing” 1971) before he permanently called it quits, but not before being awarded the 1967 “Gantimpalang Gatpuno” (Mayor’s Award) as one of the 37 illustrious pioneers of Philippine Movies, on the occasion of Manila’s golden foundation day.

Dr. Gregorio M. Fernandez died in the late 1970s and left behind a legacy of classic and multi-awarded films, visual testaments to Kapampangan creativity at its best. His son Rudy continued that tradition until his death, but the torch has been passed on to Rudy's son (with Alma Moreno, also a Kapampangan), Mark Anthony Fernandez, himself a rising star of TV and Cinema. His grandfather Yoyong must be proud.

==Death==
Dr. Gregorio Fernandez died on March 11, 1973 due to heart attack in [[Quezon City]]. He was buried to his hometown in [[Lubao, Pampanga]]. 35 years before his son [[Rudy Fernandez (actor)|Rudy Fernandez]] was buried at [[The Heritage Park]] in [[Taguig City]] on June 7, 2008.

[[File:Handsome Lake Preaching at Tonawanda.tif|thumb|right|Handsome Lake Preaching at Tonawanda by [[Jesse Cornplanter]]]]
'''Handsome Lake''' ([[Cayuga language]]: '''Sganyadái:yo''', [[Seneca language]]: '''Sganyodaiyo''') ('''Θkanyatararí•yau•'''&lt;ref&gt;Rudes, B. ''Tuscarora English Dictionary'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]]) (1735 – 10 August 1815) was a [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] religious leader of the [[Iroquois]] people. He was a half-brother to [[Cornplanter]], a Seneca war chief.&lt;ref name=Indians&gt;{{cite book|last = Wallace | first = Paul A. W.|last2=Hunter |first2=William A.

|quote='A Seneca chief of the Turtle Clan, half brother of Cornplanter.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handsome Lake, a leader and prophet, played a major role in reviving traditional religion among the Haudenosaunee (People of the Longhouse), or Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy. He preached a message that combined traditional Haudenosaunee religious beliefs with a revised code meant to revive traditional consciousness to the Haudenosaunee after a long period of cultural disintegration following colonization. This message was eventually published as the "[[Code of Handsome Lake]]" and is still practiced today.

==Early life==
Handsome Lake was born as Hadawa'ko ("Shaking Snow") around 1735 in the Seneca village of [[Canawaugus, New York|Canawaugus]], on the [[Genesee River]] near present-day [[Avon (village), New York|Avon, New York]]. Very little is known of his parents; his mother, Gahonnoneh, later had an [[affair]] with a Dutch fur trader and gunsmith, resulting in the birth of Handsome Lake's half-brother, [[Cornplanter]]. Handsome Lake was born into the Turtle [[clan]] of his mother, as the Iroquois have a [[matrilineal]] kinship system. He was eventually adopted and raised by the Wolf clan people.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker |first1=Arthur C.|title=The Code of Handsome Lake, the Seneca Prophet|journal=[NYS] Education Department Bulletin|date=Nov 1, 1912|issue=163 |url=https://archive.org/details/codeofhandsomela02hand|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born during a time when the Seneca nation was at its peak of prosperity through [[fur trading]], Handsome Lake witnessed the gradual deterioration of his society. Other well-known relatives in Handsome Lake's family included [[Governor Blacksnake]], [[Red Jacket]] and Half-Town.

==Career==
In 1794 he signed the U.S. treaty with the Six Nations (known as the [[Pickering Treaty]]). He visited Washington, D.C. with Cornplanter in 1802.

===Tribe===
Several factors contributed to the erosion of morale and spiritual welfare of the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee. At its peak in the early 18th century, the Haudenosaunee controlled much of what is now the midwestern United States, which it had conquered through decades of warring against the tribes native to those areas in the [[Beaver Wars]].

After the [[American Revolution]], the Haudenosaunee lost most of their land in New York and Pennsylvania and were forced to live on reservations, including in Canada, as punishment for taking the side of the British Crown in the revolution. Although these reservations included much of the prime real estate in [[Western New York]], including several of the prominent creek and river valleys, the small and fragmented native lands were separated by wide swaths of land that was eventually earmarked for American settlement in what would be known as the [[Holland Purchase]]. This dislocation followed years of social disruption due to epidemics of infectious disease and major wars.

Alcohol was introduced to the tribes in this time frame, a substance to which numerous Haudenosaunee (including Handsome Lake himself) began consuming in excess, exacerbating the erosion of the traditional family unit. This situation was a result of the cultural clash between the fledgling United States and the once equally powerful Six Nations people. The traditional religious rituals were no longer applicable to the environment in which the Haudenosaunee people found themselves.

==Brings a Message of Gaihwiyo ("Good Word")==
In 1799, after a period of illness due to many years of excessive alcoholism, Handsome Lake had the visions that gave him the power to become a prophet. In his vision, he was warned by three spiritual messengers presented him with ideals that he must enforce among his people. They told him of concerns he must enforce, like learning the English language and preservation of their land. Shortly after Handsome Lake's first vision, he ceased drinking alcohol. When he regained his health, he began bringing a message of Gaiwiio (the "Good Word") to his people. He preached against drunkenness and other evil practices. His message outlined a moral code that was eventually referred to as the Code of Handsome Lake. Today it is called the Longhouse Religion.

Handsome Lake abolished societal sins, attempting to cleanse the tribes of all immoral actions. He threatened his people in order to show them the error of their ways. He insisted that Iroquois people must refrain from drinking, marital abuse, abortion, spouse and child abandonment, selling of land, overconsumption, [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]], and witchcraft.

The rise of Handsome Lake's religion was more successful than most religions during that time  because his code combined traditional Iroquois religion with Quaker values. Despite the clear presence of Christian values in his teachings, it is unclear how much contact with Christianity Handsome Lake had previous to his visions.  His religion stressed survival without the sacrifice of the Iroquois identity, and recognized the need to make adjustments in order to survive in their changing world. Handsome Lake's ideals were eye opening and majority of people agreed with him. Those who opposed the code had reasons to believe that Handsome Lake was giving up on their old ways by altering the character of their religion. They saw Handsome Lake's new ideals as abandoning their history and forfeiting to Quaker ideals because Handsome Lake did not believe that they could survive with the world evolving around them.

The Code of Handsome Lake was one of the most successful uprisings during the time. His Code combined traditional Iroquois religious values with Christian values, and then-President [[Thomas Jefferson]] gave his endorsement to Handsome Lake's code in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/jeffind2.asp  To Brother Handsome Lake]&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Handsome Lake’s relatives, his visions were written down and published in 1850. The Code of Handsome Lake remains practiced among the Seneca and is considered to be a traditional Indian religion. Beginning in the 1820s, it became traditional for the Code to be recited every September at Tonawanda in the Seneca Nation.

==A Tale Of How America Was Discovered==
[[How America Was Discovered]] [https://archive.org/stream/senecamythsfolkt00park#page/n5/mode/2up] is a story told by Handsome Lake, and documented by [[Arthur C. Parker]], about a young minister who meets the one he perceives to be the Lord, who then asks him to go to a new land and bring with him cards, money, a fiddle, whiskey, and blood corruption. In return the young minister will become rich. The young minister sought out Christopher Columbus, and with the help of his crew, traveled to the Americas. They turned back to report what they had seen, which caused an immigration of people from Europe to the Americas. Along with the people came the five things that aided in destroying the natives. The end reveals that the "Lord" in the gold castle was actually the devil, and that even he knew what he had caused was wrong.

'''Harpal Brar''' (born 5 October 1939) is an Indian [[communist]] politician, writer and businessman, based in Britain. He is the founder and current Chairman of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist)]].

Born in [[Muktsar]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[British Raj|British India]], Brar has lived and worked in Britain since 1962, first as a student, then as a lecturer in law at [[University of Westminster|Harrow College of Higher Education]] (later merged into the renamed [[University of Westminster]]), and later in the textile business. Brar owns buildings in West London which he uses for CPGB-ML party activity, and he part-owns an internet shop called "Madeleine Trehearne and Harpal Brar" which sells shawls.

Brar is the editor of a far-left political newspaper called ''[[Lalkar]]'', which was a paper belonging to the [[Indian Workers' Association]] before Brar inherited it. Brar has written multiple books on subjects such as Communism, Indian republicanism, imperialism, anti-Zionism, anti-Colonialism, and the [[British General Strike]]. He is also a co-founder of the Hands off China Campaign.

==Political activities==
Brar joined the [[Maoist]] [[Revolutionary Marxist-Leninist League]] but soon left to become a founder member of a small group, the [[Association of Communist Workers]], as well as being a member of the Association of Indian Communists.

He and his comrades officially dissolved the ACW in 1997 to join [[Arthur Scargill]]'s [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]], a breakaway from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] after its abandonment of the original version of [[Clause IV]]. Brar and his comrades worked to bring what they described as an [[Anti-Revisionist]] [[Marxist-Leninist]] programme to the SLP, but were eventually expelled seven years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/530/scargill-expels-brar/|title=Scargill expels Brar|newspaper=Weekly Worker|issue= 530|date=26 May 2004|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scargill expelled the entire Yorkshire Regional Committee and five members of the National Executive Committee. From this, in July 2004, the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)]] was formed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpgb-ml.org/index.php?secName=home|title=Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)|publisher=cpgb-ml.org|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brar was elected as its chairman.

Adopting positions maintained by Brar and his comrades since the 1960s, the CPGB-ML has been vigorously opposed to all those who work with or in any way endorse the Labour Party since its inception. Its stated aim on formation was to oppose opportunism in the working-class movement, revive the "class against class" programme embodied by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] during the 1920s, and to work for the establishment of socialism in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb-ml.org/index.php?secName=proletarian&amp;subName=display&amp;art=10 Formation of the CPGB-ML], Proletarian, August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb-ml.org/index.php?secName=proletarian&amp;subName=display&amp;art=784 Celebrating October], Proletarian, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist) was registered with the Electoral Commission in 2008 under the name "Proletarian", which is the title of the bi-monthly newspaper of the CPBG-ML. The party was registered "to prepare for standing in elections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/62299/SoA-Index.pdf |accessdate=19 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107140355/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/62299/SoA-Index.pdf |archivedate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on China==
On 19 July 2008, Harpal Brar was one of the people who founded the Hands off China campaign. The campaign is dedicated to defending China and "is aimed to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity" and "the country's just stance on issues of its vital national interest such as Taiwan and Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/20/content_8576443.htm|title=Britain's Communist Party launches "Hand-0ff-China" campaign|date=20 July 2008|agency=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=29 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114034845/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/20/content_8576443.htm|archivedate=14 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on India==

Brar heavily disagrees with the belief that the fight for Indian Independence was a peaceful and pacifist movement, led entirely by Gandhi. He wrote a book on Indian history called ''[[Inquilab Zindabad]]: India's Liberation Struggle'', in which he argues that the fight for Indian independence was a violent and bloody class struggle, and goes onto accuse Gandhi of supporting British imperialism. The back cover of the book says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a widespread myth spread by bourgeois historians that Gandhi and the Indian National Congress were solely responsible for achieving India's independence from the much-hated British Raj, and that they did it using only the message of non-violence, peaceful non-co-operation and civil disobedience.
The truth is quite the reverse. The heroes of the 1857 revolt, the Ghadar patriots, and Bhagat Singh and his comrades inspired and led the Indian masses in armed struggle as the best means of liberating their country from British colonial occupation.
Many thousands of ordinary people and many hundreds of revolutionary leaders made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of this noble cause. Their struggle is summed up by Bhagat Singh's popular slogan, "Inquilab zindabad!" (Long live revolution!), which electrified the Indian masses.
It is an insult to their memory, and to their self-sacrificing heroism, to credit India's independence to the most compromising, cowardly and obscurantist representatives of the India bourgeoisie.
All progressives, workers and peasants have a duty to honour these heroes, to perpetuate their memory and to learn from them in the continuing struggle against imperialism and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brar |first=Harpal |date=2014 |title=Inquilab Zindabad: India's Liberation Struggle|location=Great Britain |isbn=1 874613 22 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views on the Soviet Union==
Brar defends the governments and leaders of the USSR until the appearance of "Khrushchevite revisionism" during the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brar|first=Harpal|title=Revisionism and the Demise of the USSR|url=http://cpgb-ml.org/download/publications/RevisionismUSSR.pdf|format=pdf|year=2011|website=Perestroika|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lalkar'', the newspaper edited by Brar, criticises ''[[Britain's Road to Socialism|The British Road to Socialism]]'' (the programme of the original [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]) from its earliest version in 1951 as "un-Marxist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The British Road to Revisionism|url=http://www.lalkar.org/article/931/the-british-road-to-revisionism|newspaper=Lalkar|date=November 2008|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regards the claim that Stalin approved it as a "fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The revolutionary programmes of British Communism|url=http://www.lalkar.org/article/853/the-revolutionary-programmesof-british-communism|newspaper=Lalkar|date=January 2008|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brar is seen as an unapologetic admirer of Stalin and has been attacked as an "anachronism" in the ''[[Weekly Worker]]'' publication of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)]], which Brar in turn regards as Trotskyite propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/389/stalin-society-v-cpgb/|title=Stalin Society v CPGB|date=20 June 2001|publisher=weeklyworker.co.uk|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He, along with his daughter Joti Brar, is an active member of the [[Stalin Society]], the website of which contains articles denying Soviet wrongdoing in the [[Katyn massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ella Rule|title= The Katyn Massacre|url=http://stalinsociety.net/?p=103|publisher=Stalin Society|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ukrainian Famine ([[Holodomor]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Puntis|title=Ukrainian famine-genocide myth|url=http://stalinsociety.net/?p=114|publisher=Stalin Society|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Moscow Trials]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mario Sousa trans. Ella Rule|title=Lies concerning the history of the Soviet Union|url=http://stalinsociety.net/?p=428|publisher=Stalin Society|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they blame on the [[Nazis]], dismiss as propaganda, or describe as fair process, respectively.

==Publications==
For many years, he was on the executive of the [[Indian Workers Association (GB)]] and was the editor of that organisation's journal ''Lalkar''. He continues to publish the journal, but the IWA cut its ties with the paper in 1992, when members of the Executive Committee with affiliations to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) objected to Brar's publishing of an article that was mildly critical of the adoption of market socialism in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lalkar.org/issues/contents/jan2006/china.php "Socialism with Chinese characteristics"], ''Lalkar''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, Brar has self-published fourteen books on various aspects of Marxism, imperialism and revisionism. These works are a combination of original material and articles previously published in Lalkar and have been translated and distributed internationally by a number of sympathetic communist parties around the world.

'''Holly Hoffman''' (née '''Wanner'''; March 15, 1966), is an [[Americans|American]] author, [[motivational speaker]], and [[television personality]].  She is best known for competing on the reality competition show ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', and for her book ''Your Winner Within''.

==Early life==
Holly Wanner was born in [[Eureka, South Dakota]], the youngest of three children.  Her parents owned a grocery store, and as Wanner got older, she would spend her after-school time helping out at the store.  Her life at home was more turbulent, though; as an adult, she would come to describe her childhood home life as having been "abusive."&lt;ref name=kelo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jorgensen|first1=Don|title=Survivor's Holly Hoffman: The Next Chapter|url=http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/survivors-holly-hoffman-the-next-chapter/?id=137037|accessdate=December 6, 2015|work=KELOLAND.com|publisher=Young Broadcasting of Sioux Falls, Inc.|date=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father, an alcoholic, left the family when Wanner was in sixth grade.  After her parents' divorce, she and her two older brothers were forced to get jobs to support the family.  Her father died in 1990 at the age of 46.

When Wanner got to high school, she became a star athlete in [[track and field|track]].  In 1982, she set the Eureka High School record in the 300-meter hurdles; the following year, she set the school record in the 100-meter hurdles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eureka Trojans Track Records (Girls)|url=http://www.eureka.k12.sd.us/athletics/track/track-records/eureka-trojans-track-records|website=Eureka School District|publisher=Eureka School District 44-1|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the South Dakota Sportswriters Association named her the state’s High School Girls Athlete of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=A Complete List Of Past SDSWA Award Winners|url=http://www.yankton.net/sports/article_54e33822-8b3e-52d3-84cd-f9ff89296929.html|accessdate=December 6, 2015|work=Yankton Press &amp; Dakotan|date=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating high school, Wanner enrolled at [[Northern State University]] in nearby [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen]].  There, she met a fellow student named [[Charles Hoffman (politician)|Charlie Hoffman]].   They married in 1985.

==Career==
After their wedding, Holly Hoffman, along with her husband Charlie, established a [[cattle ranch]] outside Eureka, which she would help to manage even while still attending college and raising a family.  In 1993, she founded a [[swimming (sport)|swim]] team in Eureka,&lt;ref name=swimworld&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Carrie|title=A Swimmer with Two Objectives: Miss South Dakota Alexandra Hoffman|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/a-swimmer-with-two-objectives-miss-south-dakota-alexandra-hoffman/|accessdate=December 11, 2015|work=Swimming World|publisher=Sports Publications, Inc.|date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she would coach for 17 years.  She was named Coach of the Year twice during her tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=USA SWIMMING COACH JOINS SURVIVOR CAST|url=http://news-sports.net/?id=582|accessdate=December 11, 2015|agency=News-Sports.net|date=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, she has also worked as a high school volleyball referee.&lt;ref name=hervoice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|title=Hoffman: ''Inner Strength, Determination Can Make You a Survivor''|journal=Her Voice|date=March 2011|pages=4–5, 14|url=http://www.hervoiceonline.com/issues/2140/15533|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Hoffman’s husband Charlie is a former [[Majority Whip]] in the [[South Dakota House of Representatives]].  From 2009 to 2015, he served three terms (of two years each) as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] representative in [[South Dakota]]’s 23rd legislative district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles B. Hoffman|url=http://legis.sd.gov/Legislators/Historical_Listing/LegislatorDetail.aspx?MemberID=3795|website=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=South Dakota Legislature|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffman’s oldest child and only son, Austin Hoffman, is a [[State's Attorney]]. Hoffman’s second child and oldest daughter is [[Alexandra Hoffman|Alex Hoffman]], a former [[beauty queen]] who has held the titles of [[Miss South Dakota Teen USA]] (2006) and [[Miss South Dakota]] (2008).  As Miss South Dakota, Alex placed in the top 15 of the [[Miss America 2009|2009 Miss America pageant]].&lt;ref name=swimworld /&gt;  Alex, like her brother Austin, is also a broadcast journalist, best known for her work at [[KETV]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].&lt;ref name=aberdeennews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nguyen|first1=Kay|title=Eureka siblings share career in television news|url=http://articles.aberdeennews.com/2013-05-20/news/39375742_1_austin-pageant-title-omaha|accessdate=December 6, 2015|work=Aberdeen News|publisher=Aberdeen News|date=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffman’s youngest child and youngest daughter, Elizabeth Hoffman, also won the [[Miss South Dakota Teen USA]] pageant (2008), two years after her sister Alex won.&lt;ref name=aberdeennews /&gt;

==''Survivor''==
After Hoffman’s children had all gone off to college, she decided to pursue a new adventure in life, so she applied to be on the TV series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blankley|first1=Bethany|title=Faith and Work: 'Survivor Nicaragua' Finalist Holly Hoffman on How to Survive the Trials of Life|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/faith-and-work-survivor-nicaragua-finalist-holly-hoffman-on-how-to-survive-the-trials-of-life-95784/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, she was one of 20 people selected to compete on the show’s 21st season, known as ''[[Survivor: Nicaragua]]''.  That season, the tribes were initially divided according to age: the Espada tribe would consist of the ten older players in the game, and the La Flor tribe would be made up of the ten younger players.  The then-44-year-old Hoffman was initially placed on the Espada tribe.

Hoffman’s first five days in the game were rough.  When she caught her tribemate Dan Lembo saying nasty things about her behind her back, she responded by taking his [[Alligator#Human uses|alligator shoes]], filling them with sand, and leaving them in the ocean to sink.  Soon after, she became so distraught, that she seriously considered quitting the game, until fellow tribemate [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] convinced her to stay.  Ironically, Hoffman would be one of the castaways to vote off Johnson three days later.

On Day 28, Hoffman was on the winning team at the reward challenge, but she decided to give up her share of the reward in exchange for the whole tribe receiving a tarp and a can of rice, to replace the food and supplies lost in a fire a few days earlier.  That same day, two players, NaOnka Mixon and “Purple Kelly” Shinn, announced that were planning on quitting the game.  Hoffman, who had almost quit the game herself on Day Five, was now one of the castaways instrumental in trying to convince Shinn and Mixon to stay in the game.  The two of them would end up quitting anyway.

At the Final Four, Hoffman was aligned with [[Chase Rice]] and Matthew “Sash” Lenahan, and the three of them were planning on eliminating [[Jud Birza|Jud “Fabio” Birza]].  But when Birza won immunity, the three men, all of whom were original members of La Flor, joined together in eliminating Hoffman.  She would finish the game fourth place overall, as the ninth jury member, the last female standing, and the last original Espada member standing.  At the Final Tribal Council, she cast her vote for Rice to win the game, although Birza would end up winning the title of Sole Survivor.

At the reunion show, Hoffman made amends with Lembo, by giving him a pair of [[ostrich leather|ostrich boots]] to replace the shoes which she had destroyed in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;''Survivor: Nicaragua'' reunion show, CBS, December 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivational speaking==
After ''Survivor: Nicaragua'' aired, series host [[Jeff Probst]] commended Hoffman for her turnaround over the course of the game, saying that he had never seen anyone “do a 180” like that.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt;  He also told her directly that she would do well as a public speaker.&lt;ref name=kelo /&gt;  Inspired, she started giving speeches in 2011, and soon after formed her own company, Inner Depth LLC, to market her [[motivational speaking]] skills.&lt;ref name=hervoice /&gt;  In 2012, she wrote a book about her life experiences, entitled ''Your Winner Within''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bahr|first1=Jeff|title='Survivor' has written a book|url=http://articles.aberdeennews.com/2012-07-19/entertainment/32751965_1_motivational-book-survivor-contestant-hoffman/2|accessdate=December 15, 2015|work=Aberdeen News|publisher=Aberdeen News|date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[foreword]] was penned by her former ''Survivor'' tribemate, [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]].&lt;ref name=kelo /&gt;

'''Ilvala''' ({{Lang-sa|इल्वल}}) and Vatapi were [[rakshasas]], they ruled from [[Badami]], formerly known as Vatapi, named after rakshasa king [[Vatapi]]. According to the Mahābhārata, Vatapi ruled the area along with his brother Ilvala.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Legend has it that both rakshasa were vanquished by the sage [[Agastya]]. Once Ilvala invited a tapasvi Brahmin, played host to him with reverence and asked him to grant a boon. He desired to have a son equal to [[Indra]]. But the sage did not oblidge. Following this, his anger turned to hatred against all Brahmins and medicants. Ilvala and his brother [[Vatapi]] took a grudge against sages and hated them implacably.

Vatapi knew the art of transformation and had the power to change into any life form. Ilvala knew the ‘Mritasanjivani’ mantra to bring back the dead to life. They used these powers to loot and kill people. Ilvala would invite a brahman to a feast and Vatapi would turn himself into a Goat.&lt;ref&gt;http://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/6/18/15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encounter with Sage Agastya and death==
Once the sage [[Agastya]] was invited. Agastya came to Ilvala and the sage was received with reverence and great honour. Sage Agastya with his divne power knew the intention of the hosts and wanted to put an end to this. Agastya ate the food served to him. As soon as the sage finished eating, Ilvala called,"Vatapi atragacha"(Vatapi come here). Immediately, Agastya who knows what Ilvala was up to passed his right hand over his stomach and said,"Vatapi Jeernobhava"(Vatape get digested). Vatapi could not come out of Agastya's stomach and that was the end of the demon. Ilvala, was scared. He went on shouting "Vatapi atragacha" Agastya then he said, "Oh, you wicked Ilvala, you wanted to kill me, but your brother Vatapi cannot come out and he is already digested". Ilvala decided to take revenge on Agastya for killing his brother and attacked Agastya. With the power of his ''tapas'' ([[penance]]), Agastya reduced Ilvala to ashes.

'''Jedediah Strutt''' (1726 – 7 May 1797) or Jedidiah Strutt – as he spelled it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.spinningdownthederwent.co.uk |authors=Middleton, J., ''et al.'' |date=2008 |title=Spinning Down The Derwent |type=book and DVD |location=Milford, Derbyshire |publisher=Maypole Promotions}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was a [[Hosiery|hosier]] and cotton spinner from [[Belper]], England.

Strutt and his brother-in-law William Woollat developed an attachment to the [[stocking frame]] that allowed the production of ribbed stockings. Their machine became known as the Derby Rib machine, and the stockings it produced quickly became popular.

==Early life==
He was born in [[South Normanton]] near [[Alfreton]] in Derbyshire into a farming family in 1726.

In 1740 he became an apprentice [[wheelwright]] in [[Findern]]. In 1754 he inherited a small stock of animals from an uncle and married Elizabeth Woolatt in 1755 in [[Derbyshire]]. He moved to [[Blackwell, Bolsover|Blackwell]] where he had inherited a farm from one of his uncles and, in addition developed a business carrying coal from [[Denby]] to [[Belper]] and [[Derby]].

==The Derby Rib==
Strutt's brother-in-law, William Woolatt, employed one Mr. Roper of Locko who had produced an idea for an attachment to the [[stocking frame]] to knit ribbed stockings. He had made one or two specimens which he showed to his friends, though he lacked the interest (and the capital) to develop his idea. Woolatt conferred with Strutt, who sold a horse and paid Roper £5 for his invention. Strutt and Woolatt turned the device into a viable machine and took out a patent in 1759.

Their machine became known as the Derby Rib machine, and the stockings it produced quickly became popular. Cotton was cheaper than silk and more comfortable than wool but demand was far exceeding supply.

==Cotton mills==
Strutt and another spinner, Samuel Need, were introduced to [[Richard Arkwright]] who had arrived in [[Nottingham]] in about 1768, and set up his spinning frame there using horse-power to run the mill, but this was an unsatisfactory power source. In [[Derby]], [[John Lombe]] had built a successful silk spinning mill using water power. Strutt and Need joined Arkwright in the building of a [[cotton mill]] at [[Cromford]], using what was henceforth called Arkwright's [[water frame]]. This was the first of its kind in the world, marking the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Strutt bought land in 1777 for his first mill in [[Belper]], which at that time was a hamlet of framework knitters and nail makers. In 1781 he bought the old forge at Makeney by [[Milford, Derbyshire|Milford]] Bridge from Walter Mather. Belper opened in 1778 and Milford in 1782. For each he built long rows of substantial worker's houses and both are now part of the [[Derwent Valley Mills]] [[World Heritage Site]].

In time there would be eight Strutt mills at Belper which would grow to a population of 10,000 by the mid-nineteenth century and be the second largest town in the county.
[[File:BootsBuildingStatue (4).JPG|thumb|230px|Statue of Jedediah Strutt on the Boots building, East Street, Derby]]

==Family==
Strutt was the second son of William Strutt of [[South Normanton]] and Martha Statham of Handley near [[Shottle]], Derbyshire, England.&lt;ref&gt; From my house title deeds. Now called Handley Wood Farm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1755, he married Elizabeth Woollatt. They had five children before Elizabeth's death in London in 1774. In 1781, Strutt married again, to Ann Cantrell, the widow of George Daniels of [[Belper]]. There were no children from this marriage.

Jedediah and Elizabeth's children were:
*[[William Strutt (inventor)|William]] (1756–1830), who married Barbara Evans, daughter of Thomas Evans (by his second wife), and who invented the [[Belper stove]]. Their son was the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician [[Edward Strutt, 1st Baron Belper]].
*Elizabeth (1758–1836), who married William Evans, son of Thomas Evans (by his first wife).
*Martha (1760–1793), who married Samuel Fox.
*George Benson (1761–1841), who married Catherine Radford, daughter of Anthony Radford of [[Holbrook, Derbyshire|Holbrook]].
*[[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|Joseph]] (1765–1844), who married Isabella Douglas, daughter of Archibold Douglas.

Jedediah died in Derby in 1797 and is buried in the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Chapel in Field Row, Belper, which he had built in 1788/9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belper-research.com/chapel/history/construct.html Strutt's Unitarian Chapel: Construction]&lt;/ref&gt; His final home, Friar Gate House, Derby, is marked with a [[blue plaque]]. The house was designed by his son, [[William Strutt (inventor)|William Strutt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-25847367 "Derby blue plaque for inventor Jedediah Strutt unveiled"] BBC News; 22 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson''' (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as '''Katy Perry''', is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in [[gospel music]] as a teenager. Perry signed with [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]] and released her debut studio album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'' under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to [[Los Angeles]] the following year to venture into [[Secularity|secular]] music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers [[Glen Ballard]], [[Dr. Luke]], and [[Max Martin]]. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] and [[Columbia Records]], she signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Capitol Records]] in April 2007.

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of her second album, a [[pop rock]] record titled ''[[One of the Boys (Katy Perry album)|One of the Boys]]'', and its singles "[[I Kissed a Girl]]" and "[[Hot n Cold]]". The former track also sparked controversy for its [[Sappho#Sexuality|sapphic]] themes. Her third album, ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010), ventured into [[disco]], and was her first album to top the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It topped the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with the singles "[[California Gurls]]", "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]", "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]", "[[E.T. (song)|E.T.]]", and "[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]" while "[[The One That Got Away (Katy Perry song)|The One That Got Away]]" reached number 3 on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after [[Michael Jackson]]'s album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. In March 2012, she re-issued the album as ''[[Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection]]'', which produced the songs "[[Part of Me (Katy Perry song)|Part of Me]]" and "[[Wide Awake (song)|Wide Awake]]". Her fourth album, ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013), was her second to peak atop the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on [[Vevo]] with the videos for its songs "[[Roar (song)|Roar]]" and "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]". Her fifth album, ''[[Witness (Katy Perry album)|Witness]]'' (2017), delved into [[electropop]] and became her third album to reach number one in the U.S. Its most successful single, "[[Chained to the Rhythm]]", broke the record for [[Spotify]]'s most streamed track by a female artist within 24 hours upon its release.

Perry has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Katy Perry|many awards]], including four [[Guinness World Records]], five [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Brit Award]], and a [[Juno Award]], and has been included in the annual ''[[Forbes]]'' lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011–2018. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is [[List of best-selling music artists|one of the best-selling music artists of all time]], having sold more than 40 million albums and over 100 million records globally throughout her career. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ''[[Katy Perry: Part of Me]]'' in 2012, and voiced [[Smurfette]] in the 2011 film ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' and [[The Smurfs 2|its sequel]] in 2013. Perry also began serving as a judge on ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2018.

'''Khavazhi Khatsigov''' (born 17 April 1977 in [[Grozny]]) is a [[Boxing|boxer]] from [[Belarus]].

He was born in Russia, but after his failure to join the Russian national team ([[Raimkul Malakhbekov]] was the No.1 Russian bantamweight in that time), he moved to Belarus in 1999.

Khatsigov won a gold medal at the [[2002 European Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Perm, Russia]].

He qualified for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] by ending up in second place at the [[4th AIBA European 2004 Olympic Qualifying Tournament]] in [[Baku, Azerbaijan]]. In Athens, Greece he defeated [[Juan Manuel López (boxer)]] but lost in the second round of the [[Boxing at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Bantamweight|Bantamweight (54 kg)]] division to Thailand's eventual runner-up [[Worapoj Petchkoom]].

He also qualified for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], but was edged out by [[Veaceslav Gojan]] in his first bout.

'''Louis Philippe I''' (6 October 1773 – 26 August 1850) was [[List of French monarchs|King of the French]] from 1830 to 1848. Like his father, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], he initially supported the [[French Revolution]]. However following the deposition and execution of his cousin, King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], Louis Philippe fled the country. His father, despite having denounced his son's actions and voted for the death of the King, was imprisoned and executed that same year. Louis Philippe spent the next 21 years in exile before returning during the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. He was proclaimed king in 1830 after his cousin [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] was forced to abdicate by the [[July Revolution]]. The reign of Louis Philippe, known as the [[July Monarchy]], was dominated by wealthy industrialists and bankers. He followed conservative policies, especially under the influence of the French statesman [[François Guizot]] during the period 1840–48. He also promoted friendship with Britain and sponsored colonial expansion, notably the [[French conquest of Algeria]].  His popularity faded as economic conditions in France deteriorated in 1847, and he was forced to abdicate after the outbreak of the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. He lived out his life in exile in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. His supporters were known as [[Orléanist]]s, as opposed to [[Legitimist]]s who supported the main line of the House of Bourbon.

==Before the Revolution (1773–1789)==

===Early life===
Louis Philippe was born in the [[Palais Royal]], the residence of the Orléans family in Paris, to Louis Philippe, Duke of Chartres (who would become [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], upon the death of his father [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orleans|Louis Philippe I]]), and [[Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon]]. As a member of the reigning [[House of Bourbon]], he was a [[Prince du Sang|Prince of the Blood]], which entitled him the use of the style "[[Serene Highness]]". His mother was an extremely wealthy heiress who was descended from [[Louis XIV of France]] through a legitimized line.

Louis Philippe was the eldest of three sons and a daughter, a family that was to have erratic fortunes from the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Bourbon Restoration]].

The elder branch of the House of Bourbon, to which the kings of France belonged, deeply distrusted the intentions of the cadet branch, which would succeed to the throne of France should the senior branch die out. Louis Philippe's father was exiled from the royal court, and the Orléans confined themselves to studies of the literature and sciences emerging from the [[French Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

===Education===
Louis Philippe was tutored by the [[Stéphanie Félicité Ducrest de St-Albin, comtesse de Genlis|Countess of Genlis]], beginning in 1782. She instilled in him a fondness for [[Liberalism|liberal]] thought; it is probably during this period that Louis Philippe picked up his slightly [[Voltaire]]an{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} brand of Catholicism. When Louis Philippe's grandfather died in 1785, his father succeeded him as Duke of Orléans and Louis Philippe succeeded his father as Duke of Chartres.

In 1788, with the [[French revolution|Revolution]] looming, the young Louis Philippe showed his liberal sympathies when he helped break down the door of a prison cell in [[Mont Saint-Michel]], during a visit there with the Countess of Genlis. From October 1788 to October 1789, the ''Palais Royal'' was a meeting-place for the revolutionaries.

==Revolution (1789–1793)==
Louis Philippe grew up in a period that changed Europe as a whole and, following his father's strong support for the Revolution, he involved himself completely in those changes. In his diary, he reports that he himself took the initiative to join the [[Jacobin Club]], a move that his father supported.

===Military service===
[[File:Feron - Le Duc de Chartres à Valmy (1792).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The duke of Chartres (dismounted) and his brother, the [[Antoine d'Orléans (1775-1807)|Duke of Montpensier]] (on horseback), in [[dragoon]] uniform at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (1792)]]
In June 1791, Louis Philippe got his first opportunity to become involved in the affairs of France. In 1785, he had been given the hereditary appointment of Colonel of the [[14th Regiment of Dragoons]].

With war on the horizon in 1791, all proprietary colonels were ordered to join their regiments. Louis Philippe showed himself to be a model officer, and he demonstrated his personal bravery in two famous instances. First, three days after Louis XVI's [[flight to Varennes]], a quarrel between two local priests and one of the new ''constitutional'' vicars became heated, and a crowd surrounded the inn where the priests were staying, demanding blood. The young colonel broke through the crowd and extricated the two priests, who then fled. At a river crossing on the same day, another crowd threatened to harm the priests. Louis Philippe put himself between a peasant armed with a [[carbine]] and the priests, saving their lives. The next day, Louis Philippe dove into a river to save a drowning local engineer. For this action, he received a [[civic crown]] from the local municipality. His regiment was moved north to [[Flanders]] at the end of 1791 after the August 27, 1791 [[Declaration of Pillnitz]].

Louis Philippe served under his father's crony, [[Armand Louis de Gontaut]] the Duke of Biron, along with several officers who later gained distinction in [[Napoleon]]'s empire and afterwards. These included Colonel [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais|Alexandre de Beauharnais]] (husband of the future [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]]).

After war was declared by the Kingdom of France on the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] on April 20, 1792, Louis Philippe saw his first exchanges of fire of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] within the invaded by France [[Austrian Netherlands]] at [[Boussu]], Walloon, on about April 28, 1792, and then at [[Quaregnon]], Walloon, on about April 29, 1792, and then at [[Quiévrain]], Walloon, near [[Jemappes]], Walloon, on about April 30, 1792, where he was instrumental in rallying a unit of retreating soldiers after the victorious [[Battle of Quiévrain (1792)]] only two days earlier on April 28th of 1792. Biron wrote to War Minister [[Pierre Marie de Grave|de Grave]], praising the young colonel, who was then promoted to [[brigadier]], commanding a brigade of cavalry in Lückner's Army of the North.

In the Army of the North, Louis Philippe served with four future Marshals of France: [[Étienne-Jacques-Joseph-Alexandre MacDonald|Macdonald]], [[Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|Mortier]] (who would later be killed in an [[#Assassination attempts|assassination attempt on Louis Philippe]]), [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]] and [[Nicolas Oudinot|Oudinot]]. [[Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez]] was appointed to command the Army of the North in August 1792. Louis Philippe commanded a division under him in the [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] campaign.

At the September 20, 1792 [[Battle of Valmy]], Louis Philippe was ordered to place a battery of artillery on the crest of the hill of Valmy. The battle was apparently inconclusive, but the Austrian-[[Prussia]]n army, short of supplies, was forced back across the [[Rhine]]. Once again, Louis Philippe was praised in a letter by Dumouriez after the battle. Louis Philippe was then recalled to Paris to give an account of the Battle at Valmy to the French government. There he had a rather trying interview with [[Georges Danton|Danton]], the Minister of Justice, which he later fondly re-told to his children.

While in Paris, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In October he returned to the Army of the North, where Dumouriez had begun a march into 'Belgium', then the 1714-1794 Austrian Netherlands. Louis Philippe again commanded a division. On November 6, 1792, Dumouriez chose to attack an Austrian force in a strong position on the heights of Cuesmes and [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]] to the west of [[Mons]]. Louis Philippe's division sustained heavy casualties as it attacked through a wood, retreating in disorder. Louis Philippe rallied a group of units, dubbing them "the battalion of Mons" and pushed forward along with other French units, finally overwhelming the outnumbered Austrians.

Events in Paris undermined the budding military career of Louis Philippe. The incompetence of [[Jean-Nicolas Pache]], the new [[Girondist]] appointee of October 3, 1792, left the Army of the North almost without supplies. Soon thousands of troops were deserting the army. Louis Philippe was alienated by the more radical policies of the [[French Republic|Republic]]. After the National Convention decided to put [[Louis XVI of France|the deposed King]] to death, Louis Philippe's father – by then known as ''Philippe Égalité'' – voted in favour of that act, Louis Philippe began to consider leaving France.

Louis Philippe was willing to stay in France to fulfill his duties in the army, but he was implicated in the plot Dumouriez had planned to ally with the Austrians, march his army on Paris, and restore the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]]. Dumouriez had met with Louis Philippe on 22 March 1793 and urged his subordinate to join in the attempt.

With the French government falling into the [[Reign of Terror]] about the time of the creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal earlier in March 1793, he decided to leave France to save his life. On 4 April, Dumouriez and Louis Philippe left for the Austrian camp. They were intercepted by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Louis-Nicolas Davout]], who had served at [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]] with Louis Philippe. As Dumouriez ordered the Colonel back to the camp, some of his soldiers cried out against the General, now declared a traitor by the [[National Convention]]. Shots rang out as they fled towards the Austrian camp. The next day, Dumouriez again tried to rally soldiers against the Convention; however, he found that the artillery had declared for the Republic, leaving him and Louis Philippe with no choice but to go into exile.

At the age of nineteen, and already a Lieutenant General, Louis Philippe left France; it was some twenty-one years before he again set foot on French soil.

==Exile (1793–1815)==
The reaction in Paris to Louis Philippe's involvement in Dumouriez's treason inevitably resulted in misfortunes for the Orléans family. Philippe Égalité spoke in the [[National Convention]], condemning his son for his actions, asserting that he would not spare his son, much akin to the Roman consul [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and his sons. However, letters from Louis Philippe to his father were discovered in transit and were read out to the [[National Convention|Convention]]. Philippe Égalité was then put under continuous surveillance. Shortly thereafter, the [[Girondists]] moved to arrest him and the two younger brothers of Louis Philippe, [[Louis-Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Louis-Charles]] and [[Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier|Antoine Philippe]]; the latter had been serving in the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]]. The three were interned in [[Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]] in Marseille.

Meanwhile, Louis Philippe was forced to live in the shadows, avoiding both pro-Republican revolutionaries and [[Legitimist]] French ''[[wikt:emigre|émigré]]'' centres in various parts of Europe and also in the Austrian army. He first moved to Switzerland under an assumed name, and met up with the Countess of Genlis and his sister [[Louise Marie Adélaïde Eugénie d'Orléans|Adélaïde]] at [[Schaffhausen]]. From there they went to [[Zürich]], where the Swiss authorities decreed that to protect Swiss neutrality, Louis Philippe would have to leave the city. They went to [[Zug]], where Louis Philippe was discovered by a group of ''émigrés''.

It became quite apparent that for the ladies to settle peacefully anywhere, they would have to separate from Louis Philippe. He then left with his faithful valet Baudouin for the heights of the [[Alps]], and then to [[Basel]], where he sold all but one of his horses. Now moving from town to town throughout Switzerland, he and Baudouin found themselves very much exposed to all the distresses of extended travelling. They were refused entry to a monastery by monks who believed them to be young vagabonds. Another time, he woke up after spending a night in a barn to find himself at the far end of a musket, confronted by a man attempting to keep away thieves.

Throughout this period, he never stayed in one place more than 48 hours. Finally, in October 1793, Louis Philippe was appointed a teacher of geography, history, mathematics and modern languages, at a boys' boarding school. The school, owned by a Monsieur Jost, was in [[Reichenau, Baden-Württemberg|Reichenau]], a village on the upper Rhine, across from Switzerland. His salary was 1,400 francs and he taught under the name ''Monsieur Chabos''. He had been at the school for a month when he heard the news from Paris: his father had been [[guillotine]]d on 6 November 1793 after a trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal.

===Travels===
After Louis Philippe left Reichenau, he separated the now sixteen-year-old Adélaïde from the Countess of Genlis, who had fallen out with Louis Philippe. Adélaïde went to live with her great-aunt the [[Maria Fortunata d'Este|Princess of Conti]] at Fribourg, then to [[Bavaria]] and Hungary and, finally, to her mother who was exiled in Spain.

Louis Philippe travelled extensively. He visited Scandinavia in 1795 and then moved on to Finland. For about a year, he stayed in [[Muonio]], a remote village in the valley of the [[Tornio river]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. He lived in the [[rectory]] under the name Müller, as a guest of the local [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] vicar. While visiting Muonio, he supposedly got a child with [[Beata Caisa Wahlborn]] (1766-1830) called [[Erik Kolstrøm]] (1796-1879).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/kom-inn/FUHA02006881/12-09-1981#t=8m39s|title=Kom Inn! (NRK-TV Norsk Rikskringkasting)|date=12 September 1981|website=tv.nrk.no|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Philippe also visited the [[United States]] for four years, staying in [[Philadelphia]] (where his brothers [[Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier|Antoine]] and [[Louis-Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Louis Charles]] were in exile), [[New York City]] (where he most likely stayed at the [[Somerindyck]] family estate on Broadway and 75th Street with other exiled princes), and [[Boston]]. In Boston, he taught French for a time and lived in lodgings over what is now the [[Union Oyster House]], Boston's oldest restaurant. During his time in the United States, Louis Philippe met with American politicians and people of high society, including [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], [[John Jay]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[George Washington]].

His visit to [[Cape Cod]] in 1797 coincided with the division of the town of Eastham into two towns, one of which took the name of Orleans, possibly in his honour. During their sojourn, the Orléans princes travelled throughout the country, as far south as [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and as far north as [[Maine]]. The brothers were even held in Philadelphia briefly during an outbreak of [[yellow fever]]. Louis Philippe is also thought to have met [[Isaac Snow]] of [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]], Massachusetts, who had escaped to France from a British [[prison ship|prison hulk]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1839, while reflecting on his visit to the United States, Louis Philippe explained in a letter to [[François Guizot|Guizot]] that his three years there had a large influence on his political beliefs and judgments when he became king.

In Boston, Louis Philippe learned of the [[coup of 18 Fructidor]] (4 September 1797) and of the exile of his mother to Spain. He and his brothers then decided to return to Europe. They went to [[New Orleans]], planning to sail to [[Havana]] and thence to Spain. This, however, was a troubled journey, as Spain and Great Britain were then at war. While in [[Louisiana (New Spain)|colonial Louisiana]] in 1798, they were entertained by [[Julien de Lallande Poydras|Julien Poydras]] in the town of [[Point Coupee, Louisiana|Pointe Coupée]],&lt;ref&gt;Corinne L. Saucier, ''History of Avoyelles Parish'', p. 27 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the [[Bernard de Marigny#Early life|Marigny de Mandeville]] family in New Orleans.

They sailed for Havana in an American [[corvette]], but the ship was stopped in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] by a British warship. The British seized the three brothers, but took them to Havana anyway. Unable to find passage to Europe, the three brothers spent a year in Cuba, until they were unexpectedly expelled by the Spanish authorities. They sailed via [[the Bahamas]] to [[Nova Scotia]] where they were received by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|the Duke of Kent]], son of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and (later) father of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. Louis Philippe struck up a lasting friendship with the British royal. Eventually, the brothers sailed back to New York, and in January 1800, they arrived in England, where they stayed for the next fifteen years. During these years, Louis Philippe taught mathematics and geography at the now-defunct [[Great Ealing School]], reckoned, in its nineteenth-century heyday, to be 'the best private school in England'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol7/pp162-170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Empires of the Plain: Henry Rawlinson and the Lost Languages of Babylon, Lesley Adkins, New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===

In 1796, Louis Philippe supposedly fathered a child with [[Beata Caisa Wahlborn]] (1766-1830) named [[Erik Kolstrøm]] (1796-1879).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1808, Louis Philippe proposed to [[Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]], daughter of King [[George III of the United Kingdom]]. His Catholicism and the opposition of her mother [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] meant the Princess reluctantly declined the offer.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{ODNBweb|last=Purdue |first=A.W.|title=George III, Daughters of (act. 1766–1857) |id=59209 |date=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809, Louis Philippe married Princess [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily]], daughter of King [[Ferdinand IV of Naples]] and [[Maria Carolina of Austria]]. They had the following ten children:

==Bourbon Restoration (1815–1830)==
{{See also|Bourbon Restoration}}
[[File:Vernet - Louis-Philippe duc d'Orléans (1773-1850) en uniforme de colonel-général des Hussards.jpg|thumb|Louis-Philippe as Colonel-General of the Hussars during the Bourbon Restoration]]

After the [[abdication]] of Napoleon, Louis Philippe, known as ''Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans'', returned to France during the reign of his cousin [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], at the time of the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Louis Philippe had reconciled the Orléans family with Louis XVIII in exile, and was once more to be found in the elaborate royal court. However, his resentment at the treatment of his family, the cadet branch of the [[House of Bourbon]] under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', caused friction between him and Louis XVIII, and he openly sided with the liberal opposition.

Louis Philippe was on far friendlier terms with Louis XVIII's brother and successor, [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], who acceded to the throne in 1824, and with whom he socialized. However, his opposition to the policies of [[Villèle]] and later of [[Jules de Polignac]] caused him to be viewed as a constant threat to the stability of Charles' government. This soon proved to be to his advantage.

==King of the French (1830–1848)==
{{Main|July Monarchy}}
[[File:Noyal - Louis-Philippe Ier (1773-1850) duc d'Orléans en uniforme de colonel-général des Hussards, représenté en 1817.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Duke of Orleans in uniform as a Colonel-General of the [[Hussar]]s in 1817]]

In 1830, the [[July Revolution]] overthrew Charles X, who abdicated in favour of his 10-year-old grandson, [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Henri, Duke of Bordeaux]], and, naming Louis Philippe ''Lieutenant général du royaume'', charged him to announce to the popularly elected [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]] his desire to have his grandson succeed him. Louis Philippe did not do this, in order to increase his own chances of succession. As a consequence, because the chamber was aware of Louis Philippe's liberal policies and of his popularity with the masses, they proclaimed Louis Philippe, who for eleven days had been acting as the [[regent]] for his young cousin, as the new French king, displacing the senior branch of the [[House of Bourbon]].

Charles X and his family, including his grandson, went into exile in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. The young ex-king, the Duke of Bordeaux, who, in exile, took the title of ''comte de Chambord'', later became the [[pretender]] to the throne of France and was supported by the Legitimists.

Louis-Philippe was sworn in as King Louis-Philippe I on 9 August 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis-Philippe Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/louis-philippe-9387069|publisher=The Biography.com Website|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his accession to the throne, Louis Philippe assumed the title of ''King of the French'' – a title already adopted by [[Louis XVI]] in the short-lived [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]]. Linking the [[popular monarchy|monarchy to a people]] instead of a territory (as the previous designation ''King of France and of Navarre'') was aimed at undercutting the legitimist claims of Charles X and his family.

By an ordinance he signed on 13 August 1830,{{refn|group=n|'''Louis Philippe's 13 August 1830 Ordinance'', relative to the surname (''nom'') and titles of his children and of his sister':
''Ordonnance du roi qui '''détermine les noms et titres''' des princes et princesses de la famille royale.
:''LOUIS PHILIPPE ROI DES FRANÇAIS, à tous présens et à venir, salut.
''Notre avènement à la couronne ayant rendu nécessaire de déterminer les noms et les titres que devaient porter à l'avenir les princes et princesses nos enfans, ainsi que notre bien-aimée sœur,
''Nous avons ordonné et ordonnons ce qui suit :
''Les princes et princesses nos bien-aimés enfans, ainsi que notre bien-aimée sœur, '''continueront à porter le nom et les armes d'Orléans.'''
:''Notre bien-aimé fils aîné, le duc de Chartres, portera, comme prince royal, le titre de duc d'Orléans.
''Nos bien-aimés fils puînés conserveront les titres qu'ils ont portés jusqu'à ce jour.
''Nos bien-aimées filles et notre bien-aimée sœur ne porteront d'autre titre que celui de '''princesses d'Orléans''', en se distinguant entre elles par leurs prénoms.
:''Il sera fait, en conséquence, sur les registres de l'état civil de la Maison royale, dans les archives de la Chambre des Pairs, toutes les rectifications qui résultent des dispositions ci-dessus [...]}} the new king defined the manner in which his children, as well as his "beloved" sister, would continue to bear the surname "d'Orléans" and the arms of Orléans, declared that his eldest son, as ''[[Crown Prince|Prince Royal]]'' (not ''Dauphin''), would bear the title ''[[Duke of Orléans]]'', that the younger sons would continue to have their previous titles, and that his sister and daughters would only be styled ''Princesses of Orléans'', not ''of France''.

In 1832, his daughter, Princess [[Louise-Marie of France|Louise-Marie]], married the first ruler of Belgium, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I, King of the Belgians]]. Their children included [[Leopold II of Belgium]] and [[Empress Carlota of Mexico]].

==Assassination attempts==
[[File:Machine infernale.JPG|thumb|Fieschi's ''Machine infernale'', displayed at the [[Museum of French History]] (2012)]]

Louis Phillippe survived seven assassination attempts.

On 28 July 1835, Louis Philippe survived an assassination attempt by [[Giuseppe Mario Fieschi]] and two other conspirators in [[Paris]]. During the king's annual review of the [[Paris National Guard]] commemorating the revolution, Louis-Philippe was passing along the [[Boulevard du Temple]], which connected [[Place de la République]] to the [[Bastille]], accompanied by three of his sons, Orleans, the [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|Duke of Nemours]] and the [[Prince de Joinville]], and numerous staff.

Fieschi, a Corsican ex-soldier, attacked the procession with a weapon he built himself, a [[volley gun]] that later became known as the ''Machine infernale''. This consisted of 25 gun barrels fastened to a wooden frame that could be fired simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Bouveiron, A. "III." [https://books.google.com/books?id=G62pc-6WJWYC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Historical and Biographical Sketch of Fieschi]. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 16. Google Books. Web. 24 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The device was fired from the third level of n° 50 Boulevard du Temple (a [[commemorative plaque]] has since been engraved there), which had been rented by Fieschi.
A ball only grazed the King's forehead. Eighteen people were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel {{ill|Joseph Rieussec|fr}} of the 8th Legion together with eight other officers, [[Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|Marshal Mortier, duc de Trévise]], and [[Colonel Raffet]], [[General Girard]], Captain Villate, [[General La Chasse de Vérigny]], a woman, a 14-year-old girl and two men. A further 22 people were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Jill Harsin|title=Barricades: The War of the Streets in Revolutionary Paris, 1830-1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcMfGnKKRu0C&amp;pg=PA150|year=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-29479-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author1=Gabriel G.

Several of the gun barrels of Fieschi's weapon burst when it was fired; he was badly injured and was quickly captured. He was executed by [[guillotine]] together with his two co-conspirators the following year.

[[File:Caricature Charles Philipon pear.jpg|thumb|Famous 1831 caricature of Louis Philippe turning into a pear mirrored the deterioration of his popularity ([[Honoré Daumier]], after [[Charles Philipon]], who was jailed for the original)]]

Louis Philippe ruled in an unpretentious fashion, avoiding the pomp and lavish spending of his predecessors. Despite this outward appearance of simplicity, his support came from the wealthy ''[[bourgeoisie]]''. At first, he was much loved and called the "Citizen King" and the "bourgeois monarch", but his popularity suffered as his government was perceived as increasingly conservative and monarchical, despite his decision to have [[retour des cendres|Napoleon's remains]] returned to France. Under his management, the conditions of the working classes deteriorated, and the [[income gap]] widened considerably.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

An [[Panic of 1847|economic crisis in 1847]]{{clarify |date=January 2018 |reason=The link "Panic of 1847" takes us to an article that says it was "a minor British banking crisis" with absolutely no hint of its relationship to what's discussed here.

The dissonance between his positive early reputation and his late unpopularity was epitomized by [[Victor Hugo]] in ''[[Les Misérables]]'' as an oxymoron describing his reign as "Prince Equality", in which Hugo states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online-literature.com/victor_hugo/les_miserables/225/ ''Les Miserables'', Victor Hugo, Chapter III: Louis Philippe]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[Louis Philippe had to] bear in his own person the contradiction of the Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power ... He had been proscribed, a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his own labor. In Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in France had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he gave lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work and sewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], built by Louis XI, and used by Louis XV. He was the companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belonged to the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; Danton had said to him: "Young man!" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the king, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times even to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? ''He took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit'', considering it something to hold his own against Europe, but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner.|[[Victor Hugo]]}}

==Abdication and death (1848–50)==
[[File:Abdication Louis-Philippe.png|thumb|upright|Abdication of Louis Philippe, in favor of his grandson, the ''comte de Paris'', dated 24 February 1848]]

On 24 February 1848, during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|February 1848 Revolution]], King Louis Philippe abdicated in favour of his nine-year-old grandson, [[Philippe, comte de Paris]]. Fearful of what had happened to Louis XVI, Louis Philippe quickly left Paris under disguise. Riding in an ordinary cab under the name of "Mr. Smith", he fled to England. There he spent his final years incognito as the 'Comte de Neuilly'.

The [[National Assembly of France]] initially planned to accept young Philippe as king, but the strong current of public opinion rejected that. On 26 February, the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was proclaimed. Louis Napoléon Bonaparte was elected President on 10 December 1848; on 2 December 1851, he declared himself [[president for life]] and then Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] in 1852.

Louis Philippe and his family remained in exile in Great Britain in [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]], Surrey, where he died on 26 August 1850. He was first buried at St. Charles Borromeo Chapel in [[Weybridge]], Surrey. In 1876, his remains and those of his wife were taken to France and buried at the ''[[Chapelle royale de Dreux]]'', the Orléans family necropolis his mother had built in 1816, and which he had enlarged and embellished after her death.

==Clash of the pretenders==
The clashes of 1830 and 1848 between the Legitimists and the [[Orléanist]]s over who was the rightful monarch were resumed in the 1870s. After the fall of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], a monarchist-dominated National Assembly offered a throne to the Legitimist pretender, [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Henri de France, comte de Chambord]], as ''Henri V''. As he was childless, his heir was (except to the most extreme Legitimists) Louis Philippe's grandson, [[Philippe, Comte de Paris|Philippe d'Orléans, comte de Paris]]. Thus the comte de Chambord's death would have united the House of Bourbon and House of Orléans.

However, the comte de Chambord refused to take the throne unless the [[Flag of France|Tricolor]] flag of the Revolution was replaced with the [[fleur-de-lis]] flag of the ''Ancien Régime''. This the National Assembly was unwilling to do. The [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was established, though many intended for it to be temporary, and replaced by a constitutional monarchy after the death of the comte de Chambord. However, the comte de Chambord lived longer than expected. By the time of his death in 1883, support for the monarchy had declined, and public opinion sided with a continuation of the Third Republic, as the form of government that, according to [[Adolphe Thiers]], "divides us least". Some suggested a monarchical restoration under a later comte de Paris after the fall of the [[Vichy regime]] but this did not occur.

Many remaining French monarchists regard the descendants of Louis Philippe's grandson, who hold the title ''Count of Paris'', as the rightful [[pretender]]s to the French throne; others, the Legitimists, consider Don [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou|Luis-Alfonso de Borbón, Duke of Anjou]] (to his supporters, "Louis XX") to be the rightful heir. Head of the Royal House of Bourbon, Louis is descended in the male line from [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe, Duke of Anjou]], the second grandson of the Sun-King, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Philippe (King Philip V of Spain), however, had renounced his rights to the throne of France to prevent the much-feared union of France and Spain.

The two sides challenged each other in the French Republic's law courts in 1897 and again nearly a century later. In the latter case, ''[[Henri, Count of Paris (1908–1999)|Henri, comte de Paris, duc de France]]'', challenged the right of the Spanish-born pretender to use the title ''Duke of Anjou''. The French courts threw out his claim, arguing that the legal system had no jurisdiction over the matter.

'''Marika Mitsotakis''' ([[née]] '''Giannoukou'''; November 29, 1930 – May 6, 2012) was the wife of the former [[Prime Minister of Greece]] [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]].&lt;ref name=greporter&gt;{{cite news |first=Anastasios |last=Papapostolou|title=Former First Lady of Greece Marika Mitsotakis Dies at 82  |url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/05/06/former-first-lady-of-greece-marika-mitsotakis-dies-at-82/ |work=[[Greek Reporter]] |publisher= |date=2012-05-06 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was regarded as a prominent political voice with the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] [[political party]], her husband's government, and [[Greek politics]].&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news |first=Demetris |last=Nellas|title=Marika Mitsotakis, wife of former Greek PM, dies Dies at 82  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10229738 |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2012-05-06 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nicknamed "Mrs. Marika" among Greeks.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Mitsotakis was born to a prominent Athenian family on November 29, 1930.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; She contracted [[poliomyelitis]] at a [[swimming pool]] when she was thirteen years old.&lt;ref name=greporter/&gt; She survived the illness, but lived with a walking disability for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=greporter/&gt; In addition to her political activities, Mitsotakis became an [[activist]] for [[people with disabilities]] in Greece.&lt;ref name=greporter/&gt;

She married Konstantinos Mitsotakis, member of a [[List of political families in Greece|political family]] from [[Crete]], in 1953.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; The couple had four children: [[Dora Bakoyannis|Dora]], who served as the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece]] from 2006 to 2009 and [[Mayor of Athens]] from 2003 until 2006; Alexandra, a civil-society activist; Aikaterini and [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis|Kyriakos]], a member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] from the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party who on 19 January 2016 was elected President of this party.&lt;ref name=greporter/&gt; Konstantinos served as the head of the New Democracy political party from 1984 to 1993.

===Political influence===
Mitsotakis served as the Spouse of the Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993 during her husband's tenure as head of government.&lt;ref name=greporter/&gt; She assumed the traditional role of the wife of a Prime Minister, being quoted in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' at the time of the [[Greek legislative election, 1990|1990 election]] saying, "Finally, my Kostas, we’ve made it."&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; However, she was known for her political skills and outspokenness. In 1990, soon after taking office, Prime Minister Mitsotakis made his first appearance in the Greek parliament. A member of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) accused Marika of making "insolent gestures" towards socialist politicians during the session.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Marika responded to the lawmaker's accusation, "I'll get my stick and beat you with it."&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; In 1991, Marika publicly criticized Minister of Industry [[Stavros Dimas]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Dimas quickly resigned during an official trip to the [[Soviet Union]] as a result of Marika's criticism.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

Mitsotakis often defended her husband against political opponents. She also likened his calm political style and [[persona]] to the calming effect of Valium, telling a reporter, "If you chopped (him) into little pieces, you could sell him as [[Valium]] tablets."&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

Mitsotakis was widely regarded as an excellent [[cook (profession)|cook]] in Greek political circles, leading to an [[urban legend]] that she used her [[culinary]] skills to influence politics.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Political opponents of Konstantinos Mitsotakis accused her of using food to persuade two members of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] to join a 1989 [[coalition government]] with the conservatives with the purpose of pursuing corruption charges against [[Andreas Papandreou]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Marika used the urban legend to write, publish and market her 2011 best-selling [[cookbook]], ''Recipes With a Bit of History''&lt;ref name="greporter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt; published in English in 2012 with the title ''Recipes of Love''.

Mitsotakis was hospitalized on April 17, 2012.&lt;ref name=greporter2&gt;{{cite news |first=Marianna |last=Tsatsou|title=Former Greek First Lady Marika Mitsotakis Hospitalized  |url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/04/17/former-greek-first-lady-marika-mitsotakis-hospitalized/ |work=[[Greek Reporter]] |publisher= |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She died at the Evgenidion Hospital in Athens on May 6, 2012, at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=greporter/&gt; She was survived by her husband and their four children, thirteen grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=greporter/&gt;

'''Matthew "Matt" Savage''' (born May 12, 1992) is an [[United States|American]] [[autistic savant]] [[musician]]. Born in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=JSF&gt;Pine, Dan. [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/27046/edition_id/518/format/html/displaystory.html "Autistic jazz prodigy already playing with greats"], ''The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California'', 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; he is the son of Diane and Lawrence "Larry" Savage.&lt;ref name=geochamp&gt;Morrow, Marsha. https://web.archive.org/web/20060514114802/http://www.mledger.com/2004/archives/1_news_040804.shtml "N.H. geography champ"] ''[[Monadnock Ledger]]'', 8 April 2004. (cached webpage)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Savage was a precocious infant who walked early and learned to read by the age of 18 months.&lt;ref name=SavantsDSC&gt;''Savants'', [[Discovery Channel]] documentary, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He was diagnosed with [[pervasive developmental disorder]], a form of [[autism]], at age three.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Chad. [http://www.insidebayarea.com/bayarealiving/ci_3049622 "13-year-old Matt Savage has autism and a genius for jazz"], ''InsideBayArea.com'', 21 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not like any noises or music during his early childhood.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;Silberman, Steve. [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/genius.html "The Key to Genius"], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], December 2003, page 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age six, Savage taught himself to read [[piano]] music.&lt;ref name=projo&gt;Massimo, Rick. [http://www.projo.com/music/content/projo_20051023_savage.31f5de3.html "N.H. pianist, 13, considers autism one of his strengths"], ''[[Providence Journal]]'', 23 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[European classical music|classical]] piano for less than a year before discovering [[jazz]], which became his main focus.

He and his younger sister, Kitty, were both [[home schooling|home schooled]].&lt;ref name=geochamp /&gt;  He began studying at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in the fall of 1999.  He continued his classical studies as well.

Among Savage's talents are [[hyperlexia]]&lt;ref name=JSF /&gt; and [[Absolute pitch|perfect pitch]].&lt;ref name=NPRATC&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1142280 "Pianist Matt Savage"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', 24 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Coupled with his extremely high intelligence, these abilities have allowed him to achieve other distinctions as well, such as winning a statewide [[geography bee]].&lt;ref name=geochamp /&gt;

Despite his young age and his autism, and even without formal instruction in musical composition,&lt;ref name=NPRATC /&gt; Savage is an accomplished musician and composer. He has released twelve [[album]]s as a solo performer, as leader of the Matt Savage Trio and as leader of various sized ensembles.  By the age of 14, he had also performed with [[Chaka Khan]] and other popular singers.&lt;ref name="CNN-0916-2006"&gt;''Genius: Quest for Extreme Brain Power'', [[CNN]] program hosted by Dr. [[Sanjay Gupta]], 17 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His compositions are very approachable and often humorous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Savage has received many awards, including being signed in 2003 to [[Bösendorfer]] pianos. He is the only child to be so recognized in the company's 188-year history.

Savage has toured the world, performing for [[head of state|heads of state]] and others, and appearing on numerous television and radio programs such as ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]],'' ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]],'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]''.  In 2006, at age 14, he was featured on a CNN report about the human brain, in which he was defined as a [[prodigious savant]], as opposed to the other types of [[savant syndrome|savants]].&lt;ref name="CNN-0916-2006"/&gt; Savage has also appeared in several documentaries about savants.

In 2007, he played with Scottish folk songwriter/singer Al Stewart, on piano. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 2009, Savage enrolled at [[Berklee]] to continue advancing his musical career. The following year, in November, he prepared to release his ninth CD. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In December 2012, Savage received his B.M. in Performance (Piano) from Berklee College of Music.

In 2014, he composed and recorded the score for a full-length documentary film, ''Sound of Redemption: The Frank Morgan Story''.

In May 2015, he received his M.M. in Jazz Performance (Piano) from the Manhattan School of Music.

Currently, Matt balances his professional music career with teaching.

Since 1975, the '''National Commander of the Civil Air Patrol''' is the senior official within the [[Civil Air Patrol]]. From 1941 until August 1975, the National Commander of CAP was an appointed active duty [[USAAF]] or [[USAF]] officer, typically a General Officer. In September 1975, this became a civilian position held by an active CAP member.  Current and former National Commanders are the only members of the Civil Air Patrol who hold the CAP rank of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]]. The original name of this position was Chairman of the CAP Board. Colonel George A. Stone, Ohio Wing Commander, became the first Chairman, but later died in an aircraft accident. Since 2012, the National Commander also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the CAP Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Change made upon adoption of the [http://www.capmembers.com/media/cms/CAP_Constitution_Bylaws_4BC09E935985F.pdf Constitution and Bylaws of the CAP Corporation] made official on 1 Oct. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Defense Battalions''' ({{lang-ar|كتائب الدفاع الوطني}} "Jahafel al-Difa' al-Watani") were Iraqi Kurdish paramilitary units. Initially emerging from pro-government Kurdish militia raised by the regime of [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] used against Kurdish insurgents in the 1960s, the Battalions were used quite prominent during the Iran-Iraq War, particularly during the [[Anfal Campaign]]. Following the war many units rebelled in 1991 and joined the [[Peshmerga]], although the Battalions survived, albeit in a reduced capacity, until the [[Iraq War|Ba'athist government was toppled in 2003]].

==Structure==
The units originated in the early 1960s during the Iraqi government's counterinsurgency operations against Kurdish guerrillas. In the 1970s the Ba'athist Iraqi government exploited tribal divisions amongst the Kurds, and recruited various tribal leaders, allowing them to form militias from their followers. These units were armed with light weapons and were tasked with policing Kurdish areas, as well as providing intelligence to the Iraqi Army.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 100"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoury |first=Dina Rizk |date= |title=Iraq in Wartime: Soldiering, Martyrdom, and Remembrance |url= |location= |publisher= |page=100 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Iran-Iraq war the Battalions came under the operational command of the Directorate of Military Intelligence and the Army leadership in the Northern Command. The Northern Bureau of the Ba'ath party was responsible for operating and setting policies of the Battalions, as well as reporting on its leaders political activities, and maintaining control over the Battalion's Kurdish conscripts.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 100"/&gt;

The Northern Bureau portrayed the Battalions as part of the Ba'ath party's plan to civilize and modernize the Kurdish population and turn them from tribesmen into Iraqi citizens. A Presidential decree therefore required military-aged men resident in the Autonomous Region to join the Battalions. In spite of official rhetoric the Battalions had been organised along tribal lines from the beginning, with Kurdish tribal leaders being responsible for both raising and maintaining the Battalions. The official title of the Kurdish tribal leaders was that of mutashar (consultant), in an attempt to hide the extent to which the leaders were subject to the power of the central government and government policy,&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 100"/&gt; with those deemed ineffective or potentially disloyal being replaced by other leaders within their clans or being forced to disband their units.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 101"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoury |first=Dina Rizk |date= |title=Iraq in Wartime: Soldiering, Martyrdom, and Remembrance |url= |location= |publisher= |page=101 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, who chose to rebel, or defect, were summarily executed. One Battalion was disbanded because its leader was claiming he controlled 900 soldiers, when in fact he only had 90. Two other Battalions were disbanded, and their leaders executed, because one had failed to fight against the Iranians alongside the [[Iraqi Armed Forces]], whereas the other had attempted to assassinate the commander of the 5th Army Corps. Meanwhile, the leader of the 24th Battalion was executed after rebelling in Mankish in Dohuk Province.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 101"/&gt;

In predominantly Kurdish areas Battalion commanders came under the jurisdiction of the local Party branch, with Battalions being attached to the party offices for [[Nineveh Governorate|Ninewah]], [[Kirkuk Governorate|Ta'mim]], [[Arbil]], [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Sulaymaniyah]], and [[Dohuk]]. The management of training camps, education sessions, the pursuit and capture of deserters, and the close surveillance of Battalion leaders and soldiers were central to the security operations of the Northern Bureau. By 1987 there were 147 Battalions, composing some 250,000 men, which made up nearly 10% of the total Kurdish population under the control of the Northern Bureau.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 101"/&gt; Although 5 Battalions were disbanded in 1987 by the end of the Anfal campaign in August 1989 the force had grown to 321 Battalions made up of 412,636 soldiers. This increase was largely due to the forcible conscription of Kurds at the end of the Anfal campaign.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 101"/&gt; The Battalions weren't only restricted to the North however, and some units even fought in the South in the defense of Basra during [[Operation Karbala-5]].&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 103"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoury |first=Dina Rizk |date= |title=Iraq in Wartime: Soldiering, Martyrdom, and Remembrance |url= |location= |publisher= |page=103 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their counterinsurgency role the Battalions were also seen as a means by which the government could absorb young Kurds, provide them with employment, and prevent or dissuade them from joining the insurgency. The government achieved only limited success however, with the units suffering high desertion rates. It was quite typical for men to continually shift between fighting in the insurgency and fighting in the Battalions. Both choices were problematic, with family members of insurgent being victim to forced deportations and imprisonment, whilst those in the Battalions became pariahs in wider Kurdish society.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 101"/&gt; Desertion however was dangerous, with execution squads being commonplace on the frontlines.&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 102"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoury |first=Dina Rizk |date= |title=Iraq in Wartime: Soldiering, Martyrdom, and Remembrance |url= |location= |publisher= |page=102 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]], and the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|ensuing uprisings]], the 100,000 strong force was dissolved and reorganized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knights |first=Michael |date= |title=Cradle of Conflict: Iraq and the Birth of Modern U.S. Military Power |url= |location= |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=2005 |page=147 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battalions survived until 2003, although in a diminished capacity. By 2002 the units were composed only 1 brigade, and ~1,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=al-Marashi |first=Ibrahim |last2=Salama |first2=Sammy |date= |title=Iraq's Armed Forces: An Analytical History |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |page=192 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The units were derisively referred to as [[Jash (term)|jash]].&lt;ref name="War in Wartime 101"/&gt;

The Battalions, due to their prominence in the Anfal Campaign, have been the subject of controversy in Iraqi Kurdistan. During the 1990s discussion of the Jash remained very much a taboo subject, however this changed following the PUK-KDP peace agreement, as well as the 2006-2007 Tribunal, with the Kurdish press opening up discussion on the subject. Views on the jash remain divided, although there has been a somewhat growing perception of the jash as being [[victim of circumstance|victims of circumstance]], and being forced into the Battalions in order to protect themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tejel |first=Jordi |last2=Sluglett |first2=Peter |last3=Bocco |first3=Riccardo |date= |title=Writing the Modern History of Iraq: Historiographical and Political Challenges |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |page=241 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ghost story by [[William T. Stead]], '''George''' and '''Hart Northey''' were two brothers who lived in St. Eglos, [[Cornwall]] during the early 19th century. Stead writes that the account of one brother who experiences a clairvoyant vision of the other's murder was sent to him by an unnamed correspondent, adding that 'names and places are disguised'.&lt;ref name="Stead1897"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Thomas Stead|title=Real Ghost Stories: A Revised Reprint of the Christmas and New Year's Numbers of the "Review of Reviews" 1891-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGcwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=9 May 2012|year=1897|publisher=G.

== Life ==
Voss was born in [[Flensburg]], [[Germany]]. During the spring and early summer of 1943, the four crematoria at Auschwitz-Birkenau became operational.&lt;ref name=anatomy165&gt;{{cite book|title=Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=978-0-253-32684-3|author=Piper, Franciszek|chapter=Gas Chambers and Crematoria|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this time that Voss became their commander, thus becoming the first of three people who would be in charge of all four Birkenau crematoria during the history of the camp. Subsequent commanders were SS-''Oberscharführer'' [[Eric Muhsfeldt]] and SS-''[[Hauptscharführer]]'' [[Otto Moll]].

Voss is frequently mentioned in the memoirs of Sonderkommando member [[Filip Müller]]. Müller described him as a stocky man of medium height, with a small, slightly hooked nose and a weakness for alcohol, stating that he displayed "neither the fanaticism nor the zeal" of [[Otto Moll]].&lt;ref name=mueller127&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Filip|title=Eyewitness Auschwitz: three years in the gas chambers|year=1999|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Ivan R. Dee]]|isbn=978-1-56663-271-3|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that his SS training had turned him into an "uncritical and willing tool rather than a fanatically cruel exterminator", and offers the analogy that Voss has two personalities: one where he could be "high-spirited, laughing and joking and talking about trivial things", and another where he would be completely indifferent to "shooting men, women and children one after the other" when required of him.&lt;ref name=mueller128&gt;Müller (1999), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller disclosed that another of Voss' weaknesses was valuables such as gold, diamonds, and currency: these could be sewn into discreet places in his uniform under the pretence that if he left it with a tailor from the Sonderkommando while he was on leave, it would be repaired.&lt;ref name=mueller128/&gt; According to Müller, Voss knew what was going on, but such behaviour was common among SS men: they were willing to turn a blind eye as long as there was no risk to themselves.&lt;ref name=mueller128/&gt;

== Hungarian action ==
Voss' tenure ended on May 9, 1944, when SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' [[Rudolf Höss]], beginning his second tour of duty as camp commandant, appointed Otto Moll as chief of the crematoria in preparation for the arrival and destruction of the Jews of [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hgs.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/1/54.abstract|last=White|first=Joseph Robert|title=Target Auschwitz: Historical and Hypothetical German Responses to Allied Attack|journal=Holocaust and genocide studies|year=2002|volume=16|pages=54–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voss was placed in charge of Crematoria IV and V.&lt;ref name=klauschwitz&gt;{{cite book|last=Bezwińska|first=Jadwiga|title=KL Auschwitz seen by the SS|year=1991|publisher=Interpress Publishers.

'''Preston Smith Brooks''' (August 5, 1819 – January 27, 1857) was an American politician and [[United States House of Representatives|Member of the U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[South Carolina]], serving from 1853 until his resignation in July 1856 and again from August 1856 until his death.

Brooks, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was a strong advocate of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and states' rights. He is primarily remembered for his May 22, 1856, attack upon [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and [[United States Senate|Republican Senator]] [[Charles Sumner]], whom he beat nearly to death; Brooks [[Caning_of_Charles_Sumner|beat Sumner with a cane]] on the floor of the [[United States Senate]] in retaliation for an anti-slavery speech in which Sumner verbally attacked Brooks' second cousin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffer |first=Williamjames Hull |date=2010 |title=The Caning of Charles Sumner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA7 |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |page=7 |isbn=978-0-8018-9469-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Puleo |first=Stephen |date=March 29, 2015 |title=The US Senate's Darkest Moment: An Excerpt from Stephen Puleo's Book, "The Caning," About an Infamous Fight Between Two Senators |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2015/03/28/the-senate-darkest-moment/sqXdd3HYKkMFEmGA4d24rM/story.html |newspaper=Boston Globe |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina Senator [[Andrew Butler]].

He resigned his seat in July 1856 to give his constituents the opportunity to ratify his conduct in a special election, which they did by electing him in August to fill the vacancy created by his resignation. He was re-elected to a full term in November 1856, but died in January 1857, five weeks before the new term began in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foreman|first=Amanda|title=A World On Fire: Britain's Crucial Role in the American Civil War|year=2010|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner was seriously injured by Brooks' beating, and was unable to resume his seat in the Senate for three years, though eventually he recovered and resumed his Senate career.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, Williamjames Hull. ''The Caning of Charles Sumner'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks' act and the polarizing national reaction to it are frequently cited as a major factor in the rising tensions leading up to the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;See Hoffer (2010) for full coverage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in Roseland, [[Edgefield County, South Carolina]], he was the son of Whitfield and Mary Parsons-Carroll Brooks. Brooks attended South Carolina College (now known as the [[University of South Carolina]]), but was expelled just before graduation for threatening local police officers with firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollis|first=Daniel Walker|year=1951|title=University of South Carolina: South Carolina College|volume=1|location=Columbia|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving college, he studied law, attained admission to the bar, and practiced in [[Edgefield, South Carolina|Edgefield]].  Brooks also owned a plantation located in Cambridge, between Edgefield and [[Ninety-Six, South Carolina|Ninety-Six]]. In 1840, Brooks fought a duel with future Texas Senator [[Louis T. Wigfall]], and was shot in the hip, forcing him to use a walking cane for the rest of his life. He was admitted to the Bar in 1845. Brooks served in the [[Mexican–American War]] with the [[Antebellum South Carolina#The Mexican–American War|Palmetto Regiment]].

==Political career==
He was a member of the South Carolina state House of Representatives in 1844. Brooks was elected to the [[33rd United States Congress]] in 1853 as a Democrat. Like his fellow South Carolina Representatives and Senators, Brooks took an extreme pro-slavery position, asserting that the enslavement of black people by whites was right and proper, that any attack or restriction on slavery was an attack on the rights and the social structure of the South.

During Brooks' service as Representative, there was great controversy over slavery in [[Kansas]] Territory and whether Kansas would be admitted as a free or slave state. He supported actions by pro-slavery men from Missouri to make Kansas a slave territory. (See ''[[Bleeding Kansas]]''.) In March 1856, Brooks wrote: "The fate of the South is to be decided with the Kansas issue. If Kansas becomes a hireling [i.e. free] State, slave property will decline to half its present value in Missouri&amp;nbsp;... [and] abolitionism will become the prevailing sentiment. So with Arkansas; so with upper Texas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McPherson|first=James M.|authorlink=James M. McPherson |year=1989|title=[[Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era]]|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=149|isbn=978-0-19-503863-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sumner assault==
{{main|Caning of Charles Sumner}}
On May 20, 1856, Senator [[Charles Sumner]] made a speech denouncing "The Crime Against Kansas" and the Southern leaders whom he regarded as complicit, including Senator [[Andrew Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA7 Hoffer, Williamjames Hull. ''The Caning of Charles Sumner'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Sumner compared Butler with [[Don Quixote]] for embracing a prostitute (slavery) as his mistress, saying Butler "believes himself a chivalrous knight".
{{Quote|Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight. I mean the harlot Slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sumner, ''Memoir and Letters of Charles Sumner: 1845–1860'' edited by Edward Pierce (1893) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gBiTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA446 Page 446 online]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Senator [[Stephen Douglas]] of [[Illinois]], who was also a subject of criticism during the speech, suggested to a colleague while Sumner was orating that "this damn fool [Sumner] is going to get himself shot by some other damn fool."&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, John and Charles. ''The Siege of Washington'' (2011) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner's language was intentionally inflammatory; Southerners often claimed that abolition would lead to intermarriage and [[miscegenation]], arguing that abolitionists opposed slavery because they wanted to have sex with and marry black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Przybyszewski |first=Linda |date=1999 |title=The Republic According to John Marshall Harlan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMGRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=southerners+accuse+abolitionists+miscegenation&amp;dq=southerners+accuse+abolitionists+miscegenation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=shKIVbqdKoGDgwS67K74Aw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionists reversed the argument by accusing southerners of loving slavery so they could have slave mistresses at their disposal. As Hoffer (2010) says, "It is also important to note the sexual imagery that recurred throughout the oration, which was neither accidental nor without precedent. Abolitionists routinely accused slaveholders of maintaining slavery so that they could engage in forcible sexual relations with their slaves."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, p 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurence M. Keitt cph.3a02077.jpg|thumb|right|Laurence M. Keitt]]
Brooks thought of challenging Sumner to a duel. He consulted with Representative [[Laurence M. Keitt]] (also a South Carolina Democrat) on dueling etiquette. Keitt said that dueling was for gentlemen of equal social standing. In his view, Sumner was no gentleman; no better than a drunkard, due to his supposedly coarse and insulting language toward Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bama.ua.edu/~ratli003/102/203sample.html|title=The Compromise of 1850, The Kansas/Nebraska Act, ''Dred Scott'', and John Brown's Raid|work=Academic Outreach|publisher=[[University of Alabama]]|accessdate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927163237/http://bama.ua.edu/~ratli003/102/203sample.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/4628|title=Bleeding Congress|work=History Engine|publisher=[[University of Richmond]]|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks then decided to "punish" Sumner with a public beating.

On May 22, two days after Sumner's speech, Brooks entered the Senate chamber in company with Keitt. Also with him was Representative [[Henry A. Edmundson]] (Democrat-[[Virginia]]), a personal friend with his own history of legislative violence. (Edmundson had been arrested by the [[House Sergeant at Arms]] after attempting to attack Representative [[Lewis D. Campbell]] of [[Ohio]] during a tense debate on the House floor in May 1854).&lt;ref&gt;Ford, James. ''History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850: 1850–1854.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ0WOeABRrkC&amp;pg=PA486 p. 486]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|left|300px|J.L. Magee's famous political cartoon of the attack on Sumner]]
Brooks confronted Sumner, who was seated at his desk, writing letters. He said, "Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine." As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks hit Sumner over the head several times with his cane, made of thick [[gutta-percha]] with a gold head. Sumner was trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner wrenched the desk from the floor in an attempt to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA9 Hoffer, Williamjames Hull. ''The Caning of Charles Sumner'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood. He staggered up the aisle and collapsed unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA9 Hoffer, Williamjames Hull. ''The Caning of Charles Sumner'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[John J. Crittenden]], Representative [[Ambrose Murray]], and others attempted to restrain Brooks before he killed Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who brandished a pistol and shouted at the onlookers to leave Brooks and Sumner alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA9 Hoffer, Williamjames Hull. ''The Caning of Charles Sumner'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA9 Hoffer, Williamjames Hull.

''The Caning of Charles Sumner'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks required medical attention before leaving the Capitol, because he had hit himself above his right eye with one of his backswings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hoffer |first=Williamjames Hull |date=2010 |title=The Caning of Charles Sumner: Honor, Idealism, and the Origins of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA9 |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=8–11 |isbn= 978-0-8018-9468-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner suffered head trauma that would cause him chronic pain and symptoms consistent with what would now be called traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, and spent three years convalescing before returning to his Senate seat. He suffered chronic pain and debilitation for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Thomas G. ''Anti-slavery politics in antebellum and Civil War America'' (2007) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the attack==
The national reaction to Brooks' attack was sharply divided along regional lines. In Congress, members in both houses armed themselves when they ventured onto the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maury Klein|title=Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G7DjFOfv3k4C&amp;pg=PA50|year=1999|publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks was widely cheered across the South, where his attack on Sumner was seen as a legitimate and socially justifiable act, upholding the honor of his family (and the South as a whole) in the face of intolerable insults from a social inferior (and the North as a whole). South Carolinians sent Brooks dozens of new canes, with one bearing the phrase, "Good job". The ''Richmond Enquirer'' wrote: "We consider the act good in conception, better in execution, and best of all in consequences. These vulgar abolitionists in the Senate must be lashed into submission." The University of Virginia's [[Jefferson Literary and Debating Society]] sent a new gold-headed cane to replace Brooks' broken one. Another cane was inscribed "Hit him again". Southern lawmakers made rings out of the original cane's remains, which they wore on neck chains to show their solidarity with Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;Puleo, 102, 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman [[Anson Burlingame]] publicly humiliated Brooks in retaliation by goading Brooks into challenging him to a duel, accepting, then watching Brooks back out. Brooks challenged Burlingame to duel, stating he would gladly face him "in any Yankee mudsill of his choosing". Burlingame, a well-known marksman, eagerly accepted, choosing rifles as the weapons and the Navy Yards in the border town of Niagara Falls, Canada, as the location (in order to circumvent the U.S. ban on dueling). Brooks, reportedly dismayed by both Burlingame's unexpectedly enthusiastic acceptance and his reputation as a crack shot, refused to show up, instead citing unspecified risks to his safety if he was to cross "hostile country" (the Northern states) in order to reach Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Warren B. Walsh, "The Beginnings of the Burlingame Mission". ''The Far Eastern Quarterly'', Vol. 4, No. 3 (May 1945), pp. 274–277&lt;/ref&gt;

In the House, a motion to expel Brooks failed, but Brooks resigned his seat anyway on July 15. Brooks claimed that he "meant no disrespect to the Senate of the United States" by attacking Sumner, and also that he had not intended to kill Sumner, or he would have used a different weapon.

Brooks was tried in a [[District of Columbia]] court for the attack. He was convicted of assault and was fined $300, though he was not incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, p 83&lt;/ref&gt;

He was quickly returned to office in a special election on August 1, and elected to a new term of office in November 1856.

In contrast, Northerners, even moderates previously opposed to Sumner's extreme abolitionist invective, were universally shocked by Brooks' violence. Anti-slavery men cited it as evidence that the South had lost interest in national debate, and now relied on "the bludgeon, the revolver, and the bowie-knife" to display their feelings, and silence their opponents. J. L. Magee's political cartoon famously expressed the general Northern sentiment that the South's vaunted [[chivalry]] had degenerated into "Argument versus Clubs". {{Wikisource|On his assault on Charles Sumner}}

==Death==

'''Ralph R. Frerichs''' is Professor Emeritus of [[Epidemiology]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] where he was active as a full-time faculty member in the School of Public Health for 31 years and as the Epidemiology department chair for 13 years, before retiring in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://epi.ph.ucla.edu/ralph-r-frerichs
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Both at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and in international workshops he taught epidemiologic methods, the use of rapid community-based surveys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3172323 | volume=34 | issue=4 | title=Rapid microcomputer surveys | year=1988 | journal=J.

In addition, he consulted on epidemiological and management-related issues with many international agencies including the Albert Schweitzer Foundation, [[Population Council]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in 16 countries:[[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Honduras]], [[Brazil]], [[Kenya]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[Mongolia]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

Since retirement, he authored  ''Deadly River: Cholera and Cover-up in Post-Earthquake Haiti'' ([[Cornell University Press]], 2016),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deadlyriver.com&lt;/ref&gt; is engaged in [[panoramic photography]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ralphfrerichs.com&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to manage the popular [[John Snow]] website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow.html&lt;/ref&gt; which he created to honor the historical father of [[epidemiology]], known for his insightful research on [[cholera]].

== Life and career ==
Ralph Frerichs was born on October 3, 1942 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], the son of [[physicist]] Rudolf Frerichs known for development of the [[Photoresistor|cadmium-sulfide photoconductive cell]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/catalog/inu-ead-nua-archon-363&lt;/ref&gt; and artist and writer Gisela Frerichs. The family moved to the [[United States]] in 1947-48, where his father joined the faculty of [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frerichs obtained his DVM in 1967 from the [[University of Illinois system|University of Illinois]] College of Veterinary Medicine at [[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area|Urbana-Champaign]]. Following two years in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] as Captain in the [[United States Army|US Army]] Veterinary Corp, he obtained the MPH and DrPH ([[epidemiology]]) in 1970 and 1973, respectively from [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine]] in [[New Orleans]].   While working on his doctoral dissertation (development of a computer simulation model for the control of urban rabies)&lt;ref&gt;https://digitallibrary.tulane.edu/islandora/object/tulane%3A25398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1287/mnsc.22.4.411|title = A Computer Simulation Model for the Control of Rabies in an Urban Area of Colombia|journal = Management Science|volume = 22|issue = 4|pages = 411–421|year = 1975|last1 = Frerichs|first1 = Ralph R|last2 = Prawda|first2 = Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was both a research associate with the International Center for Medical Research and Training in [[Cali|Cali, Colombia]] and an instructor at [[Tulane University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2630116|title = Back Matter|journal = Management Science|volume = 22|issue = 4|pages = 505–507|year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
After graduation, Frerichs became Assistant Professor of Preventive Medicine at the [[Louisiana State University School of Medicine|LSU School of Medicine]] in [[New Orleans]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/faculty/frerichs2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/faculty/frerichs2.html&lt;/ref&gt;
and epidemiologist for the Bogalusa Heart Study, a longitudinal study of [[cardiovascular disease]] risk factors in children in the biracial community of [[Bogalusa, Louisiana]].  During his [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] years from 1973–77, his publication topics included pediatric levels of blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frerichs|first=R.

In early 1978, Frerichs joined the epidemiology faculty at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], rising through the ranks from assistant to full professor, while expanding his research interests both domestically and internationally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8743">'''"Red Legs" Greaves''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[buccaneer]] active in the [[Caribbean]] and the  [[West Indies]] during the 1670s. His nickname came from the term ''[[Redlegs]]'' used to refer to the class of poor whites that lived on colonial Barbados.

Although considered a successful pirate during his career, most notably his raid of [[Margarita Island]] in the mid-1670s, he is best known for his escape from prison during an [[earthquake]].  

His story does not appear in historical records of the era and he may have been fictional.

==Authenticity==
Greaves’ story does not appear in period accounts of Margarita, pirate trials, or other documents. It first appears in 1924's ''The Pirate’s Who’s Who'' by Philip Gosse, in which Gosse cites no sources. Gosse’s work appeared only two years after [[Rafael Sabatini]]’s popular novel [[Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]], and Gosse’s description of Greaves parallels Sabatini's Captain Blood closely.&lt;ref name="Pitcaithly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitcaithly|first1=Marcus|title=Pirate Corner: The kilted buccaneer|url=http://marcuspitcaithly.wixsite.com/marcus-pitcaithly/single-post/2014/07/15/Pirate-Corner-The-kilted-buccaneer|website=Marcus Pitcaithly|accessdate=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Greaves' parents had been tried for treason for their participation during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and sold into slavery, as were many Royalists and Covenanters in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Idiot's Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selinger|first1=Gail|last2=Jr|first2=W. Thomas Smith|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pirates|date=2006|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=9781592573769|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMBGul8qB60C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is thought to have been born in 1649 in [[Barbados]].

Born a short time after his parents' arrival in Barbados, Greaves became the servant of a kindly master. However, his parents and master died a short time after another, and the orphaned boy was sold to another man who was claimed to have been violent and to have often beaten Greaves as a teenager.&lt;ref name="GAOP-web" /&gt;

==Piratical career==
During this time, concerned for his survival, he attempted to escape his servitude and successfully managed to swim across [[Carlisle Bay]], stowing away on a ship preparing to leave Barbados. Although he assumed the vessel was a merchantship on its way to a far off port, the ship was actually a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] commanded by a Captain Hawkins. Hawkins was known throughout the Caribbean as an unusually cruel pirate, often torturing captives, especially women, and rarely showing mercy to the crews of ships he attacked. Although feared by his crew, he was respected and very successful in capturing rich prizes.&lt;ref name="Everything Pirates" /&gt;

After being discovered on board, Greaves was given the option of signing with the crew ''"offering the articles on a platter along with a pistol"''.  Although reluctant to join the crew under force, Greaves showed promise and quickly gained a reputation as a capable and efficient sailor.&lt;ref name="Idiot's Guide" /&gt;

However, he soon grew to resent and hate Captain Hawkins, both for being forced into his crew as for his distaste for brutality towards captured prisoners. The two eventually fought a duel, often claimed to be over the torture of a prisoner, although it is more likely Hawkins attacked Greaves for failing to obey his orders. During the fight, Greaves killed Hawkins and was elected by the crew to succeed Hawkins as captain.&lt;ref name="Idiot's Guide" /&gt;

==Captain Greaves==
Accepting their request, Greaves rewrote the Ship's [[Pirate articles|Articles]], specifically prohibiting the mistreatment of prisoners and allowing the surrender of merchant captains during battle. Throughout the decade, Greaves found great success as well as gaining a reputation as an honorable captain widely known for his humane treatment of prisoners and never participating in the raiding of poor coastal villages.&lt;ref name="GAOP-web"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humanity|first1=History of|title=Buccaneers {{!}} "Red Legs" Greaves|url=http://www.goldenageofpiracy.org/buccaneers/red-legs-greaves.php|website=www.goldenageofpiracy.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Around 1675, he captured Margarita Island off the coast of [[Venezuela]]. After capturing the local Spanish fleet, he turned their guns against the island's coastal defences and successfully stormed the town. After taking a large amount of pearls and gold, he soon left without further looting the town or harming the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Pirate King-web"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ossian|first1=Rob|title="Red Legs" Greaves|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/greaves_red_legs.htm|website=www.thepirateking.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and escape==
After the raid, Greaves was able to retire from piracy and settled down to the life of a gentleman farmer in [[Nevis]]. However, after being recognized by one of his former victims, he was turned in to authorities to collect the reward offered for his capture.&lt;ref name="Everything Pirates"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karg|first1=Barb|last2=Spaite|first2=Arjean|title=The Everything Pirates Book: A Swashbuckling History of Adventure on the High Seas|date=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=Avon MA|isbn=9781605502694|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GnsDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greaves was found guilty of piracy and, despite his reputation, no leniency was shown towards him and he was sentenced to be [[Gibbet|hanged in chains]]. While imprisoned in the prison dungeon to await his execution, the town was submerged by an earthquake. Greaves was one of the few survivors and was eventually picked up by a whaling ship.&lt;ref name="Pirate King-web" /&gt; Some stories of Greaves describe his escape from prison in Port Royal, Jamaica, which was damaged by an earthquake and tidal wave in 1692.&lt;ref name="Everything Pirates" /&gt; Other accounts claim he had been imprisoned on Nevis, which is alternately describes as suffering its own earthquake and tidal wave in either 1680 or 1690.&lt;ref name="Gosse - Who’s Who" /&gt;

In gratitude, he joined the crew of the whaling ship and later became a pirate hunter, eventually earning a [[Pardon|royal pardon]] for his efforts in the capture of a pirate ship which had been raiding local whaling fleets. After his pardon, he again retired to a plantation and became known as a philanthropist in his later years, donating much of his wealth to various island charities and public works before his death of [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]].&lt;ref name="Gosse - Who’s Who"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gosse|first1=Philip|title=The Pirates' Who's Who by Philip Gosse|date=1924|publisher=Burt Franklin|location=New York|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19564/19564-h/19564-h.htm|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert McNair Price''' (born July 7, 1954) is an American theologian and writer, known for arguing against the existence of a [[historical Jesus]] (the [[Christ myth theory]]). He taught philosophy and religion at the [[Johnnie Colemon]] Theological Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jctseminary.org/REGISTER.aspx jctseminary.org online courses]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a professor of [[biblical criticism]] at the [[Center for Inquiry#CFI Institute|Center for Inquiry Institute]], and the author of a number of books on theology and the [[historicity of Jesus]].

A former Baptist minister, he was the editor of the ''[[Journal of Higher Criticism]]'' from 1994 until it ceased publication in 2003. He has also written extensively about the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], a "[[shared universe]]" created by the writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/ ''Journal of Higher Criticism''], accessed April 9, 2010; [[Joshi, S. T.]] and Schultz, David E. ''[[An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia]]''. Hippocampus Press, p. 217. {{ISBN|0-9748789-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-wrote a book with his wife, Carol Selby Price, ''Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush'' (1999), on the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]].

Price is a fellow of the [[Jesus Seminar]], a group of 150 writers and scholars who study the historicity of Jesus, the organizer of a Web community for those interested in the [[history of Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;Tokasz, Jay.

==Background==
Price was born in Jackson, Mississippi in 1954 and moved to New Jersey in 1964. He received a [[Master of Theological Studies]] in New Testament from [[Gordon–Conwell Theological Seminary]] in 1978. At [[Drew University]] he was awarded one Ph.D. in Systematic Theology in 1981 and another in New Testament in 1991. He was pastor of the First Baptist Church in [[Montclair, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Jesusproject /&gt; He has served as Professor of Religion at [[University of Mount Olive|Mount Olive College]], Professor of Theology and Scriptural Studies at Johnnie Colemon Theological Seminary and Professor of Biblical Criticism for the Center for Inquiry Institute in [[Amherst, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehumanbible.net/about |title= About the Show |website= The Human Bible |publisher= Center for Inquiry Institute |date=n.d. |access-date= March 1, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious writings==
Price believes that Christianity is a historicized synthesis of mainly [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Jewish mythology|Jewish]], and [[Greek mythology|Greek mythologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M. "Jesus at the Vanishing Point" in James K. Beilby &amp; Paul Rhodes Eddy (eds.) ''The Historical Jesus: Five Views''. InterVarsity, 2009, p. 55ff.

Retrieved 2010-08-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Price questioned the historicity of Jesus in a series of books, including ''Deconstructing Jesus'' (2000), ''The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man'' (2003), ''Jesus Is Dead'' (2007), and ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'' (2012), as well as in contributions to ''The Historical Jesus: Five Views'' (2009), in which  he acknowledges that he stands against the majority view of scholars, but cautions against attempting to settle the issue by [[Argumentum ad populum|appeal to the majority]].&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M. "Jesus at the Vanishing Point" in James K. Beilby &amp; Paul Rhodes Eddy (eds.) ''The Historical Jesus: Five Views''. InterVarsity, 2009, p. 61ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Price challenges [[biblical literalism]] and argues for a more sceptical and [[humanistic]] approach to Christianity.

Price argues that if critical methodology is applied with ruthless consistency, one is left in complete [[agnosticism]] regarding Jesus's historicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M. Price|title=The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man: How Reliable Is the Gospel Tradition?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmlB-KXsX8kC&amp;pg=PA351|year=2003|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-028-0|page=351|quote=One wonders if all these scholars came to a certain point and stopped, their assumption being.

But it becomes almost arbitrary to think so.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price is quoted saying, "There might have been a historical Jesus, but unless someone discovers his diary or his skeleton, we'll never know."&lt;ref name=PriceJacoby&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Douglas|title=Compelling Evidence for God and the Bible: Finding Truth in an Age of Doubt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bA8iSFIptYC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2010|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|isbn=978-0-7369-3759-7|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacoby-Price Debate|url=https://www.douglasjacoby.com/jacoby-price-debate/|website=Douglas Jacoby Website|access-date=18 July 2017|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also similarly declared in a 1997 public debate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If there was a historical Jesus lying back of the gospel Christ, he can never be recovered. If there ever was a historical Jesus, there isn't one any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Robert M.|authorlink1=Robert M.

([http://infidels.org/library/modern/robert_price/price-rankin/price1.html Opening Statement by Robert Price])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing accounts that have Jesus being crucified under [[Alexander Jannaeus]] (83 BCE) or in his 50s by [[Herod Agrippa|Herod Agrippa I]] under the rule of [[Claudius|Claudius Caesar]] (41–54 CE), Price argues that these "varying dates are the residue of various attempts to anchor an originally mythic or legendary Jesus in more or less recent history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M.

Price does not see in the [[Q source|Q document]] a reliable source for the [[historical Jesus]], simply because Q shows everywhere a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] flavor, representing a school of thought rather than necessarily the teaching of a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Robert M.|authorlink1=Robert M.

However, Price points out that, even assuming the authenticity of these references, they relate more to the claims of the Christians who lived at that time on Jesus, and do not prove that Jesus was a contemporary of the writers of antiquity.

=== Gospels and Acts ===
Price asserts that there was an almost complete fleshing out of the details of the gospels by a [[Midrash]] ([[haggadah]]) rewriting of the [[Septuagint]], [[Homer]], [[The Bacchae|Euripides' Bacchae]], and [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Price|first=Robert M.|title=New Testament narrative as Old Testament midrash|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Midrash: Biblical Interpretation in Formative Judaism|editor=[[Jacob Neusner]] and Alan J. Avery-Peck|year=2005|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=90-04-14166-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a fellow of the [[Jesus Project]] he also noted this in an article that he contributed, ''The Quest of the Mythical Jesus'', writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I realized, after studying much previous research on the question [of Jesus], that virtually every story in the gospels and Acts can be shown to be very likely a Christian rewrite of material from the Septuagint, Homer, Euripides' Bacchae, and Josephus. ...&amp;nbsp;A literary origin is always to be preferred to an historical one in such a case. And that is the choice we have to make in virtually every case of New Testament narrative. I refer the interested reader to my essay "New Testament Narrative as Old Testament Midrash," in Jacob Neusner and Alan Avery-Peck, eds., Encyclopedia of Midrash. Of course I am dependent here upon many fine works by [[Randel Helms]], [[Thomas L. Brodie]], [[John Dominic Crossan]], and others. None of them went as far as I am going. It is just that as I counted up the gospel stories I felt each scholar had convincingly traced back to a previous literary prototype, it dawned on me that there was virtually nothing left. None tried to argue for the fictive character of the whole tradition, and each offered some cases I found arbitrary and implausible. Still, their work, when combined, militated toward a wholly fictive Jesus story. [...] There may once have been an historical Jesus, but for us there is one no longer. If he existed, he is forever lost behind the stained glass curtain of holy myth. At least that's the current state of the evidence as I see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M.

He argues that the comparisons were known at the time, as early church father [[Justin Martyr]] had admitted the similarities. Price suggests that Christianity simply adopted themes from the dying-rising god stories of the day and supplemented them with themes (escaping crosses, empty tombs, children being persecuted by tyrants, etc.) from the popular stories of the day in order to come up with the narratives about Christ.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Per the Kyrios Christos Cult] The ancient Mediterranean world was hip-deep in religions centering on the death and resurrection of a savior god. [...] It is very hard not to see extensive and basic similarities between these religions and the Christian religion. But somehow Christian scholars have managed not to see it, and this, one must suspect, for dogmatic reasons. [...] But it seems to me that the definitive proof that the resurrection of the Mystery Religion saviors preceded Christianity is the fact that ancient Christian apologists did not deny it! [...] A Christ religion modeled after a Mystery cult ''is'' a Mystery cult, [and against Mack's Christ cult] a Christ cult worthy of the name. This is what we expect Burton Mack to be talking about when he talks about Christ cults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M.

Price notes that historians of [[classical antiquity]] approached mythical figures such as [[Heracles]] by rejecting supernatural tales while doggedly assuming that "a genuine historical figure" could be identified at the root of the legend. He describes this general approach as [[Euhemerism]], and argues that most historical Jesus research today is also Euhemerist.&lt;ref name="1-57392-758-9" /&gt; Price argues that Jesus is like other ancient mythic figures, in that no mundane, secular information seems to have survived. Accordingly, Jesus also should be regarded as a mythic figure.  But, Price admits to some  uncertainty in this regard. He writes at the conclusion of his 2000 book ''Deconstructing Jesus'': "There may have been a real figure there, but there is simply no longer any way of being sure."&lt;!-- R --&gt;&lt;ref name="1-57392-758-9" /&gt;&lt;!-- R --&gt;{{refn|group=note|In ''Deconstructing Jesus'' Price points out, "(w)hat one Jesus reconstruction leaves aside, the next one takes up and makes its cornerstone. Jesus simply wears too many hats in the Gospels—[[exorcist]], [[Faith healing|healer]], [[king]], [[prophet]], [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]], [[rabbi]], [[demigod]], and so on. The Jesus Christ of the New Testament is a composite figure (...) The historical Jesus (if there was one) might well have been a [[Messianism|messianic]] king, or a progressive [[Pharisees|Pharisee]], or a [[Galilean]] [[Shamanism|shaman]], or a [[Magi|magus]], or a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] sage. But he cannot very well have been all of them at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M. (2000). ''Deconstructing Jesus'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Price also states "I am not trying to say that there was a single origin of the Christian savior Jesus Christ, and that origin is pure myth; rather, I am saying that there may indeed have been such a myth, and that if so, it eventually flowed together with other Jesus images, some one of which may have been based on a historical Jesus the Nazorean."&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M. (2000). ''Deconstructing Jesus'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In a discussion on [[euhemerism]], Price cautiously asserts that "a genuine historical figure" may ultimately lie at the root of the Christian religion.&lt;ref name="1-57392-758-9" /&gt; That figure (about whom he detects no surviving mundane, secular information) would have eventually been made into God through [[apotheosis]]. But Price admits uncertainty in this regard. He writes in conclusion, "There may have been a real figure there, but there is simply no longer any way of being sure."&lt;ref name="1-57392-758-9" /&gt;}}&lt;!-- ** --&gt;

=== Christ myth theory ===
Price gives three key points for the traditional [[Christ myth theory]], which originated with [[Bruno Bauer]] and the [[Radical criticism|Dutch Radical School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|title=The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man: How Reliable Is the Gospel Tradition?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmlB-KXsX8kC&amp;pg=PA350|year=2003|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-028-0|page=350|quote=Most of the Dutch Radical scholars, following Bruno Bauer, argued that all of the gospel tradition was fabricated to historicize an originally bare datum of a savior, perhaps derived from the Mystery Religions or Gnosticism or even further afield. The basic argument offered for this position, it seems to me, is that of analogy, the resemblances between Jesus and Gnostic and Mystery Religion saviors being just too numerous and close to dismiss.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no mention of a miracle-working Jesus in secular sources; Price asserts that [[Eusebius]] fabricated the ''[[Josephus on Jesus#Testimonium Flavianum|Testimonium Flavianum]]''.&lt;ref name="Price.2010.testimonium"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M. Price|editor=James K. Beilby, Paul Rhodes Eddy|title=The Historical Jesus: Five Views|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O33P7xrFnLQC&amp;pg=PA62|date=4 February 2010|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-7853-6|page=62|chapter=Jesus at the Vanishing Point|quote=[The Traditional Christ-Myth Theory - The first of the three pillars] ''Why no mention of a miracle-working Jesus in secular sources?'' ...For the record, my guess is that Eusebius fabricated it [the ''Testimonium Flavianum''] and that the tenth-century Arabic version represents an abridgement of the Eusebian original, not a more primitive, modest version.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Epistle#New Testament epistles|epistle]]s, written earlier than the [[gospel]]s, provide no evidence of a recent historical Jesus; all that can be taken from the epistles, Price argues, is that a Jesus Christ, son of God, lived in a heavenly realm, there died as a sacrifice for human sin, was raised by God, and enthroned in heaven.&lt;ref name="Price.2010.epistles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|editor=James K. Beilby, Paul Rhodes Eddy|title=The Historical Jesus: Five Views|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O33P7xrFnLQC&amp;pg=PA63|date=4 February 2010|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-7853-6|page=63|chapter=Jesus at the Vanishing Point|quote=The second of the three pillars of the traditional Christ-Myth case is that ''the Epistles, earlier than the Gospels, do not evidence a recent historical Jesus''. Setting aside the very late 1 Timothy, which presupposes the Gospel of John (the only Gospel in which Jesus "made a good confession before Pontius Pilate"), we should never guess from the Epistles that Jesus died in any particular historical or political context, only that the fallen angels (Col 2:15), the archons of this age, did him in, little realizing they were sealing their own doom (1 Cor 2:6-8).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Jesus narrative is paralleled in Middle Eastern myths about dying and rising gods; Price names [[Baʿal#Deities called Baʿal and Baʿalath|Baal]], [[Osiris]], [[Attis]], [[Adonis]], and [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi/Tammuz]] as examples, all of which, he writes, survived into the Hellenistic and Roman periods and thereby influenced [[Early Christianity]]. Price alleges that [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] have tried to downplay these parallels.&lt;ref name="Price.2010.hellenistic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M. Price|editor=James K. Beilby, Paul Rhodes Eddy|title=The Historical Jesus: Five Views|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O33P7xrFnLQC&amp;pg=PA75|date=4 February 2010|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-7853-6|page=75|chapter=Jesus at the Vanishing Point|quote=[Dying-and-Rising Gods] The Jesus story as attested in the Epistles shows strong parallels to Middle Eastern religions based on the myths of dying-and-rising gods. (And this similarity is the third pillar of the traditional Christ-Myth theory.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price maintains that the Christ myth theory is the most likely explanation for the origin of Christianity, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me summarize the major factors that lead me to accept the Christ Myth as the most likely hypothesis to explain the data.
{{paragraph break}}First, almost every story in the Gospels (and Acts) can be plausibly argued to be borrowed from the Greek Old Testament, Homer, or Euripides. Use Occam's razor: Which is more likely: that a man fed 5,000 with a handful of loaves and fish, or that a gospel writer rewrote an already ancient myth about Elisha doing the same darn thing?{{paragraph break}}Second, every detail of the narrated life of Jesus fits the outlines of the Mythic Hero archetype present in all cultures: divine annunciation of the pregnancy, miraculous conception and birth, heralding of the birth by wise men, stellar phenomena marking the event, child prodigy behavior embarrassing the adults, temptation by a devil at the outset of his career, wonders and contests with evil forces, coronation as king, popular acclaim giving way to hostility, death on a hill top, uncertainty as to the place of burial, postmortem appearances, annunciations of a heavenly ascension. Sound familiar? Granted, many of these mythemes get stuck like barnacles to the bow of the biographies of real historical figures, like Caesar Augustus, but in those cases there remains considerable "leftover," secular information tying the figure into contemporary history. All such links in the gospels, ''e.g.'', with Herod the Great, Joseph Caiaphas, and Pontius Pilate, are so problematical on internal grounds that most critical scholars, never meaning to espouse Mythicism, reject these features of the story as legendary.{{paragraph break}}Third, the epistles, regardless of their dates as earlier or later than the gospels, seem to enshrine a different vein of early Christian faith which lacked an earthly Jesus, a Christianity that understood "Jesus" as an honorific throne-name bestowed on a spiritual savior who had been ambushed and killed by the Archons who rule the universe before he rose triumphant over them. Gnosticism, too, continued this tradition. But what we know as Christianity eventually rewrote Jesus into an historical incarnation who suffered at the hands of earthly institutions of religion and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M.

''The Cthulhu Cycle'', for example, saw the origins of [[Cthulhu]] the octopoid entity in [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s "The Kraken" (1830) and particular passages from [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], while ''The Dunwich Cycle'' points to the influence of [[Arthur Machen]] on Lovecraft's "[[The Dunwich Horror]]."

Price's religious background often informs his Mythos criticism, seeing [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] themes in Lovecraft's fictional god [[Azathoth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Most of the early ''Cthulhu'' books by [[Chaosium]] were overseen by Price; his first book was ''The Hastur Cycle'' (1993), an anthology of short stories which traced the development of a single Lovecraftian element, and this was followed by ''Mysteries of the Worm'' (1993), a collection of [[Robert Bloch]]'s Mythos fiction.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Melanie Tait of 2CN Canberra ABC interviewing Stella Young at Floriade Canberra.JPG|thumb| Stella Young being interviewed at [[Floriade (Canberra)|Floriade]] in 2013]]
Young served as the editor for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s online magazine, ''[[Ramp Up]]''.&lt;ref name=rampup/&gt; Before joining the ABC, she had worked as an educator in public programs at [[Melbourne Museum]], and hosted eight seasons of ''No Limits'', a disability culture program on community television station [[C31 Melbourne|Channel 31]].&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news |last1=Calligeros|first1=Marissa |title=Stella Young dead: comedian, ABC journalist and disability advocate dies at 32 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/comedy/stella-young-dead-comedian-abc-journalist-and-disability-advocate-dies-at-32-20141208-122ch8.html |accessdate=8 December 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Ramp Up'' editorial published in July 2012 she deconstructed society's habit of turning disabled people into what she called "[[inspiration porn]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stella |last=Young |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-03/young-inspiration-porn/4107006 |title=We're not here for your inspiration - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=3 July 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further popularized in her April 2014 [[TED (conference)|TEDxSydney]] talk, entitled "I'm not your inspiration, thank you very much".&lt;ref name=tedtalk /&gt;

Having previously appeared in several comedy showcases and group shows, Stella made her festival debut as a solo performer at the 2014 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]]. Her show ''Tales from the Crip'', directed by [[Nelly Thomas]], won her the award for best newcomer at the festival.&lt;ref name=smh /&gt;

She was a member of the boards of the Ministerial Advisory Council for the Department of Victorian Communities, Victorian Disability Advisory Council,  the Youth Disability Advocacy Service and Women with Disabilities Victoria.&lt;ref name=abc-death&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-08/stella-young--dies-writer-comedian-and-disability-activist/5950640 |title=Stella Young, writer, comedian and disability activist dies |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=8 December 2014 |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Young was inducted posthumously onto the [[Victorian Honour Roll of Women]] in recognition of her work as a  "journalist, comedian, feminist and fierce disability activist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Honour Roll of Women 2017|url=http://www.vic.gov.au/women/women-s-leadership/victorian-honour-roll-of-women.html|website=Women Victoria (vic.gov.au)|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuskaloosa''' (''Tuskalusa'', ''Tastaluca'', ''Tuskaluza'') (died 1540) was a [[paramount chief]] of a [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] [[chiefdom]] in what is now the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]]. His people were possibly ancestors to the several southern Native American confederacies (the [[Choctaw]] and [[Muscogee|Creek]] peoples) who later emerged in the region. The modern city of [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] is named for him.

Tuskaloosa is notable for leading the [[Battle of Mabila]] at his fortified village against the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto]]. After being taken hostage by the Spanish as they passed through his territory, Tuskaloosa organized a surprise attack on his captors at Mabila, but was ultimately defeated.

Contemporary records describe the paramount chief as being very tall and well built, with some of the chroniclers saying Tuaskaloosa stood a foot and a half taller than the Spaniards. His name, derived from the western [[Muskogean language]] elements ''taska'' and ''losa'', means "Black Warrior".&lt;ref name=CH1&gt;

==De Soto expedition==
{{unref|section|date=October 2018}}
Tuskaloosa and his chiefdom are recorded in the chronicles of [[Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition, which arrived in North America in 1539. De Soto had been appointed Governor of [[Cuba]] by King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos I]] of Spain, who directed him to conquer [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], which was taken to comprise what is now the [[Southern United States]], as ''[[adelantado]]''. In 1539, De Soto landed near [[Tampa, Florida]] with 600-1,000 men and 200 horses and began a circuitous exploration of modern-day [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Alabama]], often engaging in violent conflict with the indigenous peoples. As they traveled, the expedition kidnapped natives to act as bearers and interpreters of the many different language families (Muskogean, [[Yamasee language|Yamasee]], [[Iroquoian]] [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], and others) of the Southeast. The conquistadors frequently took a local chief [[hostage]] to guarantee safe passage through his territory. By October 1540, the Expedition had reached the middle of modern-day Alabama.

Tuskaloosa's province consisted of a series of villages, mostly along the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Alabama River]]s. Each village had its own chief who was a vassal to Tuskaloosa, the [[paramount chief]]. After traveling through the [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] Province, the De Soto expedition came to the village of Talisi on September 18, 1540, near the modern town of [[Childersburg, Alabama]]. The chief of Talisi and his vassals had fled the town before them, but de Soto sent messages to the chief, who returned on September 25.&lt;ref name="Hudson 1997 pp. 226"&gt;Hudson (1997), ''Knights of Spain'', pp. 226–229&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Chief Talisi had shown his obedience by supplying the Spaniards with requested deerskins, food, bearers, and women, de Soto released the paramount chief of [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], whom they had held hostage while traveling through his territory. Chief Coosa was angry that he was taken so far from his home village and that de Soto still held his sister, who was probably the mother of his successor as chief according to the region's [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] system. De Soto evidently thought Talisi was subject to Coosa, although the village was closer to Tuskaloosa. As such the chief may have had dual allegiances to both chiefdoms and balanced between them.&lt;ref name="Hudson 1997 pp. 226"/&gt;

Tuskaloosa sent an envoy led by his son and several head men to meet the Spanish in Talisi. The envoy intended to assess Spanish expedition in order to prepare a trap for them. The Spanish rested at Talisi for several weeks, then departed on October 5. During the next several days, they reached about one village of the Tuskaloosa province per day. These included Casiste, situated on a stream; and Caxa, another village on a stream, possibly [[Hatchett Creek]], the boundary between the Coosa and the Tuskaloosa. The next day they camped on the Coosa River, across from the village of Humati, near the mouth of [[Shoal Creek (Alabama)|Shoal Creek]]. On October 8 they came to a newly built settlement named Uxapita, possibly near modern [[Wetumpka, Alabama]]. On October 9, de Soto crossed the [[Tallapoosa River]], and by the end of the day, his party was within a few miles of Tuskalusa's village, Atahachi.&lt;ref name="Hudson 1997 pp. 226"/&gt;

De Soto sent a messenger to tell the chief he and his army had arrived, and the chief responded that they could go to the court whenever de Soto liked. The next day de Soto sent [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]] to tell the chief that they were on their way. The paramount village was a large, recently built, fortified community with a [[platform mound]] and plaza. Upon entering the village, de Soto was taken to meet the chief under a portico on top of the mound.&lt;ref name="Hudson 1997 pp. 226"/&gt;

{{quote|Chapter VII-In which is related what happened to the commander Hernando de Soto, in his intercourse with the Chief of Tascaluza...who was such a tall man that he seemed a giant: Sunday, October 10, 1540, the Governor entered the village of Tascaluça, which is called Athahachi, a recent village. And the chief was on a kind of balcony on a [[platform mound|mound]] at one side of the square, his head covered by a kind of coif like the ''almaizal'', so that his headdress was like a [[moors|Moor]]'s which gave him an aspect of authority; he also wore a ''pelote'' or mantle of feathers down to his feet, very imposing; he was seated on some high cushions, and many of the principal men among his Indians were with him. He was as tall as that Tony (Antonico) of the Emperor, our lord's guard, and well proportioned, a fine and comely figure of a man. He had a son, a young man as tall as himself but more slender. Before this chief there stood always an Indian of graceful mien holding a parasol on a handle something like a round and very large fly fan, with a [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|cross]] similar to that of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of the Order of St. John of Rhodes]], in the middle of a black field, and the cross was white. And although the Governor entered the [[plaza]] and alighted from his horse and went up to him, he did not rise, but remained passive in perfect composure and as if he had been a king.|''Rodrigo Ranjel 1544''&lt;ref name="siu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/RRanjel.htm|title=A Narrative of de Soto's Expedition based on the Diary of Rodrigo Ranjel|others=Edward G.

Moscoso and his men mounted their horses and galloped around the plaza, playing ''juego de cañas'',&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Juego de cañas]]&lt;/ref&gt; a dangerous sport involving jousting with lances. The men occasionally feinted toward Tuskaloosa, hoping to frighten him, a technique of manipulation de Soto had used against the [[Inca]] [[Atahualpa]] at [[Cajamarca]]. The chief sat as though unconcerned. Afterward the Indians served the Spaniards food, and the residents of Atahachi danced in the plaza, reminding the Spaniards of rural dances in their own country. When de Soto demanded porters and women from the chief, the chief said that he was accustomed to being served, and not vice versa. De Soto had Tuskaloosa taken hostage. The expedition began making plans to leave the next day, and Tuskaloosa relented, providing bearers for the Spaniards. He informed de Soto that they would have to go to his town of ''[[Mabila]]'' (or ''Mauvila'')&lt;ref name="maubilianind"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old Mobile Project Newsletter|work="University of South Alabama Center for Archaeological Studies"|url=http://www.usouthal.edu/archaeology/pdf/issue-17.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to receive the women. De Soto gave the chief a pair of boots and a red cloak to reward him for his cooperation.&lt;ref name=CH1/&gt;

The expedition departed Atachaci on October 12, and the next day arrived in the village of Piachi, situated high on a cliff overlooking the Alabama River. Here the Spaniards began noticing signs of resistance from the native population. De Soto demanded canoes from the people of Piachi, but the chief claimed his people did not have any. The expedition was forced to wait two days as they built rafts to cross to the north side of the river.&lt;ref name="HT87"&gt;{{cite book
| editors=[[Charles M. Hudson (author)]] and Carmen Chavez Tesser
| title=The Forgotten Centuries | page=87 | year=1994
| publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After crossing, they noticed that two Spaniards were missing, Juan de Villalobos (who liked to explore the countryside) and an unnamed man looking for a runaway Indian slave. De Soto ordered Tuskaloosa to have his people produced or he would be burned at the stake; the chief said only that the men would be returned at Mabila.&lt;ref name="Hudson 1997 pp. 234"&gt;Hudson (1997), ''Knights of Spain,'' pp. 234–238/240&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, de Soto and the expedition arrived at Mabila, a small, heavily fortified village situated on a plain.&lt;ref name=HT87/&gt; It had a wooden [[palisade]] encircling it, with [[bastion]]s every so often for archers to shoot from. The Spaniards knew something was amiss: the population of the town was almost exclusively male, young warriors and men of status. There were several women, but no children. The Spaniards also noticed the palisade had been recently strengthened, and that all trees, bushes and even weeds had been cleared from outside the settlement for the length of a crossbow shot. Outside the palisade in the field, they saw an older warrior haranguing younger men, or leading them in mock skirmishes and military exercises.&lt;ref name="Hudson 1997 pp. 234"/&gt; A small community in southeast Kentucky bears his name along with other towns and cities.

==Battle of Mabila==
{{main|Mabila}}
As de Soto approached the town, the chief of Mabila came out to greet him, bringing him three robes of [[marten]] skins as a gift. De Soto and several of his men dismounted and entered the town, as the native bearers placed the Spaniards' supplies next to the palisade. The Mabilians danced and sang to the Spaniards, seemingly to allay their fears and to distract them. While the spectacle unfolded, Tuskaloosa told de Soto he was tired of marching with the Spaniards, and wished to stay in Mabila. De Soto refused, and the chief asked to confer with some of his nobles in one of the large [[wattle and daub]] houses on the plaza. De Soto sent Juan Ortiz to retrieve him, but the Mabilians refused him entrance to the house. Tuskaloosa told de Soto and his expedition to leave in peace, or he and his allies would force him to leave.

[[Image:De Soto burns Mabila HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|De Soto's men burn Mabila, illustration by H. Roe]]

When de Soto sent men into the house to retrieve the chief, they discovered it was full of armed warriors prepared to protect their chief. De Soto asked the Chief of Mabila to demand the porters promised by Tuskaloosa, and the Spaniards would leave. The man refused, and a Spaniard grabbed him; in the ensuing scuffle, the chief had his arm cut off by the Spaniard's sword. With this, the Mabilians attacked the Spanish, who immediately ran for the gate and their horses. Natives came from all of the houses and attacked the Spaniards. The Mabilians grabbed the provisions and equipment left outside the palisade and brought the supplies into the town. After making it outside, the Spaniards regrouped and assaulted the village. After numerous assaults and many hours (the battle lasted eight or nine hours), the Spaniards were able to hack holes into the walls of the palisade and reenter the town.&lt;ref name="Hudson 1997 pp. 234"/&gt;

{{quote|We entered the town and set it on fire, whereby a number of Indians were burned, and all that we had was consumed, so that there remained not a thing. We fought that day until nightfall, without a single Indian having surrendered to us- they fighting bravely on like lions. We killed them all, either with fire or the sword, or, such of them as came out, with the lance, so that when it was nearly dark there remained only three alive; and these, taking the women that had been brought to dance, placed the twenty in front, who, crossing their hands, made signs to us that we should come for them. The Christians advancing toward the women, these turned aside, and the three men behind them shot their arrows at us, when we killed two of them. The last Indian, not to surrender, climbed a tree that was in the fence, and taking the cord from his bow, tied it about his neck, and from a limb hanged himself.|''Luys Biedma 1544''&lt;ref name=LB44/&gt;}}&lt;!--Need year of translation--&gt;

==After the battle==

===Mabilians===
The Spaniards burned down Mabila, and nearly all the Mabilians and their allies were killed, either in the battle, in the subsequent fires, or by suicide. Chief Tuskaloosa's son was found among the dead, although the chief was not. Biedma asserts that over five thousand were in the town, of which almost none was able to escape.&lt;ref name="LB44"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several weeks afterward, the Spanish made forays to neighboring villages for supplies of [[maize]], deerskins, and other goods, finding many wounded and dead Mabilians in the houses. The natives had made two serious mistakes: they had not realized Spaniards' advantage when mounted on horses, and they had relied too heavily on their palisade. Once the Spanish breached the palisade, the Mabilians were too crowded in the village to mount a successful defense.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (1997), ''Knights of Spain,'' p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few centuries, the Tuskaloosa, Coosa, [[Plaquemine culture|Plaquemine]] [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] peoples from the Mississippi and [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]] valleys, and other native peoples came together to form a confederacy that became the historic tribe known as the [[Choctaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Patricia Galloway]]|title=Choctaw Genesis-1500 to 1700|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Arden, 2nd Baron Alvanley''' (8 January 1789 – 16 November 1849) was a [[British Army]] officer, peer and socialite, who was one of a close circle of young men surrounding the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].

==Early life and military career==
Alvanley was the son of [[Richard Arden, 1st Baron Alvanley]] and Anne Wilbraham-Bootle. Initially pursuing a career as an officer in the British Army, purchased an [[ensign (rank)|ensigncy]] in the [[Coldstream Guards]]. He was promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] in March 1809.&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette'', no. 16243, 4 April 1809&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to the [[50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot]], and exchanged to the [[half-pay]] of the [[100th Regiment of Foot (Prince Regent's County of Dublin Regiment)|100th Regiment of Foot]] on 1 September 1812.&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette'', no. 16639, 29 August 1812&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to his subsequent debts, he was forced to dispose of his half-pay on 10 June 1826.&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette'', no. 18256, 10 June 1826&lt;/ref&gt; He later served in the Forest Troop, King's Regiment of [[Cheshire Yeomanry]] Cavalry, as a [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]], but resigned on 17 January 1840.&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette'', no. 19817, 24 January 1840&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regency buck==
Lord Alvanley was a prominent [[English Regency|Regency]] buck and member of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]'s circle, and was friends with [[Beau Brummell]]. He was popular in society and regarded as wittiest man of his day. He, Brummell, Henry Mildmay, and Henry Pierrepoint were considered the prime movers of [[Watier's]] club, dubbed "the [[Dandy]] Club" by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]. They were also the four hosts of the July 1813 [[masquerade ball]] at which the Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepoint, but then "cut" Brummell and Mildmay by snubbing them, staring them in the face but not speaking to them. Brummell then said to Alvanley, "Alvanley, who's your fat friend?". The Prince Regent was not amused; this incident was the final and most public sign that Brummell was no longer favored by "Prinny".

Alvanley continued to support Brummell, sending money to his friend during Brummell's exile in France. In 1835, Alvanley fought a [[List of famous duels|duel]] with [[Morgan O'Connell]]. According to a near contemporary report, "[Alvanley] went through the business with the most perfect ''sang froid'', but on his way to the field he whimsically intimated a singular alarm. Having descended a hollow, 'My Lord', said he to his second, 'you get me down well enough, but', alluding to his full size, 'should I fall, I do not know how the devil you will ever get me up again.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Mirror of literature, amusement, and instruction'', Volume V, Aird and Burstall, London. 1844 [https://books.google.com/books?id=szsYAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=lieutenant-colonel+Richard+Arden&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=lieutenant-colonel%20Richard%20Arden&amp;f=false p. 185]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had an extremely lavish lifestyle, funded by income generated by the estates that his father had bought. His prominent position in society also allowed him to float a line of credit. However, his debts became untenable and eventually his family estates had to be sold to pay them off. [[Underbank Hall]] in [[Stockport]] was sold by auction in 1823 and most of the [[Bredbury]] estate was sold in lots in 1825. In 1827 he sold the Willington Estate to [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] veteran [[William Tomkinson]], land that would become the site of [[Willington Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Willington Hall: History|url=http://willingtonhall.co.uk/about-us/|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arden Hall mansion was sold in 1833. He eventually resigned his membership of [[White's]]. The death of George IV in 1830 saw Alvanley's society position deteriorate, which was furthered hampered by his limited income. He occasionally contributed to debates in the [[House of Lords]]. He did not marry and had no children. On his death, the title went to his only brother, the Hon. Colonel [[Richard Arden, 3rd Baron Alvanley|Richard Arden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bernard Burke]] (editor). ''The St. James's magazine: and heraldic and historical register'', Volume 2, 1850.

'''Yvonne Madelaine Brill''' ([[née]] '''Claeys'''; December 30, 1924&amp;nbsp;– March 27, 2013) was a Canadian-American rocket and jet propulsion engineer.&lt;ref name=Weil_Brill /&gt; During her career she was involved in a broad range of national space programs in the United States, including [[NASA]] and the [[International Maritime Satellite Organization]].&lt;ref name=SunObit&gt;QMI AGENCY, [http://www.torontosun.com/2013/03/30/pioneer-canadian-rocket-scientist-dead-at-age-88 "Pioneer Canadian rocket scientist dead at age 88"], ''[[The Toronto Sun]]'', March 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Invent Now, [http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/407.html "HALL OF FAME/ Inventor Profile"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407220237/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/407.html |date=April 7, 2013 }}, ''Invent Now'', Accessed March 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brill was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Her parents were immigrants from Belgium.&lt;ref name=Weil_Brill&gt;{{cite news|last=Weil|first=Martin|title=Yvonne Brill, pioneer in spacecraft propulsion, dies at 88|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/yvonne-brill-pioneer-in-spacecraft-propulsion-dies-at-88/2013/03/31/f8f77d38-99c7-11e2-b68f-dc5c4b47e519_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=12 March 2014|date=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the University of Manitoba, but was barred from studying engineering because of her gender, so she studied chemistry and mathematics.&lt;ref name=space.com_brill&gt;{{cite web|last=Gannon|first=Megan|title=Pioneering Rocket Scientist Yvonne Brill Dies at 88|url=http://www.space.com/20467-yvonne-brill-rocket-scientist-obituary.html|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Brill's work in satellite propulsion systems resulted in a number of significant developments. She developed the concept for a new rocket engine, the [[hydrazine]] [[resistojet rocket|resistojet]], and she proposed the use of a single propellant because of the value and simplicity that it would provide. Her invention resulted in not only higher engine performance but also increased reliability of the propulsion system.

'''Zaib-un-Nissa''' (Bengali: '''জেবুন্নেসা হামিদুল্লাহ''') ([[transliterated]] '''Zeb-un-Nissa, Zaibunnissa, Zaibun Nisa, Zaibunisa, Zaib-un-Nisa, Zebunnissa, Zeb-un-Nisa''')''' Hamidullah''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|زیب النساء حمیداللہ}}}}; 25 December 1918 &amp;ndash; 10 September 2000) was a Pakistani writer and journalist. She was a pioneer of [[Pakistani literature]] and [[Journalism|journalism]] in English, and also a pioneer of [[feminism]] in Pakistan. She was Pakistan's first female columnist (in English), editor, publisher and political commentator. [[Zaibunnisa Street]] in [[Karachi]] was named after her.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epaper.dawn.com/print-textview.php?StoryImage=16_12_2017_708_001 |title=A sisterhood with nerves of steel|publisher=Dawn (newspaper)|author=Naziha Syed Ali|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947, she wrote for many Indian newspapers, and was the first Muslim woman to write a column in an Indian newspaper. After independence, her column in the newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' made her the first female political commentator in Pakistan. After she left ''Dawn'', she became the founder and editor-publisher of the ''[[Mirror (Pakistani magazine)|Mirror]]'', the first social glossy magazine in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; Due to her status as Pakistan's first female editor, she became the first woman to be included in press delegations sent to other countries. On one of these delegations, in 1955, she became the first woman to speak at the ancient [[al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], Egypt.&lt;ref name=Dawn2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041201155957/http://www.dawn.com/2000/09/12/ed.htm#2 Profile of Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah on Dawn (newspaper)] Archived from the original on 1 December 2004, Retrieved 9 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Zeb-un-Nissa Ali was born in 1921 to a literary family in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. Her father, [[S. Wajid Ali]], was the first person to translate the writings of the well-known [[Urdu]] poet [[Muhammad Iqbal]] into [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and was an avid [[Bengali people|Bengali]] and Indian nationalist and writer. She had two brothers, and one half-brother from her mother's second marriage. She grew up in a tightly-knit [[Anglo-Indian]] household filled with Bengali thinkers and philosophers of the age, as her father's house at 48, Jhowtalla Road, was something of a meeting place for the Calcutta literary circle. She started to write at an early age, and received considerable support from both her English mother and Bengali father. A lonely child, Zeb-un-Nissa took to writing poetry as a means to express her thoughts and emotions. Her later writing was affected by her trips to rural areas of Bengal and the Punjab, including her father's birthplace, the Bengali village of Tajpur. She was educated at the [[Loreto Schools, Kolkata|Loreto House Convent]].

==Marriage==
[[File:Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah Young.jpg|254px|thumb|right|Zeb-un-Nissa Hamidullah, just after her marriage.]]
In 1940, she married Khalifa Muhammad Hamidullah. Unlike most marriages of the time, hers was not an [[arranged marriage]]. She moved with him to the Punjab, Pakistan after their marriage. He worked there as an executive for the [[Bata Shoes|Bata]] shoe company. During  [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947, she and her husband helped refugees coming across the border from India.

Her husband, belonged to a well-known Punjabi family. His father, [[Khalifa Mohammad Asadullah]], was the librarian of the [[National Library of India|Imperial Library]] in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Hamidullah was the head of Bata's operations in Pakistan, and was sent to head Bata in [[Ireland]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

All of her books were dedicated to him, proof of their devotion to one another. They had two children: Nilofar (b. 1943) and Yasmine (b. 1949).

After moving to the Punjab in 1942, Begum Hamidullah was shocked. Raised in an Anglo-Indian household, she found it hard to adjust to the very different lifestyle of her husband's large Punjabi family. It took time for her to adjust, as she admitted in the foreword to ''The Young Wife''.

==Career==

===1936–1943===
Begum Hamidullah first came into prominence in 1936, when a poem of hers was accepted for publication by [[Bombay]]'s ''[[Illustrated Weekly of India]]''.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; From then on, she was a regular contributor to that newspaper, until independence in 1947. In 1941, her first book of poetry, ''Indian Bouquet'', was published by her father's publishing house and proved to be very popular. All copies of the first edition were sold in three months. She followed up on her early success with ''Lotus Leaves'', another book of poetry.

===1944–1946===
In 1945, [[Begum]] Hamidullah and her husband were in Simla at the time of the [[Simla Conference]]. It was here that she met [[Fatima Jinnah]]. They became friends, and Jinnah soon managed to get her an exclusive interview with her brother, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. This was a landmark in the young Begum Hamidullah's career, and it brought her India-wide fame. Her stories, poems and articles also began to bring her more fame around this time.

===1947–1951===
After independence in 1947, Begum Hamidullah decided to work in the field of journalism, and soon established herself as an outspoken writer in her column "Thru a Woman's Eyes", in the Karachi daily ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|newspaper Dawn]]''.&lt;ref name=Dawn2/&gt;  This column began in December 1948. After some time, she rebelled against the limited scope of the feature, declaring that women should have the right to comment on every subject, including politics. Altaf Husain, then editor of ''Dawn'', eventually agreed to give her a wider scope. He recognised the merit of her work by giving her a new assignment – that of a columnist appearing on the editorial page. Begum Hamidullah became the first female political commentator of Pakistan. Her column established her reputation as an honest columnist who was not afraid to voice her opinions. It was also a huge step for the [[women's rights]] movement in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

===1951–1956===
In 1951, she left ''Dawn'', after editor [[Altaf Husain]] demanded that she focus her writing on "issues relating to women," and not tackle political developments. Hamidullah founded a monthly magazine called the ''[[Mirror (Pakistani magazine)| Mirror]]'', and became its editor and publisher in 1952.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; She became a businesswoman as well as the first female editor and publisher in the nation. Her glossy social pictorial, with its courageous and sincere editorials, was an instant success.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

The ''Mirror'' became very popular, and Begum Hamidullah soon became quite famous as a journalist and editor. The Pakistani government included her in numerous press delegations during this period.

She was one of the founding members of the [[Pakistani Working Women's Association]], as well as a close friend of [[Fatima Jinnah]], sister of [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]], and [[Begum Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan]], wife of Pakistan's first prime minister, [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]. Some of her other close friends were: [[Hakim Said]], Salima Ahmed, [[Ardeshir Cowasjee]], [[Syed Hashim Raza]], [[Shaista Ikramullah]], and Jahanara Habibullah.

She was a founder member of the Karachi branch of [[Business and Professional Women's Foundation]], and served as its first chapter-president. She held this position for two consecutive terms. She was also the first president of the ''Women's International Club'' of Karachi, a member of the Horticultural Society, and first woman-president of the Flower Show Committee. Another organisation Hamidullah played an important role in was the [[All Pakistan Women's Association]], founded by her friend Begum Raana Liaquat Ali Khan.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

In 1955, as part of a press delegation to Cairo, she became the first woman to speak at the ancient [[Al-Azhar University]]. Her speech was controversial, as she discussed Pakistan's Kashmir issue. However, it was a great distinction for her.&lt;ref name=Dawn2/&gt;

In 1956, Begum Hamidullah wrote a travelogue entitled ''Sixty Days in America'', about her trip to the USA as part of a World Leaders Program, during which she befriended people like [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Jean Negulesco]], and appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. This travelogue consisted of columns she had written for a newspaper, ''The Times of Karachi'', during her trip. The editor, [[ZA Suleri]], gave her permission to reprint the columns in book form as a travelogue which she did.

The following year, she represented Pakistan at the United Nations sponsored seminar on Civic Responsibilities and Increased Participation of Asian Women in Public Life.

===Ban on the ''Mirror''===
In 1957, her outspoken criticism of the harsh regime of Major-General [[Iskander Mirza]], and the forced resignation of [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], culminated in a six-month government ban on the ''[[Mirror (Pakistani magazine)|Mirror]]'', issued on 9 November. This ban, she was privately informed, would be withdrawn if she publicly apologised. She refused to do this and, on the advice of the well-known lawyer [[A.K. Brohi]], appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

After Brohi's intervention on her behalf, the Supreme Court passed judgement in her favour. Holding the order of the Central Government illegal and unconstitutional, the government awarded her the costs of petition to Begum Hamidullah. This incident made journalistic history, and gave her the distinction of being the first woman journalist to have won a case in the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

===1958–1961===
In 1958, she published an anthology of her short stories, ''The Young Wife and Other Stories'', which was so popular that second and third editions were printed in 1971 and 1987 respectively. Eminent critics, from newspapers and periodicals both Pakistani and foreign, called some of the stories in it "...the most significant literary productions of Pakistan". It was during this period that her editorials started to become a major feature of the ''Mirror'', and this increased the popularity of both her and her magazine.

In April 1961, Begum Hamidullah opened her own publishing house: Mirror Press. Mirror Press, and its subsidiary, Mirror Publications, were charged with printing the Mirror from 1961 onwards. They also did other jobs, but the publishing house remained small.

===The 1960s===
The ''Mirror'' became a highly controversial magazine in the '60s, mainly due to Begum Hamidullah's editorials, which were highly critical of the government's authoritarian form of rule. As her magazine became and more and more risqué, Begum Hamidullah began to feel that she and her family could soon be in danger. Highly critical of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] and his government, Begum Hamidullah dropped out of governmental favour. As such, the ''Mirror'' lost government advertisements and patronage.&lt;ref name=Dawn2/&gt;

During this period, she wrote a series of very critical editorials about Ayub Khan's style of government, starting with "Please, Mr. President!", a very emotional open letter in which she pleaded with him to stop ordering the police to harm students taking part in demonstrations. After Khan replied to the first editorial with a letter in which he dismissed Begum Hamidullah as "rashly emotional", the tension steadily increased. The ''Mirror'' came close to being banned many times, and was actually banned twice. However, this period of her career came to a climax in the February 1969 edition of the ''Mirror'', in which she published both "Please Mr. President!" and a new editorial, "No, thank you, Sir!". She claimed that the situation had not improved and that "Pakistanis from Peshawar to Chittagong are crying 'out with Ayub!'".

Ayub Khan soon abdicated, ironically doing exactly what she had advised him to do. However, she continued to write critical editorials whenever she felt the government was in need of a rebuke.

===1969–1971===
Begum Hamidullah was Deputy Leader of the Pakistani delegation to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] from 1970 to 1971. In 1971, after civil unrest and the subsequent independence of Bangladesh, Begum Hamidullah sent a telegram congratulating the new government but chose to remain in Pakistan.

In 1971, Begum Hamidullah's husband was transferred to [[Ireland]], to head Bata operations there. As neither of her two daughters was willing to take over the magazine, she closed it down, and sold off her publishing house, Mirror Press.&lt;ref name=Dawn2/&gt;

===1971–1979===
For most of the 1970s, she and her husband lived in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been transferred. Zaib-un-Nissa put her career on hold to be with her husband, and visited Pakistan regularly. She returned near the end of the decade and began writing a column entitled "Thinking Aloud" for the Pakistani magazine ''MAG'', part of the large [[Jang Group]].

===1980–1983===
In the early 1980s, she served as president of the [[All Pakistan Women's Association]] (APWA), an organisation she had played a major role in since its inception. Still writing columns for the ''Morning News'' of Karachi, she continued to comment on the socio-political aspects of Pakistani society. However, she was becoming increasingly reclusive.

===Retirement===
In 1983, Begum Hamidullah husband had a heart attack, and he died the next year. On the day of his funeral, she wrote what was to become the most famous article of her later career. This introspective piece was published in the ''Morning News'' the day after her husband's death.

She was plunged into sadness following her husband's death, and soon retired from an active writing life. Disenchanted with the new generation of Pakistanis, Begum Hamidullah fell into seclusion and soon moved in with her daughter, choosing to spend her remaining years with her family. She retired from an active career, and only wrote occasional articles during the 1980s.

In 1987, however, she was plunged into the public eye once again, when her book of short stories, ''The Young Wife and Other Stories'', was republished due to popular demand. Yet this late fame did not last very long, and she soon went back into seclusion.

==Death==
Begum Hamidullah died on 10 September 2000, at the age of 81. She had been rushed to the hospital on the 9th, but died in the early hours of the 10th, due to water in her lungs.

An obituary in ''Dawn'' newspaper said "even her detractors admired her for the courage of conviction and the strength of character she displayed throughout her life." Another newspaper obituary said "She will be long remembered for her pioneering role in a certain genre of journalism in Pakistan, and as a powerful and courageous writer."&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

In the 1960s, the government named a major street in the [[Saddar|Karachi city centre]] after her: [[Zaibunnisa Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1233680 This week 50 years ago: Parking on Elphinstone Street made punishable] Dawn (newspaper), Updated 18 January 2016, Retrieved 9 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
After Begum Hamidullah's death, her [[copyright]] passed to her younger daughter, Yasmine S. Ahmed. This included the right to all her pictures, works, etc. Due to popular demand, a fourth edition of ''The Young Wife and Other Stories'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]], Pakistan in August 2008.

==Zaib-un-Nissa or Zeb-un-Nissa?==
There has been much confusion about the correct spelling of Begum Hamidullah's name. She was originally named Zeb-un-Nissa after the Mughal Princess [[Zeb-un-Nissa]], and kept this spelling of her name throughout most of her life. However, there was much confusion, as, due to the pronunciation, most people thought her name was spelt Zaib-un-Nissa. In 1970, when the government named [[Zaibunnisa Street]] in her honour, she changed the spelling of her name permanently to Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah. This has become the more common and accepted spelling of her name, and is the spelling most widely used today. However, most readers of the ''Mirror'' still remember her as Zeb-un-Nissa Hamidullah, as that was how she was credited in the magazine. In latter anthologies, like ''A Dragonfly in the Sun'' by [[Muneeza Shamsie]], she was credited as Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah.

Even though the first part of her name is now accepted as 'Zaib', there is still some confusion, with various [[transliterations]] popping up. Zaibunnisa, Zaibunnissa, Zaibunissa and Zaibunisa are the most common errors.
