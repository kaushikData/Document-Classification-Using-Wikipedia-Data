'''1984 Network Liberty Alliance''' is a loose group of software programmers, artists, social activists and militants, interested in computers and networks and considering them tools to empower and link the various actors of the social movement around the world. They are part of the [[hacktivism]] movement.

==History==
The group was formed in November 1984, during a "debriefing" workshop of the [[European Peace Marches]] on the [[Hartmannswillerkopf]] in [[Alsace]], France, following the struggle against the installation of [[Pershing II]] and [[SS-20]] nuclear missiles in Germany ([[Mutlangen]]). From 1978 to 1985, this European-wide peace movement had mobilized millions of citizens, protesting the arms race, the growth of military spending and joining in the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].

In reference to [[George Orwell]]'s novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]] and to the [[Rebel Alliance]] of the movie [[Star Wars]], the group chose the (ironic) name '''1984 Network Liberty Alliance'''. Founders are [[André Gorz]], French philosopher, [[Dov Lerner]], [[MIT]] computer graduate and disciple of [[Saul Alinsky]], as well as [[Gregoire Seither]], free radio activist, [[Frauke Hahn]] who had led the woman's resistance ('Commons Women') at [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]], [[David Szwarc]] from the Israeli [[Peace movement]] and [[Adama Drasiweni]], computer graduate from the [[University of London]], future founder of [[N'DA]], Africa's first independent telecom company. 

Other members, like Australian co-founder of [[Indymedia]] Matthew Arnison, south-African anti-apartheid militant [[Peter Makema]] and Israeli peace activists [[Uri Avnery]] and [[Michel Warchawsky]], joined later on. All were active in various social movements and peace initiatives in Europe and the USA.

When [[Richard Stallman]] published the [[GNU Manifesto]] in March 1985 and called for participation and support, Dov Lerner and Gregor Seither started organizing regular meetings and workshops in order to train activists in the use of [[information technology]] and gather support for the [[Free Software]] movement. Adama Drasiweni, owner of a computer business in London, set up similar workshops in [[Kibera]], a giant slum outside of [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. 

In France, the Alliance used the network of the [[Maisons de l'Informatique]] that had been set up under the presidency of [[François Mitterrand]] as well as the computer labs of Paris University, who access to academic networks and Billboard Systems. The group ran a number of BBS, among them 'Pom-Pom', devoted to the Apple Macintosh and 'PeaceNet', an "electronic pow-wow" to help social activists and community organizers exchange information around the world, offering free mail accounts and file hosting services.

Very soon the issues of free speech, software patents, civil rights and surveillance became some of the major topics addressed by the Alliance, the group being accused of [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] and [[fork]] software. One of the BBS run by the group [telnet://gaia.rebelalliance.net:1800 'Gaia rising'], was accused by the German government of being a meeting point for radical environmental activists as well as anarchists. 

The Liberty Alliance was particularly active in the popular worldwide resistance to [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]]s (MAI) in the mid-1990s, networking multiple groups and providing "open cyberspaces" for activists to share information and experience. 

In the summer of 1998 the first ''alternative media centre'' was set up in a bus in [[Birmingham]], United Kingdom during the [[Global Street Party]], an international day of protest and festive actions coinciding with the 24th G8 Summit. The alternative media centres also provided interpretation and language services to international militant meetings, like during the July 1999 '''Global [[Carnival against Capitalism]]''', or '''J18 London''', a giant rally and party in the heart of the London City, meant as a counter-summit to the 25th G8 Summit in Köln, Germany. 

Members of the team travelled to the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in Seattle to set up an '''alternative media centre''' during the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity]]. The project joined with that of other media activists and, out of the necessity to bypass the corporate media and report on a WTO conference but also to show how one could bypass corporate software (Windows), the independent media agency [[Indymedia]] was born. 

Language diversity and the lack of interpreters led a number of activists to start thinking about a way to help militants from around the world to bridge the language barrier. Three years later, during the [[27th G8 summit]] in Genoa, Italy, this would lead to the creation of the [[Babels]] network of volunteer interpreters and translators for linguistic diversity and social change.

Members of the Network Liberty Alliance have worked on social IT projects in North America ([[San Francisco Free Software]] movement, Chicago community cybercenter), Central America ([[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]], [[Panama]]), the Middle-East ([[Egypt]], [[Occupied Palestine]]) as well as in the Asia Pacific region ([[Indonesia]], [[Nouvelle-Calédonie]], Australia, [[Papua Niugini]]) and Africa ([[Malawi]], [[Mali]], [[Cameroon]]).

When the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, another member of the Alliance, Stefan Ostrowsky, transferred "NET(te) Bude" (a play on the word NET like network, and 'Nette Bude', nice crashpad in German), a community IT training centre to East-Berlin, thus becoming the first 'Cybercafe' behind the iron curtain.

{{italictitle}}
'''''Agrarian Justice''''' is the title of a [[pamphlet]] written by [[Thomas Paine]] and published in 1797, which proposed that those who possess cultivated land owe the community a ground rent,&lt;ref&gt;Agrarian Justice, Wikisource edition, paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt; and that this justifies an [[estate tax]] to fund universal old-age and disability pensions, as well as a fixed sum to be paid to all citizens upon reaching maturity.

It was written in the winter of 1795–96, but remained unpublished for a year, Paine being undecided whether or not it would be best to wait until the end of the [[First Coalition|ongoing war with France]] before publishing. However, having read a sermon by [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Richard Watson]], the [[Bishop of Llandaff]], which discussed the "Wisdom ... of God, in having made both Rich and Poor", he felt the need to publish, under the argument that "rich" and "poor" were arbitrary divisions, not divinely created ones.&lt;ref&gt;Author's preface. Penguin edition, pp. 80–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed system==

In response to the private sale of royal (or common) lands, Paine proposed a detailed plan to [[Land value tax|tax land]] owners once per generation to pay for the needs of those who have no land.  This can be considered a precursor of the modern idea of [[citizen's dividend]] or [[basic income]]. The money would be raised by taxing all direct inheritances at 10%, and "indirect" inheritances – those not going to close relations – at a somewhat higher rate; this would, he estimated, raise around £5,700,000 per year in England.&lt;ref&gt;Penguin edition, pp. 92–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around two-thirds of the fund would be spent on pension payments of £10 per year to every person over the age of fifty, which Paine had taken as his average adult life expectancy.

Most of the remainder would be used to make fixed payments of £15 to every man and woman on reaching the age of twenty-one, [[legal majority]].

The small remainder of the money raised still un-used would be used for paying pensions to "the lame and blind".&lt;ref&gt;Penguin edition, pp. 93–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

For context, the average weekly wage of an agricultural labourer was around 9 shillings, which would mean an annual income of about £23 for an able-bodied man working throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Figures are an annual average for 1795. Taken from tables in Bowley (1898), p. 706&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical background==

The work is based on the contention that in the state of nature, "the earth, in its natural uncultivated state... was the common property of the human race"; the concept of private ownership arose as a necessary result of the development of [[agriculture]], since it was impossible to distinguish the possession of improvements to the land from the possession of the land itself. Thus, Paine viewed private property as necessary while at the same time asserting that the basic needs of all humanity must be provided for by those with property, who have originally taken it from the general public. This in some sense is their "payment" to non-property holders for the right to hold private property.

'''Āli Musliyār''' (1861–1922) [[Malayalam]]: ആലി മുസ്ലിയാർ, [[Arabic]]: عالي مسليار), born '''Erikkunnan Pālattu Mūlayil Āli''' was a local religoius leader in moplah riot against British rule in the 1921–22 [[Malabar Rebellion|Malabar riots]] in [[Madras Presidency]], [[British India]].  He was a sufi of Qadiriyya Tariqah.&lt;ref&gt;jaihoon.tv/6472.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Musliyār was an [[Masjid al-Haram]] educated Islamic scholar who served as the Imam of Tirurangadi Mosque from 1907 until his eventual execution for leading malabar rebellion at Coimbatore Prison. He was an active orator of the [[Khilafat Movement]].

== Early life and career in Mecca ==
Āli Musliyar was born in Nellikkunattu desom, [[Eranad taluk]], [[Malabar district]] to Kunhimoitīn Molla and Kōtakkal Āmina. Kōtakkal Āmina was a member of the famous Maqdoom family of [[Ponnani]], known for their religious scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;''Histories of the Non-Co-operation and Khilafat Movements'', PC  Bamford, Deep Publications, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Musliyar's grandfather, Mūsa, was one of several  "Malappuram Martyrs". Ali Musliyar began his education studying the [[Quran|Qur'an]], [[Tajwid|tajwīd]] and the [[Malayalam|Malayālam]] language with Kakkadammal Kunnukammu Molla. He was sent to [[Ponnani]] Darse for further studies in religion and philosophy, under the tutelage of [[Zainuddin Makhdoom|Shiekh Zainuddin Maqdum I (Akhir)]], which he successfully completed after 10 years.

He then went to Haram, [[Makah|Makkah]] (Mecca) for further education. Throughout this period, he was guided by several famous scholars, including Sayyid Ahmed Sahni Dahlan, Shiekh Muhammed Hisbullahi Makki, and Sayyid Husain Habshi. After spending seven years in Mecca, he went on to serve as the Chief Qasi in [[Kavaratti]], [[Laccadive Islands]].

== Musliyar in Malabar ==
In 1894, after learning of the slaying of his brother and several other family members, Musliyar returned to Malabar. He discovered that many of his relations and fellow students were lost during an 1896 riot. In 1907 he was appointed as the Chief Musliyar of the mosque at Tirurangadi, Eranad taluk.

He .became a Khilafat leader, on the introduction of the Khilafat movement, was installed as Khilafat King on the 22nd August 1921 at the Jamat Mosque and issued edicts proclaiming his assumption, of office and directing that in future market fees, ferry and toll revenue belong to the Khilafat Government.

He posed as a great leader of the people. Khilafat and non-co-operation meetings were held regularly under Ali Musaliar, and "these constant preachings, combined with the resolution passed in the All-India Khilafat Conference at Karachi last July, led  the ignorant Moplahs to believe that the end of the British Government in India was at hand. AH Musaliar and his lieutenants were making secret preparations for active and direct hostility against the British Government. News was spread that the Amir of Afghanistan was about to invade India and, with the assistance of Gandhi and Ali Brothers, would establish the Khilafat rule in the country. Khilafat volunteers were recruited and made to swear on the Holy Koran that they would be ready to die for the cause of the Khilafat. Ali  Musaliar also made his volunteer corps parade throughout the locality, armed and in their uniforms, and such demonstrations added to the strength of this mischievous movement." (Public Prosecutor's speech, West Coast Spectator, October 6, 1920).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moplah Rebellion, 1921|last=Gopalan Nair|first=Diwan Bahadur|publisher=Norman Printing Bureau|year=1926|isbn=|location=https://archive.org/stream/MoplahRebellion1921/Moplah%20rebellion,%201921_djvu.txt|pages=Many}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of the future Khilafat army were in the 'making, and, at an anti-non-co-operation Meeting held at Ponnani on 24 July to counteract the effects of the Khilafat agitation, Ali Musaliar, "turned up with his volunteer force of about 50 to 100 volunteers armed with big Khilafat knives and clad in Khilafat uniform, marching under a red flag, with shouts of Allah-Ho-Akbar. The volunteers rushed the Police in the bazaar."  (Judgement in Case No. 7/21).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

No evidence has yet been forthcoming to warrant the allegation regarding agrarian discontent, but it would appear that there was some trouble — what it was, it is not possible to say — between the Pookotur Moplahs and the Manager Tirumulpad of the Pookotur Estate. This lack of cordiality was aggravated by the Police search instituted at the instance of the Manager, and V. Mohammad exploited the Khilafat movement and the fractious temper of his co-religionists to wreak vengeance. The Moplahs demanded " their wages at 9 o'clock at night, threatened the , manager and became very turbulent " (Appendix VII) and in this jungly, remote and fanatical hamlet of Pookotur, the civil administration practically ceased to function  from 2 August 1921.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The revolt of 1921–22 began following the police attempt to arrest  3 leaders, of which Ali Musaliar was one among them on 20 August 1921. Rumours were spread by Moplahs that the British troops had destroyed the Mampuram Mosque, and the Moplah gangs were brought out in huge numbers, estimated to be between 15,000 to 30,000. This led to large scale massacre of British troops, Hindu peasantry, rich Hindu landlords, and severe damage to the government infrastructure including buildings, rail bridges, roads etc throughout South Malabar.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Spencer C. Tucker ''Encyclopedia of Insurgency and Counterinsurgency: A New Era of Modern Warfare: A New Era of Modern Warfare'' ABC-CLIO, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

That this was not a riot or a class revolt, but a planning Caliphate uprising is based on evidence as follows
* The Khilafat Volunteers, were mostly dressed in Khaki uniform and had swords for everyone.
* The volunteers were all enlisted before 1921 under the Congress non-cooperation movement. Up to 100 Khilafat committees were formed, and people enlisted.
* The volunteers, had emblems, and carried a Red flag, and shouted Allah-u-Akbar as they went on parades.
* Hindu blacksmiths of the locality were intimidated into making swords and knives, a good many of these out of carpenters' saws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Their target was kill british government buildings, and their supporters both rich and poor people.
* They dug trenches and lay in ambush and went after British troops in many villages.

The events of the day — 20 August — are summarised in the following Press Communique, dated 26 August 1921
It is not correct to say the khilafat fighters directed Hindus because of that they were being Hindus. They targeted all the people who were loyal to the British. Here on the one side stood Hindus and Muslims who supported the British and those who were against them. Muslims who supported the British were also not spared.  And also we have no evidence the khilafatists raping women, tearing pregnant women's bellies to expose the new born.

''"This attempt to make searches and arrests under legal warrants in due conformity with the law has been a signal for an outburst of fanaticism throughout Ernad, Walluvanad and Ponnani directed first against European Officials and Non-officials and latterly against Hindu Jenmis* and others. Public Offices have been looted everywhere, Manast and Kovilagams pillaged, Hindus murdered or forcibly converted, and the line cut to an extent, regarding which there is no information."''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''It was an organised rising ; the rebels had manufactured war-knives and swords: collected firearms and swords from Hindu houses: also from Police stations: they wrecked the rail-road and cut telegraph lines, destroyed bridges, felled trees and blocked roads, dug trenches and lay in ambush to attack the passing troops : in fact, they acted as men who had gained some knowledge of modern war-fare, having learned these tactics from disbanded sepoys, who had seen service in Mesopotamia and who, having joined the rebels, instructed these Khilafat soldiery as to how they should proceed.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The widespread violence was led by Ali Musaliar and carried out by other Moplah families (Thangal families)

''"The storm had burst with a vengeance. Civil administration came to a standstill: the sub-treasuries in the rebellion area were looted and lakhs of rupees carried away : public buildings and records were burnt : Munsiffs, Magistrates, and Police Officers had to seek refuge elsewhere : Police Officials were overwhelmed by rebel hordes and had to surrender their arms : Village Officials had left their villages; and, eventually, the train traffic stopped for a week between Shoranur and Calicut. Murders, dacoities, forced conversions and outrages on Hindu women became the order of the day. Hindu refugees in thousands poured into Calicut, Palghat, the Cochin State, and other places wending their weary way over hills and through jungles for safety from the lust and savagery of the Moplahs."''

Although the British army troops were quick to take the upper hand in many towns, a number of rebels initiated guerilla operations, forcing the British to deploy additional military units and introduce "aggressive" patrolling. The massacre, and attempted genocide of Hindus, and revolt against British came to an end in February 1922. Ali Musliyar was among a dozen leaders who were tried and sentenced to death. He was subsequently hanged at the Coimbatore Prison on 17 February 1922.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The '''Alpine Convention''' is an international territorial treaty for the sustainable development of the [[Alps]]. The objective of the treaty is to protect the natural environment of the Alps while promoting its development. This Framework Convention involves the [[European Union]] and eight states (Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland). Opened to signature in 1991 and consisting of a Framework Convention, various implementation protocols and declarations, it entered into force in 1995, contributing to reinforce the recognition of special qualities and specific characteristics of the Alps, going beyond national boundaries and seeking international action.

== Geographic area of the Alpine Convention ==
[[File:Alpenrelief 01.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Alpine arc]]

The geographic area of the Alpine Convention covers a {{convert|190717|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} encompassing 5867 municipalities (data from 2013). The Alpine Range as defined by the Alpine Convention stretches across {{convert|1200|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, through eight states, and its maximum width is {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, between Bavaria and Northern Italy.
The entire territories of Monaco and Liechtenstein are included. Austria and Italy together represent more than 55% of the Convention area. With France, these three states cover the three-quarter of the total surface of the Alpine Convention territory.
In 2013, the total population of this area was approaching 15 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpconv.org/sl/publications/alpine/Documents/AS1_sl.pdf Alpski signali 1] Alpine convention webpage, 02/10/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Institutions of the Alpine Convention ==

=== The Alpine Conference ===
The Alpine Conference is the body that takes the most important decisions regarding the Convention. The Presidency of the Conference rotates between the Contracting parties, each holding the Presidency for a two-year period. For the period 2016–2018 the presidency is held by Austria.

The Conference also welcomes the following observers: European association of elected representatives from mountain regions, Alpe Adria, Arge Alp, [[International Commission for the Protection of the Alps|CIPRA]] International, Club Arc Alpin, COTRAO – The Working Community of the Western Alps, Euromontana, FIANET, the International Steering Committee of the Network of Protected areas, the IUCN, the Managing Authority of the European Cooperation Programme Alpine Space, Pro Mont Blanc, [[UNEP]] and ISCAR.

=== The Permanent Committee ===
The [http://www.alpconv.org/en/organization/permanentCommittee/default.html Permanent Committee] is the executive body of the Alpine Conference. It is composed of all Member delegations and guarantees that the basis, the principles and the objectives of the Convention are implemented.
Permanent committee analyses the information submitted by the Member States in implementing the Convention and reports to the Alpine Conference; prepares programmes for meetings of the Alpine Conference and proposes the agenda; sets up Working Groups that have to formulate Protocols and recommendations and it coordinates their activities; examines and harmonizes the contents of draft Protocols and makes proposals to the Alpine Conference.

Permanent Committee meets twice a year; [http://www.alpconv.org/en/organization/permanentCommittee/default.html last meetings].

=== The Compliance Committee ===
The Compliance Committee is the body that oversees implementation of the commitments and obligations taken under the Alpine Convention. Every 10 years, Contracting Parties have to publish a report concerning the implementation of the Convention and its protocols. The first report was adopted at the Xth Alpine Conference (March 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpconv.org/theconvention/conv06_CC_ en.htm Presentation of the Steering Committee]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the Alpine Convention website, consulted on 16 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Permanent Secretariat ===
This treaty dedicated to a specific territory is supported by a [http://www.alpconv.org/en/organization/permanentSecretariat/default.html Permanent Secretariat], created in 2003, that has its main office in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, and a branch office in [[Bolzano]]-[[Bozen]], Italy. 
The role of this Permanent Secretariat is to support all the other bodies instituted by the Alpine Convention by providing professional, logistic and administrative support, and by helping the Contracting parties, especially in implementing projects. The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary General, currently M. Markus Reiterer.

Permanent Secretariat carries out different [http://www.alpconv.org/EN/ACTIVITIES/default.html projects and activities] for promotion of the Alpine Convention.

=== Working Groups and Platforms ===
The Permanent Committee can establish [http://www.alpconv.org/en/organization/groups/default.html Working Groups], with a 2-year-mandate, on topics it considers relevant to support the sustainable development within the Alps. The main responsibility of the Working groups and Platforms is the development of new protocols, recommendations and implementation measures, studies of ongoing developments and reports on the progress to the Alpine Conference and Permanent Committee.

To date, Alpine states have signed all the protocols, except Monaco that didn't sign the protocol 'Energy' and the European Union that didn’t sign the protocols ‘Mountain Forests’ and ‘Settlement of disputes’. Regarding protocol ratification, Switzerland has not ratified any protocols yet.

'''Alternatiba'''  (« Alternative », in [[Basque language]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hiztegiak.elhuyar.eus/eu_fr/alternatiba Définition d'''alternatiba'' dans le dictionnaire Elhuyar]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a framework to mobilise society to face the challenges of [[climate change]]. Numerous Alternatiba events, which provide hundreds of alternatives in order to raise people's awareness and to stimulate behaviour change, have been or will be organised in over sixty different French and European cities.

Additionally, these initiatives aim to put pressure on politicians, especially before the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris (and the next [[United Nations Climate Change conference]]s).

== History ==

The first Alternatiba, village of Alternatives, took place in [[Bayonne]] on 5–6 October 2013. It was initiated by the Basque environmental organization Bizi!,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fêtes de Bayonne 2013 : une photo géante pour Alternatiba |url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2013/07/26/fetes-de-bayonne-2013-une-photo-geante-pour-alternatiba-1125398-719.php |work=[[Sud Ouest (newspaper)|Sud Quest]] |date=26 July 2013 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reunited over 12.000 people. Following the [[Copenhagen Summit]] failure in 2009, they felt it was time to show "European citizens that everything cannot be expected from political decisions at a higher level. We should start at the base, right where we live, with practical initiatives: eco-construction, short distribution chain, renewable energies, organic food, local money, etc. A list that should certainly not be restrictive in order to create a European citizen dynamic".&lt;ref&gt;According what said an organizer of this event. See [http://www.lavie.fr/actualite/ecologie/10-000-personnes-reunies-a-alternatiba-contre-le-rechauffement-climatique-08-10-2013-45059_8.php Article], ''[[La Vie]]'', 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a festive and friendly atmosphere, the visitors were able to discover that "solutions exist; they are already put into effect by thousands of associations, local communities and individuals. Even better: these alternatives contribute to a more pleasant society where solidarity, justice and people matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reporterre.net/spip.php?article4805 ''Reporterre''], 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;”

The first village hosted 50 conferences and 15 thematic areas with workshops and stands, as well as a vast number of artistic and educational activities. Ninety organizations supported the event "such as [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], SUD solidaires, [[Attac]], Biocoop, the [[Nicolas Hulot]] Foundation as well as a thousand volunteers"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/environnement/alternatiba-lance-la-fronde-contre-le-rechauffemen-55032 "Alternatiba ! lance la fronde contre le réchauffement"], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', Friday 4 October 2013 (page visited on 31 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alternatiba.eu/wp-content/uploads/ressources/kit-methodologique-annexe.pdf List of the 98 organizations signing the call « Construisons un monde meilleur en relevant le défi climatique » in page 4 of the web-site annex.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stéphane Hessel]] became the sponsor of the event in 2012, followed by his wife Christiane Hessel after his death. She concluded the event with a speech calling for the construction of 10, 100, 1 000 Alternatibas all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternatiba.eu/wp-content/uploads/ressources/Alternatiba%20FR2.pdf Christiane Hessel's speech] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726033717/https://alternatiba.eu/wp-content/uploads/ressources/Alternatiba%20FR2.pdf |date=26 July 2015 }}, www.alternatiba.eu.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 2014, in [[Nantes]], hundreds of people rallied for the first Alternatiba meeting on a European level.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://reporterre.net/Alternatibagranditetse reporting of the event in Reporterre]&lt;/ref&gt; The initiators of the Bayonne Alternatiba presented the guidelines and emphasized the main principles. In the wake of this event, a European framework for Alternatiba was created.&lt;ref&gt;See the details on the [https://alternatiba.eu/nantes/2014/02/24/naissancenantesdelacoordinationeuropeenne-desalternatiba/ web-site of Alternatiba Nantes]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Charter]] describing the shared values and common principles of all the Alternatibas was defined on 6 October 2013&lt;ref&gt;See [http://alternatiba.eu/projet/ensemble-construisons-un-monde-meilleur-en-relevant-le-defi-climatique/ here the first formulation of the Chart.] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141127214908/http://alternatiba.eu/projet/ensemble-construisons-un-monde-meilleur-en-relevant-le-defi-climatique/ |date=27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then revised after successive debates of the Alternatiba committees.

During the summer of 2014, the Nantes Alternatiba committee proposed to create an "Alternatiba" anthem,&lt;ref&gt;The song can be heard by clicking [https://soundcloud.com/xa_singeries/sets/proposition_alternatiba here]&lt;/ref&gt; recorded by a collective from Nantes with professional and amateur musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Six months after its first production, according to [http://reporterre.net/Alternatibaenpleineforme the Reporterre article], it has been listen over 2,000 times.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method and tools ==

The organization of the different Alternatiba collective reflect the experience gained by Bizi ! Cross-sectoral commissions decide on the location of the event, liaise with local governments and manage the funds. Organization relies on the work of a large number of volunteers.

Thematic committees concentrate on the content of the event and the organization of the thematic areas. At almost every Alternatiba, a [[climate]] area is introduced as well as different thematic areas concerning the use of natural and energy resources such as transport, energy, agriculture, food, and also areas dedicated to alternative lifestyles and culture, education, [[solidarity]], shared goods, [[sustainable development]], the necessity of [[environmental justice|international environmental justice]], for example.

=== Alternatiba Tour ===

in 2015 the Alternatiba Tour crossed six European countries, using 3- or 4-person bikes and joined by other cyclists along the 5,000-km route. The aim of the Tour was to popularize the Alternatiba initiatives and to start mobilizing citizens on the climate. The tour ended in the [[Île-de-France]] region at the Paris Alternatiba on 26–27 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;According to the article [http://www.bastamag.net/Appel-a-volontaires-pour-le-climat « 5000 kilomètres en vélo... et 1000 manières de soutenir le Tour Alternatiba ! »] published on 5 December 2014 in the French Basta !, [http://www.bastamag.net/Appel-a-volontaires-pour-le-climat Quelques mois avant le sommet international sur le climat à Paris, fin 2015, un drôle de vélo va traverser six pays européens et parcourir 5000 kilomètres pour porter le message d’Alternatiba].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Farm Bureau convention stage (32176199636).jpg|thumb|250x250px|American Farm Bureau Federation Annual Convention]]
The '''American Farm Bureau Federation''' ('''AFBF'''), more commonly referred to as '''Farm Bureau''' ('''FB'''), is an independent, non-governmental, voluntary organization governed by and representing farm and ranch families united for the purpose of analyzing their problems and formulating action to achieve educational improvement, economic opportunity and social advancement and, thereby, to promote the national well-being. Farm Bureau is local, county, state, national and international in its scope and influence and is non-partisan, non-sectarian and non-secret in character. Farm Bureau is the voice of agricultural producers at all levels. AFBF is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] There are 50 state affiliates and one in [[Puerto Rico]].

==History==
The Farm Bureau movement officially started in 1911 when John Barron, a farmer who graduated from [[Cornell University]], worked as an [[extension agent]] in [[Broome County, New York|Broome County]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He served as a "Farm Bureau" representative for farmers with the [[Binghamton, New York]] [[Chamber of Commerce]].  The effort was financed by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Lackawanna Railroad]]. The Broome County Farm Bureau was soon separated from the Chamber of Commerce. Other farm bureaus on a county level formed across the country.

In 1914, with the passage of the [[Smith–Lever Act of 1914]], the [[U.S. Congress]] agreed to share with the states the cost of programs for providing what had come to be called "county agents", who furnished farmers information on improved methods of [[animal husbandry]] and [[crop production]] developed by the agricultural colleges and agricultural experiment stations, which has evolved into the modern day [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Cooperative Extension Service]], shaped in part by political opposition to [[agricultural subsidies]].

Farmers meeting in [[Saline County, Missouri]], were the first to form a statewide Farm Bureau in 1915. The initial Bureaus had a social and educational function furthering the extension service efforts, and they have additionally developed a [[lobbying]] presence as well.

The American Farm Bureau was formally founded in 1919 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Its initial organization papers said:

{{quote|The purpose of Farm Bureau is to make the business of farming more profitable, and the community a better place to live. Farm Bureau should provide an organization in which members may secure the benefits of unified efforts in a way which could never be accomplished through individual effort.Statement originally approved by Farm Bureau members in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fb.org/index.php?fuseaction=about.home We are Farm Bureau] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822111203/http://www.fb.org/index.php?fuseaction=about.home |date=August 22, 2006 }}, American Farm Bureau Federation, retrieved December 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American Farm Bureau Federation relocated its headquarters from [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 2003.

Each November since 1986, AFBF has reported the results of an informal survey on the average retail cost of a classic [[Thanksgiving]] dinner, including a 16-pound [[turkey meat|turkey]] and all the trimmings. In 2017, the cost was $49.12, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fb.org/newsroom/farm-bureau-survey-reveals-lowest-thanksgiving-dinner-cost-in-five-years|title=Farm Bureau Survey Reveals Lowest Thanksgiving Dinner Cost in Five Years|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fb.org/index.php?action=newsroom.news&amp;year=2012&amp;file=nr1108.htmlCost of Classic Thanksgiving Dinner Up Slightly This Year], American Farm Bureau Federation, November 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
Policy is changing constantly, and it has a direct impact on farmers and ranchers. Having a voice – a seat at the table and an impact on policy – is critical. Beginning at the grassroots level and involving Farm Bureau members' advocacy efforts across the country, all of agriculture speaks with one voice through the American Farm Bureau Federation.

==Education==
The [https://www.agfoundation.org/ American Farm Bureau Foundation for Agriculture] works to build awareness, understanding and a positive perception of agriculture through education. The Foundation is creating agriculturally literate citizens through our educational programs, grants, scholarships, classroom curriculum, and volunteer training.

The Foundation also builds relationships with educational institutions to introduce agricultural education tools and resources, and encourages adoption at the community, county, state, and national level.

== Empowerment ==
From its beginnings nearly a century ago, Farm Bureau has existed to give members the tools they need to succeed. That can mean financial expertise, communication skills, advocacy opportunities, training and opportunities to network with and learn from fellow farmers and ranchers. It all adds up to helping America's farmers and ranchers stay strong and prosperous.

== Membership ==
For nearly a century Farm Bureau members have joined together from coast to coast and become the Voice of Agriculture. Farm Bureau continues to evolve to serve the needs of members and their families on and off the farm or ranch. The Farm Bureau legacy includes leadership within local communities, advocacy on rural issues, public service and outreach, agriculture literacy and environmental initiatives that protect the environment and preserve its productive beauty for the next generation to utilize and enjoy.

Joining Farm Bureau provides your family with exclusive discounts on national brands, plus valued member benefits.

== Lobbying ==

AFBF made The Hill's [http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/top-lobbyists/358132-top-lobbyists-2017-associations 2017 list of top association lobbying groups] and was dubbed a "farm policy powerhouse" for tracking issues like crop insurance, voluntary labeling requirements for bioengineered foods and disease surveillance response. "And that only scratches the surface of its work," according to The Hill.11

AFBF supported the [[Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to permanently extend and expand certain expired provisions that provided an enhanced [[tax deduction]] for businesses that donated their food [[inventory]] to [[charitable organizations]].&lt;ref name=4719cbo&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4719|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45425|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFBF argued that without the tax [[write-off]], "it is cheaper in most cases for these types of businesses to throw their food away than it is to donate the food".&lt;ref name=FarmBureauSupport&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting Hunger Incentive Act will increase food bank donations|url=http://fbnews.fb.org/FBNews/Top_News/Fighting_Hunger_Incentive_Act_will_increase_food_bank_donations.aspx|publisher=Farm Bureau News|accessdate=16 July 2014|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
The '''Anti-Defamation League''' ('''ADL'''; formerly known as the ''Anti-Defamation League of [[B'nai B'rith]]'') is an international [[Jews|Jewish]] [[non-governmental organization]] based in the [[United States]]. The ADL states that it "fights anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry, defends democratic ideals, and protects civil rights for all", doing so through "information, education, legislation, and advocacy".&lt;ref name="ADLCharter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=https://www.adl.org/who-we-are/our-mission|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=https://www.adl.org/who-we-are|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in late September 1913 by the Independent Order of [[B'nai B'rith]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[service organization]] in the United States, its original mission statement was "to stop, by appeals to reason and conscience and, if necessary, by appeals to law, the defamation of the Jewish people". Its ultimate purpose is "to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike, and to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens".&lt;ref name=ADLCharter /&gt; The ADL has 29 offices in the United States and three offices in other countries, with its headquarters located in [[New York City]]. [[Abraham Foxman]] was the national director from 1987 for more than a quarter century. In November 2014, it was announced that [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] would succeed Foxman as national director in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2014/11/06/news-opinion/united-states/white-house-aide-to-succeed-abe-foxman-as-adl-chief-1 "White House aide Jonathan Greenblatt to succeed Abe Foxman as ADL chief"], ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'', November 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The national chair is Barry Curtiss-Lusher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/about-adl/adl-leadership.html#.VF-ZvslNe8A Barry Curtiss-Lusher, National Chair] ADL.org, ''accessed November 9, 2014.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Founded in late September 1913 by [[B'nai B'rith]], with [[Sigmund Livingston]] as its first leader, the ADL's charter states, &lt;blockquote&gt;The immediate object of the League is to stop, by appeals to reason and conscience and, if necessary, by appeals to law, the defamation of the Jewish people. Its ultimate purpose is to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike and to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens.&lt;ref name=ADLCharter /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Anti-Defamation League was founded by B'nai B'rith as a response to attacks on Jews; the [[Leo Frank]] affair was mentioned by [[Adolf Kraus]] when he announced the creation of the ADL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Deborah Dash|title=B'nai B'rith and the Challenge of Ethnic Leadership|year=1981|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-480-8|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews in American Politics: Essays|year=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0181-2|page=105|author=Jerome A. Chanes|editor1=Louis S |editor2=y Maisel |editor3=Ira N. Forman |editor4=Donald Altschiller |editor5=Charles Walker Bassett |chapter=Who Does What?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Jonathan Greenblatt by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Jonathan Greenblatt, National Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League since 2015]]
The stated purpose of the ADL is to fight: &lt;blockquote&gt;anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry (in the United States) and abroad, combat international terrorism, probe the roots of hatred, advocate before the United States Congress, come to the aid of victims of bigotry, develop educational programs, and serve as a public resource for government, media, law enforcement, and the public, all towards the goal of countering and reducing hatred.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Historically, the ADL has opposed groups and individuals it considered to be anti-Semitic and/or racist, including: [[Nazism|Nazis]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[Henry Ford]], Father [[Charles Coughlin]] (leader of the [[Christian Front (United States)|Christian Front]]), the [[Christian Identity]] movement, the [[German-American Bund]], [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], the [[Militia (United States)|American militia]] movement and [[white power skinhead]]s (although the ADL acknowledges that there are also non-racist [[skinhead]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/racist_skinheads/ |title=Racist Skinhead Project |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salberg, Melvin. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/opinion/l-adl-acknowledges-nonracist-skinheads-932108.html Letter to the editor ("A.D.L. Acknowledges Nonracist Skinheads")]. ''The New York Times''. April 29, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL publishes reports on a variety of countries, regarding alleged incidents of anti-Jewish attacks and propaganda.

The ADL maintains that some forms of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] cross the line into anti-Semitism. The Anti-Defamation League states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Criticism of particular Israeli actions or policies in and of itself does not constitute anti-Semitism. Certainly the sovereign State of Israel can be legitimately criticized just like any other country in the world. However, it is undeniable that there are those whose criticism of Israel or of "Zionism" is used to mask anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response To Common Inaccuracy: Israel Critics are Anti-Semites|url=https://www.adl.org/resources/fact-sheets/response-to-common-inaccuracy-israel-critics-are-anti-semites|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ADL gives out its [[Courage to Care Award]] to honor rescuers of Jews during [[the Holocaust]].

Since 2010, the ADL has published a list of the "ten leading organizations responsible for maligning Israel in the US", which has included [[ANSWER]], the [[International Solidarity Movement]], and [[Jewish Voice for Peace]] for its call for [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS]].&lt;ref&gt;Benhorin, Yitzhak. "[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3969798,00.html Jewish group makes ADL blacklist]." ynet news. October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the ADL condemned remarks by [[Ovadia Yosef]] that the sole purpose of non-Jews was to serve the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mozgovaya, Natasha. "[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/adl-slams-shas-spiritual-leader-for-saying-non-jews-were-born-to-serve-jews-1.320235?localLinksEnabled=false ADL slams Shas spiritual leader for saying non-Jews 'were born to serve Jews']." Haaretz Service. October 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[anti-Mormon]] film ''[[The God Makers]]'' (1982) was produced, Rhonda M. Abrams, Central Pacific (San Francisco) Regional Director for the ADL, wrote a critical review, including the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Had a similar movie been made with either Judaism or Catholicism as its target, it would be immediately denounced for the scurrilous piece that it is. I sincerely hope that people of all faiths will similarly repudiate ''The Godmakers'' as defamatory and untrue, and recognize it for what it truly represents - a challenge to the religious liberty of all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairmormon.org/perspectives/publications/the-truth-about-the-god-makers/ia Letter to Dr. Richard Lindsay], Director of Public Communications, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, May 25, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Separation of church and state ===
One of the ADL's major focuses is [[Freedom of religion#Judaism|religious freedom]] for people of all faiths.&lt;ref name="RelFree"&gt;{{cite web|title=Primer on the First Amendment &amp; Religious Freedom|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/the-first-amendment-and-religious-freedom|website=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Freedom|url=https://www.adl.org/what-we-do/discrimination/religious-freedom|website=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of public schools, the ADL has taken the position that because [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]] are religious beliefs, and the government is prohibited from endorsing the beliefs of any particular religion, they should not be taught in [[science]] classrooms: "The U.S. Constitution guarantees the rights of Americans to believe the religious theories of creation (as well as other theories), but it does not permit them to be taught in public school science classes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adl.org/issue_religious_freedom/create/creationism_QA.asp |title=Religion in the Science Class? Why Creationism and Intelligent Design Don't Belong |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ADL supports the legal precedent that it is [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]] for the government to post the [[Ten Commandments]] in courthouses, schools, and other public places: "True religious liberty means freedom from having the government impose the religion of the majority on all citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adl.org/10comm/Prohibitions.asp |title=The Ten Commandments Controversy: A First Amendment Perspective – Prohibitions on Display of the Ten Commandments |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL has also condemned the public school [[Bible]] curriculum published by the [[National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools]], saying that it raises "serious constitutional problems" and "advocates the acceptance of one faith tradition's interpretation of the Bible over another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Says Bible Teaching Guide for Public Schools 'Unacceptable' |publisher=ADL |date=November 7, 2005 |url=http://www.jewsonfirst.org/05a/public024.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL opposed [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] and supported the [[Matthew Shepard Act]].

=== Tracking extremists ===
The ADL keeps track of the activities of various extremist groups and movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bigots on Bikes: The Growing Links between White Supremacists and Biker Gangs|url=https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/ADL_CR_Bigots_on_Bikes_online.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ADL Director Abe Foxman, "Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-Jewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings …. Because extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources … [who] function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists. Some have performed great service to the American people—for example, by uncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training camps—with no recognition and at considerable personal risk."&lt;ref&gt;"A League of His Own", letter to the editor, ''The Village Voice'' 38:20 (May 18, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; A person apprehended in connection to the [[2002 white supremacist terror plot]] had drawn a cartoon of himself blowing up the Boston offices of the ADL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

The ADL regularly releases reports on [[Anti-Semitism in the USA|anti-Semitism]] and extremist activities on both the [[Far-left politics|far left]] and the [[Far-right politics|far right]]. For instance, as part of its Law Enforcement Agency Resource Network (L.E.A.R.N.), the ADL has published information about the [[Militia Movement]]&lt;ref name="militia"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Militia Movement|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/militia-movement|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in America and a guide for law enforcement officials titled ''Officer Safety and Extremists''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officer Safety and Extremists|url=https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Officer-Safety-and-Extremists-An-Overview.pdf|publisher=ADL|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archive of "[[Mark Pitcavage#Militia Watchdog|The Militia Watchdog]]" research on U.S. right-wing extremism (including groups not specifically cited as anti-Semitic) from 1995 to 2000 is also available on the ADL website.&lt;ref name="militia" /&gt;

In the 1990s, some details of the ADL's monitoring activities became public and controversial, including the fact that the ADL had gathered information about some non-extremist groups. In 2013, J.M. Berger, a former nonresident fellow of the [[Brookings Institution]], wrote that media organizations should be more cautious when citing the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) and ADL, arguing that they are "not objective purveyors of data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=J. M.|title=The Hate List|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/12/the-hate-list/|work=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the ADL announced that they would be developing profiles on 36 [[alt-right]] and [[alt-lite]] leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/adl-releases-whos-who-guide-of-alt-right-and-alt-lite-extremists/|title=ADL releases ‘Who’s Who’ guide of alt-right and alt-lite extremists|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate|title=From Alt Right to Alt Lite: Naming the Hate|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Role in arrest of potential assassins of Barack Obama ====
In October 2008 the ADL reportedly assisted the US [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) by providing, on request, information on Daniel Cowart and Paul Schlesselman and their associates and contacts, and on their ties to the [[Supreme White Alliance]]. Shortly thereafter the two men were arrested on charges of plotting to murder dozens of African Americans and [[Barack Obama assassination plot in Tennessee|plotting to assassinate US President-elect Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/NeoSk_82/5380_82.htm "ADL Applauds Law Enforcement for Preventing Killing Spree and Obama Assassination Attempt"], ADL Press Release, October 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225199589269&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "ADL helped probe into neo-Nazis"], ''Jewish Telegraph Agency'' (JTA)(reprinted by the ''Jerusalem Post''), October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holocaust awareness ===
The ADL holds that it is important to remember [[the Holocaust]], in order to prevent such an event from reoccurring. Along with sponsoring events and fighting [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] and revisionists, the ADL has been active in urging action to stop modern-day [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] in places such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Darfur]], and [[Sudan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The ADL spoke out against an advertising campaign by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) beginning in 2003 that equated meat-eating with the Holocaust. A press release from the ADL stated that, "PETA's effort to seek 'approval' for their 'Holocaust on Your Plate' campaign is outrageous, offensive and takes chutzpah to new heights. Rather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find ways to make sure such catastrophes never happen again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Denounces Peta for its "Holocaust On Your Plate" Campaign; Calls Appeal for Jewish Community Support 'The Height Of Chutzpah' |publisher=ADL |date=February 24, 2003 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/HolNa_52/4235_52.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005, PETA apologized for its campaign, with PETA President [[Ingrid Newkirk]] stating that causing pain "was never our intention, and we are deeply sorry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rabbinate to phase out 'shackle and hoist' animal slaughter.

However, PETA has a history of controversial campaigns. On May 5, 2005, PETA issued an apology for its "Holocaust on Your Plate" exhibit, which traveled to more than 100 cities. The exhibit compared the treatment of farm animals to that of victims of the Nazi concentration camps. PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said she realized that the campaign had caused pain: "This was never our intention, and we are deeply sorry."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national ADL issued a "Statement on the Armenian Genocide" on August 21, 2007. The statement declared, "The consequences of those actions were indeed tantamount to genocide." Activists felt that the statement was not a full, unequivocal acknowledgment of the [[Armenian genocide]], because the use of the qualifier "tantamount" was seen as inappropriate, and the use of the word "consequences" was seen as an attempt to circumvent the international legal definition of genocide by avoiding any language that would imply intent, a crucial aspect of the 1948 UN [[Genocide Convention]] definition. The ADL convened its national meeting in New York City in early November 2007 at which time the issue of the Armenian Genocide was discussed. Upon conclusion, a one-sentence press statement was issued that, "The National Commission of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today, at its annual meeting, decided to take no further action on the issue of the Armenian genocide."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5162_00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political positions ==

The ADL supports the [[Jewish state]], and has vociferously opposed resolutions such as the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|1975 United Nations resolution]] ([[UN General Assembly Resolution 4686|revoked in 1991]]) which equated [[Zionism]] with racism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/durban/adl_quotes.asp |title=U.N. World Conference Against Racism |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to revive that formulation at the 2001 U.N. [[World Conference Against Racism]] in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/durban/un_anti-zionism.asp |title=U.N. World Conference Against Racism |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL also has expressed concern over Israeli legislative proposals that would stifle freedom of expression and undermine Israeli democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/israel-middle-east/adl-concerned-that-proposed-legislation-on-ngo-funding.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.VrPgDfkrKig ADL 'Concerned That Proposed Legislation on NGO Funding in Israel Would Erode Nation’s Democratic Character,'] Anti-Defamation League Press ReleaseJanuary 11, 2016:'In 2011, the League urged the Israeli government to work to modify two similar bills regarding donations from foreign governments to Israeli NGOs, and voiced concern over laws that stifle free expression.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/reform-joins-adl-ajc-in-opposing-israels-ngo-bill/|title=Reform joins ADL, AJC in opposing Israel’s NGO bill|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADL honors individuals throughout the year for various reasons. On September 23, 2003, at its Tribute to Italy Dinner, the ADL awarded Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] the ADL's distinguished statesman award, an honor "conferred on world leaders who exhibit a commitment to furthering the achievement of regional and world peace, and who possess a special commitment to promoting human and civil rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adl.org/international/lfe/speech_berlusconi.asp |title=Speech by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at the Anti-Defamation League Tribute to Italy Dinner |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi is also known for his staunch pro-Israel stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

In 2006, the ADL condemned Senate Republicans in the United States for attempting to ban [[same-sex marriage]] with the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], and praised its demise, calling it "discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Welcomes Demise Of Same-Sex Marriage Amendment; Expresses 'Dismay' At Senate Vote |publisher=ADL |date=June 7, 2006 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/DiRaB_41/4832_41.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the ADL warned that the debate over [[illegal immigration]] was drawing [[neo-nazis]] and [[anti-Semites]] into the ranks of the [[The Minuteman Project Inc.|Minutemen Project]].

In 1974, ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R. Epstein published a book called ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974), arguing that a new kind of anti-Semitism is on the rise. In 1982, ADL national leader Nathan Perlmutter and his wife, Ruth Ann Perlmutter, released a book entitled ''The Real Anti-Semitism in America'' (New York, 1982). In 2003, ADL's national director Abraham Foxman published ''Never Again? The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), where, on page 4, he states: "We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s—if not a greater one."&lt;ref name="adl.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

In 2010, during a hearing for Florida House Bill 11 (Crimes Against Homeless Persons), which was to revise the list of offenses judged to be [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crimes]] in Florida by adding a person's homeless status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

But lawmakers were swayed by arguments in favor of protecting the homeless."&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADL supports [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007|Comprehensive]] and [[DREAM Act]] legislation that would provide conditional permanent residency to certain illegal aliens of good moral character who graduate from U.S. high schools, arrived in the United States as minors, and lived in the country continuously for at least five years prior to the bill's enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Afirman que con el debate de reforma migratoria subieron los crímenes de odio|publisher=EFE News Services|date=January 25, 2013|quote= La Liga Antidifamación Judía ( ADL ) aseguró hoy que desde que se inició el debate sobre una reforma migratoria integral en Estados Unidos se ha registrado un aumento de los crímenes de odio contra los hispanos. ...

== Relations with religious and ethnic groups ==

=== Relations with Arabs and Muslims ===
{{See also|Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs}}

On June 18, 2004, the ADL issued a news release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Statement On The Muslim Student Union at UC-Irvine |publisher=ADL |date=June 18, 2004 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/4520_00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the [[University of California Irvine]] (UCI) Muslim Students Union in which the student group had invited speakers to campus who made public declarations of support for [[Hamas]], advocated suicide bombings and called for the destruction of Israel. For graduation, Muslim Students Union members chose to wear [[Green in Islam|green]] (the traditional colour of Islam) graduation stoles bearing the ''[[Shahada]]'', the Islamic [[declaration of faith]]. The ADL's press release explained that the Shahada is a declaration of faith that has been closely identified with Palestinian terrorists, and said that [[suicide bomber]]s connected to the Palestinian group [[Hamas]] wear green armbands and headbands inscribed with the ''Shahada'' as a symbol of their movement, and stated, "We are troubled that members of the [[(UCI) Muslim Students Union]] have chosen to display symbolism that is closely identified with Palestinian terrorist groups and that can be especially offensive to Jewish students."

The ADL has publicly opposed anti-Islamic organizations, like [[Stop Islamization of America]] and [[Stop Islamization of Europe]], and activists, such as [[Pamela Geller]] and [[David Yerushalmi]], describing them as "anti-Muslim bigots".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/civil-rights/discrimination/c/stop-islamization-of-america.html#.USIPpKWzd8E Civil Rights: Discrimination: SOIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with African-Americans ===
In 1997, the ''National Center for Black-Jewish Relations'' of [[Dillard University]], a [[historically black college|historically black university]] in [[New Orleans]], awarded the director of the ADL, Abraham H. Foxman, with the first Annual [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. – Donald R. Mintz Freedom and Justice Award.

In 2004, the ADL became the lead partner in the ''Peace and Diversity Academy'', a new New York City public high school with predominantly black and Hispanic students.

In celebration of [[Black History Month]], the ADL created and distributed lesson plans to middle and high school teachers about [[Shirley Chisholm]] (1924–2005), the first black woman elected to the [[US Congress]], and an important civil rights leader.

The ADL has also publicly charged certain African Americans with anti-Semitism:

* The ADL has catalogued a three-decade history of [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s espousal of anti-Semitic rhetoric such as claims that certain Jews are "not real Jews" and that they are "wicked deceivers of the American people" who "sucked [Americans'] blood", and that powerful Jews promote homosexuality and control black leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/farrakhan_own_words2/farrakhan_own_words.asp |title=Farrakhan In His Own Words |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrakhan first attracted the attention of the ADL with comments in a March 11, 1984, radio broadcast saying that, "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was a very great man".&lt;ref name="finalcall"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Farrakhan and the Jewish Rift; How It All Started |journal=[[The Final Call]] |url=http://www.finalcall.com/perspectives/rift.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrakhan insists that he was using the word 'great' in the sense of 'Great Depression' or 'great white shark'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noi.org/statements/rift/Wanniski12-22-1997.htm Memo, 12–22–97; Letter From Farrakhan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 24, 1984, he described the Jewish state as "structured on injustice, thievery, lying and deceit and using the name of God to shield your dirty religion under His holy and righteous name."&lt;ref name="finalcall" /&gt; The ADL has urged various groups including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (whose leader [[Benjamin Chavis]] developed a working relationship with Farrakhan in 1994) to dissociate themselves from Farrakhan and his views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foxman |first=Abraham H. |authorlink=Abraham Foxman |date=July 20, 1994 |title=Today's N.A.A.C.P.

* In 1984 ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that then ADL national director, Nathan Perlmutter, said that Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]], Sr. was anti-Semitic, after Jackson referred to New York City as "Hymietown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 23, 1984 |title=Post Reaffirms Report On Jackson Comment |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages=13 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E10FB3B5D0C708EDDAB0894DC484D81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 27, 1984 |title=Jackson Admits Saying 'Hymie' And Apologizes At A Synagogue |journal=[[The New York Times]] |pages=16 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A14F83C5D0C748EDDAB0894DC484D81}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ADL later reconciled with Jackson and has worked with him on the issue of the Iranian Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Rev.

* Film Director [[Spike Lee]] was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for his portrayal of Jewish nightclub owners Moe and Josh Flatbush in his 1990 film ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]''. The Anti-Defamation League said that the characterizations of the nightclub owners "dredge up an age-old and highly dangerous form of anti-Semitic stereotyping", and it was "disappointed that Spike Lee – whose success is largely due to his efforts to break down racial stereotypes and prejudice – has employed the same kind of tactics that he supposedly deplores".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 16, 1990 |title=Spike Lee's Jews and the Passage From Benign Cliche Into Bigotry|journal=[[The New York Times]] |author=Caryn James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/16/movies/critic-s-notebook-spike-lee-s-jews-passage-benign-cliche-into-bigotry.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's portrayal also angered the B'nai B'rith and other such Jewish organizations causing Lee to apologize via an Opinion-Editorial article in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 13, 2006 |title=The Angriest Auteur|journal=[[New York Magazine]] |author=Ariel Levy|url=http://nymag.com/movies/profiles/19144/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 2002 election cycle, the ADL, in a letter to ''The New York Times'', harshly criticized [[Congressional Black Caucus]] member [[Cynthia McKinney]] of Georgia for launching attacks perceived as racial against her Jewish opponent. According to an August 19, 2002, article in ''The New York Times'', ADL Director Abraham Foxman said, "It made sense that Jewish Americans would want to contribute to efforts to replace Ms. McKinney".
* In February 2005, ADL National Director Abraham Foxman called it hypocritical for hip-hop producer [[Russell Simmons]] to lead an ad campaign against anti-Semitism while also, according to Foxman's view, defending or excusing Louis Farrakhan's anti-Semitic statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Calls on Russell Simmons to Distance Himself from Minister Farrakhan |publisher=ADL |date=February 14, 2005 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASUS_12/4645_12.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the ADL urged prominent black leaders including Simmons to reconsider their support for Farrakhan and [[Malik Zulu Shabazz]] organizing the [[Millions More Movement]] and to "stand up" against black anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ADL Urges Prominent African-American Leaders to Reconsider Their Support for the "Millions More Movement" |publisher=ADL |date=May 2, 2005 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASUS_12/4707_12.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmons, responding to ADL Director Abraham Foxman, said, "simply put, you are misguided, arrogant, and very disrespectful of African Americans, and most importantly, your statements will unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of Jews in the minds of millions of African Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millionsmoremovement.com/news/russell-simmons05-09-2005.htm |title=Russell Simmons Responds to Abraham Foxman about the Millions More Movement |last=Simmons |first=Russell |authorlink=Russell Simmons |date=May 9, 2005 |publisher=[[Millions More Movement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxman replied, "If there were a Jewish event which was led by an out-and-out racist, I would expect Black leaders to say to me that ADL should have nothing to do with it.

=== Interfaith camp ===
ADL's New England Regional Office has also established a faith-based initiative called "The Interfaith Youth Leadership Program", better known as "Camp If", or Camp Interfaith. Involving teenagers of the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic faiths, the camp brings the teens together for a week at camp where the teens bond and learn about each other's cultures. The camp has emerged as a new attempt to foster good relations between younger members of the Abrahamic faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siek |first=Stephanie V. |date=April 6, 2006 |title=A different kind of camp |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/06/a_different_kind_of_camp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== ADL files controversy ===
Since the 1930s, the ADL has been gathering information and publishing reports on whatever it identifies as antisemitism, racism, and prejudice, and on anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, racist, anti-democratic, violent, and extremist individuals and groups. As a result, the organization amassed what it once called a "famous storehouse of accurate, detailed, unassailable information on extremist individuals and organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/ADLHistory/1930_1940.asp |title=1930–1940 The World and ADL Were Changing... |work=History of the ADL |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the decades the ADL has assembled thousands of files.

During the 1930s, the ADL, along with the American Jewish Committee, coordinated American Jewish groups across the country in monitoring the activities of the German-American Bund and its pro-Nazis, nativist allies in the United States. In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925-1931. From 1934-1941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of "un-American activities" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenzweig |first=Laura |date=2017 |title=Hollywood’s Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles |url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/ |location=New York |publisher=NYU Press |page= |isbn=9781479855179 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Steven |date=2017 |title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America |url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/ |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury |page= |isbn=9781620405642 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its sources for the 1980s and 1990s was Roy Bullock, an intelligence gatherer for the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] regime,&lt;ref name="MearWalt"&gt;[[John Mearsheimer]], [[Stephen Walt]], ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]],'' Penguin Books 2007 p.187.&lt;/ref&gt; a private collector of information. He amassed files on 10,000–12,000 individuals and 600 organizations&lt;ref&gt;Paul Findley, [[They Dare to Speak Out|They Dare Speak Out: People and Institutions Confront Israel's Lobby]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=jCO7siJkxSEC&amp;pg=PA61 3rd edition], Chicago Review Press, 2003 p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and provided them to the ADL as a secretly paid independent contractor for over 32 years. Bullock often wrote letters to various groups and forwarded copies of their replies to the ADL, clipped articles from newspapers and magazines, and maintained files on his computer. He also used less orthodox, and possibly illegal, methods such as combing through trash and tapping into [[White Aryan Resistance]]'s phone message system in order to find evidence of [[hate crime]]s. Some of the information he obtained and then passed on to the ADL came from confidential documents (including intelligence files on various Nazi groups and driver's license records and other personal information on nearly 1,400 people) that were given to him by San Francisco police officer and former CIA agent Tom Gerard.&lt;ref name="Paddock"&gt;Richard C. Paddock, "[http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-13/news/mn-22383_1 New Details of Extensive ADL Spy Operation Emerge]", ''Los Angeles Times'', April 13, 1993, A1&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 1993, police seized Bullock's computer and raided the ADL offices in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles, California]]. A search of Bullock's computer revealed that he had compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 groups across the political spectrum. Many of Bullock's files concerned groups that did not fit the mold of extremist groups, [[hate group]]s, and organizations hostile to Jews or Israel that the ADL would usually be interested in. Along with files on the [[Ku Klux Klan]], White Aryan Resistance, Islamic Jihad, and the [[Jewish Defense League]] were data on the [[NAACP]], the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the [[United Auto Workers]], the AIDS activist group [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] Soviet/Russian news agency, [[Greenpeace]], [[Jews for Jesus]], and the [[National Lawyers Guild]]; there were also files on politicians, including Democratic U.S. Representative [[Nancy Pelosi]], former Republican U.S. Representative [[Pete McCloskey]], and activist [[Lyndon LaRouche]].&lt;ref name="Paddock" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refuseandresist.org/big_brother/011697antifa.html |title=The 'Public-Private Partnership' |last=Burghardt |first=Tom |date=January 16, 1997 |publisher=Antifa Info-Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock told investigators that many of those were his own private files, not information he was passing on to the ADL. An attorney for the ADL stated that, "We knew nothing about the vast extent of the files. Those are not ADL's files. … That is all [Bullock's] doing."&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Meredith Jane Adams (May 3, 1993) [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-04-18/news/9304180103_1_roy-bullock-adl-anti-defamation-league "B'nai B'rith Is Target Of Probe"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt; As for its own records, the ADL indicated that just because it had a file on a group, that did not mean that the ADL opposed the group. The San Francisco district attorney at the time accused the ADL of conducting a national "[[spy]] network", but dropped all accusations a few months later,&lt;ref name="jewishsf"&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Wiener |title=ADL settles with Arabs, others to wrap up 6-year lawsuit |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/ |work=The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California |date=October 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; judging it to be a force for good. The ADL offered the district attorney's office a sum of $75,000 to fight bigotry, which was accepted.&lt;ref name="MearWalt" /&gt;

In the weeks following the raids, twelve civil rights groups led by the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] and the [[National Lawyers Guild]], filed a lawsuit demanding that the ADL release its surveillance information and end its investigations, as well as ordering it to pay punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;James Bolden, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2221305.html Coalition of Civil Rights Groups Sue Anti-Defamation League], ''[[Los Angeles Sentinel]]'', November 3, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit fueled speculation that the organization was waging a secret campaign to repress political dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/us/anti-defamation-league-accused-of-spying.html "Anti-Defamation League Accused of Spying"], New York Times. October 24, 1993. Retrieved 27 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs' attorney, former Representative McCloskey, claimed that the information the ADL gathered constituted an invasion of privacy. The ADL, while distancing itself from Bullock, countered that it is entitled like any researcher or journalist to research organizations and individuals. Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], stated that like journalists, the ADL's researchers "gather information however they can" and welcome disclosures from confidential sources, saying "they probably rely on their sources to draw the line" on how much can legally be divulged. Bullock admitted that he was overzealous, and that some of the ways in which he gathered information may have been illegal.&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;

The lawsuit was settled out of court in 1999. The ADL agreed to pay $175,000 for the court costs of the groups, two of them Jewish,&lt;ref name="MearWalt" /&gt; that sued it, promised that it would not seek information from sources it knew could not legally disclose such information, consented to remove sensitive information like criminal records or [[Social Security number]]s from its files, and spent $25,000 in order to further relations between the Jewish, Arab and black communities. When the case was settled, [[Hussein Ibish]], director of communications for the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC), claimed that the ADL had gathered data "systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine civil rights and Arab-American organizations". ADL national director Abraham Foxman called the ADC's claims "absolutely untrue", saying that, "if it were true, they would have won their case", and noted that no court found the ADL guilty of any wrongdoing. The ADL released a statement saying that the settlement "explicitly recognizes ADL's right to gather information in any lawful and constitutionally protected manner, which we have always done and will continue to do".&lt;ref name="jewishsf" /&gt; [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] claim that the organization, rather than defending Jews from bigotry, was targeting individuals critical of Israel or of U.S. support for Israel.&lt;ref name="MearWalt" /&gt;

==== Executive Order 12333 ====

During congressional testimony in 1990, the organization was implicated in the use of [[Executive Order 12333]] to facilitate some of its intelligence initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1991: Testimony of members of Congress and other interested individuals and organizations.'' United States. Congress. House. Committee on Appropriations. Subcommittee on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; This compounded on a partnership with the FBI expanded by William Webster beginning in 1978 and resulting in a memorandum in 1985 in which the "agencies" would cooperate through liaisons with direct lines of communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq "Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA"], George Michael.

==== James Rosenberg ====
A case which has been compared to the Bullock case was that of James Mitchell Rosenberg, aka Jim Anderson. Rosenberg/Anderson was an undercover operative of the ADL who acted as an ''[[agent provocateur]]'', posing as a racist right-wing paramilitary extremist. He appeared in this role as part of a TV documentary entitled ''Armies of the Right'' which premiered in 1981. Rosenberg was arrested that same year in New York for carrying an unregistered firearm in public view. In 1984, ADL fact-finding director [[Irwin Suall]] identified Rosenberg as an ADL operative in a court deposition.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kaplan, Heléne Lööw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CjIYNrOO24IC&amp;pg=PA305 ''The cultic milieu: oppositional subcultures in an age of globalization''], {{ISBN|0-7591-0204-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armenian Genocide controversy ===
In 2007, Abraham Foxman came under criticism for his stance on the [[Armenian Genocide]]. The ADL had previously described it as a "massacre" and an "atrocity", but not as a "genocide".&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5114_00.htm
|title=ADL Statement on the Armenian Genocide
|date=August 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxman had earlier opposed calls for the U.S. Government to recognise it as a "genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewcy.com/feature/2007-07-09/fire_foxman |title=Fire Foxman: Denying the Armenian Genocide should be the last atrocity perpetrated by the ADL chief.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I don't think congressional action will help reconcile the issue. The resolution takes a position; it comes to a judgement", said Foxman in a statement issued to the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]. "The [[Turkey|Turks]] and [[Armenia]]ns need to revisit their past. The Jewish community shouldn't be the arbiter of that history, nor should the U.S. Congress, and "a Congressional resolution on such matters is a counterproductive diversion and will not foster reconciliation between Turks and Armenians, and may put at risk the Turkish Jewish community and the important multilateral relationship between Turkey, Israel, and the United States".

In early August 2007, complaints about the Anti-Defamation League's refusal to acknowledge the [[Armenian Genocide]] led to [[Watertown, Massachusetts]]'s, unanimous town council decision to end its participation in the ADL's "No Place for Hate" campaign. (Watertown is known for its Armenian population.) Also in August 2007, an editorial in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' criticized the ADL by saying that, "as an organization concerned about human rights, it ought to acknowledge the [[genocide]] against the Armenian people during [[World War I]], and criticize Turkish attempts to repress the memory of this historical reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= August 3, 2007 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2007/08/03/a_genocide_not_to_be_denied/ |title=A genocide not to be denied |work=[[Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on August 17, 2007, the ADL fired its regional [[New England]] director, Andrew H. Tarsy, for breaking ranks with the main organization and for saying that the ADL should recognize the genocide.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{cite news

The ADL was criticized by many in the Armenian community including ''The Armenian Weekly'' newspaper, in which writer Michael Mensoian stated:

{{quote|The belated backtracking of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in acknowledging the planned, systematic massacre of 1,500,000 Armenian men, women and children as "…tantamount to genocide…" is discouraging. Tantamount means something is equivalent. If it's equivalent, why avoid using the term? For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey. Historians use the term genocide simply because it is the proper term to describe the horrific events that the Ottoman Turkish government unleashed on the Armenian people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/com08250702p.htm "The Armenian Weekly", Volume 73, No. 34, August 25, 2007, By Michael G. Mensoian]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Foxman's capitulation, the New England ADL pressed the organization's national leadership to support a congressional resolution acknowledging the genocide.&lt;ref name=Woolhouse /&gt; After hours of closed-door debate at the annual national meeting in New York, the proposal was ultimately withdrawn.&lt;ref name=Woolhouse /&gt; The organization issued a statement saying it would "take no further action on the issue of the Armenian genocide". The ADL had earlier received direct pressure from the Turkish Foreign ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/911393.html טורקיה לישראל: עזרו לנו לעצור הכרה אמריקאית בשואה הארמנית] Haaretz, 10/10/07, Barak Ravid&lt;/ref&gt; Tarsy submitted his resignation on December 4.&lt;ref name=Woolhouse&gt;{{cite news

In the subsequent months, some [[human rights]] commissions in other Massachusetts communities decided to follow Watertown's lead and withdraw from the ADL's No Place for Hate anti-discrimination program.&lt;ref name=Woolhouse /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://medford.wickedlocal.com/x96464381|title=City recognizes Armenian genocide, suspends ADL membership|last=Esker/medford@cnc.com|first=Sharon Tosto|work=Medford Transcript|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 2016, [[Jonathan Greenblatt]], the ADL's CEO for less than a year, published a blog post in which he wrote "What happened to the Armenian people was unequivocally genocide" and urged the U.S. to take a position recognizing the Armenian genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Greenblatt|Greenblatt, Jonathan]] (May 13, 2016) [https://www.adl.org/blog/adl-on-the-armenian-genocide "ADL on the Armenian Genocide"] Anti-Defamation League website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 1989, the linguist and [[left-wing]] commentator and activist [[Noam Chomsky]] characterized the ADL as having lost entirely its focus on civil rights issues in order to become solely an advocate for Israeli policy; he held that the ADL cast all left-wing opposition to Israeli interests as antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.nvg.org/~skars/ni/ni-c10-s20.html|title=Necessary Illusions: Appendix V [20/33]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in cancellation of speech by Tony Judt at Polish Consulate ===
In 2006, the ADL, in addition to the [[American Jewish Committee]], was criticized by academic [[Tony Judt]] for allegedly pressuring the [[Poland|Polish]] [[List of diplomatic missions of Poland#North America|Consulate-General]] in New York to cancel a scheduled appearance by Judt at Network 20/20, a non-profit organization that rents space from the consulate. In an interview with the ''[[New York Sun]]'', Foxman claimed that the group "had nothing to do with the cancellation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoll |first=Ira |authorlink=Ira Stoll |date=October 4, 2006 |title=Poland Abruptly Cancels a Speech By Local Critic of the Jewish State |journal=[[The New York Sun]] |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/40911?page_no=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; insisting that the ADL only called to ask if the event was being sponsored by the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/media_watch/newspapers/20061116-Chronicle+of+Higher+Ed.htm |title=Article on Free Speech and Israel Gets it Wrong |last=Foxman |first=Abraham H. |authorlink=Abraham Foxman |date=November 16, 2006 |publisher=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Consul General Krzysztof Kasprzyk suggested in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that calls by the ADL and the American Jewish Committee were "exercising a delicate pressure".&lt;ref name="WP sparks"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=Michael |date=October 9, 2006 |title=In N.Y., Sparks Fly Over Israel Criticism |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |pages=A03 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/08/AR2006100800817.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the role of the ADL and the American Jewish Committee in organizing the cancellations, Judt told ''The Washington Post'': "This is serious and frightening, and only in America—not in Israel—is this a problem. These are Jewish organizations that believe they should keep people who disagree with them on the Middle East away from anyone who might listen."&lt;ref name="WP sparks" /&gt; The ADL denied the charges. According to Foxman, "I think they made the right decision... He's taken the position that Israel shouldn't exist. That puts him on our radar."&lt;ref name="WP sparks" /&gt;

=== Denver defamation suit ===
In 1994, the ADL became embroiled in a dispute between neighbors in Denver, Colorado. Upon the involvement of the ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.

Candace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a Radio Shack police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with "Nazi scare tactics", the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of the ADL. Upon the advice of the ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the Aronsons nor the ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.

Not knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of the ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as "a vicious anti-Semitic campaign", based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.

Two days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.

The Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quigley v. Rosenthall|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-10th-circuit/1360107.html|website=Findlaw|publisher=Findlaw|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Quigley's career with [[United Artists]] suffered serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=George|title=Charges of bigotry backfire|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/news0429.htm|accessdate=June 23, 2015|issue=April 29, 2000|publisher=Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon investigation, and after assistant district attorney Steven Jensen heard on the tapes the context of Mrs. Quigley's remarks, all charges but one, a misdemeanor traffic violation against Mr. Quigley, were dropped. The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in "anti-Semitic conduct or harassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quigleys brought a lawsuit against the ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against the ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. The ADL appealed.

According to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge "lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-114248316.html|title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple.

=== New antisemitism controversy ===
{{Main|New antisemitism}}
In 1974, ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R. Epstein published a book called ''The New Anti-Semitism'' (New York, 1974), arguing that a new kind of anti-Semitism is on the rise. In 1982, ADL national leader Nathan Perlmutter and his wife, Ruth Ann Perlmutter, released a book entitled ''The Real Anti-Semitism in America'' (New York, 1982). In 2003, ADL's national director Abraham Foxman published ''Never Again? The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), where on page 4 he states: "We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s—if not a greater one."&lt;ref name="adl.org" /&gt;

Reviewing Forster and Epstein's work in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at [[Brandeis University]], argued that a "new anti-Semitism" was indeed emerging in America, in the form of opposition to the collective rights of the Jewish people, but he criticized Forster and Epstein for conflating it with anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Earl. "Is there a New Anti-Semitism?", ''Commentary'', May 1974, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Allan Brownfeld writes that Forster and Epstein's new definition of antisemitism trivialized the concept by turning it into "a form of political blackmail" and "a weapon with which to silence any criticism of either Israel or U.S. policy in the Middle East",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Norman Finkelstein]] claims that organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League have brought forward charges of new anti-Semitism at various intervals since the 1970s, "not to fight antisemitism, but rather to exploit the historical suffering of Jews in order to immunize Israel against criticism".&lt;ref name=Finkelstein21&gt;Finkelstein, Norman.

Gun rights group [[Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership]] (JPFO) has been highly critical of the Anti-Defamation League. In pamphlets such as "Why Does the ADL Support Nazi-Based Laws?",&lt;ref&gt;The Liberty Crew (September 20, 2007) [http://www.jpfo.org/alerts/alert20070920.htm "Why Does the ADL Support Nazi-Based Laws?"] JPFO.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and "JPFO Facts vs. ADL Lies",&lt;ref&gt;Editors (1997–1999) [http://www.jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/jpfacts.htm "JPFO Facts vs. ADL Lies."] JPFO.org.&lt;/ref&gt; the JPFO has accused the ADL of undermining the welfare of the Jewish people by promoting [[gun control]].

=== Park51 Community Center controversy ===
On July 28, 2010, the ADL issued a statement in which it expressed opposition to the [[Park51]] Community Center, which sponsors planned to build near the [[World Trade Center site]] in New York. The ADL stated, "The controversy which has emerged regarding the building of a Community Center at this location is counterproductive to the healing process. Therefore, under these unique circumstances, we believe the City of New York would be better served if an alternative location could be found."&lt;ref name ="berk" /&gt; The ADL denounced what it saw as bigoted attacks on the project. Foxman opined that some of those who oppose the mosque are "bigots", and that the plan's proponents may have every right to build the mosque at that location. Nevertheless, he said that building the mosque at that site would unnecessarily cause more pain for families of some victims of 9/11.&lt;ref name ="berk"&gt;Jacob Berkman, [http://blogs.jta.org/telegraph/article/2010/07/30/2740283/adl-opposes-world-trade-center-mosque ADL opposes World Trade Center Mosque], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], July 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacoby |first=Susan |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/spirited_atheist/2010/08/ground_zero_mosque_protected_by_first_amendment--but_its_still_salt_in_a_wound.html |title=The Spirited Atheist: Ground Zero mosque protected by First Amendment – but it's still salt in a wound|publisher=The Washington Post |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817115334/http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/spirited_atheist/2010/08/ground_zero_mosque_protected_by_first_amendment--but_its_still_salt_in_a_wound.html| archivedate= August 17, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes6"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/opinion/l05mosque.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=The ADL, the Mosque and the Fight Against Bigotry | date=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/CvlRt_32/5820_32.htm "Statement On Islamic Community Center Near Ground Zero"], Anti-Defamation League, July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusation of Armenian genocide denial ===
Mark Arax, a former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer and current ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' writer of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], strongly criticized the role of the ADL in American [[Armenian Genocide denial]]. In 2007, he spoke with [[Abraham Foxman]], who said:&lt;ref name="Salon 2010" /&gt;
{{quote frame|Our focus is Israel. If helping Turkey helps Israel, then that's what we're in the business of doing. Was it genocide? It was wartime. Things get messy. The Turks and Armenians need to revisit their past. The Jewish community shouldn't be the arbiter of that history. And I don't think the U.S. Congress should be the arbiter, either.}}
Arax later wrote on this: "I almost had to revisit his website to make sure that the ADL was still in the business of fighting not only anti-Semitism, but "bigotry and extremism", and "securing justice and fair treatment to all." When Arax pointed out that the genocide had been documented as a fact by many prominent historians, and that Congress recognizes all sorts of people's history, including resolutions commemorating the victims of the Holocaust, Foxman replied: "You're not suggesting that an Armenian Genocide is the same as the Holocaust, are you?"&lt;ref name="Salon 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/06/16/israel_lobby_genocide_armenia/|title=Suddenly, the Israel lobby discovers a genocide|last=Arax|first=Mark|date=June 16, 2010|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''apartment''' ([[American English]]), '''flat''' ([[British English]]) or '''unit''' ([[Australian English]]) is a self-contained [[housing unit]] (a type of residential [[real estate]]) that occupies only part of a building, generally on a single [[storey]]. There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).

==Terminology==
==="Flat" vs "apartment"===
Both words refer to a self-contained residential unit, i.e. one with its own front door, kitchen, [[toilet (room)]] and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house. In other places the terms are interchangeable.

The term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term apartment is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment). 

In some countries the word "[[Unit (housing)|unit]]" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., "This building has three units" or "I'm going to rent a unit in this building", but not "I'm going to rent a unit somewhere".

Some buildings can be characterized as 'mixed use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.

===By housing tenure===

([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)

[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in "[[Messuage]] or Tenement" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.

In the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as [[cooperative|co-ops]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in [[condominium]]s, whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.

In England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a "share of freehold" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.

A [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=©2012 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].

A [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as "an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&amp;lng=3&amp;esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===By country===
In [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or "co-op"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.

In [[British English]] the usual word is "flat", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.

[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms "unit", "flat" and "apartment" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as "apartments", as the term "flats" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.

In [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.

In [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.

In Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.

==Types and characteristics==
===Studio apartment===
[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Studio apartment, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet]]
{{Main|Studio apartment}}
{{See also|Microapartment}}
The smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term "one room" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a [[House in multiple occupation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private renting: Houses in multiple occupation - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garden apartment (US)===
[[Merriam-Webster]] defines a garden apartment in [[American English]] as "a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garden apartment |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden%20apartment |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first "garden apartment" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 2009-10-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, Meghan. [http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/story-of-the-week/2006/eden-in-the-city.html Eden in the City] ''Preservation Magazine'' online, 2006-09-22. Article on preservation of early United States garden apartment buildings.&lt;/ref&gt; Some garden apartment buildings place a one-car garage under each apartment. The interior grounds are often landscaped.

===Garden flat (UK)===
[[File:Streets of Bayswater.jpg|thumb|[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraced [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]]. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats.]]
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the use of "garden flat" in [[British English]] as "a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. "Garden flat" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a "tradesman's entrance" via the area stairs. This "lower ground floor" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained "garden flat". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].

===Basement apartment===
{{Main|Basement apartment}}
Generally on the lowest floor of a building.

===Secondary suite===
{{Main|Secondary suite}}
When part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an "in-law apartment", "annexe", or "granny flat", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore "basement suites".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an "accessory dwelling unit", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.

===Maisonette===
{{redirect|Maisonette|other uses|Maisonette (disambiguation)}}
Maisonette (from the French word for "little house") has no strict definition, but the OED suggests "A part of a residential building which is occupied separately, usually on more than one floor and having its own outside entrance." This differs from flats, which are usually reached through shared entrance doors, stairs or corridors.

Discounting the "usually", a maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.&lt;ref name="Housing in Gateshead" &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Housing in Gateshead
  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf
  |publisher=Gateshead Council
  |year=2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Maisonette" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'Four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.

===One dwelling with two storeys===
[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]
The vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence "flat". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is "maisonette", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.

Two storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as "[[townhouse]]s".

===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===
[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]
[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]

"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.

Duplex description can be different depending on the part of the country but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story.

In the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or "raised cottage" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.

Groups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]].

===Loft apartment===
[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]
{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}
This type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].

These loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.

===Penthouse===
{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}
An apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Communal apartment===
{{Main|Communal apartment}}
In [[Russia]], a communal apartment («коммуналка») is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=www.terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serviced apartment===
[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]
{{Main|Serviced apartment}}
{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}
A "serviced apartment" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a "lock-up and leave" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Facilities===
[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]
Apartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Laundry]] facilities may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

On or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the mailman and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Various===
In more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.

Moving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)

Small apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In most American West Coast cities, the need for resisting earthquakes at a low building cost results in the construction of many low-rise apartments of wooden frames with thin plaster-board based exterior and interior dry walls, despite sometimes being on as many as three or four levels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Historical examples==

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
The [[Puebloan peoples]] of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.

In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title=Teotihuacan: Ancient City of Pyramids|url=http://www.livescience.com/22545-teotihuacan.html|website=Livescience|publisher=Livescience|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city's population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Living the good life in Teotihuacan|url=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html|accessdate=19 March 2016|ref=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Teotihuacan.htm|website=Mexican History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman [[insulae]].

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|Remains of an Ancient Roman apartment block from the early 2nd century AD in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]]]
In [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled. The floor at ground level was used for [[taberna]]s, shops and businesses, with living space on the higher floors. Insulae in Rome and other [[Roman Empire|imperial]] cities reached up to ten or more stories,&lt;ref name="Gregory S. Aldrete"&gt;Gregory S. Aldrete: "Daily Life in the Roman City: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia", 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-313-33174-9}}, p.79f.&lt;/ref&gt; some with more than 200 stairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martial]], Epigrams, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Roman emperor|emperors]], beginning with [[Augustus]] (r. 30&amp;nbsp;BC-14&amp;nbsp;AD), attempted to establish limits of 20–25&amp;nbsp;m for multi-storey buildings, but met with only limited success.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], 5.3.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander G. McKay: Römische Häuser, Villen und Paläste, [[Feldmeilen]] 1984, {{ISBN|3-7611-0585-1}} p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The lower floors were typically occupied by either shops or wealthy families, while the upper stories were rented out to the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Gregory S.

===Ancient and medieval Egypt===
During the medieval [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic-Islamic period]], the Egyptian capital of [[Fustat]] ([[Old Cairo]]) housed many [[high-rise]] residential buildings, some seven stories tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. In the 10th century, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] described them as resembling [[minaret]]s,&lt;ref name=Behrens/&gt; and stated that the majority of Fustat's population lived in these multi-storey apartment buildings, each one housing more than 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[Nasir Khusraw]] described some of these apartment buildings rising up to fourteen stories, with [[roof garden]]s on the top storey complete with ox-drawn [[water wheel]]s for irrigating them.&lt;ref name=Behrens&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Architecture in Cairo|first=Doris|last=Behrens-Abouseif|year=1992|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-04-09626-4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, the current [[Cairo]] also had high-rise apartment buildings, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were [[Renting|rented]] out to [[Leasehold estate|tenants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Traditional Islamic principles of built environment|first=Hisham|last=Mortada|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=0-7007-1700-5|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemen===

High-rise apartment buildings were built in the [[Yemen]]i city of [[Shibam]] in the 16th century.

===Ancient China===
The [[Hakka people]] in southern [[China]] adopted communal living structures designed to be easily defensible, in the form of Weilongwu (围龙屋) and [[Tulou]] (土楼). The latter are large, enclosed and fortified earth buildings, between three and five stories high and housing up to eighty families.

==Current examples==
===England===
In London, by the time of the 2011 census, 52 per cent of all homes were flats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Housing-in-London-2012_v4.pdf Housing in London - The evidence base for The London Housing strategy - December 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313035749/http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Housing-in-London-2012_v4.pdf |date=13 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were built as Georgian or Victorian houses and subsequently divided up. Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many tower blocks were built in the UK after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history.  Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a "flat above a shop" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman.  In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house – even if this was a small [[terraced house]] - while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.

During the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change.  Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a ''[[pied-à-terre]]'' in the capital.  The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.

The first mansion flats in England were:
*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Knowles (architect)|James Knowles]] designed.  These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s.  Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate "houses", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor.  Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing.  Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].
*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876.  Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block.  The gamble paid off and was a success.

===Scotland===
[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]
[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]
In [[Scotland]], the term "[[tenement]]" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere, and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.

During the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour "[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''—both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors, and in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the "back green" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or "factor".

In [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide "homes fit for heroes". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].

Post [[Second World War]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums to modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Williamson, E., Riches, A. &amp; Higgs, M. ''The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow''. London: Penguin Books, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-071069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotcities.com/cathcart/houses.htm Houses and Mansions: Domestic Architecture of Glasgow's South Side] 2008-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; Again, economic considerations meant that many of the planned "New Town" amenities were never built in these areas. These housing estates, known as "schemes", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] ("deserts with windows", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High rise living too started off with bright ambition—the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable—but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.

In 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in "stone cleaning", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed "grey" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a "universally admired architectural" style.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; --&gt; The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a £96 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]

[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]

In 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. "Old Dan" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. "I have made my will," he said. "My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand." In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31–32|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.

[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.

Some significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).

In the United States, "tenement" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are "walk-ups" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term "[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky façades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.

====Property classes====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
In the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:

''Class A''
properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.

''Class B''
properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.

''Class C''
properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters "for life". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.

''Class D''
properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.

===Canada===
Apartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton, Ontario in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments, and both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average cap rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in the last 30 years. The cap rate in Q3 2015 stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]
[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]
[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]

Apartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or "owners corporation" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres.  These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.

In Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.

Australia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].

The earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values–both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914 - the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).

Post-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.

The main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.

In other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].

In the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).

In Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York "loft" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the amount of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.

Despite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.

Today, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.

Some Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]],  are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9938">The '''Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project''' ('''ACLED''')  is a project that collates data on [[political violence]] in developing states, from 1997 to the present. As of early 2015, ACLED has recorded over 90,000 individual events, with ongoing data collection focused on [[Africa]]. Data on South and South-East Asia are also available.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acleddata.com/about-acled/|title = About ACLED|accessdate = January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team and history==

ACLED is directed by Prof. Clionadh Raleigh and operated by senior research manager Caitriona Dowd, both affiliated with the [[University of Sussex]], while data collection involves several researchers.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The dataset was introduced by Raleigh and co-authors in a 2010 paper in the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Introducing ACLED: An Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset|last = Raleigh|first = Clionadh|last2 = Linke|first2 = Andrew|last3 = Hegre|first3 = Håvard|last4 = Karlsen|first4 = Joakim|journal = [[Journal of Peace Research]]|volume = 47|issue = 5|pages = 1–10|url =http://www.prio.org/Global/upload/CSCW/Data/UCSD_paper_final.pdf|doi = 10.1177/0022343310378914}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLED was originally hosted by the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] (but was, even at the time, distinct from the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program|UCDP/PRIO]] Armed Conflict dataset) but later moved to an independent home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prio.org/Data/Armed-Conflict/Armed-Conflict-Location-and-Event-Data/|title = ACLED - Armed Conflict Location and Event Data|publisher = [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]]|accessdate = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLED is now registered as an independent, non-governmental organization in the United States.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acleddata.com/about-acled/|title = About ACLED|accessdate = January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==

ACLED data contain information on the specific dates and locations of conflict events, the types of events, the groups involved, reported fatalities and changes in territorial control. ACLED covers political violence in all African countries starting from 1997 to the present, and South and South-East Asia in real-time. Data for non-African states are also available for the period 1997-2010, with the exception of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], for which "beta" data collections are available for 2006-2009.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=data&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acleddata.com/data/|title = Data|accessdate = January 28, 2015|publisher = Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data collection involves a variety of sources including reports from developing countries and local media, humanitarian agencies, and research publications. A full account of definitions, practices, source materials and coding procedures are available in the Methodology section on ACLED website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Methodology|url=http://www.acleddata.com/methodology/|publisher=Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data are updated in real-time and can be downloaded from the website.

==Uses and users of ACLED==

===Academic literature and practitioners===

Over the past few years, several scholars have cited ACLED in their research on civil wars and political violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ACLED|title=A Review of Research Using ACLED in 2014|url=http://www.crisis.acleddata.com/a-review-of-research-using-acled-in-2014/|publisher=Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLED has also been referenced in a number of reports published by development practitioners and humanitarian agencies, including the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], [[United Nations]] country offices, the [[United States State Department]] and the [[United States military]].

===Blogs on political violence and data analysis===

Political scientist, data analyst, and forecaster [[Jay Ulfelder]] blogged about his experience trying to use the ACLED to see if it added predictive power in estimating the probability of coups, and explained both how he approached the problem and why he eventually concluded that the ACLED data did not add predictive power for coup forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dartthrowingchimp.wordpress.com/2014/06/02/conflict-events-coup-forecasts-and-data-prospecting/|title = Conflict Events, Coup Forecasts, and Data Prospecting|last = Ulfelder|first = Jay|authorlink = Jay Ulfelder|date = June 2, 2014|accessdate = June 12, 2014|publisher = Dart-Throwing Chimp}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 23 successful and unsuccessful changes in power through coups have occurred across Africa since 1997. Recent research suggests that coup risk is related to the size and stability of a leader's cabinet, and not episodes of political violence preceding coups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arriola|first1=Leonardo R.|title=Patronage and Political Stability in Africa|journal=Comparative Political Studies|date=October 2009|volume=42|issue=10|pages=1339–1362|url=http://polisci.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/people/u3618/Arriola_2009.pdf|accessdate=January 29, 2015|doi=10.1177/0010414009332126}}&lt;/ref&gt; A post by Thomas Zeitzoff at the ''Political Violence at a Glance'' blog listed the ACLED as one of several "high-profile datasets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2013/04/02/why-ir-and-conflict-research-need-micro-foundations/|title = Why IR and Conflict Research Need Micro-Foundations|last = Zeitzoff|first = Thomas|date = April 2, 2013|accessdate = June 12, 2014|publisher = ''Political Violence at a Glance''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Meier blogged about it at irevolution.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://irevolution.net/2009/06/08/armed-conflict-and-location-event-dataset-acled |title= Armed Conflict and Location Event Dataset (ACLED) {{!}} iRevolutions |last= Meier |first= Patrick |date= June 8, 2009 |accessdate= June 12, 2014 |publisher= iRevolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8717">The '''Assize of Bread and Ale''' ({{lang-la|Assisa panis et cervisiae}}) was a 13th-century law in [[High Middle Ages|high medieval]] England, which regulated the price, weight and quality of the [[bread]] and [[beer]] manufactured and sold in towns, villages and hamlets. It was the first law in British history to regulate the production and sale of food.{{sfn|Gibbins|1897|pp=245–246}}{{sfn|Cartwright|2001|p=152}} At the local level, this resulted in [[regulatory]] [[licensing]] systems, with arbitrary recurring [[fee]]s, and fines and punishments for lawbreakers (see [[amercement]]).{{sfn|Bennett|2004|pp=233–236}} In rural areas, the statute was enforced by [[Lord of the Manor|manorial lords]], who held tri-weekly [[court]] sessions.{{sfn|Hornsey|2004|pp=292–296}}

The law was amended by the Bread Acts of 1822 and 1836, which stipulated that loaves should be sold by the pound, or multiple thereof, and finally repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1863]] (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. 125).

==Origin==
An assize was originally a fixed sitting of a court or council. Under the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]] monarchy its meaning developed to signify a law based upon "agreed custom".

==Background==
Bread regulation was the most significant and long-lasting commercial law in medieval England. The first bread assize law dates back to the 13th century, but its origins are even older. This law can be traced back to proclamations from the reigns of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and [[John of England|John]] that regulated the purchasing requirements of the royal household.{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=464}}

These assizes adjusted the weight of bread according to the price of wheat. The price of bread was always the same, even though the price of grain fluctuated. Instead, when the price of grain increased, the weight of bread was reduced accordingly. For every increase in the price of wheat, the weight of a loaf fell.{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=464}} The Assize of Bread and Ale set the price of [[ale]] and the weight for a [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] loaf of bread.{{sfn|Wood|2002|pp=97–98}} The act reduced competition and was purportedly given at the request of the bakers of [[Coventry]], embracing several ordinances of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]'s predecessors.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Davies, Charles (1871) ''The Metric System, Considered with Reference to its Introduction into the United States''. A. S. Barnes and Company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic context==
The expensive equipment associated with brewing and baking, particularly the [[oven]], created a commercial market for the goods. This resulted in a perceived need for regulations controlling quality and pricing, and checking weights, to avoid fraudulent activity by food providers.

==Declarations==
Some versions of the statute include an explanatory third paragraph which begins:

{{"
|text=By the Consent of the whole Realm of ''England'', the Measure of our Lord the King was made; that is to say: That an [[English penny|''English'' peny]], called a ''[[sterling silver|Sterling]]'', round and without any [[coin clipping|clipping]], shall weigh 32 [[grains (unit)|Wheat Corn]]s in the midst of the [[ear of wheat|Ear]], and 20 ''[[pennyweight|d]]''. do make an [[Ounce]], and 12 Ounces one [[Tower pound|Pound]], and 8 Pound do make a [[wine gallon|Gallon of Wine]], and 8 Gallons of Wine do make a [[London bushel|''London'' Bushel]], which is the Eighth Part of a [[quarter (unit)|Quarter]].&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name=assbread&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Ruffhead |editor-first=Owen |editor-link=Owen Ruffhead |title=The Statutes at Large |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I: From Magna Charta&lt;!--sic--&gt; to the End of the Reign of King Henry the Sixth.

}}

===Bread===
The assize presented an established scale, then of ancient standing, between the prices of wheat and of bread, providing that when the ''quarter'' (~240 L / 6.9 US bushel if the gallon is taken to be the [[wine gallon]]) of wheat was sold at twelve [[pence]], the farthing loaf of the best white bread should weigh six pounds sixteen shillings (~2.5&amp;nbsp;kg / 5.6&amp;nbsp;lb [[Avoirdupois|avdp]] if the pound is taken to be the troy pound). It then graduated the weight of bread according to the price of wheat, and for every six pence added to the quarter of wheat, the weight of the farthing loaf was reduced; until, when the wheat was at twenty shillings a quarter, it directed the weight of the loaf to be six shillings and three pence (~120 g / 4.1 oz avdp).

The assize of bread was in force until the beginning of the 19th century, and was only then abolished in London.{{sfn|Gibbins|1897|p=229}}

===Ale===
In a similar manner, the assize regulated the price of the gallon of ale, by the price of wheat, barley, and oats, stating that,

{{"
|text=when a quarter of wheat was sold for three shillings, or three shillings and four-pence, and a quarter of barley for twenty pence or twenty-four pence, and a quarter of oats for fifteen pence, brewers in cities could afford to sell two gallons of ale for a penny, and out of cities three gallons for a penny; and when in a town (in burgo) three gallons are sold for a penny, out of a town they may and ought to sell four.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;Long, George, ed. (1833) "Ale", in: ''The Penny Cyclopædia''. 30 vols. London: Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; {which vol.?} p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Over time, this uniform scale of price created opportunities for [[arbitrage]] that made it extremely inconvenient and oppressive; and by the statute 23 [[Henry VIII of England|Hen. VIII]] c. 4 in the 16th century, it was enacted that ale-brewers should charge for their ale such prices as might appear convenient and sufficient in the discretion of the [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] within whose jurisdiction where the ale-brewers lived. The price of ale was regulated by provisions like those stated above, and the quality was ascertained by officers of great antiquity, called ''gustatores cervisiae'', that is, "aletasters" or [[Ale-Conner|ale-conners]], chosen annually in the [[court-leet]] of each manor, and were sworn "to examine and assay the beer and ale, and to take care that they were good and wholesome, and sold at proper prices according to the assize; and also to present all defaults of brewers to the next court-leet."&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt;

'''Bethel College''' is a four-year private Christian [[liberal arts]] college in [[North Newton, Kansas|North Newton]], [[Kansas]], United States.  It is affiliated with the [[Mennonite Church USA]].

==History==

===Early years===
Founded in 1887 and conferring its first four-year degrees in 1912, Bethel is the oldest Mennonite college in North America. Starting in 1874, thousands of [[Russian Mennonite]]s began arriving in Kansas. In 1882, having a century of experience running their own schools, they opened Emmental, a training school for teachers, between Newton and [[Goessel, Kansas]]. The school was moved to [[Halstead, Kansas]], in 1883. A better site was found in North Newton, Kansas, and the cornerstone of the main building was laid on October 12, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;The cornerstone was laid by Andrew B. Shelly (1834–1913), then president of the General Conference Mennonite Church. (Kaufman, p. 73.)&lt;/ref&gt; This structure, the current Administration Building, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The Administration Building has been on the Historic Register since March 16, 1972.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Campus relocation===
The Halstead school was closed for the 1892–1893 school year while it was relocated to the new site and reopened as Bethel College in 1893. Bethel College became the second institution of higher learning associated with the [[General Conference Mennonite Church]] (now known as the ''Mennonite Church USA''), replacing [[Wadsworth Institute]] which had closed in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/location/campus-map/#!ad_building Administration Building page] of the Bethel College website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Newton===
During the 1880s, Kansas cities and towns competed with one another to create, build, and construct many institutions and buildings including colleges. On May 11, 1887, representatives of the Newton community and the Kansas Conference of Mennonites signed a charter for Bethel College to be built on a plot of about {{convert|120|acre|km2}}. Over a year later on October 12, 1888, around 2,500 people gathered on the property to lay the cornerstone of what is today the Administration Building of Bethel College.   The building project took around five years to fully complete. The fund-raising to create the institution was slow, but on September 20, 1893 there was a service of dedication held for the building to be opened, and classes began.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===First college president===
Cornelius H. Wedel, a young teacher, was made Bethel College's first president. There were 98 students – 77 men and 21 women ages 13 to mid-30s – living on the west end of the main floor and the ground floor of the Administration Building.  Wedel and his family lived on the east end of the Administration Building's main floor.  The classrooms, chapel, and library of 600 volumes were located on the second floor. In those days, the students were up by five in the morning and in bed by ten at night. Each student worked two hours a day at a campus job.  Student conduct was strictly monitored.  Men and women were not allowed to be in the library during the same evenings; they alternated each evening. Five men, including the president, made up the first faculty. They taught classes in the Bible, church history, German, [[English studies|English]], mathematics, science, and music. Bethel College was a bilingual college until early 1918, when the U.S. entered [[World War I]]. German was removed from the curriculum, but later reinstated: as of the 2011–2012 school year, two years of German were offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bethel College German Language|url=http://www.bethelks.edu/academics/areas/german/|publisher=Bethel College|accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administration Building was the main campus structure until 1925 when the Science Hall was completed. The cornerstone for Memorial Hall was laid in 1938, and the building was completed in 1942. The Art Center has also been in place for many years. In 1952 the [[Mennonite Church USA Archives|Mennonite Library and Archives]] was built. In 1979, the current student center/cafeteria was built. The newest building is the Thresher Stadium in the Thresher Sports Complex. The Krehbiel Science Center was completed in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

There are three student residence halls located on campus.  They are Haury Hall (completed in 1958 and expanded in 1963), Warkentin Court (completed in 1966), and the newer Voth Hall (completed in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/about-the-college/125th-anniversary/history-of-bethel/ History of Bethel College]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luyken Fine Arts Center includes the Krehbiel Auditorium and Prairie Sky Stage for stage performances, lectures and events; the Robert W. Regier Art Gallery which hosts exhibits by local, regional, national and international artists, including Bethel alumni, in all types of media; and houses the music, drama and communication arts departments.

== Organization and administration ==
{{As of|2017}} the college president was John K. Sherriff.&lt;ref name="Bethel-Admin"&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/people/administration/ Administration; Bethel College.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic profile ==
Bethel's curriculum is founded on a general education program in the liberal arts and [[sciences]], and is geared toward students of moderate to high academic ability. There are requirements for the study of religion, and a cross-cultural experience.{{Clarify|date=May 2017}} The college offers majors in the traditional liberal arts disciplines and selected career areas, and accredited professional programs in [[nursing]], [[social work]], athletic training, and teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/ Official Bethel Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==

{{main article|Bethel Threshers}}
Bethel College teams are nicknamed the Threshers. The college is a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) and competes in the [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] (KCAC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

In the 2006–07 season, three of Bethel's coaches were named [[Conference (sports)|conference]] Coach of the Year. The Threshers have won more than 55 conference titles. In 1998–99  six of the ten Thresher teams won conference [[champion]]ships. At Bethel College the athletes also compete academically; 89 student athletes have been named American Scholar Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelthreshers.com/ Athletics of Bethel College]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chaebol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|eɪ|b|ɒ|l|,_|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|b|əl}};&lt;ref name="ODE"&gt;{{cite web|title=chaebol|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chaebol|website=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaebol|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chaebol|website=[[Dictionary by Merriam-Webster]]|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-ko|tɕɛ̝.bʌl|lang|Ko-재벌.oga}}) is a large industrial [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] that is run and controlled by an owner or family in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; A chaebol often consists of a large number of diversified affiliates, controlled by an owner whose power over the group often exceeds legal authority.&lt;ref name="Jung 2004 299–303"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=Dong-Hyeon|title=Korean Chaebol in Transition|journal=China Report |date=August 2004|volume=40|issue=3|pages=299–303|doi=10.1177/000944550404000306|url=http://chr.sagepub.com/content/40/3/299|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used in a context similar to that of the English word "[[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The term was derived from the Japanese. It was first used in English in 1984.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; There are several dozen large South Korean family-controlled corporate groups that fall under this definition.

The chaebol have also played a significant role in South Korean politics. In 1988, a member of a chaebol family, [[Chung Mong-joon]], president of [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]], successfully ran for the [[National Assembly of South Korea]]. Other business leaders also were chosen to be members of the National Assembly through [[proportional representation]]. [[Hyundai]] has made efforts to contribute to the thawing [[North Korea–South Korea relations|North Korean and South Korean relations]], but not without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/course_00S_L9436_001/2004/hyndais-money.pdf|title=Hyundai's $500 Million Payments to North Korea: A Bribe or Business Deal?|publisher=Korea WebWeekly|date= 9 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many South Korean family-run chaebols have been criticized for low dividend payouts and other governance practices that favor controlling [[shareholder]]s at the expense of ordinary investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Joyce|title=Samsung Electronics names new-generation leaders as profit soars|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results/samsung-electronics-names-new-generation-leaders-as-profit-soars-idUSKBN1CZ2U8|accessdate=31 October 2017|agency=Reuters|date=30 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word chaebol derived from the [[McCune–Reischauer]] romanization, ''chaebŏl'', of the [[Korean language|Korean]] word ''jaebeol'' ({{lang|ko|재벌}}, from ''jae'' "wealth or property" + ''beol'' "faction or clan" – also written with the same Chinese characters 財閥 as [[Zaibatsu]] in Japan).&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; The word entered English use in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ODE" /&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:hdhq.jpg|thumb|right|The former headquarters of Hyundai in [[Seoul]].]]
South Korea's economy was small and predominantly [[agriculture|agricultural]] well into the mid-20th century. However, the policies of [[President of South Korea|President]] [[Park Chung Hee]] spurred rapid [[industrialization]] by promoting large businesses, following his seizure of power in 1961. The First Five Year Economic Plan&lt;ref name="Jung 2004 299–303"/&gt; by the government set [[industrial policy]] toward new investment, and the chaebol were to be guaranteed loans from the banking sector. The chaebol played a key role in developing new industries, markets, and [[export]] production, helping make [[South Korea]] one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

Although South Korea's major industrial programs did not begin until the early 1960s, the origins of the country's entrepreneurial elite were found in the political economy of the 1950s. Very few Koreans had owned or managed larger corporations during the Japanese colonial period. After the departure of the Japanese in 1945, some Korean businessmen obtained the assets of some of the Japanese firms, a number of which grew into the chaebol of the 1990s.

The companies, as well as certain other firms that were formed in the late 1940s and early 1950s, had close links with [[Syngman Rhee]]'s First Republic, which lasted from 1948 to 1960. It is confirmed that many of these companies received special treatment from the government in return for kickbacks and other payments.

When the military took over the government in 1961, its leaders announced that they would eradicate the corruption that had plagued the Rhee administration and eliminate "injustice" from society. Some leading industrialists were arrested and charged with corruption, but the new government realized that it would need the help of entrepreneurs if the government's ambitious plans to modernize the economy were to be fulfilled. A compromise was reached, under which many of the accused corporate leaders paid fines to the government. Subsequently, there was increased cooperation between corporate and government leaders in modernizing the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=South Korea: A Country Study|first=Andrea Matles|last=Savada|page=152}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government-chaebol cooperation was essential to the subsequent economic growth and astounding successes that began in the early 1960s. Driven by the urgent need to turn the economy away from consumer goods and light industries toward heavy, chemical, and import-substitution industries, political leaders and government planners relied on the ideas and cooperation of the chaebol leaders. The government provided the blueprints for industrial expansion; the chaebol realized the plans. However, the chaebol-led industrialization accelerated the monopolistic and oligopolistic concentration of capital and economically profitable activities in the hands of a limited number of conglomerates.

Park used the chaebol as a means towards economic growth. Exports were encouraged, reversing Rhee's policy of reliance on imports. Performance quotas were established.

The chaebol were able to grow because of two factors: foreign loans and special favors. Access to foreign technology also was critical to the growth of the chaebol through the 1980s. Under the guise of "guided capitalism," the government selected companies to undertake projects and channeled funds from foreign loans. The government guaranteed repayment should a company be unable to repay its foreign creditors. Additional loans were made available from domestic banks. In the late 1980s, the chaebol dominated the industrial sector and were especially prevalent in manufacturing, trading, and heavy industries.

The tremendous growth that the chaebol experienced, beginning in the early 1960s, was closely tied to the expansion of South Korean exports. Growth resulted from the production of a diversity of goods rather than just one or two products. Innovation and the willingness to develop new product lines were critical. In the 1950s and early 1960s, chaebol concentrated on wigs and textiles; by the mid-1970s and 1980s, heavy, defense, and chemical industries had become predominant. While these activities were important in the early 1990s, real growth was occurring in the electronics and high-technology industries. The chaebol also were responsible for turning the trade deficit in 1985 to a trade surplus in 1986. The current account balance, however, fell from more than US$14 billion in 1988 to US$5 billion in 1989.

The chaebol continued their explosive growth in export markets in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, the chaebol had become financially independent and secure, thereby eliminating the need for further government-sponsored credit and assistance.

By the 1990s, South Korea was one of the largest [[newly industrialized countries]] and boasted a standard of living comparable to industrialized countries.
[[File:Seoul Square.jpg|220px|thumb|Former headquarters of the defunct Daewoo Group, once the second-largest conglomerate in South Korea.]]
President [[Kim Young-sam]] began to challenge the chaebol, but it was not until the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] that the weaknesses of the system were widely understood. Of the 30 largest chaebol, 11 collapsed between July 1997 and June 1999. Initially, the crisis was caused by a sharp drop in the value of the currency and aside from immediate cash flow concerns for paying foreign debts, the lower cost ultimately helped the stronger chaebol expand their brands to Western markets, but the simultaneous decline of nearby export markets in Southeast Asia, which had been fueling growth made the large debts incurred, for what was now overcapacity, become fatal to many of the chaebol. The remaining chaebol also became far more specialized in their focus. For example, with a population ranked 26th in the world, before the crisis, the country had seven major [[automobile]] manufacturers. Afterward, only two major manufacturers remained intact though two additional continued, in a smaller capacity, under [[General Motors]] and [[Renault]].
The chaebol debts were not only to state industrial banks but also to independent banks and their own financial services subsidiaries. The scale of the loan defaults meant that banks could neither foreclose nor write off bad loans without themselves collapsing, so the failure to service these debts quickly caused a systemic banking crisis, and South Korea turned to the IMF for assistance. The most spectacular example came in mid-1999, with the collapse of the [[Daewoo]] Group, which had some US$80 billion in unpaid debt. At the time, it was the largest corporate [[bankruptcy]] in history.

Investigations also exposed widespread corruption in the chaebol, particularly [[fraud]]ulent [[accounting]] and bribery.

Still, South Korea recovered quickly from the crisis, and most of the blame for economic problems was shifted to the IMF. The remaining chaebol have grown substantially since the crisis, but they have maintained far lower debt levels.

In 2014, the largest chaebol, Samsung, composed about 17% of the South Korean economy and held roughly US$17 billion in cash. However, recent financial statements of these chaebols actually show that chaebols are slowly losing power over either international competition or internal disruptions from newly emerging startups. Net profit/income of South Korea's top conglomerates has decreased from 2012 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innovationiseverywhere.com/south-korean-startups-save-conglomerates/|title=Can South Korean Startups (and the government) Save its Flailing Giant Tech Conglomerates? |publisher=Innovation is Everywhere|last=Pasquier |first=Martin |date=June 2016 |access-date=2016-07-12}} reprinted from {{cite web |author=Martin Pasquier |title=Can South Korean Startups (and the government) Save its Flailing Giant Tech Conglomerates? |date=May 17, 2016 |publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did their profits stop increasing, but certain chaebols such as LG, have been making losses and losing talent.

== Corporate governance ==

=== Management structure ===
Some chaebol are one large [[corporation]] while others have broken up into loosely connected groups of separate companies sharing a common name. Even in the latter case, each is almost always owned, controlled, or managed by the same family group.

South Korea's chaebol are often compared with [[Japan]]'s [[keiretsu]] business groupings, the successors to the pre-war [[zaibatsu]]. While the "chaebol" are similar to the "zaibatsu" (the words are [[cognates]], from the same [[hanja]] or [[kanji]]), some major differences have evolved between chaebol and keiretsu:
* Chaebol are still largely controlled by their founding families while keiretsu are controlled by groups of professional managers. Chaebol, furthermore, are more family based and family oriented than their Japanese counterparts.
* Chaebol are centralized in ownership while keiretsu are more decentralized.
* Chaebol have more often formed subsidiaries to produce components for exports while large Japanese corporations have mostly switched to employing outside contractors.
* The major structural difference between Korean chaebol and the Japanese keiretsu is that chaebol do not all have their own financial institutions. Most were heavily dependent on government loans and loan guarantees in their early years, and they still have a closer relationship with government than their Japanese counterparts. Chaebol are largely prohibited from owning private banks, partly to spread risk and partly to increase the government's leverage over the banks in areas such as credit allocation. In 1990, government regulations made it difficult for a chaebol to develop an exclusive banking relationship, but following the cascading collapses of the late 1990s, it was somewhat relaxed. Keiretsu have historically worked with an affiliated bank, giving the affiliated companies almost unlimited access to credit, so the economic problems for which the Japanese have been known is [[zombie bank]]s rather than a systemic banking crises. However, many of the largest keiretsu have diversified their debt practices, and public bond sales have become somewhat common.

The chaebol model is heavily reliant on a complex system of interlocking ownership. The owner of the chaebol, with the help of family members, family-owned charity and senior managers from subsidiaries, has to control only three of four public companies, who themselves control other companies that control subsidiaries. A good example of this practice would be the owner of [[Doosan]], who controlled more than 20 subsidiaries with only a minor participation in about 5 companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Dong-Woon|date=April 2003|title=Interlocking Ownership in the Korean Chaebol|journal=Corporate governance: an International Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity ===
The chairmen in charge of the chaebol possess a small portion of equity in the companies under the large umbrella of the chaebol but are very powerful in making decisions and have the ability to control all management. For example, Samsung owns 0.5% in the group's listed firms. That demonstrates a lack in the rule of law.&lt;ref name="Jung 2004 299–303" /&gt; The method that allows this type of possession is called cross-holding, which is a horizontal and vertical structure that enhances the control of the chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moskalev|first=Sviatoslav|last2=Park|first2=Seung Chan|date=March 2010|title=South Korean Chaebols and Value-Based Management|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=92|pages=49–62|doi=10.1007/s10551-009-0138-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace culture ===
The typical culture at one of these conglomerates is highly paternalistic in nature. Much of the environment is defined by the chairman who acts as a "fatherly-figure" to his subordinates. This can be traced back to the infusion of [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] values that permeate Korean society. A chaebol head's demeanor towards his employee can be described as "loving" while maintaining "sternness and a sense of responsibility". Workers commit to long hours, most notably on weekends and holidays, in order to appease their superiors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Korea: The Impossible Country|last=Tudor|first=Daniel|publisher=Tuttle|year=2012|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Company outings and drinking sessions tend to be compulsory as to foster a sense of family and belonging among employees. Employers believe that enhancing a common bond between them would translate into prosperity and productivity for the company. Other practices that would be uncommon for Western workplaces to engage in include gift-giving to employees and arranging dates for workers in search of relationships or marriage. The chaebol are notoriously hierarchical. As such, it is unusual for an individual to challenge or question the decision-making of his or her boss. This dynamic adds to the culture that orients itself around whoever is in charge; but can lead to undesirable circumstances. For example, the [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214|Asiana flight 214]] crash led critics to speculate that cultural factors prevented a pilot on board from aborting the low-speed landing and thus straying from his superior's commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asiana-culture-idUSBREA1906U20140210|title=Asiana Airlines seeks cockpit culture changer after U.S. crash|date=2017-02-10|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion is rarely merit based. Rather, it is through order of age and time served to the conglomerate. This is reflected by the fact that most executives are far older than their employees. If a worker does not attain an executive or high-management role by the age of fifty, he or she is commonly forced into resignation. Again, this is attributable to the age-hierarchy dynamics in Korean Confucian culture. Loyalty to the firm is heavily emphasized at the chaebol. Signs of this is evident in standard recruiting process, where newly acquired employees undergo intense initiations. Activities in these tests include training camps and singing company unique songs that reiterate the production goals of the firm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Even though the chaebol system helped bring about rapid growth and helped Korea launch itself on the international stage, it caused negative impacts on the Korean economy:

===Emergence and inflation===
The origins of the chaebol system in South Korea come as consequence of the Korean War. The war resulted in much destruction and halted industrial production, which led the government to print money to pay for the war and meet requirements of the United Nations forces for the Korean currency, all of which caused mass inflation. This inflation caused many commodity prices to double every six months.

The government had to react and so devised a plan in providing strong financial incentives to private companies between the 1960s and 1970s. It consisted on the government choosing select family businesses to distribute the incentives (imported raw materials, commodities, bank loans). The impact was immediate, and most of the businesses flourished rapidly. The protection of infant companies allowed them to develop because of the highly regulated market, which prevented foreign companies from entering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Beck | first=Peter M. | journal= Asian Survey| title=Revitalizing Korea's Chaebol |date=November 1998 | volume=38 | issue=11 | pages=1018–1035 | doi=10.1525/as.1998.38.11.01p0405n}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies that were not in the circle of businesses saw the system as flawed and corrupted.&lt;ref name="Jung 2004 299–303" /&gt; While these problems resemble "[[crony capitalism]]" problems common in developing countries, corruption scandals have periodically occurred in all of the chaebol.

===Internal market transactions accountability===
Because the government gave out incentives to help businesses, it had a lot of control over them. However, there was no way to ensure the businesses would use the incentives in an effective and efficient manner.&lt;ref name="Jung 2004 299–303"/&gt; In other words, there was no external monitoring system to monitor the chaebol and ensure that they were efficient in the allocation of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Seung-Rok|last2=Yuhn |first2=Ky-hyang|title=Has the Korean Model of Chaebol Succeeded?|journal=Journal of Economic Studies|year=2012|volume=39|issue=2|pages=260–274|doi=10.1108/01443581211222680|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17031521&amp;show=abstract|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All businesses undertake internal market transactions, which constitute "purchase and sale of intermediate inputs, the provision and receipt of loan collaterals, and the provision and receipt of payment guarantees among member firms in a business group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Seung-Rok|author2=Yuhn, Ky-hyang|title=Has the Korean chaebol model succeeded?|journal=Journal of Economic Studies|date=April 2011 |volume=39 |issue=2 |doi=10.1108/01443581211222680 |pages=260–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is the question of efficiency, especially in production and management. Therefore, the system of chaebol was not very transparent. Behind the scenes, businesses were provided with subsidiary financing and intragroup transactions. This allowed them easy loans to cover for their deficits, and prior to the 1997 crisis, huge debts had accumlated, many of which were hidden. That gave the illusion to the world that the system was flourishing into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Jung 2004 299–303"/&gt;

==="Too big to fail"===
During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, bankers feared that the chaebol would go bankrupt so they allowed these businesses to roll over their loans each time they were unable to repay their debts. Many did not believe that the chaebol were capable of collapsing and that the more they borrowed, the safer they were.

However, the theory was proven wrong when many businesses collapsed during the crisis. Since they were linked through debt guarantees, many of the companies fell in a chain reaction.&lt;ref name="Jung 2004 299–303" /&gt; The focus on capacity expansion created debt that was manageable when the economy was growing. However, when the economy stalled, [[debt-to-equity ratio]]s became a huge problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akaba|first=Yuji|author2=Budde, Florian|author3=Jungkiu Choi|title=Restructuring South Korea's Chaebol|journal=McKinsey Quarterly|date=1 December 1998|issue=4|pages=68–79|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=5f415648-0f8c-4e09-b4e1-b55ac6bf1fcc%40sessionmgr13&amp;hid=14|accessdate=13 February 2013}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the crisis, the chaebols now have less debt and are less vulnerable to similar crises, as was demonstrated in the 2008 crisis. With the growth of the fewer remaining chaebols however, each now occupies a larger portion of the economy.

=== Monopolistic behavior ===
The protectionist policies and preferable government treatment granted the chaebol the ability to exhibit monopolistic behavior. The absence of a market free of intervention meant that "true competition" became a rarity in South Korea. Especially in the era prior to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] crisis, the only products available to the Korean people were those made by the chaebol. Therefore, the social fabric of the country lacked an entrepreneurship culture. Massive market concentration exists as is evident from the fact that 80% of the country's GDP is derived from the chaebol. The largest of the group, Samsung, exports 20% of South Korea's goods and services alone. Although no longer financially supported by the government, these firms have attained economies of scale on such a massive level that it is extremely difficult for a startup or small or medium enterprise (SME) to surmount the high barriers to entry. A majority of these smaller companies end up being acquired by the chaebol, only increasing their size and economic dominance. In recent years the trend of selling internationally has been seen among aspiring Korean entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-G20-country-report-2013-South-Korea/$FILE/EY-G20-country-report-2013-South-Korea.pdf|title=EY G20 Country Report 2013 South Korea|last=Ernst &amp; Young|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Ernst &amp; Young|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the chaebol have also been moving money abroad with the tacit endorsement of the South Korean government and investing in commercial enterprises, particularly in [[Koreatown, Manhattan|Koreatown]] [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=ChaebolsKoreatownManhattan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ny.eater.com/2018/7/31/17633796/k-town-nyc-restaurants-chains-report|title=NYC’s K-Town Isn’t What It Used to Be|author=Sam Kim, photography by Gary He|publisher=Vox Media|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=November 21, 2018|quote=Most mom-and-pops are gone, and 32nd Street is now dominated by chains due to high rents and policies in Korea itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, the chaebol maintain dominance across all industries. Reductions in tariffs and removal of trade regulations designed to protect Korean conglomerates has led to increasing competition from abroad. However, among domestic firms the chaebol have kept their market share intact. Most notably, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s entry into the smartphone market pressured rival Samsung into diversifying its revenue streams from overseas. All but 3 of the top 50 firms listed on the [[Korea Exchange|Korean Stock Exchange]] are designated as chaebol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consequently, the chaebol have more bargaining power and oftentimes takes pricing action that squeezes both suppliers and consumers. Typically the firms down the supply chain fail to increase their profit margins enough to expand and thus never see growth. Collusion among the chaebol is commonplace. [[Price fixing|Price-fixing]] acts mean consumers expect to pay an inflated value for most goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, in 2012 [[Samsung]] and [[LG Electronics]] were fined for colluding to raise prices for home appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/lcd-makers-fined-388-million-for-alleged-price-fixing/|title=LCD makers fined $388 million for alleged price fixing|newspaper=CNET|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government ties, corruption and abuse of power ===
Since the inception of the chaebol, the government has been closely involved in its affairs. Many of the reforms enacted over the years, especially those under President [[Kim Dae-jung|Kim Dae-Jung]], have cracked down on kickbacks and preferential treatment. Moreover, the state is no longer a majority shareholder of any chaebol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But their sheer size and wealth has been used to gain influence. For the most part, the government sees the function of the chaebol as crucial to the Korean economy. When President [[Lee Myung-bak|Lee Myung-Bak]] took office, he pardoned [[Samsung|Samsung Group]] chairman [[Lee Kun-hee|Lee Kun-Hee]] for tax evasion. President Lee then proceeded to champion pro-chaebol deals, including a nuclear energy contract with the city of [[Abu Dhabi]], and loosened laws preventing the conglomerates from owning financial services companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15816702|title=Return of the overlord|date=2010-03-31|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung's leader is not the only chaebol chairman to be excused from a crime conviction. [[Chey Tae-won|Choi Tae-Won]] of [[SK Group]], [[Chung Mong-koo|Chung Mong-Koo]] of [[Hyundai]], Kim Seung-Youn of Hanwha, and [[Shin Dong-bin|Shin Dong-Bin]] of [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/business/international/south-korea-lotte-chaebol-conglomerate-indicted.html|title=Family Behind Korean Conglomerate Lotte Is Indicted in Corruption Case|last=Sang-hun|first=Choe|date=2016-10-19|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a few examples of chairmen who have been charged, convicted, or are currently serving a prison sentence for white collar crime. Accusations include, bribery, tax evasion, accounting fraud, embezzlement, and violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-07-07/chaebol-behaving-badly-aren-t-korea-s-biggest-worry|title=Don't Fret Over the Chaebol|last=Fickling|first=David|date=2016-07-07|newspaper=Bloomberg Gadfly|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically chairmen of the chaebol are pardoned. August 15 is recognized in South Korea as [[National Liberation Day of Korea|Liberation Day]]. This is when the president forgives the chairmen for their infractions in order to ensure they remain in power of their companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/09/anger-and-envy-in-the-chaebol-republic-korea-nut-rage-samsung/|title=Anger and Envy in the Chaebol Republic|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rare case that an executive is sentenced to prison, as the CEOs of SK and CJ group were, it is typically a relatively light punishment of up to 4 years depending on the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21648178-dark-side-family-capitalism-those-have|title=To those that have|date=2015-04-18|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collusion between members of the chaebol and the government granted preferential statuses to the companies. The chaebol would funnel bribes to politicians and bureaucrats through slush funds and illegal donations. This could help maintain the government's position of power, allowing them to secure contracts for major government projects and provide favorable treatment to the donor firm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Phil-Sang|year=2000|title=Economic Crisis and Chaebol Reform in Korea|url=|journal=APEC Study Center|volume=Discussion Paper Series, [[Columbia Business School]]|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this type of corruption were widespread in the years leading up to the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997 financial crisis]]. Many of the firms who benefited from this relationship were too indebted, had poor corporate governance, and were inefficient. There was a huge inflow of capital and bending of regulation in favor of these problematic firms. Hanbo Group, formerly South Korea's second largest [[steelmaking|steel-maker]], is a good example of this. In the 1990s the company paid for special arrangements with high-ranking politicians so that it could secure contracts for large government projects over its competitors. Hanbo went bankrupt in the 1997 after defaulting on debt payments along with other governance issues. Numerous chaebol companies had similar private agreements with the government in this fashion. It would be most common in companies dealing with heavy industries or projects that involved government procurement and urban planning. In the past, most successful political elections were won with the support of the chaebol. Each time a new administration or regime stepped in, it would gear its policy platform towards chaebol revitalization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was under the claim that in order to be a competitive economy more power must be given to the chaebol. In recent years, the leading political parties of South Korea have reversed their pro-large corporate stance to one of economic diversification.

==Reforms==

=== IMF Agreement ===
Under [[Kim Dae-jung|Kim Dae-Jung]] and in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997 Asian Financial crisis]], many reforms were made to the chaebol. Most of these changes pertained to corporate structure, transparency in financial reporting, corporate governance, and debt stabilization. In 1997, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] provided a bailout loan of $60 billion conditional on revision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Distressed financial institutions were to be closed down and those that were deemed viable were to be restructured and recapitalized by the levels it set forth. This affected the chaebol because it severely restricted its easy access to financing that led to over leveraged balance sheets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Chekan_YB2010.pdf|title=Korea and the Great Recession: The Effects of Chaebol Reform on South Korea’s Recovery from the 2008 Financial Crisis|last=Chekan|first=Kate|date=|website=|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210233654/http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Chekan_YB2010.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenient accounting practices and disclosure rules were to be strengthened and standardized for international practice. Hence, transparency was increased to what would be expected from a public company. The chaebol agreed to be subject to independent auditors and were obligated to provide consolidated financial statements on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Government-led Reforms and 2008 Crisis ===
Kim Dae-Jung enacted what is known as the "Five Principles of Corporate Governance".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These were the enhancement of management transparency, strengthening owner-manager accountability, elimination of cross-debt guarantees among chaebol affiliates, improvement of capital structures, and consolidation of core business areas. In his plans, debt to equity ratios were to be below 200%. Subsidiaries of chaebol that were debt-laden or on the verge of bankruptcy were instructed to be either liquidated, sold, or put up for merger. Each chaebol-holding group had to break up its subsidiaries and operations so that they were more manageable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the end of 1997, each had an average of 26.8 subsidiaries. It was hoped that if there were fewer activities, the quality of the remaining businesses would see improvement. Many unrelated branches to their core competencies were swiftly shed. If any of the conglomerates failed to meet the conditions by the set deadlines, strict sanctions would be passed against them. During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 Financial crisis]], many of these reforms ensured the quick recovery of the chaebol.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Having had exposure to a massive recession before, the companies learned to cope better than those in foreign countries. With significantly healthier balance sheets and higher cash reserves, the chaebol were able to avoid any liquidity issues. Moreover, with fewer subsidiaries they were less exposed to the full scope of the crisis and thus helped keep the Korean economy afloat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

President [[Roh Moo-hyun|Roh Moo Hyun]] pushed for even more extensive reform.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His administration passed stringent regulations on fraudulent accounting, stock manipulation, and irregular wealth succession. The chaebol were forced to improve objectivity on their board of directors. Rather than having the decision-makers be insiders, affiliates, or family members, the chaebol were expected to hold representation who reflected the interests of investors, especially minority shareholders who gained a significant number of rights. As a result, it became easier for the chaebol to raise capital through equity rather than riskier debt. This is because the new transparency laws and restructuring boosted investor confidence from abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Regulation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Laws were passed to limit the expansion of chaebol:
* Law for separate finance from industry ([[:ko:금산분리법]];金産分離法 : Chaebol may no longer have banks since 1982
* Law for limit of investment (출자총액제한;出資總額制限 : A chaebol's growth by M&amp;A) was limited until 2009
* Law for limit of assurance (상호출자채무보증제한;相互出資債務保證制限 : A law defends the insolvency of a chaebol's affiliates

'''Colorado for Family Values''' is a [[Social conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] [[advocacy group]] in [[Colorado]], United States.&lt;ref name="gluckman"&gt;Amy Gluckman, Betsy Reed, ''Homo economics: capitalism, community, and lesbian and gay life'', Routledge, 1997 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6cfGMIaAm-QC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=%22Colorado+for+Family+Values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=28OsTtqwK4_ItAbU89QD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Colorado%20for%20Family%20Values%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
It was co-founded by Tony Marco, Kevin Tebedo and David Noebel in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="gluckman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herma"&gt;Didi Herma, ''The Antigay Agenda: Orthodox Vision and the Christian Right'', University of Chicago Press, 1998, p. 222 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xw7332sc5zoC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=%22Colorado+for+Family+Values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=28OsTtqwK4_ItAbU89QD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Colorado%20for%20Family%20Values%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Will Perkins, a former car dealer from [[Colorado Springs]], is the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name="herma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig A.

However, it was truly coincidental timing as Focus on the Family had nothing to do with the founding of Colorado for Family Values.  Dobson's [[Focus on the Family]] is independent from CFV.&lt;ref&gt;Chip Berlet (ed.), ''Eyes right!: challenging the right wing backlash'', South End Press, 1995, p. 93 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl6Ix9HFKQEC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22Colorado+for+Family+Values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=28OsTtqwK4_ItAbU89QD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Colorado%20for%20Family%20Values%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martha Craven Nussbaum, ''From disgust to humanity: sexual orientation and constitutional law'', Oxford University Press, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Oq3katPB40C&amp;pg=PT124&amp;dq=%22Colorado+for+Family+Values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=28OsTtqwK4_ItAbU89QD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Colorado%20for%20Family%20Values%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to [[Traditional Values]], [[Summit Ministries]], [[Concerned Women for America]], and the [[Eagle Forum]].&lt;ref name="gluckman"/&gt; [[Bill McCartney]], the founder of [[Promise Keepers]], is a supporter.&lt;ref name="balmer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J.

Colorado for Family Values (CFV) was created specifically for the purpose of countering an objective of the Colorado Human Relations Commission, to introduce legislation that would effectively add the behavior of homosexuality to the list of protected class status, thus creating the legal process of strict scruntiny for claims of discrimination made by homosexual individuals.  It drafted and promoted Amendment 2 in 1992, which led to the United States Supreme Court case ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel A.

'''Consideration and Initiating Structure''' are two dimensions of [[leader]] behavior identified in 1945 as a result of the Ohio State Leadership Studies. Reviews of research on these dimensions are in Ralph M. Stogdill (1974): ''Handbook of leadership: A survey of theory and research''.
[[New York City|New York]], NY, US: Free Press; and Littrell, R.F. (2013).

According to the findings of these studies, leaders exhibit two types of [[behaviors]] to facilitate [[goal]] accomplishment:
* People-oriented (consideration) 
* [[Task (project management)|Task]] oriented (initiating structure)

The model is similar to the [[Michigan Studies of Leadership]].

In his Handbook, Stogdill expanded the model to twelve [[dimensions]].

== Ohio State Leadership Studies ==
Prior to 1945 most studies of [[leadership]] sought to identify the individual [[trait theory|traits]] of effective leaders.

[[Trait theory|Trait theories]] of leadership were the first to attempt a systematic approach of studying [[leadership]].  However, these studies yielded disappointing results when no set of traits were found that explained effective leadership.

In 1945, a group of researchers at the [[Ohio State University]] sought to identify the observable [[behaviors]] of leaders instead of identifying [[personality traits]].
=== Leaders Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) ===
To accomplish this they generated a list of 1790 statements.  This was narrowed down to 150 statements designed to measure nine different dimensions of leader behavior.  These statements were used to develop the Leaders Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ).&lt;ref name="cyfar.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Originated by staff members of The Ohio State Leadership Studies And revised by Bureau of Business Research|title=LEADER BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION QUESTIONNAIRE – Form XII Self|url=https://cyfar.org/sites/default/files/LBDQ_1962_Self_Assessment.pdf|website=cyfar.org|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After further research, the LBDQ-XII, was developed, assessing 12 factors/dimensions of leader behavior. See Stogdill (1963).&lt;ref name="Ralph M. Stogdill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralph M. Stogdill|title=LEADER BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION QUESTIONNAIRE|date=1963|publisher=Fisher College of Business, The Ohio State University|url=https://fisher.osu.edu/supplements/10/2862/1962%20LBDQ%20MANUAL.pdf|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consideration and Initiating structure ==
=== Consideration ===
[[Consideration of future consequences|Consideration]] is the extent to which a leader exhibits concern for the welfare of the members of the [[Social group|group]].

This factor is oriented towards [[interpersonal relationships]], mutual [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] and [[friendship]]. 
 
This [[leadership style]] is people-oriented. 

Some of the statements used to measure this factor in the LBDQ are:
*being friendly
*treating all group members as his/her equal
*looking out for the personal [[welfare]] of group members
*making him/herself accessible to group members

=== Initiating structure ===
Initiating Structure is the extent to which a leader defines leader and group member roles, initiates actions, organizes group activities and defines how tasks are to be accomplished by the group.

This leadership style is task-oriented.

Some of the statements used to measure this factor in the LBDQ are:
*letting group members know what is expected of them
*maintaining definite [[Job performance|standards of performance]]
*scheduling the work to be done
*checking that group members follow standard [[Business rule|rule]]s and [[regulations]]

'''Contraction and Convergence''' (C&amp;C) is a proposed global framework for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to combat [[climate change]]. Conceived by the [[Global Commons Institute]] [GCI] in the early 1990s, the Contraction and Convergence strategy consists of reducing overall emissions of greenhouse gases to a safe level (contraction), resulting from every country bringing its emissions [[per capita]] to a level which is equal for all countries (convergence). It is intended to form the basis of an international agreement which will reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid dangerous climate change]], carbon dioxide being the gas that is primarily responsible for changes in the [[greenhouse effect]] on Earth. It is expressed as a simple mathematical formula. This formula can be used as a way for the world to stabilize carbon levels at any level. Advocates of Contraction and Convergence stress that negotiations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] are governed sequentially by the 'objective' of the UNFCCC [safe and stable GHG concentration in the global atmosphere] followed by its organising principles ['precaution' and 'equity']. C&amp;C is widely cited and supported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gci.org.uk/SDa.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The C&amp;C calculus is now embedded in Domain Two of GCI's Carbon Budget Accounting Tool &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gci.org.uk/CBAT_AUBREY/CBAT/index.html#domain-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==The C&amp;C Proposal==
The "convergence" part structures how the entitlements to emit carbon are shared between the countries or regions of the world. Initially entitlements would reflect current emissions, however subject to a negotiation of 'the rate of convergence' these initial entitlements will converge towards equal per capita entitlements across the planet. An early date of convergence will mean that countries with currently low per capita emissions (which as a rule are poorer countries) will see their entitlements rise while a late date for full convergence would risk curtailing poorer countries' chances of development.

Once convergence is reached then all countries entitlements would continue to fall, subject to the contraction-event required to be UNFCCC-compliant.

Some argue that the per capita focus risks giving an incentive to countries to increase their population to "earn" more entitlements. To answer this, the GCI put a 'population base-year' function in the model for users to choose and specify any date between 2000 and 2050 beyond which no further entitlements would result from population growth.

==Acceptable concentration levels==
Both the basic concept of Contraction and Convergence and the specific formulas that the [[Global Commons Institute]] advocate can be adapted to both very moderate restrictions on carbon emissions through to much more drastic measures depending on what final level of greenhouse gases concentration is deemed to carry an acceptable level of risk. However, supporters of Contraction and Convergence believe that a safe level at which concentrations of greenhouse gases should stabilize is much lower than many suggest. Specifically they believe that suggestions that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide of 550 parts per million by volume (ppmv) would be safe are wrong. This they consider runs the risk of entering a phase of runaway "climate feedback", where one change sparks off another with unpredictable results. They advocate erring on the side of caution, with atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide being stabilized at 350-450 ppmv. GCI's numerical analysis of the unrealistically optimistic 'sink-assumptions' behind the UK Climate Act is here &lt;ref name="gci.org.uk"&gt;http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/OrigStatement2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of GCI's intervention dates from 1989 and resulted in a statement published in 1990 in the Guardian June 18, 1991 &lt;ref name="gci.org.uk"/&gt;

The formal calculating model 'Contraction and Convergence' [C&amp;C] was developed over a period of three years in response to the objective and principles of the [[UNFCCC]]. Between 1992 and 1995, at the request of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], GCI undertook and presented an analysis on the growing trends of expansion and divergence, which revealed the increasing asymmetry in global development between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries — ultimately observing that it was developing countries that would be worst affected by climate change. C&amp;C was developed by GCI to counteract the adverse effects of these trends.

==Application==
The application of the framework begins with a full-term contraction [[budget]] for global emissions consistent with stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a pre-agreed concentration deemed to be safe. In order to help negotiators at the UNFCCC negotiations internationally share this emissions contraction-budget in a way that is less arbitrary and chaotic than it was under 'Kyoto', the C&amp;C model will calculate any rate of linear convergence of all Parties to the global per capita average arising under the chosen contraction rate. This can be on year anywhere between immediate and 'end-of-term' with or without a population base-year as desired. As Prof Ross Garnaut has observed in his 'Review' for the Australian Government, "this rate-of-convergence is the main equity lever" in the negotiations. Practically it means that the sooner the convergence occurs, the faster the gap between under-consumers and over consumers is closed but within the agreed contraction budget.  Quickly following the launch of the Garnaut Review, collaborating researchers at Monash University published the first empirical C&amp;C target based on human life expectancies across nations. The paper called for early adoption of C&amp;C to soften any impact on younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;Read, P, Stanley, J, Vella-Brodrick, D &amp; Griggs, D (2013) Towards a contraction and convergence target based on population life expectancies since 1960. Environment, Development &amp; Sustainability. October (2013) Vol 15(5) pp 1173-1187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
In 2009 the Hadley Centre [UKMO] agreed that the rates of C&amp;C projected by GCI to keep within 2 degrees Celsius were better than those projected by the UK Government in its 'Climate Act'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Memo from GCI to the UK House of Commons ‘Environmental Audit Committee’|url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/GCI_EAC.pdf|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a further memo to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee presented a detailed critique of why the rates of C&amp;C in the UK 'Climate Act' needed revision (acceleration) and provided a heuristic device (CBAT) to assist the understanding of this and how the revision might be organised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Further Memo from GCI to the UK House of Commons ‘Environmental Audit Committee’|url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/EAC_Real_.pdf|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==C&amp;C, COP-15 and COP-21==
The C&amp;C aspect of the negotiations at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP-15) in Copenhagen in 2009 provoked controversy.&lt;ref name=COP-15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/comment/2255920/copenhagen-blame-game-sparked |title=Copenhagen blame game sparked by failure to properly explain Danish Text |publisher=BusinessGreen |date=11 Jan 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these animations of C&amp;C as 'Climate Justice without Vengeance' show transparently the financial implications of negotiating an 'accelerated convergence' which issue remains directly relevant to achieving the 'global climate deal' still sought for at COP-16 and beyond.

The contraction aspect of C&amp;C was demonstrated by the UK Government Special Representative for Climate Change [[Sir David King]] at a debriefing to the IEA on COP-21 in January 2016. This compared the contraction-rates needed for 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C &amp; 2&amp;nbsp;°C, with the INDCs on offer in the 'Paris Agreement' at 'COP-21'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation to IEA on COP-21 by Sir David King|url=http://www.gci.org.uk/images/INDCs_COP_21_a.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Shays''' ({{circa|lk=no|1747}}{{spaced ndash}}September 29, 1825) was an American soldier, revolutionary, and farmer famous for being one of the leaders of [[Shays' Rebellion]], a populist uprising against controversial debt collection and tax policies in [[Massachusetts]] in 1786 and 1787.

==Early life==
[[File:Daniel and Abigail Shays' Pelham, MA farmhouse.jpg|thumb|Daniel and Abigail Shays' Pelham, MA farmhouse, {{circa|lk=no|1898}}]]
Daniel Shays was born in 1747 in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]], the son of Irish immigrants Patrick and Margaret (Dempsey) Shays. Daniel was the second of six; his siblings were Margaret, James, Roger, Phebe, and Mary Polly.&lt;ref&gt;The Family of Daniel Shays, from Descendants of Daniel Shays, by Elmer S. Smail, November, 1934: http://www.worldcat.org/title/family-of-daniel-shays-from-descendants-of-daniel-shays-by-elmer-s-smail-november-1934/oclc/17982816&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his early years as a landless farm laborer. In 1772, he married Abigail Gilbert, and they settled in [[Brookfield, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name="Brown-2010-p220"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, Lorri|chapter=Shays, Daniel (1747–1825)|editor=Danver Steven L.|title=Revolts, protests, demonstrations, and rebellions in American history: an encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59884-221-0|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1C4W2IVHcMC&amp;pg=PA220}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they had 6 children.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts Births and Christenings, 1639-1915," database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FC3N-TJR : 4 December 2014), Daniel Shayes in entry for Daniel Shayes, 31 Jan 1773; citing, Shutesbury, Franklin, Massachusetts, 2:179B4K1; FHL microfilm 886,455&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary War==
Shays joined the local militia during the American Revolution and rose to the rank of captain in the [[5th Massachusetts Regiment]] of the Continental Army by 1777.&lt;ref name="Brown-2010-p220" /&gt; He was involved in the [[Boston campaign]] and fought at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, pf u. 95&lt;/ref&gt; He also fought in the [[Battle of Lexington]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]]. He was wounded during the war and resigned from the military unpaid in 1780. Upon returning home, he was summoned to court for unpaid debts, which he could not pay because he had not been paid in full for his military service.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/massachusettssol14mass#page/76/mode/2up Massachusetts Solder and Sailors in the war of the Revolution Vol XIV p.76 summary of Shays service record]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, [[General Lafayette]] presented him with an ornamental sword in honor of his military service. He later sold it for a few dollars to help pay off his debts, which was frowned upon by his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gross, Robert A.|chapter=The Uninvited Guest: Daniel Shays and the Constitution|editor=Gross, Robert A.|title=In Debt to Shays: The Bicentennial of an Agrarian Rebellion|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8139-1354-4|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpSIYclyYogC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Shays' Rebellion}}

===Debt and tax burdens===
After returning from the war, Daniel Shays was alarmed to discover that many of his fellow veterans and farmers were in the same financial situation as he. At commoners' meetings veterans asserted that they were treated unfairly upon release, and that businessmen were trying to squeeze money out of smallholders in order to pay their own debts to European war investors. Many Massachusetts rural communities first tried to petition the legislature in Boston,&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; but the legislature was dominated by eastern merchant interests and did not respond substantively to those petitions.  The petitions and proposals often included a request to issue paper currency.  Such inflationary issues would depreciate the currency, making it possible to meet obligations made at high values with lower-valued paper.  The merchants, among them [[James Bowdoin]], were opposed to these proposals because they were generally lenders who stood to lose.  These proposals were repeatedly rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, pp. 38–42, 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor [[John Hancock]], accused by some of anticipating trouble, abruptly resigned in early 1785.  When Bowdoin (a loser to Hancock in earlier elections) was elected governor that year, matters became more severe.  Bowdoin stepped up civil actions to collect back taxes, and the legislature exacerbated the situation by levying an additional property tax to raise funds for the state's portion of foreign debt payments.&lt;ref name=Richards87_8&gt;Richards, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;  Even comparatively conservative commentators like [[John Adams]] observed that these levies were "heavier than the People could bear".&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests against the courts===
Protests in the rural Massachusetts turned into [[direct action]] in August 1786, after the state legislature adjourned without considering the many petitions that had been sent to Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, pp. 6–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 29 a well-organized force of protestors, Shays among them, marched on [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] and successfully prevented the county court from sitting.&lt;ref name=Morse208&gt;Morse, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaders of this and later forces proclaimed that they were seeking relief from the burdensome judicial processes that were depriving the people of their land and possessions.  They called themselves ''Regulators'', a reference to the [[Regulator movement]] of [[North Carolina]] that sought to reform corrupt practices in the late 1760s.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 2 Governor Bowdoin issued a proclamation denouncing such mob action, but took no military measures in response beyond planning militia response to future actions.&lt;ref name=Morse208/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;   When the court in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] was shut down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin's amazement.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Shays, who had participated in the Northampton action, began to take a more active leadership role in the uprising in November.  On September 19, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] indicted eleven leaders of the rebellion as "disorderly, riotous, and seditious persons."&lt;ref name="zinn93"&gt;Zinn, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  When the supreme judicial court was next scheduled to meet in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] on September 26, Shays in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] and [[Luke Day]] in what is now [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]] (but was then part of Hampshire County) organized an attempt to shut it down.  They were anticipated by [[William Shepard]], the local militia commander, who began gathering government-supporting militia the Saturday before the court was to sit.  By the time the court was ready to open, Shepard had 300 men protecting the Springfield courthouse.  Shays and Day were able to recruit a similar number, but chose only to demonstrate, exercising their troops outside Shepard's lines, rather than attempt to seize the building.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 245–47&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges first postponed the hearings, and then adjourned on the 28th without hearing any cases.  Shepard withdrew his force, which had grown to some 800 men (to the Regulators' 1,200), to the [[Springfield Armory|federal armory]], which was then only rumored to be the target of seizure by the activists.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan to seize the Springfield Armory===
On November 28 a posse of some 300 men rode to [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] to arrest [[Job Shattuck]] and other protest leaders in the area.  Shattuck was chased down and arrested on the 30th, and was wounded by a sword slash in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;  This action and the arrest of other protest leaders in the eastern parts of the state radicalized those in the west, and they began to organize an overthrow of the state government.  "The seeds of war are now sown", wrote one correspondent in [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; and by mid-January rebel leaders spoke of smashing the "tyrannical government of Massachusetts."&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

While government forces organized in the east, Shays, Day, and other rebel leaders in the west organized their forces, establishing regional regimental organizations that were run by democratically elected committees.  Their first major target was the federal armory in Springfield.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;  General Shepard had, however, pursuant to orders from Governor Bowdoin, taken possession of the armory and used its arsenal to arm a force of some 1,200 militia.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack and collapse===
The insurgents were organized into three major groups, and intended to surround and simultaneously attack the armory.  Shays led one group east of Springfield near [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]], Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], and the third force, under [[Eli Parsons]], was to the north at [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  The rebels had planned their assault for January 25, but Luke Day changed this at the last minute, sending Shays a message indicating he would not be ready to attack until the 26th.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Day's message was intercepted by Shepard's men, so the militia of Shays and Parsons, some 1,500 men, approached the armory on the 25th not knowing they would have no support from the west.&lt;ref name="Richards29"&gt;Richards, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Springfield Armory.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Springfield Armory]] (building pictured is from the 19th century) was the first major target of the rebellion.]]
When Shays and his forces neared the armory, they found Shepard's militia waiting for them. Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the approaching Shaysites' heads, and then ordered two cannons to fire [[grape shot]] at Shays's men.  Four Shaysites were killed and twenty wounded.  There was no musket fire from either side, and the rebel advance collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the rebel force fled north, eventually regrouping at [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]].  On the opposite side of the river, Day's forces also fled north, also eventually reaching Amherst.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] had mustered 3,000 men at [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] to deal with the rebels.  When he heard of the Springfield incident, they immediately began marching west.  Shays led the rebel force generally north and east to avoid Lincoln, eventually establishing a camp at [[Petersham, Massachusetts|Petersham]]; along the way they raided the shops of local merchants for supplies, taking some of them hostage.  Lincoln pursued them, reaching [[Pelham, Massachusetts|Pelham]], some {{convert|10|mi|km}} from Petersham, on February 2.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, pp. 103–04&lt;/ref&gt;  On the night of February 3–4, he led his militia on a forced march to Petersham through a bitter snowstorm.  Arriving early in the morning, they surprised the rebel camp so thoroughly that they scattered "without time to call in their out parties or even their guards."&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Lincoln claimed to capture 150 men, none of them were officers, leading historian Leonard Richards to suspect the veracity of the report.  Shays and some of the other leaders escaped north into New Hampshire and Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, pp. 31, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Some four thousand people signed confessions acknowledging participation in the events of the rebellion (in exchange for amnesty); several hundred participants were eventually indicted on charges relating to the rebellion.  Most of these were pardoned under a general amnesty that only excluded a few ringleaders.  Eighteen men, including Shays, were convicted and sentenced to death.  Most of these were either overturned on appeal, pardoned, or had their sentences commuted.  Two of the condemned men, John Bly and Charles Rose, were hanged on December 6, 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; Shays was pardoned in 1788 and he returned to Massachusetts from hiding in the Vermont woods.&lt;ref name="zinn95"&gt;Zinn, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  He was, however, vilified by the Boston press, who painted him as an archetypal anarchist opposed to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Shays was later granted a pension by the federal government for the five years he served in the [[Continental Army]] without pay. Shays lived the last few years of his life in poverty, a heavy drinker. He supported himself on his pension and by working a small parcel of land.&lt;ref name="Gross-1993-p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gross, Robert A.|chapter=The Uninvited Guest: Daniel Shays and the Constitution|editor=Gross, Robert A.|title=In Debt to Shays: The Bicentennial of an Agrarian Rebellion|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8139-1354-4|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpSIYclyYogC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shays died at age 78 in [[Sparta, New York]], and was buried at the Union Cemetery in [[Scottsburg, New York|Scottsburg]].&lt;ref name="Gross-1993-p2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyhistoric.com/2011/10/captain-daniel-shays/ |title=Captain Daniel Shays |website=nyhistoric.com/ |publisher=New York Historic |access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rededicated grave marker==
The original gravestone for Shays contained an error; by dropping the "s", Shays was incorrectly spelled as "Shay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beagle |first=Ben |date=August 7, 2016 |title=Gravestone Rededication: Heroic rebel, formative figure in U.S. history, to gets his ‘S’ |url=http://www.thelcn.com/lcn01/gravestone-rededication-heroic-rebel-formative-figure-in-us-history-to-gets-his-s-20160807 |newspaper=Livingston County News |location=Geneseo, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, Philip R. Shays, of [[Clarence Center, New York]], a descendant of Daniel Shays, led an effort to correct the error.  Because the original stone did not contain enough space to add a letter, a new marker was created.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thelcn.com/lcn01/gravestone-rededication-heroic-rebel-formative-figure-in-us-history-to-gets-his-s-20160807 Gravestone Rededication: Heroic rebel, formative figure in U.S. history, to gets his ‘S’]"&lt;/ref&gt;  The new gravestone was dedicated in a ceremony on August 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 12, 2016 |title=Revolutionary War hero gets new headstone – with his name spelled correctly |url=http://13wham.com/news/local/revolutionary-war-hero-gets-new-headstone-with-his-name-spelled-correctly |newspaper=WHAM-TV |location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dead end''' is a street with only one inlet/outlet. A dead end is also known as a '''cul-de-sac''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|d|ə|s|æ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊ|l|d|ə|s|æ|k}}&lt;ref name=ahd/&gt;, from French for cul ["bottom"] + de ["of"] + sac ["bag, sack"]) or '''no exit road''' in certain contexts and dialects. In Australia they are usually referred to as a '''court''' when they have a bulbous end.

The term "dead end" is understood in all varieties of English, but the official terminology and traffic signs include many different alternatives. Some of these are used only regionally. In the United States and other countries, ''cul-de-sac'' is often not an exact synonym for ''dead end'' and refers to dead ends with a circular end, allowing for easy turning at the end of the road. The actual term people mean to use for a “cul-de-sac” is cove.   &lt;ref name=ahd&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=cul-de-sac|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: cul-de-sac|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dead ends are created in [[urban planning]] to limit through-traffic in residential areas. While some dead ends provide no possible passage except in and out of their road entry, others allow [[cyclist]]s, [[pedestrian]]s or other non-automotive traffic to pass through connecting easements or paths, an example of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|filtered permeability]]. The [[International Federation of Pedestrians]] proposed to call such streets "living end streets"&lt;ref&gt;http://pedestrians-int.org/en/about-us/project/68-living-end-roads-2 living end streets&lt;/ref&gt;  and to provide signage at the entry of the streets that make this permeability for pedestrians and cyclists clear. Its application retains the dead end's primary function as a non-through road, but establishes complete pedestrian and bicycle network connectivity.

==History==
The earliest examples of dead ends were unearthed in the [[El-Lahun]] workers' village in [[Egypt]], which was built circa 1885 BC. The village is laid out with straight streets that intersect at right angles; akin to a grid, but irregular. The western part of the excavated village, where the workers lived, shows fifteen narrow and short dead-ends laid out perpendicularly on either side of a wider, straight street; all terminate at the enclosing walls.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Dead-end streets also appeared during the classical period of Athens and Rome. The 15th century architect and planner [[Leon Battista Alberti]] implies in his writings &lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Battista Alberti]], ''Ten Books on Architecture, 1485'', ed. [[Joseph Rykwert]] (New York: Transatlantic Arts, 1966) Book IV, Ch. V. 75&lt;/ref&gt; that dead-end streets may have been used intentionally in antiquity for defense purposes. He writes: "The Ancients in All Towns were for having some intricate Ways and turn again Streets [i.e.dead-ends or loops], without any Passage through them, that if an Enemy comes into them, he may be at a Loss, and be in Confusion and Suspense; or if he pushes on daringly, may be easily destroyed". The same opinion is expressed by an earlier thinker, [[Aristotle]], when he criticized the Hippodamian grid.  He   writes:  "... but for security in war [the arrangement is more useful if it is planned in] the opposite [manner], as it used to be in ancient times. For that [arrangement] is difficult for foreign troops to enter and find their way about when attacking."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''The Politics'', 335–323, trans. T. A. Sinclair(New York: Penguin, 1962) Book VII, section xi. 422&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, their prior existence is implied by an [[Public Health Act 1875|1875 law]] which banned their use in new developments.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Inferential evidence of their earlier use can also be drawn from the text of a [[Germany|German]] architect, Rudolf Eberstadt, that explains their purpose and utility: &lt;blockquote&gt;We have, in our medieval towns, showing very commendable methods of cutting up the land. I ought to mention here that to keep traffic out of residential streets is necessary not only in the general interest of the population, but, above all, for the sake of the children, whose health (amongst the [[working class]]es) is mainly dependent on the opportunity of moving about in close connection with their dwelling places, without the danger of being run over. In the earlier periods, traffic was excluded from residential streets simply by gates or by employing the cul-de-sac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rudolf |last=Eberstadt |title=The Problems of Town Development |journal=Contemporary Review |volume=96 |date=December 1909 |pages=660–667 |url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/eberstad.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110141027/http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/eberstad.htm |archivedate=2011-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was in the UK that the cul-de-sac street type was first legislated into use, with The [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] Act 1906. The proponents of the Act, [[Raymond Unwin]] and Barry Parker, thus gained permission to introduce culs-de-sac in their subsequent site plans, and they promoted it as a suitable street type for Garden Suburbs. Unwin's applications of the cul-de-sac and the related crescent always included pedestrian paths independent of the road network. This design feature reflects the predominance of pedestrian movement for local trips at the turn of the 20th century, and presages the current planning priority for increased pedestrian accessibility. The 1906 Act defined the nature of the cul-de-sac as a non-through road and restricted its length to {{convert|500|ft|m}}. [[Garden city movement|Garden cities]] in the UK that followed Hampstead, such as [[Welwyn Garden City]] all included culs-de-sac (see photo).

In the 1920s, the garden city movement gained ground in the US and, with it, came its design elements, such as the cul-de-sac. [[Clarence Stein]], a main proponent of the movement, incorporated it in the [[Radburn, NJ]], subdivision, which was to become a model for subsequent neighbourhood developments. The US Federal Housing Authority recommended and promoted their use through their 1936 guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=FHA |title=Planning Neighbourhoods for Small Houses |series=Technical Bulletin |volume=5 |location=Washington DC |date=July 1, 1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the power of lending development funds.

In [[Canada]], a variation of Stein’s Radburn 1929 plan that used crescents (loops) instead of culs-de-sac was built in 1947 in Manitoba, [[Wildwood Park, Winnipeg]], designed by Hubert Bird. In 1954, the [[Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] published its own guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of small house grouping |location=Ottawa |publisher=Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation |year=1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the cul-de-sac was strongly recommended for local streets and, as the FHA in the US, used its lending power to see its inclusion in development plans. The Varsity Village and Braeside, subdivisions in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] also used the [[Radburn model]] in the late 1960s.

In the 1960s the cul-de-sac attained systematic international application in planned new cities such as Doxiadis’ [[Islamabad]] (1960). In the UK new towns such as [[Harlow]] (1947) by Sir Frederick Gibberd and [[Milton Keynes]] (1967) incorporated culs-de-sac and crescents in their layouts
Planning theorists have suggested the use alternatives to culs-de-sac most notably, Christopher Alexander et al., in his “[[A Pattern Language]]” 1977 book (pattern #49) suggests the use of looped local roads which do not abruptly stop. Although dead end streets, i.e. culs-de-sac, would fit his definition of looped local roads Alexander suggestions that "culs-de-sacs are very bad from a social standpoint–they force interaction and they feel claustrophobic, because there is only one entrance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Alexander |title=A Pattern Language |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1977 |page = 262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doxiadis has additionally argued their important role in separating man from machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K.

===Originally unplanned dead ends===
[[File:PF Sackgasse.jpg|thumb|Two dead ends created by closing a minor road in the center to block through traffic]]
Originally unplanned dead ends have been created in the centers of cities that are laid on a grid by blocking through traffic. Whole neighbourhood street reconfigurations emerged in several cities, mainly concentrated in North America and the UK, which include [[Berkeley, California]], [[Seattle, Washington]] and [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].  This transformation of [[grid plan]]s since the 1970s responds to the following needs:
* To limit access to an existing road newly designated as a major artery, enabling traffic to move smoothly on it
* To alleviate residents' concerns
This selective, sporadic transformation is continuing. As traffic volumes increase and as cities decide to remove or reduce traffic on specific streets of central areas, streets are closed off using bollards or landscaping thus creating new, originally unplanned dead ends and producing a new, functional blend of the inherited grid with newer street types. A recent variation of limiting traffic is the managed closure by using retractable bollards which are activated by designated card holders only. However, not only do they stop cars, they also stop ambulances and other emergency vehicles and often lack adequate turning.

==Suburban use and benefits==

Since the end of [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5455743 |work=NPR |title=Culs-de-Sac: Suburban Dream or Dead End? }}&lt;/ref&gt; new [[subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] in the United States and Canada, as well as [[New Towns]] in England and other  countries  have made extensive use of the cul-de-sac and crescent (loops) street types. Typically, there is one or several central roads in the subdivision with many cul-de-sac streets of varying length, branching out from the main roads, to fill the land in the subdivision; a dendrite or [[Hierarchy of roads|hierarchical]] pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Marshal |year=2005 |title=Streets and Patterns |location= |publisher=Spon Press |isbn=0-415-31750-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, this pattern has been the dominant road network structure of suburbs and exurbs in the United States, Canada, and Australia. It is also increasingly popular in [[Latin America]], [[Western Europe]], and [[China]]. In this pattern, there are only a few roads (relative to the number of cul-de-sac streets) leading out of the subdivision and into other subdivisions or onto major roads.

In the US, these changes can be attributed to real-estate developers' desire to meet [[Federal Housing Administration|FHA]] guidelines and make federal home loans available to their consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/01workshop/sub_landsc.htm |work=NRHP Workshop @ NCSHPO Annual Meeting |title=Suburban Landscapes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada a similar incentive was provided to developers by [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation|CMHC]]. These incentives, which were discontinued in the 1970s, gave the initial impetus for the application of the hierarchical pattern. In other countries, such incentives do not exist and its adoption is motivated by consumer preferences.

American [[urban planning]], in the 19th and early 20th century emphasized a [[grid plan]], partly out of extensive reliance on foot, horse and [[streetcars]] for transportation. In such earlier urban development, [[alleys]] were included to allow for deliveries of soiled supplies, such as coal, to the rear of houses which are now heated by electricity, piped natural gas or oil.

The use of culs-de-sac reduces the amount of car traffic on residential streets within the subdivision, thus reducing noise, air pollution and the probability of accidents. Ben-Joseph (1995) and Lovegrove/Sayed (2006) indicate a substantially lower collision rate for [[street network]]s based on the cul-de-sac street type.&lt;ref name="Ben-Joseph 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eran |last=Ben-Joseph |title=Livability and Safety of Suburban Street Patterns: A Comparative Study |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=Institute of Urban and Regional Development |series=University of California, Working Paper |volume=641 |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lovegrove |first=Gordon R. |last2=Sayed |first2=Tarek |year=2006 |title=Using Macrolevel Collision Prediction Models in Road Safety Planning Applications |journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board |volume=1950 |issue= |pages=73–82 |doi=10.3141/1950-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dumbaugh and Rae (2009) suggest that land use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Dumbaugh |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Robert |last2=Rae |title=Safe Urban Form: Revisiting the Relationship Between Community Design and Traffic Safety |journal=Journal of the American Planning Association |volume=75 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pages=309–329 |doi=10.1080/01944360902950349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While all intersection types in general increase the incidence of fatal crashes, four-way intersections, which rarely occur in a network with cul-de-sac or loop streets, increase total and injurious crashes significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.

This decrease in traffic, in turn, is thought to lower the incidence of crime and increase desirability, because in most cases the people who traverse the cul-de-sac either live there or are guests of those who do. [[CPTED]] planning principles suggest increased natural surveillance and sense of ownership as a means of fostering security in a neighbourhood. Both of these phenomena occur naturally on a cul-de-sac street as does social networking. Design guidelines based on the CPTED perspective recommend its use for these reasons.

Cul-de-sac streets increase spontaneous outdoor activity by children. A study in California examined the amount of child play that occurred on the streets of neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Culs-de-Sac and Children's Outdoor Play: Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence |year=2007 |first=Susan |last=Handy |first2=Samantha |last2=Sommer |first3=Julie |last3=Ogilvie |first4=Xinyu |last4=Cao |first5=Patricia |last5=Mokhtarian |publisher=University of California Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings indicate that culs-de-sac showed substantial increase in play activity than the open grid street pattern. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic, thereby encouraging more outdoor play.

Similar studies in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huttenmoser |first=Marco |first2=Marie |last2=Meierhofer |year=1995 |title=Children and Their Living Surroundings for the Everyday Life and Development of Children |journal=Children’s Environments |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=1–17 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Individual, social and physical environmental correlates of children's active free-play: a cross-sectional study |first=Jenny |last=Veitch |first2=Jo |last2=Salmon |first3=Kylie |last3=Ball |journal=Australia International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue= |page=11 |doi=10.1186/1479-5868-7-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children’s outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk. In addition, they confirmed the results of the seminal [[Donald Appleyard]] 1982 study  which showed the negative correlation between amount of traffic and social networks. This inverse correlation between amounts of traffic and sociability of streets was reconfirmed by a newer study &lt;ref&gt;Hart, Joshua and Parkhurst, Graham 2011, Driven To Excess: Impacts of Motor Vehicles on the Quality of Life of Residents of Three Streets in Bristol UK, World Transport, Policy &amp; Practice, Volume 17.2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; that repeated Appleyard’s San Francisco analysis in Bristol, UK. It showed that the cul-de-sac street with the lowest traffic of the three streets had the highest level of social interaction.
These studies recommend the use of the cul-de-sac or strong traffic calming measures. When culs-de-sac are interconnected with foot and bike paths, as for example in [[Vauban, Freiburg]], [[Village Homes]], Davis, California, they can increase active modes of mobility among their residents.&lt;ref name="Frank, L. 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frank |first=L. |last2=Hawkins |first2=C. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008 |title=Assessing Travel and Environmental Impacts of Contrasting Levels of Vehicular and Pedestrian Connectivity: Assessing Aspects of the Fused Grid |location=Ottawa |publisher=Canada Mortgageand Housing Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Real estate developer]]s prefer culs-de-sac because they allow builders to fit more houses into oddly shaped tracts of land and facilitate building to the edges of rivers and property lines.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; They also choose these discontinuous network patterns of cul-de-sac and loop streets because of the often significant economies in infrastructure costs compared to the [[grid plan]].

From an environmental perspective, culs-de-sac allow greater flexibility than the common grid in adapting to the natural grades of a site and to its ecologically sensitive features, such as streams creeks and mature forest growth.

The desirability of the cul-de-sac street type among home buyers is implied by the evidence that they often pay up to a 20% premium for a home on such a street, according to one study.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; This could be because there is considerably less passing traffic, resulting in less noise and reduced actual or perceived risk, increasing the sense of tranquility. A survey of residents on three types of streets: cul-de-sac, loop, and through (grid) recorded their preferences among these types. It found that 82% of cul-de-sac residents preferred their own street type, 18% preferred a loop, and 0% the grid. Only 13% of grid street residents preferred their own type and 54% would choose a cul-de-sac to live on.&lt;ref name="Ben-Joseph 1995" /&gt;
Two other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul K. |last=Asabere |title=The value of a neighborhood street with reference to the cul-de-sac |journal=Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=185–193 |doi=10.1007/BF00216591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asabere |first=Paul K. |last2=Huffman |first2=Forrest E. |title=The Relative Impacts of Trails and Greenbelts on Home Price |journal=Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics |volume=38 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=408–419 |doi=10.1007/s11146-007-9089-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported in 1990 and 2009 respectively, confirmed this upward trend and determined the premium that cul-de-sac streets command. The first found a 29% premium over the streets in a grid. The second, focused on trails and greenbelts, found that other amenities including cul-de-sac streets add significantly to the home value.

The positive feelings that a cul-de-sac street could evoke, that residents value, are expressed vividly by [[Allan Jacobs]] in describing a short (250 ft), narrow (60 ft), densely built (14 du/acre), and wood-paved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Diana |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/life/lifestyle/2004/03/21/Shadyside-s-wooden-street-paves-its-way-to-greatness/stories/200403210204 |title=Shadyside's wooden street paves its way to greatness &amp;#124; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2004-03-21 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; cul-de-sac in the [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Allan B. |last=Jacobs |title=Great Streets |year=1993 |publisher=MIT press |isbn=0-262-10048-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Step into Roslyn Place and you are likely to sense, immediately, that you are in a ''place'', a special place, a handsome place, a safe place, a welcoming place, a place where you might wish to live.” ... “narrowness and enclosure  and intimacy bring a feeling of safety to Roslyn Place... “Stay on our street” is all the kids have to know.”

[[Gated community|Gated communities]], steadily increasing worldwide, employ cul-de-sac and loop street networks because, having a dendrite structure, they reduce the number of through roads and, consequently, the corresponding number of entries and exits to be controlled.

===Traffic safety issues===
Dead ends are traditionally considered safer traffic environments for children than normal streets, but research shows that areas with many dead ends in fact have higher rates of traffic accidents involving young children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5455743 Cul-de-Sacs: Suburban Dream or Dead End?], Morning Edition on NPR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bettercities.net/article/tomorrow’s-cities-tomorrow’s-suburbs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/06/07/cul-de-sacs-are-killing-us-public-safety-lessons-from-suburbia/|title=Cul-de-Sacs Are Killing Us: Public Safety Lessons From Suburbia|date=7 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental, health, and crime issues===
Culs-de-sac are criticised by urban designers like those of the [[The Prince's Foundation for Building Community|Foundation for the Built Environment]] in the United Kingdom for encouraging car transport for even short distances, as more direct connections are precluded by the geometry, which necessitates long travel distances even to physically nearby locations. This increases fuel consumption and vehicle emissions and has negative effects on health by reducing walking and cycling rates.&lt;ref name="CHARLES"&gt;''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1364738.ece Charles: let’s kill off the cul-de-sac]'' – ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', February 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Related research in the United States by Richard Jackson has shown that people in car-based (cul-de-sac heavy) communities weigh on average 6 lb (2.7 kg) more than those in traditional towns (with open grid networks).&lt;ref name="CHARLES" /&gt;
An extensive analysis of the research evidence by TRB,&lt;ref&gt;Does the built environment influence physical activity? : examining the evidence /Committee on Physical Activity, Health, Transportation, and Land Use, Transportation
Research Board, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. (Special report ; 282){{ISBN|0-309-09498-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, shows only an association between the built environment and physical activity levels, not causal connections. The evidence does not either identify with certainty which characteristics of the built environment are most closely associated with physical activity behaviour. The study also warns against confusing inadequate physical activity with obesity which is the outcome of an energy imbalance. Many contemporary lifestyle trends, some inevitable (sedentary work) and some avoidable, (frequent energy-rich food consumption or TV watching [4 h/d]), contribute to this imbalance and must be considered in understanding and combating [[obesity]].

The impermeability deficiency of the typical cul-de-sac street can be addressed by applying a modified, improved version of it, mentioned above, that enables pedestrian and bicycle through movement. While this more permeable version can be applied in new developments easily, modifying existing impermeable cul-de-sac streets is problematic as it encounters property ownership issues. Efforts in this direction are, however, being made. Given the complicated legal process and the sheer number of exiting cul-de-sac streets, however, such efforts would be slow to produce results and may only have a marginal impact in changing the landscape of existing districts. Conversely, transforming existing streets that are part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac, as was done in Berkeley, California and Vancouver, British Columbia, is physically and administratively easy due to the public ownership of the street right-of-way. However, residents on adjacent through roads may resent the potential traffic increase and delay the process.  In Berkeley, the barriers used were permeable to both pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and became the backbone of the [[bicycle boulevard]] system in that region.

Increases in pedestrian and bicycle permeability may result in a displacement of local car trips for short distance destinations&lt;ref name="Frank, L. 2008" /&gt; and consequently a reduction in neighbourhood vehicle emissions. The impermeable cul-de-sac not only discourages walking and biking but also increases the length of car trips by the circuitous geometry of the dendrite network structure of which it is a part. Research studies examined the influence of several variables on the amount of car travel that residents of several types of districts recorded. Results vary considerably among one other, but there is general agreement on a number of key correlations:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Taming the Flow—Better Traffic and Safer Neighbourhoods. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Urban Travel: Tool for Evaluating Neighbourhood Sustainability.Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; a) the wealthier and the larger the family is the more cars they own and the more they drive, b) the farther away a family lives from the city centre and the fewer the jobs in the vicinity plus a slow bus service the more they drive and c) street patterns may add a 10% length to ''local trips'' but the total VKTs are affected more by the "macro" urban than the "micro" neighbourhood structure.

Culs-de-sac, especially those that also cut off pedestrian connections instead of limiting only road traffic, have also been criticised for negative effects on safety, because they decrease the amount of through traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) that might spot an accident or crime victim in need of help. Proponents of culs-de-sac and [[gated communities]] have in turn countered that the reduction in through traffic makes any "stranger" much more recognisable in the closed local environment and thus reduces crime danger. This view has in turn been characterized as unrealistic; it is argued that since only a very small proportion of all non-locals passing through the area are potential criminals, increased traffic should increase rather than decrease safety.&lt;ref&gt;''Can Streets Be Made Safe?'' – Hillier, Bill; Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London&lt;/ref&gt;

New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study&lt;ref&gt;An evidence based approach to crime and urban design Or, can we have vitality, sustainability and security all at once? Bill Hillier, Ozlem Sahbaz March 2008 Bartlett School of Graduate StudiesUniversity College London&lt;/ref&gt; did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, a) dwelling types, b) unit density (site density) c) movement on the street, d) culs–de-sac or grids and e) the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that a) flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters; b) density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level; c) local movement is beneficial, larger scale movement not so; d) relative affluence and the number of neighbours has a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The over-provision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard.

More generally, the [[New Urbanism]] movement has offered criticism of the cul-de-sac and crescent (loop) street types not intended to network with each other. It has been suggested that such street layouts can cause increased traffic on the collector streets. It is recognized that cul-de-sac and looped streets inherently remove car traffic through them and restrict access to residents only. Resident traffic is naturally channelled to minor residential collectors and to arterials that provide inter-neighbourhood and inter-district connectivity. A study, reported in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Traditional Neighborhood Development: Will the Traffic Work?Presentation by Walter Kulash at the 11th Annual Pedestrian Conference in Bellevue WA, October 1990&lt;/ref&gt; compared the traffic performance in a {{convert|700|acre|km2|adj=on}} development that was laid out using two approaches, one with and the other without hierarchy or cul-de-sac streets. It concluded that the non-hierarchical, traditional layout generally shows lower peak speed and shorter, more frequent intersection delays than the hierarchical pattern. The traditional pattern is not as friendly to the long trips as the hierarchical but friendlier to short trips. Local trips in it are shorter in distance but about equivalent in time with the hierarchical layout.  A later similar comparative traffic study&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; of about {{convert|830|acre|km2}} concluded that all types of layouts perform adequately in most land use scenarios and that a refined hierarchical, dendrite network can improve traffic performance.

Anecdotal and research evidence suggests that navigation (especially on foot) in a disconnected network of cul-de-sac and looped streets is inconvenient and non-intuitive, particularly when combined with curvilinear geometry. Loss of orientation and sense of direction is also a common experience in older cities with cul-de-sac streets (Medina of Arab cities or Mediterranean hill towns) as well as in cities with highly irregular block geometries and sizes and corresponding street alignments that produce a labyrinthine effect. The long history of such cities implies that an irregular, complicated street network that appears entirely illegible to a visitor is well understood and used by the inhabitants. More convincing about its workability for their permanent residents are the case histories of cities such as Regensburg that show a gradual transformation of an imported or imposed orthogonal, “legible” grid to the traditional “confusing” street networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. E. J. |last=Morris |year=1994 |title=History of Urban Form Before the Industrial Revolution |edition=Third |publisher=Pearson Education Limited |location=Harlow, UK |isbn=0-582-30154-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cul-de-sac and loop streets can reduce the size of any given neighbourhood to a single street. Neighbourhoods can be defined by geographic boundaries but more often it is shared ethnic, socio-economic and cultural characteristics that create social cohesion irrespective of apparent physical "boundaries". Mehaffy ''et al.'' (2010), who propose a model for structuring an urban network, suggest that neighbourhoods cannot be designed into being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Mehaffy |first2=Sergio |last2=Porta |first3=Yodan |last3=Rofe |lastauthoramp=yes |first4=Nikos |last4=Salingaros |title=Urban nuclei and the geometry of streets: The 'emergent neighborhoods' model |year=2010 |journal=Urban Design International |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=22–46 [p. 45] |doi=10.1057/udi.2009.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Community” is viewed as a dynamic social and [[cultural construct]] especially in contemporary, open, multicultural cities. Residential area street configuration can only assist its emergence by reducing through traffic and increasing local pedestrian movement; a design goal for which connected cul-de-sac and looped streets are suited.

Issues of pedestrian trip length and isolation are sharply evident in the back-to-front housing arrangement where the front of the house fronts onto the cul-de-sac street while the rear fronts onto the main roads. Some of these problems can be mitigated by the newer practice of connecting the neighbouring roads and culs-de-sac with public pedestrian/cycle paths. In effect, this removes the discontinuity aspect for these modes of transport. Built examples of such connected culs-de-sac can be found in the [[United States]] (such as [[Radburn, New Jersey|Radburn]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Village Homes]], [[California]]), [[England]] (such as [[Milton Keynes]]) and [[Greece]] (such as [[Papagou]], a suburb of [[Athens]]) (see photo). Acknowledging their use, Germany, under the 2009 amendment to the Road Traffic Act, introduced an additional sign for culs-de-sac that are permeable to pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa-95.de/VZ-Liste.htm |title=Richtlinien für die Sicherung von Arbeitsstellen an Straßen RSA-95 (Übersicht alte und neue Verkehrszeichen) |author=Uli Korsch |access-date=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407043850/http://www.rsa-95.de/VZ-Liste.htm |archivedate=2013-04-07 |df= }} – Zeichen 357, 357–50 und 357-51&lt;/ref&gt; (see under signage below). A new system for organizing connected, permeable culs-de-sac into complete neighbourhoods, the [[Fused Grid]], has been developed by [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]].

In the [[North America]]n development context and planning literature, cul-de-sac streets have been associated with low density residential development. [[sustainable development]] theorists and proponents claim that this is in some undefined way, inefficient. The increased prevalence of cul-de-sac streets occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, a period of rapid economic and city expansion, when a detached house on a large lot meant an ideal form of habitation. This temporal coincidence of the wide adoption of a street type and an increasing demand for large lots and houses creates the impression of a necessary relationship between street type and unit density. Historically, however, the earliest systematic application of the cul-de-sac street type by Raymond Unwin (1909) had a unit density between 8 and 12 units per acre, considerably higher than mid-to-late 20th century. Even early 21st century developments rarely achieve densities above 5 to 7 units per acre in the suburbs. Conversely, early 1950s suburban developments that were laid out on a grid exhibit similar low densities. Evidently, street, network type and density are not linked causally; other factors, such as land scarcity and income influence the outcome as, for example, in cities that are landlocked or that have low average incomes.

Another concern is often raised by emergency services, who can have difficulty locating streets when a community consists of a large number of similarly named culs-de-sac; also, large fire response vehicles, in particular, can have great difficulty with turning around in a cul-de-sac.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbr.org/2010/05/back-to-the-city/sb1|title=Back to the City|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confusing street naming is not a necessary outcome of street network design and can be improved. The practice of naming orthogonal networks by numbers and letters in the corresponding cardinal directions has been criticized by [[Camilo Sitte]] as lacking imagination. Nonetheless, police and fire departments now use advanced [[GPS navigation device|GPS]] systems that quickly locate the destination and the shortest path to follow.

School buses can also have a hard time turning around, which means that children who live in a cul-de-sac must often walk to a bus stop on a main through road. However, recent research on obesity and urban planning suggests that this may be an advantage because it enables children to get daily physical activity. Longer walking distances, however, reduce interest to use buses especially when a car is available.&lt;ref name="HBR" /&gt; This disincentive to walking to the school bus stop can be overcome in planned cul-de-sac streets by regulating their maximum length to about {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, as was recommended and practiced by R. Unwin and others.

Weighing available evidence has led a few U.S. cities including [[Austin, Texas]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; and [[Portland, Oregon]] to restrict and regulate the inclusion of cul-de-sac streets in new suburbs.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; However, a 2010 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/lewyn/65|title=This work is no longer available|first=Berkeley Electronic|last=Press|website=works.bepress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Sprawl in NA  by a legal expert concludes that “....neighborhoods dominated by culs-de-sac are less walkable than those that include street grids...’. ‘On the other hand, culs-de-sac do have a countervailing public benefit: because of their very inaccessibility, they tend to have less automobile traffic. Given the existence of important public policy goals on both sides, a city seeking to maximize walkability should not favor culs-de-sac over grids, but should also allow some culs-de-sac as a legitimate residential option’ ... ‘In addition, there are “middle ground” alternatives between prohibiting culs-de-sac and mandating them. For example, a city could encourage culs-de-sac combined with pedestrian walkways”. This design combination is shown in the Village Homes layout and is an integral part of the [[Fused Grid]].

==Terminology==
[[George Orwell]] wrote in his 1946 article "[[Politics and the English Language]]" that the term "cul de sac" is another foreign word used in English as pretentious diction and is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "Politics and the English Language". 1946&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mla.stanford.edu/Politics_&amp;_English_language.pdf ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216033215/http://mla.stanford.edu/Politics_%26_English_language.pdf |date=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.george-orwell.org/Politics_and_the_English_Language/0.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016111356/http://www.george-orwell.org/Politics_and_the_English_Language/0.html |date=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm |title=George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language," 1946 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715144246/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm |archivedate=2010-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O.

The word "cul-de-sac" and its synonyms or near synonyms "dead end" and "no exit" have inspired metaphorical uses in literature and in culture, often with the result that a word or phrase seeming to have a negative connotation is replaced in street signs with a new coinage. ("No outlet" is another alternative name used on street signs.)

The expression ''cul-de-sac'' comes from French, where it originally meant "bottom of the sack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cul-de-sac|title=cul-de-sac - Definition of cul-de-sac in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used in English in anatomy (since 1738). It was used for dead-end streets since 1800 in English (since the 14th century in French).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/cul-de-sac|title=CUL-DE-SAC : Définition de CUL-DE-SAC|website=www.cnrtl.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The often heard erroneous folk etymology "arse/ass [buttocks] of the sack" is based on the modern meaning of ''cul'' in [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], but ''cul'' doesn't have that meaning in ''cul-de-sac'', which is still used to refer to dead ends in modern French although the terms ''[[:fr:impasse|impasse]]'' and ''voie sans issue'' are more common in modern French.

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] used the name [[Bag End]] as a translation of "cul-de-sac" to poke fun at the British use of French terms.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''The Road to [[Middle-earth|Middle-Earth]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, "cul-de-sac" is commonly used in speech but "no exit" or "no through road" is more common in road signs, especially in western Canada. In Quebec and Newfoundland, "Cul-de-Sac" is in far more common use, though Quebec  is increasingly using "Impasse" instead.

===Australia===
In Australia, they are signposted as and often referred to as a "No Through Road". Suffixes for these types of streets include "court", "close" or "place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www0.landgate.wa.gov.au/docvault.nsf/web/PS_LD/$file/Geographic-names-policies.pdf |title=Policies and Standards for Geographical Naming in Western Australia |publisher=Landgate, Government of Western Australia|date=January 2015 |pages=53–54 |access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cul-de-sac" generally only refers to a reasonably short street with a bulbous end, or even only to the end portion. A long road that is a no-through road and terminates abruptly is usually called a dead end.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand they are signposted as "No Exit", but are often not signposted at all.  The terms 'cul-de-sac' and 'dead end' have the same senses as in Australia (see above).

===United States===
[[File:Dead end, Otay Mesa, San Diego.jpg|thumb|right|Dead end sign in English and Spanish in [[Otay Mesa, San Diego]]]]
U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] rules state: "The ''Dead End'' sign may be used at the entrance of a single road or street that terminates in a dead end or cul-de-sac. The ''No Outlet'' sign may be used at the entrance to a road or road network from which there is no other exit." There is no federal regulation on "no exit".&lt;ref name="wsnyt"&gt;{{cite news | last=Safire | first=William | authorlink=William Safire | title=On Language: Dead End | publisher=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/magazine/13wwln-safire-t.html | date=2008-07-13 | accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase, "No Exit", is also preferred for [[Chicago]] signs, although "dead end" is still used there.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[New York City]] has favored "dead end" since at least the 1930s, when [[Sidney Kingsley]] used the phrase to title his Broadway play about poor, tough [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] youths with lives of little promise, in contrast to the dead-end streets of the nearby [[Sutton Place, Manhattan|Sutton Place]] neighborhood. (Similarly, French [[Existentialism|existentialist]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] titled a play about three damned sinners, ''[[Huis Clos]]'', translated into English as "[[No Exit]]".) Kingsley's play was later made into a movie, ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]]'', which proved so popular that it spawned similar movies, many starring a group of recurring characters known as the [[Dead End Kids]]. The play and movies created such a strong image of bleak futures and an unfair society that some municipalities changed the sign terminology for culs-de-sac, often to "no outlet" or "no exit". (The "dead end" signs currently at Sutton Place are bright yellow with black lettering.)&lt;ref name="wsnyt"/&gt;

In New York City, as of 2008, there were 4,659 "dead end" traffic signs, along with 160 "no outlet" signs. The city records, which go back to the 1960s, show only a couple "no exit" signs once existing near the approaches to the Midtown Tunnel, and which are no longer there. "We hear that some towns use 'no outlet' instead of 'dead end' because they think it sounds less morbid," New York City Commissioner of Transportation [[Janette Sadik-Khan]] said in 2008. "We tell New Yorkers the truth: it's a 'dead end', and we think that motorists get the point quickly."&lt;ref name="wsnyt"/&gt;

[[California]] uses the phrase ''Not a Through Street'' or ''Not a Through Road'' to mark roads or road systems that end in culs-de-sac. More recently, ''No Outlet'' has been shown on some signs as well (an example being Meyers Avenue south of Eureka Street in the [[Eureka, California|Pine Hills]] area).

===Other uses===
In military parlance, a "cul-de-sac" refers to a situation where an army is ''"hemmed in on all sides but behind"''.&lt;ref&gt;OED, online edition, draft revision December 2007, entry for ''cul-de-sac, n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt; "Cul-de-sac" is also used [[metaphorically]] to mean a line of thought or action that leads nowhere.

In medicine, the expression is used to refer to the [[recto-uterine pouch]], also known as the Pouch of Douglas, the deepest point of the female [[peritoneal cavity]].

The '''Democratic Movement of Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|Demokratski pokret Srbije}}) or DEPOS, was a centre-right [[political coalition]] founded in 1992. The coalition was formed by:&lt;ref&gt;http://ius.regione.toscana.it/elezioni/Quaderni/qua56/Saggio3.pdf (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO)
*[[Democratic Party of Serbia]] (DSS)
*[[Serbian Liberal Party]] (SLS)
*[[Liberals of Serbia|New Democracy]] (ND)

The coalition received 16.89% of the popular vote in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1992|1992]] and 16.64% in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1993|1993]] parliamentary elections. The DSS left the coalition ahead of the 1993 election, while the DEPOS was joined by the [[Civic Alliance of Serbia]] and the [[People's Peasant Party]]. The coalition was dissolved in 1993 after New Democracy entered into a coalition government with the [[Socialist Party of Serbia|Socialist Party]].

The '''Department of Basic Education''' ('''DBE''') is one of the [[ministry (government department)|departments]] of the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]]. It oversees [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] [[education]] in [[South Africa]]. It was created in 2009 after the election of [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Jacob Zuma]], when the former [[Department of Education (South Africa)|Department of Education]] was divided.

The political head of the department is the [[Minister of Basic Education (South Africa)|Minister of Basic Education]]; {{asof|2009|5|lc=on}} this is [[Angie Motshekga]]. The department is headquartered in Sol Plaatje House, named after the author [[Sol Plaatje]], in [[Pretoria]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.education.gov.za/dobeinternet/ContactUs/tabid/75/Default.aspx Contact Us]."

{{History of Australia}}
The '''Federation of Australia''' was the process by which the six separate British [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[Colony of Queensland|Queensland]], [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria]], [[Colony of Tasmania|Tasmania]], [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia (1836)|South Australia]], and [[History of Western Australia#Colonial era|Western Australia]] agreed to unite and form the Commonwealth of Australia, establishing a system of [[federalism in Australia]]. [[Fiji]] and [[New Zealand]] were originally part of this process, but they decided not to join the federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article908489|title=Fiji and Australian Federation. – (From the Herald's own Correspondent.) Melbourne, Monday|work=The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser|date=25 October 1883|access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following federation, the six colonies that united to form the Commonwealth of Australia as states kept the systems of government (and the bicameral legislatures) that they had developed as separate colonies, but they also agreed to have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, on 1 January 1901, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.

The efforts to bring about federation in the mid-19th century were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement. A number of conventions were held during the 1890s to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. Sir [[Henry Parkes]], Premier of [[New South Wales]], was instrumental in this process. Sir [[Edmund Barton]], second only to Parkes in the length of his commitment to the federation cause, was the caretaker [[Prime Minister of Australia]] at the inaugural [[Australian federal election, 1901|national election in 1901]] in March 1901. The election returned Barton as prime minister, though without a majority.

This period has lent its name to an architectural style prevalent in Australia at that time, known as [[Federation architecture]], or Federation style.

==Federal idea ==

===Federal Council ===
A serious movement for Federation of the colonies arose in the late 1880s, a time when there was increasing nationalism amongst Australians, the great majority of whom were native-born. The idea of being "Australian" began to be celebrated in songs and poems. This was fostered by improvements in transport and communications, such as the establishment of a [[telegraph]] system between the colonies in 1872. The Australian colonies were also influenced by other federations which had emerged around the world, such as the United States and Canada.

Sir [[Henry Parkes]], then Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, first proposed a Federal Council body in 1867. After it was rejected by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]], Parkes brought up the issue again in 1880, this time as the [[Premier of New South Wales]]. At the conference, representatives from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia considered a number of issues including federation, communication, Chinese immigration, vine diseases and uniform [[tariff]] rates. The Federation had the potential to ensure that throughout the continent, trade, and [[interstate commerce]] would be unaffected by [[protectionism]] and measurement and transport would be standardised.

The final (and successful) push for a Federal Council came at an Intercolonial Convention in Sydney in November and December 1883. The trigger was the British rejection of Queensland's unilateral annexation of [[New Guinea]] and the British Government wish to see a federalised Australasia. The convention was called to debate the strategies needed to counter the activities of the [[German Empire|German]] and [[French Third Republic|French]] in New Guinea and in [[New Hebrides]]. Sir [[Samuel Griffith]], the [[Premier of Queensland]], drafted a bill to constitute the Federal Council. The conference successfully petitioned the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial Parliament]] to enact the bill as the ''[[Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885]]''.&lt;ref&gt;note 2, at 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, a [[Federal Council of Australasia]] was formed, to represent the affairs of the colonies in their relations with the [[Australasia|South Pacific]] islands. New South Wales and New Zealand did not join. The self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, as well as the [[crown colony|Crown Colonies]] of Western Australia and [[Fiji]], became involved. South Australia was briefly a member between 1888 and 1890. The Federal Council had powers to legislate directly upon certain matters, such as in relation to [[extradition]], regulation of fisheries, and so on, but it did not have a permanent secretariat, executive powers, or any revenue of its own. Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value. 
[[File:1886 Anti-Chinese Cartoon from Australia.jpg|thumb|200px|Published in 1888 this cartoon depicts the [[anti-Chinese]] sentiment that was one of the driving forces behind the push for federation.]]

Nevertheless, it was the first major form of inter-colonial co-operation. It provided an opportunity for [[Federalist]]s from around the country to meet and exchange ideas. The means by which the Council was established endorsed the continuing role that the Imperial Parliament would have in the development of Australia's constitutional structure. In terms of the ''Federal Council of Australia Act'', the Australian drafters established a number of powers dealing with their "common interest" which would later be replicated in the Australian Constitution, especially [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51]].

=== Early opposition ===
The individual colonies, Victoria excepted, were somewhat wary of Federation. Politicians from the smaller colonies, in particular, disliked the very idea of delegating power to a national government; they feared that any such government would inevitably be dominated by the more populous New South Wales and Victoria. Queensland, for its part, worried that the advent of [[White Australia Policy|race-based]] national legislation  would restrict the importing of [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|kanaka]] labourers, thereby jeopardising its [[sugar cane]] industry.

These were not the only concerns of those resistant to federation. Smaller colonies also worried about the abolition of [[tariff]]s, which would deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue, and leave their commerce at the mercy of the larger states. New South Wales, traditionally free-trade in its outlook, wanted to be satisfied that the federation's tariff policy would not be protectionist. Victorian Premier [[James Service]] described [[fiscal union]] as "the lion in the way" of federation.

A further fundamental issue was how to distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For the larger colonies there was the possibility (which never became an actuality) that they could be required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.

Even without the concerns, there was debate about the form of government that a federation would take. Experience of other federations was less than inspiring. In particular, the United States had experienced the traumatic [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

The nascent [[Australian labour movement]] was less than wholly committed in its support for federation. On the one hand, nationalist sentiment was strong within the labour movement and there was much support for the idea of [[White Australia]]. On the other hand, labour representatives feared that federation would distract attention from the need for [[reform movement|social]] and [[Labor relations|industrial]] reform, and further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The federal conventions included no representatives of organised labour. In fact, the proposed federal constitution was criticised by labour representatives as being too conservative. These representatives wanted to see a federal government with more power to legislate on issues such as wages and prices. They also regarded the proposed senate as much too powerful, with the capacity to block attempts at social and political reform, much as the colonial upper houses were quite openly doing at that time.

Religious factors played a small but not trivial part in disputes over whether federation was desirable or even possible. As a general rule, pro-federation leaders were Protestants, while Catholics' enthusiasm for federation was much weaker, not least because Parkes had been militantly anti-Catholic for decades (and because the labour movement was disproportionately Catholic in its membership).

== Early constitutional conventions ==
In the early 1890s two meetings established the need for federation and set the framework for this to occur. An informal meeting attended by official representatives from the Australasian colonies was held in 1890. This led to the first [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|National Australasian Convention]], meeting in Sydney in 1891. New Zealand was represented at both the conference and the Convention, although its delegates indicated that it would be unlikely to join the Federation at its foundation, but it would probably be interested in doing so at a later date.

===Conference of 1890 ===
The Conference of 1890 was organised at the instigation of Parkes. The account of the calling of the 1890 conference usually begins with [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]], goading the ageing Parkes at a luncheon on 15 June 1889. Parkes reportedly boasted that he "could confederate these colonies in twelve months". Carrington retorted, "Then why don't you do it? It would be a glorious finish to your life."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Henry Parkes'', at 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Parkes the next day wrote to the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[Duncan Gillies]], offering to advance the cause of Federation. Gillies's response was predictably cool, given the reluctance of Parkes to bring [[New South Wales]] into the Federal Council. In October Parkes travelled north to Brisbane and met with Griffith and Sir [[Thomas McIlwraith]]. On the return journey, he stopped just south of the colonial border, and delivered the historic [[Tenterfield Oration]] on 24 October 1889, stating that the time had come for the colonies to consider Australian federation.

Through the latter part of 1889 the premiers and governors corresponded and agreed for an informal meeting to be called. The membership was: New South Wales, Parkes (Premier) and [[William McMillan (Australian politician)|William McMillan]] (Colonial Treasurer); Victoria, Duncan Gillies (Premier) and [[Alfred Deakin]] (Chief Secretary); Queensland, Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] (Leader of the Opposition) and [[John Murtagh Macrossan]] (Colonial Secretary); South Australia, Dr. [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] (Premier) and [[Thomas Playford II|Thomas Playford]] (Leader of the Opposition); Tasmania, [[Andrew Inglis Clark]] (Attorney-General) and [[Stafford Bird]] (Treasurer); Western Australia, Sir [[James George Lee Steere]] (Speaker); New Zealand, Captain [[William Russell (New Zealand politician)|William Russell]] (Colonial Secretary) and Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand)|John Hall]].
[[File:Federal Oak 1890.jpg|thumb|The Federal [[Oak tree|Oak]] in the gardens of the Victorian Parliament House in Melbourne. The tree was planted in 1890 by Sir Henry Parkes to commemorate the meeting of the Australian Federal Conference.]]
When the conference met at the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne on 6 February, the delegates were confronted with a scorching summer maximum temperature of {{convert|39.7|°C}} in the shade. The Conference debated whether or not the time was ripe to proceed with federation.

While some of the delegates agreed it was, the smaller states were not as enthusiastic. Thomas Playford from South Australia indicated the tariff question and lack of popular support as hurdles. Similarly, Sir James Lee Steere from Western Australia and the New Zealand delegates suggested there was little support for federation in their respective colonies.

A basic question at this early assembly was how to structure the federation within the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] tradition of government. The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' (1867), which had confederated the [[provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], provided a model with respect to the relations between the federation and the Crown. There was less enthusiasm, however, for the [[centralization|centralism]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian Constitution]], especially from the smaller states. Following the conference of 1890, the Canadian federal model was no longer considered appropriate for the Australian situation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams J, "'With Eyes Open': Andrew Inglis Clark and our Republican Tradition" (1995) 23(2) ''Federal Law Review'' 149 at 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provided another example, it was inevitable that the delegates should look to the [[Constitution of the United States]] as the other major model of a federation within the English-speaking world. It gave just a few powers to the federal government and left the majority of matters within the legislative competence of the states. It also provided that the Senate should consist of an equal number of members from each State while the Lower House should reflect the national distribution of population. [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], a long-time admirer of American federal institutions, introduced the [[US Constitution]] as an example of the protection of States' rights. He presented it as an alternative to the Canadian model, arguing that Canada was "an instance of amalgamation rather than Federation."&lt;ref&gt;''Debates of the Australian Federation Conference'', at 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction by Deakin of [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]]'s ''The American Commonwealth'' also had far-reaching influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Making of the Australian Constitution | last=La Nauze | first=J. A. | isbn=0-522-84016-7 | page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference in Melbourne ended with an agreement by the delegates that the time for federation had arrived.

=== Clark's draft constitution ===
[[Image:Andrew Inglis Clark.jpg|thumb|right|Andrew Clark, circa 1907]]

A. I. Clark had given considerable thought towards a suitable constitution for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;As early as 1874, he published a comparative study of the American, Canadian and Swiss constitutions.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1890, he travelled to London to conduct an appeal on behalf of the [[Government of Tasmania]] before the [[Privy Council]]. During this trip, he began writing a draft constitution, taking the main provisions of the [[British North America Act]] and its supplements up through 1890, the US Constitution, the [[Federal Council of Australasia Act]], and various Australian colonial constitutions. Clark returned from London by way of [[Boston]], Massachusetts, where he held discussions about his draft with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], and [[Moncure Conway]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Conway and Holmes were all [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Clark had met Conway when he travelled to [[Hobart, Tasmania]], as part of his speaking tour in 1883. Conway later introduced Clark to Holmes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark's draft introduced the nomenclature and form which was subsequently adopted:

* The Australian Federation is described as the Commonwealth of Australia
* There are three separate and equal branches – the Parliament, the Executive, and the Judicature.
* The Legislature consists of a House of Representatives and a Senate
* It specified the [[Separation of powers in Australia|separation of powers]] and the [[Federalism in Australia|division of powers]] between the Federal and State governments.

Upon his return to Hobart in early November 1890, with the technical aid of [[W. O. Wise]], the Tasmanian Parliamentary Draftsman, Clark completed the final form of the Draft Constitution and had a number of copies printed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from W. O. Wise to A. P. Canaway dated 29 June 1921. Cover page to First draft of Australian Constitution. Mitchell Library MS, Q342.901&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1891, Inglis Clark circulated copies of his draft to Parkes, Barton and probably Playford as well.&lt;ref name="neasey"&gt;{{cite book | title=Andrew Inglis Clark | year=2001 | publisher=University of Tasmania Law Press | last=Neasey | first=F. M. | author2=Neasey, L. J. | isbn=0-85901-964-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This draft was always intended to be a private working document, and was never published.&lt;ref&gt;La Nauze, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convention of 1891 ===
The [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] proposed at the Convention of 1891 was to adopt the nomenclature of the [[United States Congress]]. This proposal provided the broad outline of a Federal government. Its lower house was to be elected by districts drawn up on the basis of their population, while in the Senate there was to be equal representation for each "province". This American model was mixed with the [[Westminster system]] by which the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] and other ministers would be appointed by the representative of the [[British Crown]] from among the members of the political party holding a majority in the lower House.

Griffith identified with great clarity at the Sydney Convention perhaps the greatest problem of all: how to structure the relationship between the lower and upper houses within the Federal Parliament. The main division of opinion centred on the contention of [[Alfred Deakin]], that the lower house must be supreme, as opposed to the views of Barton, [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] and others, that a strong Senate with co-ordinate powers was essential. Griffith himself recommended that the doctrine of responsible government should be left open, or substantially modified to accord with the Federal structure.

Over the Easter weekend in 1891, Griffith edited Clark's draft aboard the Queensland Government's steam yacht ''[[Lucinda (steam yacht)|Lucinda]]''. (Clark was not present, as he was ill with influenza in Sydney). Griffith's draft Constitution was submitted to colonial parliaments but it lapsed in [[New South Wales]], after which the other colonies were unwilling to proceed.

=== Griffith or Clark? ===
The importance of the draft Constitution of 1891 was recognised by [[John La Nauze]] when he flatly declared that "The draft of 1891 is the Constitution of 1900, not its father or grandfather."&lt;ref&gt;La Nauze, note 11 at 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Twenty-First Century, however, a lively debate has sprung up as to whether the principal credit for this draft belongs to Queensland's Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] or Tasmania's [[Andrew Inglis Clark]]. The debate began with the publication of Peter Botsman's ''The Great Constitutional Swindle: A Citizen's Guide to the Australian Constitution''&lt;ref name="swindle"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Constitutional Swindle|last=Botsman|first=Peter|publisher=Pluto Press Australia|year=2000|isbn=1-86403-062-3|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000, and a biography of ''Andrew Inglis Clark'' by F.M. Neasey and L.J. Neasey published by the University of Tasmania Law Press in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Andrew Inglis Clark|last=Neasey|first=F.M.|last2=Neasey|first2=L.J.|publisher=University of Tasmania Law Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Hobart|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view attached almost sole responsibility for the 1891 draft to Griffith. Quick and Garran, for instance, state curtly that Griffith "had the chief hand in the actual drafting of the Bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The annotated constitution of the Australian Commonwealth|last=Quick|first=John|last2=Garran|first2=Robert Randolph|publisher=Angus and Robertson|year=1901|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=130|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the authors of this highly respected work were themselves active members of the federal movement, it may be presumed that this view represents - if not the complete truth - then, at least, the consensus opinion amongst Australia's "founding fathers".

In his 1969 entry on "Clark, Andrew Inglis (1848–1907)" for the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Henry|date=1969|year=|title=Clark, Andrew Inglis (1848 -1907)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/clark-andrew-inglis-3211|journal=Australian Dictionary of Biography|volume=|pages=|access-date=31 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Reynolds offers a more nuanced view:&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the National Australasian Convention in Sydney in 1891 he [Clark] circulated his own draft constitution bill. This was practically a transcript of relevant provisions from the British North American Act, the United States Constitution and the Federal Council Act, arranged systematically, but it was to be of great use to the drafting committee at the convention. Parkes received it with reservations, suggesting that 'the structure should be evolved bit by bit'. George Higinbotham admitted the 'acknowledged defects &amp; disadvantages' of responsible government, but criticized Clark's plan to separate the executive and the legislature. Clark's draft also differed from the adopted constitution in his proposal for 'a separate federal judiciary', with the new Supreme Court replacing the Privy Council as the highest court of appeal on all questions of law, which would be 'a wholesome innovation upon the American system'. He became a member of the Constitutional Committee and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Although he took little part in the debates he assisted (Sir) Samuel Griffith, (Sir) Edmund Barton and Charles Cameron Kingston in revising Griffith's original draft of the adopted constitution on the Queensland government's steam yacht, ''Lucinda''; though he was too ill to be present when the main work was done, his own draft had been the basis for most of Griffith's text. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Clark's supporters are quick to point out that 86 Sections (out of a total of 128) of the final Australian Constitution are recognisable in Clark's draft,&lt;ref name="swindle" /&gt; and that "only eight of Inglis Clark’s ninety-six clauses failed to find their way into the final Australian Constitution";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neasey|first=Frank|year=1991|title=Andrew Inglis Clark and Australian Federation|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/~/link.aspx?_id=C39CAE7B9E4743FA814AD5759747601D&amp;_z=z|journal=Papers on Parliament|volume=13|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these are potentially misleading statistics. As Professor John Williams has pointed out:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=John (Professor)|year=2014|title=Andrew Inglis Clark: Our Constitution and His Influence|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/~/link.aspx?_id=50F3804219D141609BD6887ECDB41E74&amp;_z=z#_ftn28|journal=Papers on Parliament|volume=61|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is easy to point to the document and dismiss it as a mere ‘cut and paste’ from known provisions. While there is some validity in such observations it does tend to overlook the fact that there are very few variations to be added once the basic structure is agreed. So for instance, there was always going to be parts dealing with the executive, the parliament and the judiciary in any Australian constitution. The fact that Inglis Clark modelled his on the American Constitution is no surprise once that basic decision was made. Issues of the respective legislative powers, the role of the states, the power of amendment and financial questions were the detail of the debate that the framers were about to address in 1891.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As to who was responsible for the actual detailed drafting, as distinct from the broad structure and framework of the 1891 draft, Professor Williams (for one) is in no doubt:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In terms of style there can be little argument that Inglis Clark’s Constitution is not as crisp or clean as Kingston’s 1891 draft Constitution. This is not so much a reflection on Inglis Clark, but an acknowledgement of the talents of Charles Kingston and Sir Samuel Griffith as drafters. They were direct and economical with words. The same cannot always be said of Inglis Clark.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Later constitutional conventions ==
The revival of the federal movement stemmed from the growth of federal leagues and nationalist organisations that were committed to federation, such as the [[Australian Natives' Association]]. There were two so-called People's Conventions held in [[Corowa]] and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].
[[File:Australia Federation Ribbon2.jpg|150px|thumb|upright|A ribbon produced in Sydney]]
In 1893 [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]], who had attended the Corowa convention, drew up a bill which became the basis of discussion at the Adelaide Convention (see below) and is considered to have contributed largely to the eventual constitution. Quick with [[Robert Garran]] went on to publish ''The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth'' in 1901, which is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative works on the Australian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/cl/constitution.html|title=Closer Look: The Australian Constitution|publisher=Parliamentary Education Office|accessdate=9 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405180301/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/cl/constitution.html|archivedate=5 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 a proposal was accepted by the premiers of the Australian colonies to establish a new Convention by popular vote, with the resulting draft of the constitution being submitted to the electors of each colony in a [[referendum]]. The Convention held meetings over the course of a year, beginning first in [[Adelaide]] in 1897, later meeting in Sydney, and culminating in Melbourne in March 1898. After the Adelaide meeting, the colonial Parliaments took the opportunity to debate the emerging Bill and to suggest changes. The basic principles discussed in 1891 were adopted, with the addition of the principle of [[responsible government]]. There was also a consensus for more democracy in the constitutional structure. It was agreed that the Senate should be chosen by popular vote with the voters in each State acting as one electorate.

A draft bill was drawn up in 1898, and then sent to each colony to be ratified by the electorate. Referendums were held in four of the colonies in June 1898. There were majority votes in all four of them, however, the enabling legislation in New South Wales required the support of at least 80,000 voters for passage, and this number was not reached.&lt;ref name=ccwa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/Documents/federation.pdf|title=Celebrating Federation|publisher=Constitutional Centre of Western Australia|format=PDF|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting of the colonial premiers in early 1899 agreed to a number of amendments to make the constitution more acceptable to New South Wales.  Known as the "[[Edward Braddon|Braddon Clause]]", the amendments provided for the return of customs revenue to the states for ten years.  It was also agreed that the new federal capital was to be built in New South Wales provided it was at least a hundred miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) from Sydney.&lt;ref name=ccwa /&gt; In June 1899, the referendum was held again in all the colonies except for [[Western Australia]], where the vote was not held until the following year. The majority vote was "yes" in all the colonies.

{{main|Constitution of Australia}}
The ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (UK)'' was passed on 5 July 1900 and given [[Royal Assent]] by [[Queen Victoria]] on 9 July 1900. It was proclaimed on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1901 in [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], Sydney. Sir Edmund Barton was sworn in as the interim [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], leading an interim Federal ministry of nine members.

The new constitution established a [[bicameral]] Parliament, containing a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The office of [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] was established as the Queen's representative; initially, this person was considered a representative of the British government. The Constitution also established a [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], and divided the powers of government between the states and the new Commonwealth government.

The site of a federal capital was disputed heavily between the two arch-rivals Sydney and [[Melbourne]]; the compromise was that a separate territory (the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) would be established within New South Wales to hold a new capital, while Parliament would sit in Melbourne until the new city was constructed. The site eventually chosen for the city became [[Canberra]].

==Landmarks named after Federation==

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''First Rutte cabinet''', also called the '''Rutte–Verhagen cabinet''' was the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]] from 14 October 2010 until 5 November 2012. The cabinet was formed by the [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political parties]] [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) after the [[Dutch general election, 2010|election of 2010]]. The [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] cabinet was a [[minority government]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] but was [[Confidence and supply|supported]] by the [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) for a majority. It was the first of three cabinets of [[Mark Rutte]], the [[Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]], with [[Maxime Verhagen]] the [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] serving as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]].

==Formation==
{{main|2010 Dutch cabinet formation}}
Following the collapse of the fourth Balkenende cabinet on 20 February 2010, elections for the House of Representatives were held on 9 June 2010. As usual in Dutch politics, none of the parties had a majority and several ''[[Informateur]]s'' were appointed to investigate the formation of a coalition cabinet. A broad coalition consisting of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] was briefly looked at, but dismissed. Then negotiations for a "[[Purple (government)|purple plus]]" coalition consisting of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], [[Democrats 66]] and [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]] lasted for about three weeks, but the parties could not reach agreement on the amount of budget cuts. Finally, a construction which is rare for the Netherlands was investigated: a minority coalition consisting of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (together 52 out of 150 seats in the House of Representatives), supported in parliament by the [[Party for Freedom]] (24 seats), to make the smallest possible majority of 76 seats. The reason for this construction was that parties agreed that the largest party the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and the largest winner in the elections needed to be in power; only the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] could or wanted to help make a majority, but they were against forming a proper coalition with [[Party for Freedom]] because of their different views on Islam and immigration. Therefore, negotiations were held to form a coalition agreement between the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], and to form a "parliamentary support agreement" between all three parties, which were successfully finished on 30 September 2010.

When Rutte took office on 14 October, it marked the first time that the VVD had led a government since its formation in 1946. It also marked the first [[liberalism in the Netherlands|liberal]]-led government since 1913.

The opposition parties expected that the coalition would prove to be unstable because at a special [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] conference, about a third of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] members voted against the formation of this cabinet. Also, in the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] parliamentary fraction at least two people indicated they have difficulties with the cabinet, but say they will support it because the majority of the party approves of the cabinet. When the cabinet took office, the three parties had a minority in the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] of 35 out of 75 seats. The parties hoped this would change following the [[Dutch Senate election, 2011|Dutch Senate election of 2011]], but they obtained 37 seats, one short of a majority. However, it is expected that the small Christian party [[Reformed Political Party]], which obtained one seat, will support the cabinet in the Senate.

The cabinet consisted of 12 [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] and 8 [[Secretary of State|State secretaries]]. The positions where divided equally among the coalition members, regardless of their respective size: [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (31 seats in parliament) supplied 6 Ministers and 4 State secretaries, and [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (21 seats) also supplied 6 Ministers and 4 State secretaries.

==Term==
===Policy===
In accordance with the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] approach to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and a [[small government]] the number of ministers and State Secretaries was reduced from the previous cabinet by merging several ministries. The [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]] was merged with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to vorm a combined [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (Netherlands)|Ministry Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation]]. The [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] was merged with the [[Ministry of Transport and Water Management (Netherlands)|Ministry of Transport and Water Management]] to form the new [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management|Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment]]. Also the portfolio of [[Public security]] was transferred from the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] to the Ministry of Justice which was renamed as the [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Ministry of Security and Justice]]. Also the position of the [[Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation (Netherlands)|Minister for Development Cooperation]], a long serving [[Minister without portfolio]] title that had been used continuously since 1965 except for a small break from 2002 until 2003 was scrapped and replaced by the return of a [[Minister without portfolio]] for Immigration and Asylum Affairs like in the previous [[First Balkenende cabinet|Cabinets Balkenende I]], [[Second Balkenende cabinet|II]] and [[Third Balkenende cabinet|III]], but this time the [[Minister without portfolio]] for Immigration and Asylum Affairs was placed in the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] instead of the [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Ministry of Security and Justice]].

===Withdrawal of support of the Party for Freedom===
Because of the financial crisis in the Netherlands and because of the rules of the [[Euro convergence criteria]] that the deficit should be maximum 3%, the [[Party leader|Leaders]] of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] [[Mark Rutte]], [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] [[Maxime Verhagen]] and the [[Party for Freedom]] [[Geert Wilders]] decided to talk with each other about new, severe austerity measures, worth about 14 billion Euro. The negotiations about the measures were held in the [[Catshuis]] and lasted 7 weeks and ended on 21 April when Geert Wilders walked out of the negotiations. The reason he gave was that the measure would negatively impact people who receive benefits from the [[Algemene Ouderdomswet|pensions law]]. Both Mark Rutte and Maxime Verhagen blamed Wilders for the failure of the negotiations. As a result, the government resigned and a new election was called.

===Composition Changes===
On 16 December 2011 [[List of Ministers of the Interior of the Netherlands|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] [[Piet Hein Donner]] (CDA) resigned after he was nominated as the new [[Vice-President of the Council of State (Netherlands)|Vice-President of the Council of State]] succeeding [[Herman Tjeenk Willink]]. He was replaced as [[List of Ministers of the Interior of the Netherlands|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] by former [[Christian Democratic Appeal|Chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] [[Liesbeth Spies]]. [[Piet Hein Donner]] as [[List of Ministers of the Interior of the Netherlands|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] was responsible for the portfolio of Integration. When he resigned the Integration portfolio was transferred to [[Minister without portfolio]] [[Gerd Leers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://nos.nl/artikel/322712-benoeming-spies-tot-minister-verwacht.html Benoeming Spies tot minister vrijdag verwacht], NOS, 15 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://nos.nl/artikel/322863-donner-naar-raad-van-state.html Donner naar Raad van State], NOS, 16 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nu.nl/politiek/2694905/spies-volgt-donner-in-kabinet.html 'Spies volgt Donner op in kabinet'], NU.nl, 16 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5110">[[File:JKH-19 Artikel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Grundrechte at Jakob Kaiser House, [[Berlin]]]]

'''Fundamental Rights in the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]''' (''German: Grundrechte'') are a set of rights guaranteed to everyone in Germany and partially to German people only through their [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Constitution, the ''Grundgesetz'']] and the constitutions of some of the [[States of Germany]]. In the Federal Constitution, the majority of the ''Grundrechte'' are contained in the first title, Articles 1 to 19 of the Grundgesetz (GG). These rights have constitutional status, binding each of the country's [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany#Constitutional institutions|constitutional institutions]]. In the event that these rights are violated and a remedy is denied by [[Judiciary of Germany|other courts]], the constitution provides for an appeal to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') (Art. 93 (1) (4a) GG).

According to this article, the Constitutional Court is entitled to hear appeals concerning not just the ''Grundrechte'' contained in Arts. 1-19, but also Arts. 20 (4), 33, 38, 101, 103 and 104. These rights are also therefore referred to as ''grundrechtsgleiche Rechte'' (rights equal to fundamental rights) or colloquially also as fundamental rights.

==Limitation==
In addition to the ''Grundrechte'', the Constitution guarantees a number of other public rights, such as the uniform application of federal law between states (Art.28 (2)(1) GG) and the independence of the church (Art. 137 (3) of the Weimar Constitution and Art. 140 GG). These however are not ''Grundrechte'' as they are not contained under the first title of the constitution or in the appeal mechanism to the Federal Constitutional Court.

There are also lists of fundamental rights in the majority of state constitutions, which vary slightly from one another but are never capable of ruling out a ''Grundrecht''. ''Landesrechte'' (i.e. rights guaranteed by state constitutions) which mirror ''Bundesrechte'' (those guaranteed by the Federal Constitution) are therefore disregarded in favour of the ''Bundesrechte''. Many state constitutions which were written after the Federal Constitution do not contain their own lists of fundamental rights at all.

==Applicability==
All the ''Grundrechte'' have a binding effect on each of the constitutional institutions, regardless of whether it is the [[Cabinet of Germany|executive]], [[Bundestag|legislature]] or [[Judiciary of Germany|judiciary]], federally or in one of the states (''Länder''). It is also irrelevant whether the state was directly or indirectly involved in the violation, whether it acted through public or private law or through legal entities under private law; public bodies are always bound by the ''Grundrechte'' (Art. 1(3) GG).

Rights under the German constitution can also be divided between universal fundamental rights (''Jedermann-Grundrechte''), which are afforded to everyone, and German fundamental rights (''Deutschengrundrechte, Staatsbürgerrechte'' or ''Deutschenrechte''), to which only Germans are entitled. The reason for the separation is largely due to democratic will and the protection of sovereignty.

The ''Deutschengrundrechte'' include the rights to [[freedom of assembly]] (Art. 8 GG), [[freedom of association]] (Art. 9 GG), [[Right of abode|freedom of abode]] (Art. 11 GG) and [[right to work|freedom to work]] (Art. 12 GG), as well as the right to vote and stand for public office. The restriction of these rights only to Germans does not just refer to German citizenship, [[German nationality law|German status]] being regulated by Art. 116 GG. While some ''Grundrechte'' apply only to Germans, there are some on which only non-Germans can rely, e.g. right to asylum (art. 16a GG). 

Some of the ''Deutschengrundrechte'' also apply for other [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] with or without residence in Germany regarding their rights to move freely within Germany or to work. Nevertheless it is disputed whether all German fundamental rights apply to them in light of the prohibition of discrimination contained in Art. 18 (1) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|TFEU treaty]]. This article requires that all citizens of the EU are given equal status and equality of protection under all legal systems in the community.

According to their contents, the ''Grundrechte'' can also be divided into freedom rights and equality rights.

==Protection==
Although the Grundgesetz might be changed with a 2/3 majority of the Bundestag, the original Fundamental Rights are protected by article 19. Modification on the first 18 articles is only allowed as long as the essential contents remain unchanged.

Identity-based security is an approach to control access to a digital product or service based on the authenticated identity of an individual. This allows organizations to grant access to specific users to access a variety of digital services using the same credentials, ensuring the accurate match between what users are entitled to and what they actually receive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10duke.com/file/whitepapers/10Duke-Whitepaper-Pillars_for_effective_Personalisation.pdf |format=PDF |title=Identity and Access Management: Pillars for effective Personalisation |publisher=''10duke.com'' |date=2016-02-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705065947/http://www.10duke.com/file/whitepapers/10Duke-Whitepaper-Pillars_for_effective_Personalisation.pdf |archivedate=2017-07-05 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while also permitting other access constraints such as company, device, location and application type ([[Attribute-based access control|attributes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gigaom.com/report/identity-based-security-and-the-cloud/ |title= Analyst Report: Identity-based security and the cloud |last=Linthicum |first=David |publisher=[[Gigaom]] |date=2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624051107/https://gigaom.com/report/identity-based-security-and-the-cloud/ |archivedate=2016-06-24 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Underpinning the identity-based security approach is the Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://csrc.nist.gov/Glossary/?term=4708 |title=Glossary: Identity-Based Access Control |work=Computer Security Resource Center |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (or identity-based licensing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10duke.com/resources/blog/2016-02-02:What_is_identity-based_licensing%3F.html |title=What is identity-based licensing? |publisher=''10duke.com'' |date=2016-02-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114103751/http://www.10duke.com/resources/blog/2016-02-02:What_is_identity-based_licensing%3F.html |archivedate=2017-11-14 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.adobe.com/en_US/fmrms/1.0.1/overview.pdf#G4.1520496 |format=PDF |title=Adobe Flash Media Rights Management Server 1.0 Overview for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and UNIX |authorlink=Adobe Systems |work=Workflows - Identity-based licensing |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]] |date=2008-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829230756/https://help.adobe.com/en_US/fmrms/1.0.1/overview.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-29 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) concept.

[[NIST]] defines identity-based security policies as policies "based on the identities and/or attributes of the object (system resource) being accessed and of the subject (user, group of users, process, or device) requesting access."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-33.pdf SP 800-33 - Underlying Technical Models for Information Technology Security], Gary Stoneburner, p. 21, December 2001, ''NIST Computer Security Publications - NIST Special Publications (SPs)'', [[doi:10.6028/NIST.SP.800-33]]. Retrieved 4 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the advantages of the identity-based security approach include the ability to exercise very fine-grained control over who is allowed to use which services and which functions those users can perform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=102217 |title=.NET Identity and Principal Objects |last=Enrico |first=Sabbadin |work=informIT |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |date=2003-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114114047/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=102217 |archivedate=2017-11-14 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is device-agnostic, offering the possibility to enforce access control policy across a variety of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://esj.com/Articles/2012/07/16/BYOD-and-Identity-Based-Security.aspx?Page=2 |title=Q&amp;A: Addressing BYOD with Identity-Based Security |last=Powell |first=James E. |publisher=Enterprise Systems Journal |date=2012-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114113119/https://esj.com/articles/2012/07/16/byod-and-identity-based-security.aspx |archivedate=2017-11-14 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Identity-based security models ==

=== Cyberoam’s approach ===

The identity-based security network security approach put forward by [[Cyberoam]] includes security components that provides visibility and control over user activity in a particular [[Computer network|network]]. It offers a network security system which includes a user's [[identity management|human identity]] as a part of the [[firewall (computer)|firewall]] rule matching criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberoam.com/downloads/Whitepaper/CyberoamLayer8Technology.pdf  Identity based security], ''cyberoam.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept includes treating a user's identity as the 8th Layer (also known as the human layer{{cn|date=November 2017}}) in the [[Protocol_stack|network protocol stack]], thus attaching user identity to security while authenticating, authorizing and auditing the network. This takes a different step from conventional security appliances, which bind security to [[IP address|IP-address]]es. Such an approach allows organisations to create [[computer security policy|security policies]] that align to users and groups rather than to IP addresses which ultimately gives them more precise control over who can access the network—and what they can access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/routers/800-series-routers/at_a_glance_c45-675579.pdf Identity-Based Firewall Security], ''cisco.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity-based security prevents systems against address [[IP address spoofing|spoofing]] attacks by combining the point of [[encryption]], [[authentication]], and [[access control]] into a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arubanetworks.com/pdf/solutions/identity-based-security.pdf Identity-Based Security], ''arubanetworks.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latvian Farmers' Union''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas Zemnieku savienība}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lzs.lv/par-mums|title=Latvijas Zemnieku savienības programma (Programme of the Latvian Farmers' Union)|last=|first=|date=2018-03-24|website=lzs.lv|language=lv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, LZS) is a [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[agrarianism|agrarian]] [[List of political parties in Latvia|political party]] in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref name="Nordsieck" /&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1917, the party was the most influential [[conservative]] party in Latvia in the period from [[Latvian War of Independence|Independence]] in 1918 until the [[self-coup]] [[1934 Latvian coup d'état|led by Kārlis Ulmanis in 1934]], and the second most popular party overall after the [[Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]]. [[Kārlis Ulmanis|Ulmanis]], who was a member of the party, banned all political parties after his coup including the LZS. As Latvia was subsequently [[Occupations of Latvia|occupied]] during the course of the [[Second World War]], the party was dormant until it reformed in 1990 when [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|Latvia regained its independence]]. Immediately after the restoration of independence, there existed several groups competing at elections to claim the legacy of the pre-war LZS.  Since 2002 it has been part of the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] (''ZZS'') coalition, along with the [[Latvian Green Party]]. The coalition now includes [[For Latvia and Ventspils]] and the [[Liepāja Party]], who have cooperation agreements with the party allowing their members to be elected to the [[Saeima]] on the list of the Union of Greens and Farmers. The coalition faction is currently the third largest in the Saeima and the LZS has 9 out of the 21 seats it holds. Since [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Latvia)|May 2014]] the party has had one [[member of the European Parliament]], [[Iveta Grigule]], who sits with the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats]] group, having previously sat with the [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] group and as a [[Non-Inscrits|Non-Attached Member]].&lt;ref name="Stray MEP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8887">'''MuckRock''' is a United States-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which assists anyone in filing governmental requests for information through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], then publishes the returned information on its website and encourages journalism around it.

==History==
MuckRock was founded by Michael Morisy and Mitchell Kotler, graduates of [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedom.press/about/blogger/michael-morisy Michael Morisy], Freedom of the Press Foundation, Retrieved 28 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The site's beta version went online in May 2010, and was part of the ''[[Boston Globe]]''’s GlobeLab incubator program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cjr.org/behind_the_news/qa_michael_morisy_cofounder_of_muckrock.php Q&amp;A: Michael Morisy, Co-Founder of MuckRock], ''Columbia Journalism Review'', 13 February 2012, Retrieved 28 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; MuckRock was granted a 501(c)(3) non-profit status by the [[IRS]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/jun/15/muckrock-granted-501c3-non-profit-status/ MuckRock granted non-profit status], MuckRock, Retrieved 14 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2018, MuckRock announced they would be merging with [[DocumentCloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2018/jun/11/muckrock-documentcloud-merge-announcement/ |title=MuckRock and DocumentCloud merge to build tools for a more informed society |last=Morisy |first=Michael |last2=Pilhofer |first2=Aron |date=June 11, 2018 |website=Muckrock.org |publisher=MuckRock |access-date=June 11, 2018 |quote= We are thrilled to announce that DocumentCloud and MuckRock are merging.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Filing requests for information through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] has been described as confusing and tedious, despite the intent that the process be public and the service available to all American citizens.&lt;ref name="Faraone"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/111660-muckrock-city/ |title=MuckRock City - Media -- Dont Quote Me |first=Chris |last=Faraone |work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; MuckRock partially automates the process with an interface designed to make the filing of requests easier.&lt;ref name="Faraone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2010/12/muckrock-automates-government-records.html |title=MuckRock automates government records requests - Boston Business Journal |first=Lynette F. |last=Cornell |work=bizjournals.com |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2010/12/02/a-%e2%80%9clegal-wikileaks%e2%80%9d-competing-in-knight-news-challenge |title=A "Legal WikiLeaks" Competing in Knight News Challenge |first=Maggie |last=Georgieva  |work=[[BostInno]] |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, MuckRock acts as a middleman for processing the requests, so when a user makes a request through MuckRock, it is the staff of MuckRock who themselves make the request.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/10/muckrock-makes-foia-requests-easy-but-will-reporters-use-it/ |title=MuckRock makes FOIA requests easy, but will reporters use it?  |first=Justin |last=Ellis |work=niemanlab.org |publisher=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When MuckRock makes the request, they note and timestamp it on their website as proof of it being made.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; When a reply comes to the request, MuckRock publishes and timestamps it openly so that everyone can see the reply and when it was made.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;

==Information shared==
In 2010 MuckRock received a notice that the government had sent MuckRock information about the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] which was secret and that MuckRock must cease publishing it or its staff would face fines and jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/11/11/state_tells_man_he_may_be_jailed_for_releasing_data/ |title=State tells man he may be jailed for releasing data - The Boston Globe |first=Noah |last=Bierman |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=11 November 2010  |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[Boston, MA|Boston]] |issn=0743-1791 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.telegram.com/article/20101113/NEWS/11130325/1020 |title=SNAP shot |author=no author listed |work=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]] |date=13 November 2010 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state later said that it would not jail MuckRock staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/11/12/state_cools_threat_to_blogger_over_food_stamp_post/ |title=State cools threat to blogger over food stamp post |first=Jonathan |last=Saltzman |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=12 November 2010  |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[Boston, MA|Boston]] |issn=0743-1791 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boston Police Department]] suspended an [[automatic number plate recognition]] program because of privacy concerns raised after a MuckRock request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/12/14/boston-police-suspend-use-high-tech-licence-plate-readers-amid-privacy-concerns/FUrus0ktxAt51sAdmLKpPM/story.html?rss_id=Top+Stories |title=Boston Police suspend use of high-tech licence plate readers amid privacy concerns - News Local Massachusetts |first=Shawn |last=Musgrave |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=13 December 2013  |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[Boston, MA|Boston]] |issn=0743-1791 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/12/boston-police-indefinitely-suspends-license-plate-reader-program/ |title=Boston Police indefinitely suspends license plate reader program &amp;#124; Ars Technica |first=Cyrus |last=Farvivar |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MuckRock made numerous requests to various United States state and federal agencies regarding their work with [[Booz Allen Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="Masnick"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130930/16534724704/fbi-wants-more-than-270000-to-respond-to-foia-request-about-booz-allen.shtml |title=FBI Wants More Than $270,000 To Respond To FOIA Request About Booz Allen |first=Mike |last=Masnick |work=[[Techdirt]] |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was a bill for USD $270,000 to fulfill the request.&lt;ref name="Masnick"/&gt;

MuckRock's request to the [[New York City Police Department]] for their guidebook on responding to FOIA requests was denied due to it being a confidential document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boingboing.net/2014/03/16/nypd-claims-its-freedom-of-inf.html#more-292385 |title=NYPD claims its Freedom of Information Act policy is a secret 'attorney-client communications'|first=Cory |last=Doctorow |work=boingboing.net |date=16 March 2014 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In June 2014 MuckRock sued the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act for "consistently ignoring deadlines, refusing to work with requesters, and capriciously rejecting even routine requests for what should be clearly public information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boingboing.net/2014/06/11/transparency-journalism-site-m.html |title=Transparency journalism site MuckRock sues CIA |first=Xeni |last=Jardin |authorlink=Xeni Jardin |work=boingboing.net |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has made public records requests with MuckRock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/eff-and-muckrock-have-filed-over-200-public-records-requests-surveillance-drones |title=EFF and MuckRock Have Filed Over 200 Records Requests On Drones And The Results Are Pouring In |first=Trevor |last=Timm |work=eff.org |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6630">The '''National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care''' (NIGB) was established in the [[United Kingdom]] under section 157&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/14/section/157 Section 157 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Health and Social Care Act 2008, with effect from October 2008, with a range of advisory functions relating to [[information governance]].  From January 2009, the NIGB also gained functions under section 251&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/41/section/251 Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; of the NHS Act 2006 which had previously been held by the [[Patient Information Advisory Group]] (PIAG) until its abolition. These functions were to advise the [[Secretary of State for Health]] on the use of powers to set aside the common law duty of confidentiality in [[England]] where identifiable patient information is needed and where consent is not practicable. From 1 April 2013, the NIGB's functions for monitoring and improving information governance practice have transferred to the [[Care Quality Commission]], which established a National Information Governance Committee to oversee this work. Functions relating to section 251 of the [[National Health Service Act 2006|NHS Act 2006]] (access to people’s personal and confidential information for research purposes) were transferred to the [[Health Research Authority]]'s Confidentiality Advisory Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130513181011/http://www.nigb.nhs.uk/ Webarchive page of the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms of reference==

The key functions of the NIGB (excerpted from the legislation) were:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; to monitor the practice followed by relevant bodies in relation to the processing of relevant information;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; to keep the [[Secretary of State for Health]], and such bodies as the [[Secretary of State for Health]] may designate by direction, informed about the practice being followed by relevant bodies in relation to the processing of relevant information;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; to publish guidance on the practice to be followed in relation to the processing of relevant information;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; to advise the [[Secretary of State for Health]] on particular matters relating to the processing of relevant information by any person; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; to advise persons who process relevant information on such matters relating to the processing of relevant information by them as the [[Secretary of State for Health]] may from time to time designate by direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The definition of “relevant information” in the legislation covers patient information, any other information obtained or generated in the course of the provision of the health service, and any information obtained or generated in the course of the exercise by a local social services authority in [[England]] of its adult social services functions.

==Ethics and Confidentiality Committee==

Some areas of NIGB functions (d) and (e) above had been delegated to the NIGB’s Ethics and Confidentiality Committee (ECC).  These functions primarily related to applications to use identifiable patient information without consent, in specific circumstances within the bounds of section 251 of the NHS Act 2006.  These applications, which had been considered by PIAG before the NIGB, passed on to the [[Health Research Authority]]'s Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) on 1 April 2013.

==Care Record Development Board==

The NIGB had also replaced the Care Record Development Board (CRDB),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/crdb Care Record Development Board archive page hosted by NHS Connecting for Health]&lt;/ref&gt; which had closed in September 2007. The NIGB had subsequently maintained the NHS Care Record Guarantee which was originally developed by the CRDB and developed a companion Social Care Record Guarantee.

==Members==

The NIGB had consisted of a Chair, a number of Public Members appointed by the NHS Appointments Commission, and a number of Representative Members appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Health]] from a range of stakeholder organisations.  Representatives of several other stakeholder organisations had served as Corresponding Advisers to the NIGB but had not typically attended meetings.  Regular observers at meetings had included representatives from the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] and the devolved UK administrations.

The ECC had consisted of a Chair and a number of Members, all of whom had been appointed by the NIGB with advice from an NHS Appointments Commission approved independent assessor.  The ECC Chair and two ECC Members had also been NIGB Members.

Between 1 June 2011 and 31 March 2013 Dame [[Fiona Caldicott]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/newsroom/news/nigbchair Appointment of Fiona Caldicott as new NIGB Chair - press release on NHS Connecting for Health website, June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; had been Chair of the NIGB, succeeding [[Harry Cayton]] who had chaired the NIGB since its inception.

==Geography==

Members of the NIGB and ECC had been widely distributed nationally but had attended meetings at the NIGB office.  Since September 2011, this had been based at [[Skipton House]], London SE1.  The NIGB’s staff team had been predominantly based at this office.

==Abolition==

As a result of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]] the NIGB was abolished with effect from 1 April 2013. The functions delegated to the ECC with respect to research transferred to the [[Health Research Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/2012/12/17/further-update-on-transfer-of-s251-function-from-nigb-to-hra/ Transfer of s251 function from NIGB to HRA]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NHS Commissioning Board]] is now responsible for providing advice and guidance to NHS bodies. Other functions were transferred to the National Information Governance Committee hosted by the [[Care Quality Commission]].

'''Nikolai Frantsevich Danielson''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Фра́нцевич Дание́льсон}}; also known as N-on, Nik-on, Nikolai-on; 7 February 1844, [[Moscow]]{{spaced ndash}}13 July 1918, [[Petrograd]]) was a Russian socio-political figure, economist, publicist, one of the theoreticians of [[liberal populism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hrono.ru/biograf/bio_d/danielson.php&lt;/ref&gt; He is also famous for translation of [[Das Kapital]] by Marx, and being a writer on Russian economic development.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=7NgcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=Nikolai+Frantsevich+Danielson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a0ZQ1C-doM&amp;sig=_Yx7MTHnNfoKSi7apQkh3ZxHUdA&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLlunq9YLZAhWGCSwKHcsYAsEQ6AEIZjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nikolai%20Frantsevich%20Danielson&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He graduated from [[Commercial School]] in [[St. Petersburg]], and later attended lectures in St. Petersburg's university.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrono.ru/biograf/bio_d/danielson.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s Danielson worked at the St Petersburg Mutual Credit Association. Mutual credit associations were then often associated with utopian and social reform politics, and during that period, he became involved in radical political circles and took interest in one of the populist ''[[narodnik]]'' movement.

==Economic Writings and Translation of ''Das Kapital''==

In 1872, Danielson published the first Russian translation of volume 1 of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' by [[Karl Marx]]. The translation had been initiated by [[Mikhail Bakunin]] before Bakunin's break with Marx and had been continued by [[German Lopatin]]. While completing the translation, Danielson initiated a correspondence with Karl Marx and Friedrich [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], which continued for the rest of their lives. Danielson also translated volumes 2 and 3 of ''Das Kapital'', which were published in 1885 and 1896. In 1880 Danielson published the article "Studies of Our Post-Reform Economy" in issue 10 of the journal ''Slovo''. Marx, who had taught himself Russian, commended it and encouraged Danielson to expand it into a book, which Danielson subsequently did. That book, bearing the same title, appeared in 1893. The book and the article on which it was based contained extensive statistical material on Russia's economic development.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=SXm9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Nikolai+Frantsevich+Danielson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oeEJA0IK-L&amp;sig=G4yU7O8tVPdmT7CuobqFQwk8DV0&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLlunq9YLZAhWGCSwKHcsYAsEQ6AEIYTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Nikolai%20Frantsevich%20Danielson&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Marxism==

Danielson regarded himself as a [[Marxist]], but was criticized by the self-proclaimed "orthodox" Marxists [[Georgi Plekhanov]],  [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Peter Struve]], among others. Danielson's critics grouped him with populist writers like [[Vasily Vorontsov]] and [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]]. But whereas Vorontsov claimed that the development of industrial capitalism in Russia was impossible for lack of markets and Mikhailovsky thought that it was possible but undesirable and preventable, Danielson argued that capitalist industrialisation was already well under way in Russia by the 1890s. The "orthodox" Marxists agreed with him in this. However, in the 1890s, Plekhanov, Lenin and their associates argued that capitalism in Russia must follow essentially the same course as capitalist development in Western Europe. Danielson believed that the "capitalist stage" of development could be foreshortened in Russia, since Russia's late development would allow it to adopt the latest western industrial technology without having to undergo the social evolution that had first produced it in the West. This theory went back to A.I. Herzen and N.G. Chernyshevsky and strongly influenced the theoreticians of the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (PSR), such as [[Victor Chernov]]. It also anticipated [[Leon Trotsky]]'s theory of "uneven and combined development". Danielson argued that capitalism was essentially dispensable for further economic development, and that industrialisation could continue on the basis of a socialist economy. Like the ''narodniks'', he saw the surviving peasant village communes as potential nuclei for a socialist organisation of the Russian economy. Plekhanov and Lenin denounced this as dangerous utopianism.

==Political Involvement==

In the early 1900s, Danielson was briefly involved with the Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Party, but he did not play a very active role in it, and he withdrew after the ''"Azef affair"'' of 1908. ([[Yevno Azef]] was a prominent leader of the PSR and the chief of its terrorist organisation; in 1908 he was unmasked as a double agent for the Okhrana, the secret police.) Danielson seemed to have played no role in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]].

Shah used Octagon Press to increase the availability of information on [[Afghanistan]], aware that there would be a need for such information after the country's recent history.&lt;ref name="DTOB" /&gt; Two of his books, ''Darkest England'' (1987) and ''The Natives are Restless'' (1988), "traced affinities between the English and Afghan peoples".&lt;ref name="OISTI" /&gt;

For many years Octagon Press sold the academic monographs published by the London [[Institute for Cultural Research]], now sold directly by the ICR. A number of the classical works have been published with the aid of the Sufi Trust.

The Octagon Press Limited was registered in the United Kingdom as a limited liability company at Companies House on 10 January 1972.&lt;ref name="ukdata"&gt;[https://www.ukdata.com/company-credit-reports/OCTAGON-PRESS-LIMITED-(THE).html Company details of Octagon Press Limited (The) at ukdata.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, it was stated on the official web site that "The Octagon Press announces that it is to cease from trading in its current form. The works of Idries Shah will henceforth be represented by ISF Publishing, a part of [[The Idries Shah Foundation]]. Existing editions of Octagon Press titles will no longer be available. Idries Shah's corpus of work will be relaunched in entirety in new printed and eBook editions."&lt;ref name="Octagon-Ceased-2014" /&gt;

==Relief efforts==
Idries Shah set up a charitable agency, Afghan Relief&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Afghan Relief was registered with the UK Charity Commission (no. 289910). It was founded 25 July 1984 and ceased to exist and was removed from the registry on 3 October 2002. See [http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/RemovedCharityMain.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=289910&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Charity Commission record].

Its aim was to provide medical, educational and other aid to refugees&lt;ref name="OISTI" /&gt; and Shah wrote books to assist in the operation, some of which are published by Octagon. The relief effort is also now carried out in association with The Institute for the Study Of Human Knowledge (ISHK) and their children's imprint, Hoopoe Books.

The oil and gas industry operates in countries throughout the world in accordance with a number of different types of agreements.  These agreements generally fall into one of four categories (or a combination of the categories): [[risk agreement (oil and gas)|risk agreements]], [[concession (contract)|concessions]], [[production sharing agreement]]s (PSAs, also known as production sharing contracts, PSCs) and service contracts. 

Traditional concession agreements pre-1940 were granted for large areas, sometimes the whole country e.g. Iraq. Those grants were for long term (50 to 99 years). The IOC had full discretion and control to explore and whether or
not to develop a particular field. 

This caused developments to be delayed, postponed or the expected investment did not immediately materialise. This was clear against host governments interest. The contracts did not foreseen any relinquishment of non explored areas. Further more traditional concession agreements granted petroleum "in situ" to the IOC, with market and pricing powers. The royalties were flat or fixed for per unity rates and sometimes credited against income taxes. There were no or low signature bonus and sometimes no income taxation. Those terms were often "frozen" for the life of the agreement.

After the Second World War host governments relocated economic rents with the aim of increasing passive profit sharing. Towards the 1960s and 1970s governments started to demand more active profit sharing through NOC Joint Ventures Participation.

Participation agreements: the NOC is "Carried" by an International Oil Company (IOC). The NOC burdens the IOC by not fully compensate the IOC for the risks assumed during exploration or to make a commercial discovery. The IOC faces the full losses and thus needs bigger success to compensate depending on NOC's share on the joint venture. However, the IOC benefit for example by having the NOC as partner when faced with nationalistic treats.

'''Paris Economy Pact''' was an international economic agreement reached at the '''Paris Economic Conference''' held from 14 June 1916 in [[Paris, France]].  The meeting, held at the height of [[World War I]], included representatives of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]: [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RXgAAAAAYAAJ William S. Culbertson, ''Commercial Policy and the War'', The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, 1919, pp. 137-38.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pact was intended to isolate the [[Central Powers]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]].  The Allied Powers envisioned isolating the [[Central Powers]] through trade sanctions after the war.  A standing body, the ''Comité Permanent International d'Action Économique'', based in Paris, was established to monitor the implementation of the pact.

This pact was of great concern to the United States government, led by the [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]], which saw the continued fragmentation of Europe to be a risk for continued conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s6dSIuBcx1IC David M. Kennedy, ''Over Here: The First World War and American Society'', 2004, p. 308.]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] asked the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Paris to monitor the proceedings (the United States, having not yet entered the war, was not part of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]).  The issue of central concern to the United States was that this pact included schemes for subsidization and government ownership of manufacturing enterprises and the division of European markets for the pact participants.

The outcome of the 1916 Paris Economic Conference foreshadowed the conflict between the United States and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqj-oHp4KsgC Elizabeth Glaser, ''The Making of the Economic Peace'' in The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment after 75 Years, 1998, p. 374.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The past concern of the U.S. government with this Pact are fossilized even today in the [[United States Code]], in Title 19, Section 1332(c), which gives the [[U.S. International Trade Commission]] the "power to investigate the Paris Economy Pact and similar organizations and arrangements in Europe."

{{undue|reason=Not only applied in Austria, but e.g. also in Switzerland|date=October 2016}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}
'''''Proporz''''' ({{IPA-de|pʁoˈpɔʁts|lang}}, from ''[[wikt:Proportion#German|Proportionalität]]'') is a long-standing doctrine within the [[Politics of Austria|politics of the second Austrian republic]] that government posts be allocated to parties in proportion to their electoral support. However, recent developments, both internal and external, have arguably weakened the influence of the Proporz system in Austrian politics.

== The underlying principle ==
Under the Proporz system, the posts of [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] [[Political minister|Minister]]s are filled by [[political party|party members]] as closely as possible in [[ratio|proportion]] to the [[Voting|vote]]s won by their respective parties in the general elections.  Furthermore, the particular portfolios are selected by each party on the basis of its constituency or any perceived ideological [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] to them.

Thus, for example, the portfolio of Minister for Labour and Social Affairs was nearly always held by a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ), while the conservative [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP), with traditionally strong support from [[farmer]]s, took the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment, &amp; Water.

In this basic form, the principle would not be exclusive to Austria, but would be an element of many countries which have [[coalition government]]s.

== Origins ==
The Proporz system arose out of the need for balanced, [[consensus|consensual governance]] in the early years of Austria's second republic. At the time, the nation was consumed in an effort to rebuild the country after the devastation of [[World War II]]. Moreover, the nation was still haunted by the specter of the ideological factionalism which had characterized [[First Austrian Republic|Austria's first republic]] (cf. the events of the [[Austrian Civil War]]).  Thus, the doctrine of Proporz is intimately linked to the idea of the [[grand coalition]], in which the major political parties, in the case of post-war Austria the SPÖ and the ÖVP, share in the government.

The memories of the factionalism that characterised the First Republic were so strong that even after the ÖVP won an absolute majority in the first postwar election, in [[Austrian legislative election, 1945|1945]], it immediately sought a coalition with the SPÖ.  Even when one major party governed alone (as the ÖVP did from 1966 to 1970 and the SPÖ did from 1970 to 1983), the other party was never really shut out of decision-making.

== Degeneration and reform ==
However, the doctrine was later charged with having degenerated into a system of patronage and [[nepotism]] pervading too many aspects of Austrian life. Positions down to minor [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] posts were commonly allocated by party membership. The reaches of Proporz went as far as the educational system and even the banking business, in which political parties and municipalities were traditionally tightly involved.

Resentment of the system among large reaches of the population had become widespread by the late 1990s, and it is believed that [[Jörg Haider]]'s criticism of Proporz gained him the support of many centrist voters who were not necessarily supporters of his [[nationalism|nationalist]] and anti-immigration rhetoric.

When his then-party, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ), joined the government in 2000, many were expecting a discontinuation of the system in all fields except government itself. However, few people today would claim that this has happened. Haider's followers contend that reforms were stymied by the resistance of the FPÖ's coalition partner, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). His detractors hold that Haider had never had a true reform in mind, but merely endeavoured to heave members of his own political disposition into positions of power (a practice referred to as ''umfärben'' in German, which roughly translates as 're-coloring').

It is probably fair to say that the major impetus for the rescaling of Austria's system of Proporz was of an external nature. Austria's membership in the [[European Union]] reduced the degree to which government is allowed to interfere in private businesses such as telecommunications and banking, where Proporz had been all-pervading.

A diversified media and the possibilities of modern information technology also hold the government to higher standards of transparency and accountability. Above all, there has been a sea change in the public's attitude to the practice and its willingness to confront it.

In conclusion, it can be argued that while they have not altogether vanished from the politics of Austria, the ideas of Proporz are much less pervasive today than they were only a decade ago.

'''Racial nationalism''' is an [[ideology]] that advocates a [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] definition of [[national identity]]. Racial nationalism seeks to preserve a given race through policies such as banning [[Miscegenation|race mixing]] and the [[immigration]] of other races.

The '''Red Terror''' in Hungary ({{lang-hu|vörösterror}}) was a period of heightened political tension and suppression in 1919 during the four-month period of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], primarily towards [[anti-communists|anti-communist]] forces. The [[communist party]] and [[communist]] policies had considerable popular support among the proletarian masses of large industrial centers - especially in Budapest - where the working class represented a higher ratio of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Okey|title=Eastern Europe 1740-1985: Feudalism to Communism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|page=162|ISBN=9781134886876|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8qIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=%22bitterly+unpopular+in+the+countryside%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS9vCVw6DbAhVJaFAKHWbVDXkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bitterly%20unpopular%20in%20the%20countryside%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hungarian countryside, the authority of the government was often nonexistent, serving as a launch-point for anti-communist insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Lukacs]]|title=Budapest 1900: A Historical Portrait of a City and Its Culture|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=1990|page=2012|ISBN=9780802132505|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=ajeNDt-QsyIC&amp;q=%22over+the+Hungarian+countryside+was+often+nonexistent%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22over%20the%20Hungarian%20countryside%20was%20often%20nonexistent%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government followed the Soviet solution: the party established its revolutionary terror groups (such as the infamous "[[Lenin Boys]]") to "overcome the obstacles" of the worker's revolution. It received its name in reference to the [[Red Terror]] of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. It was soon followed by the [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] against communists, industrial workers and Jews.

==History==

In March 1919, the [[Hungarian Communist Party|Party of Communists in Hungary]], in alliance with the [[Social Democratic Party of Hungary]], gained control of the government of Hungary after president [[Mihály Károlyi]] stepped aside. Soon after, a coup by Party of Communists in Hungary, led by [[Béla Kun]], established the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

[[Tibor Szamuely]]&lt;ref&gt;Szamuely Tibor in 20th of April 1919. said on a speech in Győr: "Now the power is in our hands. Who wants the old reign to come back, they should be hanged quickly. The one of this kind must be neck-bitten. The victory of Hungarian proletariat till this time required no serious numbers of victims. But now there is the need of bloodshed. We mustn't be afraid of blood, the blood is like steel: strengthens the hearth and strengthens the proletarian class. Blood will make us gigantean. [...] We will exterminate the whole bourgeoisie, if we have to."{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in the pages of the ''Vörös Újság'' (''Red News''): "Everywhere [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] run about and swagger; beat them down! Beat their heads where you find them! If [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] were to gain the upper hand for even a single hour, there will be no mercy for any proletarian. Before they stifle the revolution, suffocate them in their own blood!"&lt;ref&gt;''Vörös Újság'', 11 February 1919&lt;/ref&gt; With their support, [[József Cserny]] organised a group of some 200 individuals known as "Lenin Boys" (''Lenin-fiúk''), whose intention was to uncover "counter-revolutionary" activities in the Hungarian countryside. Similar groups operated within Budapest.

Two months after gaining power, the government attempted to restore Hungary to its [[Kingdom of Hungary|pre-World War I boundaries]], first by recapturing parts of present-day [[Slovakia]], and then attempting to recapture Transylvania from Romania. These unsuccessful recapture attempts, as well as the inefficacy of the government during the war period, lowered the popular support for the Communist Party, and on June 24 the Social Democratic Party attempted a coup to take control of the government. This attempted coup failed, and in its wake a series of reprisal arrests and lootings occurred in retaliation against the Social Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vjrktf.hu/carus/honisme/ho030400.htm Honismeret] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102054519/http://www.vjrktf.hu/carus/honisme/ho030400.htm |date=2007-11-02 }} 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}[http://kalocsa.hit.hu/Lap22222.htm A modernizacia kora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021133648/http://kalocsa.hit.hu/Lap22222.htm |date=2007-10-21 }} 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hungarian Soviet Republic''. Studia Historica. Vol. 131. Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. Budapest, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] ended in the first week of August 1919, when Romanian forces pushed all the way into Budapest. Kun went into exile in Russia; Szamuely fled to Austria but was captured and killed there. József Cserny was arrested and tried in November 1919; the Hungarian Bar Association refused to defend him at trial, so a lawyer was appointed by the court.&lt;ref&gt;"Magyar Reds On Trial," ''New York Times'', November 27, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; He was executed in December.

As was common in the political unrest of the 20th century, the Red Terror was answered by a wave of counter-reprisals once the Party of Communists leadership fled.

{{Hatnote|This article covers only the ideology of republicanism.}}
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
'''Republicanism''' is a [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] centred on citizenship in a [[state (polity)|state]] organized as a [[republic]] under which the people hold [[popular sovereignty]]. Many countries are "republics" in the sense that they are not [[Monarchy|monarchies]].
 
The word "republic" derives from the Latin noun-phrase ''[[res publica]]'', which referred to the system of government that emerged in the 6th century BCE following the expulsion of the [[King of Rome|kings from Rome]] by [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus|Collatinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer N. S. Sellers. ''American Republicanism: Roman Ideology in the United States Constitution''. (New York University Press, 1994. p. 71.)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This form of government in the [[Roman Republic|Roman state]] collapsed in the latter part of the 1st century BCE, giving way to what was a monarchy in form, if not in name. Republics recurred subsequently, with, for example, [[Republic of Florence|Renaissance Florence]] or [[Commonwealth of England|early modern Britain]]. The concept of a republic became a powerful force in Britain's [[North America]]n colonies, where it contributed to the [[American Revolution]]. In Europe, it gained enormous influence through the [[French Revolution]] and through the [[French First Republic|First French Republic]] of 1792–1804.

==Historical development of republicanism==
===Classical antecedents===
====Ancient Greece====
In [[Ancient Greece]], several philosophers and historians analyzed and described elements we now recognize as [[classical republicanism]]. Traditionally, the Greek concept of "[[politeia]]" was rendered into Latin as res publica.  Consequently, political theory until relatively recently often used republic in the general sense of "regime". There is no single written expression or definition from this era that exactly corresponds with a modern understanding of the term "republic" but most of the essential features of the modern definition are present in the works of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Polybius]]. These include theories of [[mixed government]] and of [[civic virtue]]. For example, in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato places great emphasis on the importance of civic virtue (aiming for the good) together with personal virtue ('just man') on the part of the ideal rulers. Indeed, in Book V, Plato asserts that until rulers have the nature of philosophers (Socrates) or philosophers become the rulers, there can be no civic peace or happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics ancient and modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Ancient Greek [[city-states]] such as [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] have been classified as "[[classical republic]]s", because they featured extensive participation by the citizens in legislation and political decision-making. Aristotle considered [[Carthage]] to have been a republic as it had a political system similar to that of some of the Greek cities, notably Sparta, but avoided some of the defects that affected them.

====Ancient Rome====
Both [[Livy]], a Roman historian, and [[Plutarch]], who is noted for his biographies and moral essays, described how Rome had developed its legislation, notably the transition from a ''kingdom'' to a ''republic'', by following the example of the Greeks. Some of this history, composed more than 500 years after the events, with scant written sources to rely on, may be fictitious reconstruction.

The Greek historian [[Polybius]], writing in the mid-2nd century BCE, emphasized (in Book 6) the role played by the [[Roman Republic]] as an institutional form in the dramatic rise of Rome's hegemony over the Mediterranean. Polybius exerted a great influence on [[Cicero]] as he wrote his politico-philosophical works in the 1st century BCE. In one of these works, ''[[De re publica]]'', Cicero linked the Roman concept of ''res publica'' to the Greek ''politeia''.

The modern term "republic", despite its derivation, is not synonymous with the Roman ''[[res publica]]''. Among the several meanings of the term ''res publica'', it is most often translated "republic" where the Latin expression refers to the Roman state, and its form of government, between the era of the Kings and the era of the Emperors. This Roman Republic would, by a modern understanding of the word, still be defined as a true republic, even if not coinciding entirely. Thus, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers saw the Roman Republic as an ideal system because it included features like a systematic [[separation of powers]].

Romans still called their state "Res Publica" in the era of the early emperors because, on the surface, the organization of the state had been preserved by the first emperors without significant alteration. Several offices from the Republican era, held by individuals, were combined under the control of a single person. These changes became permanent, and gradually conferred sovereignty on the Emperor.

Cicero's description of the ideal state, in ''De re Publica'', does not equate to a modern-day "republic"; it is more like [[enlightened absolutism]]. His philosophical works were influential when Enlightenment philosophers such as [[Voltaire]] developed their political concepts.

In its classical meaning, a republic was any stable well-governed political community. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] identified three forms of government: [[democracy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[monarchy]].  First Plato and Aristotle, and then Polybius and Cicero, held that the ideal republic is a [[Mixed government|mixture]] of these three forms of government. The writers of the Renaissance embraced this notion.

Cicero expressed reservations concerning the republican form of government. While in his ''theoretical'' works he defended monarchy, or at least a mixed monarchy/oligarchy, in his own political life, he generally opposed men, like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Augustus|Octavian]], who were trying to realise such ideals. Eventually, that opposition led to his death and Cicero can be seen as a victim of his own Republican ideals.

[[Tacitus]], a contemporary of Plutarch, was not concerned with whether a form of government could be analyzed as a "republic" or a "monarchy".&lt;ref&gt;see for example ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann]]''. IV, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; He analyzed how the powers accumulated by the early [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] were all given by a State that was still notionally a republic. Nor was the Roman Republic "forced" to give away these powers: it did so freely and reasonably, certainly in [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]]' case, because of his many services to the state, freeing it from [[civil war]]s and disorder.

Tacitus was one of the first to ask whether such powers were given to the head of state because the citizens wanted to give them, or whether they were given for other reasons (for example, because one had a [[imperial cult|deified ancestor]]). The latter case led more easily to abuses of power. In Tacitus' opinion, the trend away from a true republic was ''irreversible'' only when [[Tiberius]] established power, shortly after Augustus' death in 14 CE (much later than most historians place the start of the Imperial form of government in Rome). By this time, too many principles defining some powers as "untouchable" had been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann]]''. I–VI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance republicanism===
In Europe, republicanism was revived in the late [[Middle Ages]] when a number of states, which arose from [[medieval commune]]s, embraced a republican system of government.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine political thought and the Atlantic republican tradition'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; These were generally small but wealthy trading states in which the merchant class had risen to prominence. Haakonssen notes that by the Renaissance, Europe was divided, such that those states controlled by a landed elite were monarchies, and those controlled by a commercial elite were republics. The latter included the Italian city-states of [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], and [[Venice]] and members of the [[Hanseatic League]]. One notable exception was [[Dithmarschen]], a group of largely autonomous villages, who confederated in a peasants' republic. Building upon concepts of medieval [[feudalism]], [[Renaissance]] scholars used the ideas of the ancient world to advance their view of an ideal government. Thus the republicanism developed during the Renaissance is known as 'classical republicanism' because it relied on classical models. This terminology was developed by Zera Fink in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Zera S. Fink, ''The classical republicans: an essay on the recovery of a pattern of thought in seventeenth-century England'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; but some modern scholars, such as Brugger, consider it confuses the "classical republic" with the system of government used in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, '' Republican Theory in Political Thought: Virtuous or Virtual?'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; 'Early modern republicanism' has been proposed as an alternative term. It is also sometimes called [[civic humanism]].  Beyond simply a non-monarchy, early modern thinkers conceived of an ''ideal'' republic, in which [[mixed government]] was an important element, and the notion that [[virtue]] and the [[common good]] were central to good government. Republicanism also developed its own distinct view of [[liberty]].
Renaissance authors who spoke highly of republics were rarely critical of monarchies. While [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' is the period's key work on republics, he also wrote the treatise ''[[The Prince]],'' which is better remembered and more widely read, on how best to run a monarchy. The early modern writers did not see the republican model as universally applicable; most thought that it could be successful only in very small and highly urbanized city-states. [[Jean Bodin]] in ''Six Books of the Commonwealth'' (1576) identified monarchy with republic.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Najemy, "Baron's Machiavelli and renaissance republicanism." ''American Historical Review'' 101.1 (1996): 119-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical writers like [[Tacitus]], and Renaissance writers like Machiavelli tried to avoid an outspoken preference for one government system or another. Enlightenment philosophers, on the other hand, expressed a clear opinion. [[Thomas More]], writing before the Age of Enlightenment, was too outspoken for the reigning king's taste, even though he coded his political preferences in a utopian allegory.

In England a type of republicanism evolved that was not wholly opposed to monarchy; thinkers such as Thomas More and [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]] saw a monarchy, firmly constrained by law, as compatible with republicanism.

====Dutch Republic====
Anti-monarchism became more strident in the [[Dutch Republic]] during and after the [[Eighty Years' War]], which began in 1568. This anti-monarchism was more propaganda than a political philosophy; most of the anti-monarchist works appeared in the form of widely distributed [[pamphlet]]s. This evolved into a systematic critique of monarchy, written by men such as the brothers [[Johan de la Court|Johan]] and [[Peter de la Court]]. They saw all monarchies as illegitimate tyrannies that were inherently corrupt. These authors were more concerned with preventing the position of [[Stadholder]] from evolving into a monarchy, than with attacking their former rulers. [[Republicanism in the Netherlands|Dutch republicanism]] also influenced on French [[Huguenots]] during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. In the other states of early modern Europe republicanism was more moderate.&lt;ref&gt;Eco Haitsma Mulier,  "The language of seventeenth-century republicanism in the United Provinces: Dutch or European?." in   Anthony Pagden, ed., ''The Languages of political theory in early-modern Europe (1987): 179-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
In the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], republicanism was the influential ideology. After the establishment of the Commonwealth of Two Nations, republicans supported the status quo, of having a very weak monarch, and opposed those who thought a stronger monarchy was needed. These mostly Polish republicans, such as [[Łukasz Górnicki]], [[Andrzej Wolan]], and [[Stanisław Konarski]], were well read in classical and Renaissance texts and firmly believed that their state was a republic on the Roman model, and started to call their state the [[Rzeczpospolita]]. Atypically, Polish–Lithuanian republicanism was not the ideology of the commercial class, but rather of the landed nobility, which would lose power if the monarchy were expanded. This resulted in an oligarchy of the great landed magnates.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Lukowski, ''Disorderly Liberty: The political culture of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the eighteenth century'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment republicanism===

====England====
[[Oliver Cromwell]] set up a republic called the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649–1660) which he ruled after the overthrow of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] was then a leading philosopher of republicanism. [[John Milton]] was another important Republican thinker at this time, expressing his views in [[John Milton's politics|political tracts]] as well as through poetry and prose. In his epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', for instance, Milton uses Satan’s fall to suggest that unfit monarchs should be brought to justice, and that such issues extend beyond the constraints of one nation.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher N (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6VW8W Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx.]” ''Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development'', Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As Christopher N. Warren argues, Milton offers “a language to critique imperialism, to question the legitimacy of dictators, to defend free international discourse, to fight unjust property relations, and to forge new political bonds across national lines.”&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher N (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6VW8W Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx.]” ''Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development'', Vol. 7. Pg. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of international Miltonic republicanism has been influential on later thinkers including 19th-century radicals [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], according to Warren and other historians.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Jonathan (2001). [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Intellectual_Life_of_the_British_Wor.html?id=3B-qbvQTYyEC ''The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes'']. Pgs. 26, 36-37, 122-25, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Antony (2002). “Shakespeare and Radicalism: The Uses and Abuses of Shakespeare in Nineteenth-Century Popular Politics.” ''Historical Journal'' 45, no. 2. Pgs. 357-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of the [[Commonwealth of England]] in 1660 and the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] discredited republicanism among England's ruling circles. Nevertheless, they welcomed the [[liberalism]], and emphasis on rights, of [[John Locke]], which played a major role in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. Even so, republicanism flourished in the "country" party of the early 18th century ([[commonwealthmen]]), which denounced the corruption of the "court" party, producing a political theory that heavily influenced the American colonists. In general, the English ruling classes of the 18th century vehemently opposed republicanism, typified by the attacks on [[John Wilkes]], and especially on the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Pocock 1975"&gt;Pocock, J.G.A. ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition'' (1975; new ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

====French and Swiss thought====
French and Swiss Enlightenment thinkers, such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron Charles de Montesquieu]] and later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], expanded upon and altered the ideas of what an ideal republic should be: some of their new ideas were scarcely traceable to antiquity or the Renaissance thinkers. Concepts they contributed, or heavily elaborated, were [[social contract]], [[positive law]], and [[mixed government]]. They also borrowed from, and distinguished republicanism from, the ideas of [[liberalism]] that were developing at the same time.

Liberalism and republicanism were frequently conflated during this period, because they both opposed absolute monarchy. Modern scholars see them as two distinct streams that both contributed to the democratic ideals of the modern world. An important distinction is that, while republicanism stressed the importance of [[civic virtue]] and the [[common good]], liberalism was based on economics and [[individualism]]. It is clearest in the matter of private property, which, according to some, can be maintained only under the protection of established [[positive law]].

[[Jules Ferry]], Prime Minister of France from 1880 to 1885, followed both these schools of thought. He eventually enacted the [[Ferry Laws]], which he intended to overturn the [[Falloux Laws]] by embracing the anti-clerical thinking of the ''Philosophs''. These laws ended the Catholic Church's involvement in many government institutions in late 19th-century France, including schools.

===Republicanism in the United States===
{{Main|Republicanism in the United States}}

In recent years a debate has developed over the role of republicanism in the [[American Revolution]] and in the British radicalism of the 18th century. For many decades the consensus was that [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], especially that of [[John Locke]], was paramount and that republicanism had a distinctly secondary role.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite web |first=Vernon L. |last=Parrington |title=Main Currents in American Thought |year= 1927 |url= http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/Parrington/vol1/bk03_01_ch02.html |accessdate= 2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new interpretations were pioneered by [[J.G.A. Pocock]], who argued in ''[[The Machiavellian Moment]]'' (1975) that, at least in the early 18th century, republican ideas were just as important as liberal ones.  Pocock's view is now widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Shalhope (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Bailyn]] and [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] pioneered the argument that the American founding fathers were more influenced by republicanism than they were by liberalism. Cornell University professor [[Isaac Kramnick]], on the other hand, argues that Americans have always been highly individualistic and therefore Lockean.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Kramnick, ''Ideological Background," in Jack. P. Greene and J. R. Pole, ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of the American Revolution'' (1994) ch. 9; Robert E. Shallhope, "Republicanism" ibid ch 70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Appleby]] has argued similarly for the Lockean influence on America.

In the decades before the American Revolution (1776), the intellectual and political leaders of the colonies studied history intently, looking for models of good government. They especially followed the development of republican ideas in England.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Colbourn, ''The Lamp of Experience: Whig History and the Intellectual Origins of the American Revolution'' (1965) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/Home3/Book.php?recordID=0009 online version]&lt;/ref&gt; Pocock explained the intellectual sources in America:&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, ''The Machiavellian Moment'' p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Whig canon and the neo-Harringtonians, [[John Milton]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] and [[Algernon Sydney|Sidney]], [[John Trenchard (writer)|Trenchard]], [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Gordon]] and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], together with the Greek, Roman, and Renaissance masters of the tradition as far as [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], formed the authoritative literature of this culture; and its values and concepts were those with which we have grown familiar: a civic and patriot ideal in which the personality was founded in property, perfected in citizenship but perpetually threatened by corruption; government figuring paradoxically as the principal source of corruption and operating through such means as patronage, faction, standing armies (opposed to the ideal of the militia), established churches (opposed to the Puritan and deist modes of American religion) and the promotion of a monied interest&amp;nbsp;– though the formulation of this last concept was somewhat hindered by the keen desire for readily available paper credit common in colonies of settlement. A neoclassical politics provided both the ethos of the elites and the rhetoric of the upwardly mobile, and accounts for the singular cultural and intellectual homogeneity of the Founding Fathers and their generation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The commitment of most Americans to these republican values made the [[American Revolution]] inevitable. Britain was increasingly seen as corrupt and hostile to republicanism, and as a threat to the established liberties the Americans enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, Bernard.'' The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leopold von Ranke]] in 1848 claimed that American republicanism played a crucial role in the development of European liberalism:&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Becker 2002, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By abandoning English constitutionalism and creating a new republic based on the rights of the individual, the North Americans introduced a new force in the world. Ideas spread most rapidly when they have found adequate concrete expression. Thus republicanism entered our Romanic/Germanic world.... Up to this point, the conviction had prevailed in Europe that monarchy best served the interests of the nation. Now the idea spread that the nation should govern itself. But only after a state had actually been formed on the basis of the theory of representation did the full significance of this idea become clear. All later revolutionary movements have this same goal... This was the complete reversal of a principle. Until then, a king who ruled by the grace of God had been the center around which everything turned. Now the idea emerged that power should come from below.... These two principles are like two opposite poles, and it is the conflict between them that determines the course of the modern world. In Europe the conflict between them had not yet taken on concrete form; with the French Revolution it did.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Républicanisme''===
Republicanism, especially that of Rousseau, played a central role in the [[French Revolution]] and foreshadowed modern republicanism. The revolutionaries, after overthrowing the French monarchy in the 1790s, began by setting up a republic; Napoleon converted it into an Empire with a new aristocracy. In the 1830s [[Belgium]] adopted some of the innovations of the progressive political philosophers of the Enlightenment.

''Républicanisme'' is a [[France|French]] version of modern republicanism. It is a form of [[social contract]], deduced from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s idea of a [[general will]]. Ideally, each [[citizen]] is engaged in a direct relationship with the [[State (polity)|state]], removing the need for [[identity politics]] based on local, religious, or racial identification.

''Républicanisme'', in theory, makes anti-discrimination laws unnecessary, but some critics argue that [[Color blindness (race)|colour-blind law]]s serve to perpetuate discrimination.&lt;ref name="lnl"&gt;{{cite news

===Republicanism in Ireland===
{{Main| Society of United Irishmen}}

Inspired by the American and French Revolutions, the Society of United Irishmen was founded in 1791 in Belfast and Dublin. The inaugural meeting of the United Irishmen in Belfast on 18 October 1791 approved a declaration of the society's objectives. It identified the central grievance that Ireland had no national government: "...we are ruled by Englishmen, and the servants of Englishmen, whose object is the interest of another country, whose instrument is corruption, and whose strength is the weakness of Ireland..."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Carroll, ''The Man from God knows Where'', p. 42 (Gartan) 1995&lt;/ref&gt; They adopted three central positions: (i) to seek out a cordial union among all the people of Ireland, to maintain that balance essential to preserve liberties and extend commerce; (ii) that the sole constitutional mode by which English influence can be opposed, is by a complete and radical reform of the representation of the people in Parliament; (iii) that no reform is practicable or efficacious, or just which shall not include Irishmen of every religious persuasion. The declaration, then, urged constitutional reform, union among Irish people and the removal of all religious disqualifications.

The event that above all{{peacock term|date=February 2017}} influenced men's thoughts at that time was the French Revolution.{{original research inline|date=February 2017}} Public interest, already strongly aroused, was brought to a pitch by the publication in 1790 of [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', and Thomas Paine's response, ''[[Rights of Man]]'', in February 1791.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  Theobald [[Wolfe Tone]] wrote later that, "This controversy, and the gigantic event which gave rise to it, changed in an instant the politics of Ireland."&lt;ref name="Henry Boylan p.16"&gt;Henry Boylan, Wolf Tone, p. 16 (Gill and Macmillan, Dublin) 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Paine himself was aware of this commenting on sales of Part I of ''Rights of Man'' in November 1791, only eight months after publication of the first edition, he informed a friend that in England "almost sixteen thousand has gone off – and in Ireland above forty thousand".&lt;ref&gt;Paine to John Hall, 25 Nov. 1791 (Foner, Paine Writings, II, p. 1,322)&lt;/ref&gt; Paine my have been inclined to talk up sales of his works but what is striking in this context is that Paine believed that Irish sales were so far ahead of English ones before Part II had appeared. On 5 June 1792, [[Thomas Paine]], author of the ''Rights of Man'' was proposed for honorary membership of the Dublin Society of the United Irishmen.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Keogh and Whelan, The United Irishmen. Republicanism, Radicalism and Rebellion, pp. 135–37 (Lilliput, Dublin) 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of the [[Bastille]] was to be celebrated in Belfast on 14 July 1791 by a Volunteer meeting. At the request of [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]], Tone drafted suitable resolutions for the occasion, including one favouring the inclusion of Catholics in any reforms. In a covering letter to Russell, Tone wrote, "I have not said one word that looks like a wish for separation, though I give it to you and your friends as my most decided opinion that such an event would be a regeneration of their country".&lt;ref name="Henry Boylan p.16"/&gt; By 1795, Tone's Republicanism and that of the society had openly crystallized when he tells us: "I remember particularly two days thae we passed on Cave Hill. On the first Russell, Neilson, Simms, McCracken and one or two more of us, on the summit of McArt's fort, took a solemn obligation...never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country and asserted her independence."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Boylan, Wolf Tone, pp. 51–52 (Gill and Macmillan, Dublin) 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

The culmination was an uprising against British rule in Ireland lasting from May to September 1798 – the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] – with military support from revolutionary France in August and again October 1798. After the failure of the rising of 1798 the United Irishman, John Daly Burk, an émigré in the United States in his '' The History of the Late War in Ireland'' written in 1799, was most emphatic in its identification of the Irish, French and American causes.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Keogh and Whelan, ''The United Irishmen. Republicanism, Radicalism and Rebellion'', pp. 297–98 (Lilliput, Dublin) 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern republicanism==
During the Enlightenment, anti-monarchism extended beyond the civic humanism of the Renaissance. Classical republicanism, still supported by philosophers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Montesquieu]], was only one of several theories seeking to limit the power of monarchies rather than directly opposing them. New forms of anti-monarchism, such as [[liberalism]] and later [[socialism]], quickly overtook [[classical republicanism]] as the leading ideologies. Republicanism gained support, and monarchies were challenged throughout Europe.

===France===
{{Further|Radicalism (historical)}}
The French version of Republicanism after 1870 was called "Radicalism"; it became the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] a major political party.  In Western Europe, there were similar smaller "radical" parties. They all supported a constitutional republic and [[universal suffrage]], while European ''liberals'' were at the time in favor of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[census suffrage]]. Most radical parties later favored [[economic liberalism]]  and [[capitalism]]. This distinction between radicalism and liberalism had not totally disappeared in the 20th century, although many radicals simply joined liberal parties. For example, the [[Radical Party of the Left]] in France or the (originally Italian) [[Transnational Radical Party]], which still exist, focus more on republicanism than on simple liberalism.

Liberalism, was represented in France by the [[Orleanist]]s who rallied to the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] only in the late 19th century, after the [[comte de Chambord]]'s 1883 death and the 1891 papal encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]''.

But the early [[Radical Party (France)|Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party]] in France, and [[Chartism]] in Britain, were closer to republicanism, and the [[left-wing]]. Radicalism remained close to republicanism in the 20th century, at least in France, where they governed several times with other left-wing parties (participating in both the [[Cartel des Gauches]] coalitions as well as the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]).

Discredited after the [[Second World War]], French radicals split into a left-wing party&amp;nbsp;– the [[Radical Party of the Left]], an associate of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] – and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party "valoisien"]], an associate party of the conservative [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) and its [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] predecessors. Italian radicals also maintained close links with republicanism, as well as with [[socialism]], with the ''[[Radical Party (Italy)|Partito radicale]]'' founded in 1955, which became the [[Transnational Radical Party]] in 1989.

Increasingly, after the fall of communism in 1989 and the collapse of the Marxist interpretation of the French Revolution, France increasingly turned to Republicanism to define its national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sudhir Hazareesingh, "Conflicts Of Memory: Republicanism and the Commemoration of the Past in Modern France," ''French History'' (2009) 23#2 pp. 193–215&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles de Gaulle]], presenting himself as the military savior of France in the 1940s, and the political savior in the 1950s, refashioned the meaning of Republicanism. Both left and right enshrined him in the Republican pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Sudhir Hazareesingh, ''In the Shadow of the General: Modern France and the Myth of De Gaulle'' (2012) [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=36448 online review]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Republicanism in the United States}}

Republicanism became the dominant political value of Americans during and after the [[American Revolution]]. The "[[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]" were strong advocates of republican values, especially [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Samuel Adams]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Shalhope, "Toward a Republican Synthesis," ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 29 (Jan. 1972), pp. 49–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===The British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations===
In some countries of the [[British Empire]], later the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], republicanism has taken a variety of forms.

In [[Barbados]], the government gave the promise of a referendum on becoming a republic in August 2008, but it was postponed due to the change of government in the 2008 election.

In [[South Africa]], republicanism in the 1960s was identified with the supporters of [[apartheid]], who resented British interference in their treatment of the country's black population.

====Australia====
{{Main|Republicanism in Australia}}
In [[Australia]], the debate between republicans and monarchists is still active and [[Malcolm Turnbull]],  former Prime Minister of Australia, has confirmed he supports a republic but only after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref&gt;http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-17/turnbull-reaffirms-his-support-for-an-australian-republic/8129764&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barbados====

In [[New Zealand]], there is also a republican movement.

====The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland====
{{Main|Republicanism in the United Kingdom|}}
Republican groups are also active in the [[United Kingdom]]. The major organisation campaigning for a republic in the United Kingdom is '[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]'.

===The Netherlands===
{{Main|Republicanism in the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands have known two republican periods: the [[Dutch Republic]] (1581–1795) that gained independence from the [[Spanish Empire]] during the [[Eighty Years' War]], followed by the [[Batavian Republic]] (1795–1806) that after conquest by the [[French First Republic]] had been established as a [[Sister Republic]].  After [[Napoleon]] [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowned himself Emperor of the French]], he made his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] [[Kingdom of Holland|King of Holland]] (1806–1810), then annexed the Netherlands into the [[French First Empire]] (1810–1813) until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. Thereafter the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands]] (1813–1815) was established, granting the [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange-Nassau]] family, who during the Dutch Republic had only been [[stadtholder]]s, a princely title over the Netherlands, and soon [[William I of the Netherlands|William Frederick]] even crowned himself King of the Netherlands. His rather autocratic tendencies in spite of the principles of constitutional monarchy met increasing resistance from Parliament and the population, which eventually limited the monarchy's power and democratised the government, most notably through the [[Constitutional Reform of 1848]]. Since the late 19th century, republicanism has had various degrees of support in society, which the royal house generally dealt with by gradually letting go of its formal influence in politics and taking on a more ceremonial and symbolic role. Nowadays, popularity of the monarchy is high, but there is a significant republican minority that strives to abolish the monarchy altogether.

===Sweden===
{{Main|Republicanism in Sweden}}
In Sweden, a major promoter of republicanism is the [[Swedish Republican Association]], smells bad of the [[Monarchy of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repf.se/in-english |title=The Swedish Republican Association |publisher=Repf.se |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{Main|Republicanism in Spain}}
There is a renewed interest in republicanism in [[Spain]] after two earlier attempts: the [[First Spanish Republic]] (1873–1874) and the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1939). Movements such as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ciudadanos Por la República|es}}'', Citizens for the Republic in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], have emerged, and parties like [[United Left (Spain)]] and the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] increasingly refer to republicanism. In a survey conducted in 2007 reported that 69% of the population prefer the monarchy to continue, compared with 22% opting for a Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/reportajes/Rey/bien/gracias/elpepusocdmg/20071230elpdmgrep_10/Tes |title=¿El Rey? Muy bien, gracias |publisher=Elpais.com |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 survey, 58% of Spanish citizens were indifferent, 16% favored a republic, 16% were monarchists, and 7% claimed they were ''Juancarlistas'' (supporters of continued monarchy under King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], without a common position for the fate of the monarchy after his death).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-pesimo.blogspot.com/2008/08/encuesta-sigma-dos-el-mundo-que-hemos_15.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104055635/http://e-pesimo.blogspot.com/2008/08/encuesta-sigma-dos-el-mundo-que-hemos_15.html|archivedate=2011-11-04 |title=Indiferentes ante la Corona o la República |publisher=E-pesimo.blogspot.com |date=2004-02-27 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years republicanism has been rising, especially among the young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republica.com/2013/01/03/el-apoyo-a-la-monarquia-baja-hasta-el-54-el-nivel-mas-bajo-de-la-historia_596055/ |title=The 60% of the young spaniards are against the monarchy |publisher=Republica.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-republicanism&lt;!--'Neo-republicanism' and 'Neorepublicanism' redirect here--&gt;===
Neorepublicanism is the effort by current scholars to draw on a classical republican tradition in the development of an attractive public philosophy intended for contemporary purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lovett and Philip Pettit. "Neorepublicanism: a normative and institutional research program." ''Political Science'' 12.1 (2009): 11+ [http://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/DkZDjE3ZCC8aiDeVBEDe/full/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;   With traditional socialism virtually defunct, it emerges as an alternative postsocialist critique of market society from the left.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald F. Gaus, "Backwards into the future: Neorepublicanism as a postsocialist critique of market society." ''Social Philosophy and Policy'' 20#1 (2003): 59-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent theorists in this movement are [[Philip Pettit]] and [[Cass Sunstein]], who have each written several works defining republicanism and how it differs from liberalism. [[Michael Sandel]], a late convert to republicanism from [[communitarianism]], advocates replacing or supplementing liberalism with republicanism, as outlined in his ''Democracy's Discontent: America in Search of a Public Philosophy.''

Contemporary work from a neorepublican include jurist K. Sabeel Rahman's book ''Democracy Against Domination'', which seeks to create a neorepublican framework for [[economic regulation]] grounded in the thought of [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[John Dewey]] and [[popular sovereignty|popular control]], in contrast to both [[New Deal]]-style [[managerialism]] and [[neoliberal]] [[deregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rahman |first1=K.

==Democracy==
[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Paine]]]]
[[File:Upprop för republik 1848.jpg|thumb|A revolutionary republican hand-written bill from the Stockholm riots during the [[Revolutions of 1848]], reading: "Dethrone [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar]] he is not fit to be a king – rather the Republic! Reform! Down with the Royal house – long live [[Aftonbladet]]! Death to the king – Republic! Republic! – the people! [[Brunkeberg]] this evening." The writer's identity is unknown.]]

In the late 18th century there was convergence of democracy and republicanism. Republicanism is a system that replaces or accompanies inherited rule. There is an emphasis on liberty, and a rejection of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/ |title=Republicanism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It strongly influenced the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] in the 1770s and 1790s, respectively.&lt;ref name="Pocock 1975"/&gt;  Republicans, in these two examples, tended to reject inherited elites and aristocracies, but left open two questions: whether a republic, to restrain unchecked majority rule, should have an unelected [[upper chamber]]—perhaps with members appointed as meritorious experts—and whether it should have a [[constitutional monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood,  ''The Creation of the American Republic 1776–1787'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though conceptually separate from democracy, republicanism included the key principles of rule by [[consent of the governed]] and sovereignty of the people. In effect, republicanism held that kings and aristocracies were not the real rulers, but rather the whole people were. Exactly ''how'' the people were to rule was an issue of democracy: republicanism itself did not specify a means.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. R. Palmer]], ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the solution was the creation of [[First Party System|political parties]] that reflected the votes of the people and controlled the government (see [[Republicanism in the United States]]). Many exponents of republicanism, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Paine]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]] were strong promoters of representative democracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Other supporters of republicanism, such as [[John Adams]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]], were more distrustful of majority rule and sought a government with more power for elites.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} There were similar debates in many other [[Democratization|democratizing]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Shalhope, "Republicanism and Early American Historiography," ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 39 (Apr. 1982), pp. 334–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy and republic===
In contemporary usage, the term ''democracy'' refers to a government chosen by the people, whether it is [[Direct democracy|direct]] or [[Representative democracy|representative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/democracy |title=democracy – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the term ''[[republic]]'' usually refers to representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[president]], who serves for a limited term; in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies, with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=republic – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticized democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean [[direct democracy]] and which they equated with [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]; [[James Madison]] argued that what distinguished a ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combatted faction by its very structure.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]]&lt;/ref&gt; What was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted, was that the government should be "bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend."&lt;ref&gt;Novanglus, no. 7, 6 Mar. 1775&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional monarchs and upper chambers===
Some countries (such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Scandinavian countries, and Japan) turned powerful monarchs into constitutional ones with limited, or eventually merely symbolic, powers. Often the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system, whether or not they were replaced with democratic institutions (such as in France, China, Iran, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Turkey and Egypt). In Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and some other countries the monarch, or its representative, is given supreme executive power, but by convention acts only on the advice of his or her ministers. Many nations had elite upper houses of legislatures, the members of which often had lifetime tenure, but eventually these houses lost much power (as the UK [[House of Lords]]), or else became elective and remained powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Mark McKenna, ''The Traditions of Australian Republicanism'' (1996) [https://web.archive.org/web/20000818204057/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1995-96/96rp31.htm online version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Maynor, ''Republicanism in the Modern World.'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Summary of Pocock's influential ideas that traces the Machiavellian belief in and emphasis upon Greco-Roman ideals of unspecialized civic virtue and liberty from 15th century Florence through 17th century England and Scotland to 18th century America. Pocock argues that thinkers who shared these ideals tended to believe that the function of property was to maintain an individual's independence as a precondition of his virtue. Therefore they were disposed to attack the new commercial and financial regime that was beginning to develop.

'''Reset San Francisco'''  is a Gov 2.0 website founded by [[Phil Ting]], the assessor-recorder for the city of San Francisco. Launched in August 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eskenazi |first=Joe |url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/08/phil_ting_reset_sf_politics.php |title=Phil Ting Launches Slick New 'Reset S.F.' Site - But Not to Bolster Mayoral Run. Right? - San Francisco News - The Snitch |publisher=Blogs.sfweekly.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the website is designed to give the residents of San Francisco [[Web 2.0]] tools through which to engage in city issues. Its main purpose is to encourage civic discussion which it does through a number of forums focusing on themes such as education, jobs and tax reform. In addition it includes online polls and petitions on particular issues. It is an example of an increasing trend towards user generated government to give people more avenues through which to participate in politics.

== Campaigns ==

Although the website states itself primarily as a venue for the sharing of ideas, it has taken a position and led campaigns on certain issues.

=== Parking Tickets ===

In January 2011 [[Phil Ting]] used the website to criticize what he argued was the writing of excessive parking tickets in order to boost city tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/01/20/san-franciscos-assessor-launches-parking-ticket-revolt/ |title=San Francisco’s Assessor Launches Parking Ticket Revolt « CBS San Francisco |publisher=Sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com |date=2011-01-20 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,700 people signed the Reset San Francisco petition calling for a change in ticketing policy. Users of the website responded by calling for San Francisco to adopt a system similar to the "One-Click Hearings"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/ecb/html/respond/one-click.shtml |title=One-Click Hearings - NYC Environmental Control Board |publisher=Nyc.gov |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently established in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resetsanfrancisco.org/news/mar-28-11/fighting-parking-tickets-san-francisco |title=Fighting Parking Tickets in San Francisco – Take it to the Web &amp;#124; www.ResetSanFrancisco.org Blog |publisher=Resetsanfrancisco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system allows New Yorkers to contest unfair parking tickets by submitting evidence online. The system claims to streamline the appeals process making the system fairer and more efficient.

=== Twitter Tax break ===

Following the news that San Francisco has plans to give a large tax break to the local company, [[Twitter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baycitizen.org/technology/story/san-francisco-give-big-tax-breaks/ |title=San Francisco to Give Big Tax Breaks to Twitter |publisher=The Bay Citizen |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the website held a discussion to try to establish a consensus on the issue. A website poll showed 45% in favor, 44% opposed with the remaining 11% unsure. With no strong consensus the site ran dueling petitions on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resetsanfrancisco.org/tax-reform/discussion/twitter-san-francisco-tax-breaks-debate-now-140-characters-or-less |title=Twitter San Francisco Tax Breaks Debate - Now In 140 Characters or Less &amp;#124; www.ResetSanFrancisco.org Discussion |publisher=Resetsanfrancisco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319041349/http://www.resetsanfrancisco.org/tax-reform/discussion/twitter-san-francisco-tax-breaks-debate-now-140-characters-or-less |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== YouTube Testimony ===

In March 2010 [[Phil Ting]] and Reset San Francisco established an online campaign, petitioning City Hall to accept [[YouTube]] videos on the same basis as conventional public testimonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherbert |first=Erin |url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2011/03/youtube_public_comments_should.php |title=YouTube: City Hall Petitioned to Accept Public Comment Via Video - San Francisco News - The Snitch |publisher=Blogs.sfweekly.com |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aims to make it more convenient for the public to engage in city politics by using online tools. The current system requires citizens to attend city meetings which are generally held during regular working hours, preventing many working people from being able to participate in the political process. Ting's campaign argues that being busy should not prevent people from being involved, and that YouTube technology is a way to overcome this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ResetSanFrancisco |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gia2zENJZTs |title=Phil Ting discusses Reset San Francisco's YouTube Testimony Petition |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food For Thought ==

Reset San Francisco ran a community event in Golden Gate park on February 26 named Food for Thought. Over 250 citizens of San Francisco attended the event to discuss possible solutions to the city's problems. The participants split into various groups each leading discussion on a different theme such as transportation, housing and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AsianWeek |url=http://www.asianweek.com/2011/02/28/more-than-250-gather-to-help-reset-san-francisco/ |title=More than 250 Gather to Help Reset San Francisco |publisher=Asianweek.com |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307011252/http://www.asianweek.com/2011/02/28/more-than-250-gather-to-help-reset-san-francisco/ |archivedate=2011-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of several events intended to harness the discussion of the online community to help facilitate real world political engagement.

'''Social policy''' is [[policy]] usually within a governmental or political setting, such as the [[welfare state]] and study of [[social services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spicker|first1=Paul|title=An introduction to Social Policy|url=http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/publicpolicy/introduction/index.htm?CFID=75213086&amp;CFTOKEN=94736152&amp;jsessionid=50314442b009e7f430b746b7574792426401TR|website=www2.rgu.ac.uk|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social policy consists of guidelines, principles, legislation and activities that affect the living conditions conducive to [[human welfare]], such as a person's [[quality of life]]. The Department of Social Policy at the [[London School of Economics]] defines social policy as "an interdisciplinary and applied subject concerned with the analysis of societies' responses to social need", which seeks to foster in its students a capacity to understand theory and evidence drawn from a wide range of social science disciplines, including economics, sociology, psychology, geography, history, law, philosophy and political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Department|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/socialPolicy/aboutUs/introduction.aspx|publisher=London School of Economics (LSE)|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at [[Harvard University]] describes social policy as "public policy and practice in the areas of [[health policy|health care]], human services, [[criminal justice]], [[Social inequality|inequality]], [[education policy|education]], and labor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Malcolm Wiener Center|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/socpol/about.html|publisher=Presidents and Fellows of Harvard|accessdate=21 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225021708/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/socpol/about.html|archivedate=25 December 2008|date=15 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social policy might also be described as actions that affect the well-being of members of a society through shaping the distribution of and access to goods and resources in that society.&lt;ref&gt;''Social Policy in Aotearoa New Zealand: A Critical Introduction'' (2005) by Christine Cheyne, Mike O'Brien, &amp; Michael Belgrave - Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Social policy often deals with [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Horst Rittel|Rittel, H.]] &amp; Webber, M.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}

The earliest example of direct intervention by government in human welfare dates back to [[Umar ibn al-Khattāb]]'s rule as the second [[caliph]] of Islam in the 6th century. He used ''[[zakat]]'' collections and also other governmental resources to establish pensions, income support, child benefits, and various stipends for people of the non-Muslim community{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

In the West, proponents of scientific social planning such as the sociologist [[Auguste Comte]], and social researchers, such as [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]], contributed to the emergence of social policy in the first industrialised countries following the [[industrial revolution]]. Surveys of poverty exposing the brutal conditions in the urban [[slum]] conurbations of [[Victorian Britain]] supplied the pressure leading to changes such as the [[decline and abolition of the poor law system]] and [[Liberal welfare reforms]]. Other significant examples in the development of social policy are the [[Otto von Bismarck#Social legislation|Bismarckian welfare state]] in 19th century [[Germany]], [[Social Security (United States)#History|social security policies in the United States]] introduced under the rubric of the [[New Deal]] between 1933 and 1935, and the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] in Britain.

Social policy in the 21st century is complex and in each state it is subject to [[Local government|local]] and [[Central government|national governments]], as well as [[supranational]] political influence. For example, membership of the [[European Union]] is conditional on member states' adherence to the [[Law of the European Union#Social chapter|Social Chapter]] of European Union law {{clarify span|text=and other [[international laws]].|date=May 2015}}&lt;!-- Which "other international laws"? --&gt;

Social policy is an academic discipline focusing on the systematic evaluation of societies' responses to social need. It was established in the early-to-mid part of the 20th century as a complement to [[social work]] studies. One can reasonably argue there is not a single clear and comprehensive definition of social policy.&lt;ref&gt;Clasen (2013) Defining Comparative Social Policy, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably because social policy is more an area of study than a discipline, and also because the meaning of social policy has constantly evolved over time.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1963) Sociology at the Crossroads an other essays, Heinmann&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the founding fathers of the discipline (mainly sociologists, such as [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall]], [[Richard Titmuss|Titmuss]], [[Peter Townsend (sociologist)]] and historians, such as [[Asa Briggs]]) mainly defined the domain by looking at its aims: to reduce [[poverty]], insure against social risks, provide  [[equal opportunity]] for all, enhance [[economic growth]], and foster the expansion of social citizenship and social rights.

Scholars studied and categorized social security systems on the basis of their 'modes of intervention' (universalism, social insurance, social assistance). Of course, each welfare state system includes a mixture of these elements, but certain systems are geared toward universal principles, i.e. Sweden and Denmark. Others emphasize social insurance mechanisms, i.e. Germany and France. Still other focus on social assistance for the poor, i.e. the United Kingdom .&lt;ref&gt;Esping-Andersen (1990) The three worlds of welfare capitalism, Princeton University Press; for a revision of his typology see Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser (2011) Welfare Regime Theory: past, Present, Futures, Policy and Politics 39 [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/tpp/pap/2011/00000039/00000004/art00010].&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious, racial, ideological, scientific and philosophical movements and ideas have historically influenced American social policy, for example, [[John Calvin]] and his idea of [[pre-destination]] and the [[Protestant]] Values of hard work and [[individualism]]. Moreover, [[Social Darwinism]] helped mold America's ideas of [[capitalism]] and the ''[[survival of the fittest]]'' mentality. The Catholic Church's social teaching has also been considerably influential to the development of social policy.

United States politicians who have favored increasing government observance of social policy often do not frame their proposals around typical notions of welfare or benefits; instead, in cases like ''[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]'' and ''[[Medicaid]]'', President [[Lyndon Johnson]] presented a package called the [[Great Society]] that framed a larger vision around [[poverty]] and [[quality of life]]. [[Insurance]] has been a growing policy topic, and a recent example of [[health care law]] as social policy is the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] formed by the 111th U.S. Congress and signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], on March 23, 2010.

Moreover, former president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s ground breaking [[New Deal]] is a paragon example of Social Policy that focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through public spending on projects, rather than on cash payment. The programs were in response to the [[Great Depression]] affecting the United States in the 1930s.

An American [[education policy]] proposal from a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president is the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. This Act took effect on January 8, 2002, and was put in place to raise standards in education so different individuals can have better educational outcomes. The No Child Left Behind Act requires every state to [[Standards-based education reform in the United States|assess students on basic skills]] to receive federal funding. However, this Act did not create a national standard since each state develops their own set of standards and assessments. Critics of most all social policies point toward a depiction of a [[welfare state]] on the make of a Hobbesian [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].

{{cquote|The Web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect—to help people work together—and not as a technical toy.

The term "social Web" was coined by [[Howard Rheingold]] for this network in 1996; Rheingold was quoted in an article for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on his website "Electric Minds", described as a "virtual community center" that listed online communities for users interested in socializing through the Web, saying that "The idea is that we will lead the transformation of the Web into a social Web".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Rheingold's Neighborhood |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985581,00.html |work=Time|accessdate=7 June 2011|first=Joshua|last=Quittner|date=1996-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rheingold |first=Howard |title=The virtual community: homesteading on the electronic frontier |year=2000 |publisher=The MIT Press|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr8bdUDisqAC&amp;pg=PA334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social Web developed in three stages from the beginning of the '90s up to the present day, transforming from simple one-way communication web pages to a network of truly social applications.&lt;ref name = Porter /&gt;{{rp|14}} During the "one-way conversation" era of online applications in the mid '90s, most of the nearly 18,000 web pages in existence were "read only", or "static web sites" with information flowing exclusively from the person or organization that ran the site; although the web was used socially at this time, communication was difficult, achieved only through individuals reacting to each other's posts on one web page by responding to them on their own personal web page.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;{{rp|14}} In the mid '90s, Amazon and other pioneers made great progress in advancing online social interaction by discovering how to link databases to their web sites in order to store information as well as to display it; in concert with other innovations, this led to the rise of read-write web applications, allowing for a "two-way conversation" between users and the individual or organization running the site.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;{{rp|14}} As these web applications became more sophisticated, people became more comfortable using and interacting with them, bandwidth increased, and access to the Internet became more prevalent, causing designers to begin implementing new features that allowed users to communicate not only with a site's publishers, but with others who visited that site as well.&lt;ref name= Porter /&gt;{{rp|15}} Despite being a small step forward technologically, it was a huge step socially, enabling group interaction for the first time, and it has been claimed that this social exchange between many individuals is what separates a web application from a ''social Web'' application.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The first social networking sites, including [[Classmates.com]] (1995) and [[SixDegrees.com]] (1997), were introduced prior to social media sites.&lt;ref name=Won/&gt; It has been argued that the transition towards social media sites began after the world's first online interactive diary community [[Open Diary]] was founded on December 19, 1998; currently still online after ten years, it has hosted over five million digital diaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendiary.com/about.asp About Open Diary]. Opendiary.com (1998-10-19). Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Open Diary successfully brought online diary writers together into one community as an early social networking site, and it was during this time that the term "[[weblog]]" was coined (later to be shortened to the ubiquitous "blog" after one blogger jokingly turned weblog into the sentence "we blog").&lt;ref name=Kaplan /&gt; Some claim that this marked the beginning of the current era of social media, with "social media" being a term that entered into both common usage and prominence as high-speed Internet became increasingly available, growing in popularity as a concept and leading to the rise of social networking sites such as Myspace (2003) and Facebook (2004).&lt;ref name=Kaplan /&gt; It has been argued that this trend towards social media "can be seen as an evolution back to the Internet's roots, since it re-transforms the World Wide Web to what it was initially created for: a platform to facilitate information exchange between users."&lt;ref name=Kaplan /&gt;

The social Web is quickly becoming a way of life: many people visit social networking sites at least once per day, and in 2008 the average amount of time per visit to MySpace hovered around twenty-six minutes (the length of a sitcom).&lt;ref name= Porter /&gt;{{rp|18}} Furthermore, the astoundingly rapid growth of the social Web since the '90s is not projected to slow down anytime soon: with less than 20% of the world's population using the Internet, the social Web is felt by some to still be in its infancy.&lt;ref name= Porter /&gt;{{rp|20}} The line between social networking and social media is becoming increasingly blurred as sites such as Facebook and Twitter further incorporate photo, video, and other functionalities typical of social media sites into users' [[User profile|public profiles]], just as social media sites have been integrating features characteristic of social networking sites into their own online frameworks.&lt;ref name=Won /&gt;{{rp|233}} One notable change that has been brought about by the merging of social networking/media is the transformation of social web applications into egocentric software that put people at the center of applications.&lt;ref name= Porter /&gt;{{rp|16}} Although there had been discussion about a sense of community on the web prior to these innovations, modern social web software makes a wider set of social interactions available to the user, such as "[[friending]]" and "following" individuals, even sending them virtual gifts or kisses.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;{{rp|16}}  Social Web applications are typically built using [[object oriented programming]], utilizing combinations of several programming languages, such as [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[ASP.NET (programming language)|ASP.NET]] and/or [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echophp.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/what-is-php-social-networking-software/ |title=What is PHP Social Networking Software? « Simplify Php Web Programming |publisher= Echophp.wordpress.com |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[API]]s are utilized to tie non-social websites to social websites, one example being Campusfood.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campusfood.com |title=Order Food Online - Food Delivery, Restaurant Menus, College Campuses, Pizza, Chinese, Wings, Takeout |publisher=Campusfood.com |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blogs and wikis===

Both [[blogs]] and [[Wikis]] are prime examples of collaboration through the Internet, a feature of the group interaction that characterizes the social Web.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;{{rp|16}} Blogs are used as BBS for the 21st century on which people can post discussions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Ruth|title=Blogs and Wikis a Personal Journey|journal=Business Information Review|year=2006|volume=23|pages=234–240|url=http://bir.sagepub.com/content/23/4/235|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Wikis are constructed and edited by anyone who is granted access to them. Members of both are able to see the recent discussions and changes made, although for many blogs and Wikis such as [[Wikipedia]] this is true even for non-members. Blogs and Wikis allow users to share information and educate one another, and these social interaction are focused on content and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Will|title=The Social Web|url=https://sremote.pitt.edu/gtx/,DanaInfo=find.galegroup.com+retrieve.do?contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;qrySerId=&amp;inPS=true&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=ITOF&amp;searchId=R1&amp;retrieveFormat=PDF&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;userGroupName=upitt_main&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;sort=DateDescend&amp;docId=A151440719&amp;noOfPages=2 |publisher=www.techlearning.com |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs and Wikis are used by both those writing them and those who reference them as resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferriter|first=Bill|title=Learning with Blogs and Wikis|journal=Educational Leadership|date=Feb 2009|pages=34–40 |volume=66 |number=5 |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/feb09/vol66/num05/Learning-with-Blogs-and-Wikis.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs allow members to share ideas and other members to comment on those ideas, while Wikis facilitate group collaboration: both of these tools open a gateway of communication in which social interaction allows the web to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/02/05/what-is-a-blog/ |title=What is a Blog? |publisher=Problogger.net |date=2005-02-05 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites are used by teachers and students alike to accomplish the goal of sharing education, and working in a community with other scholars enables the users to see different interpretations of similar subjects as well as to share resources that might not be available to them otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:School and university projects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile connectivity support===

The lives of social web users are increasingly interconnected with their online profiles and accounts, such to the extent that many social networking and social media sites now offer support for mobile devices and [[internet phone]] connectivity.&lt;ref name=Won /&gt;{{rp|233}} Popular social web sites such Facebook Mobile, [[Orkut]], Twitter, and YouTube have led the way for other sites to enable their users to post and share new content with others, update their statuses and receive their friends' updates and uploaded content via mobile platforms.&lt;ref name=Won /&gt;{{rp|233}}The central aim for both sites offering these mobile services and for those who use them is for the user to maintain contact with their [[Online friendship|friends online]] at all times; it allows them to update their profiles and to communicate with each other even when they are away from a computer.&lt;ref name=Won /&gt;{{rp|233}} It is predicted that this trend will continue in the future, not as other sites follow suit to offer similar services, but as they are extended to other mobile devices that social web users will carry with them in years to come.&lt;ref name= Won /&gt;{{rp|233}}  Social web mobile applications can also allow for [[augmented reality]] gaming and experiences; examples of such include SCVGR and [[Layar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elgan|first1=Mike|title=Augmented reality on Android already available!|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2480962/mobile-wireless/augmented-reality-on-android-already-available-.html|website=Computerworld|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social features added to non-social sites===

Web sites that are not built around social interaction nevertheless add features that enable discussion and collaboration out of an interest in expanding their user bases—a trend that is projected to continue in the coming years.&lt;ref name= Won /&gt;{{rp|233}} As early as 1995 electronic retailer [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] had implemented such features, especially the customer review, to great success; Joshua Porter, author of ''Designing for the Social Web,'' writes:

{{cquote|At Amazon, customer reviews act like a magnet, pulling people down the page. That's the content people want...They keep scrolling until they hit the reviews, which in some cases are up to 6000 pixels down from the top of the page! Nobody seems to mind...Customer reviews allow people to learn about a product from the experience of others without any potentially biased seller information. No wonder everyone wanted to shop at Amazon. They had information that no other site had: they had the ''Truth''. And that truth, interestingly enough, arose from simply aggregating the conversation of normal people.&lt;ref name=Porter /&gt;{{rp|4}}}}

These customer reviews contribute valuable information that individuals seek out, and are written by users for free simply out of a desire to share their experiences with a product or service with others; the quality and value of each review is further determined by other users, who rate them based upon whether or not they found the feedback helpful, "weeding out the bad (by pushing them to the bottom [of the page])."&lt;ref name= Porter /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Non-retailer, special interest websites have also implemented social web features to broaden their appeal: one example is Allrecipes.com, a community of 10 million cooks that share ideas and recipes with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levi-Garza|first=Jalaane|title=Allrecipes Content &amp; Technology Services|url=http://allrecipes.com/help/aboutus/licensing.aspx|publisher=AllRecipes.com|accessdate=7 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018123024/http://allrecipes.com/Help/aboutus/licensing.aspx|archivedate=18 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to exchanging recipes with others through the website, users are able to rate and post reviews of recipes they have tried, and to provide suggestions as to how to improve or alter them;&lt;ref name=allrecipes&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Help/FAQ|url=http://allrecipes.com/Help/questions/faq/community.aspx#homepage|work=Allrecipes Customer Support}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the website, "The ratings/reviews...are a valuable resource to our community because they show how the members and their families feel about a recipe. Does the recipe get raves—or does it never get made again? Your opinion counts".&lt;ref name=allrecipes /&gt;  This feedback is used to evaluate and classify recipes based upon how successfully they passed through the site's "editorial process" and to what extent they were approved by site members, potentially resulting in receiving "Kitchen approved" status that is comparable to Wikipedia's [[Good Article nominations|"good article" nomination]] process.&lt;ref name=allrecipes /&gt; The site has also augmented its services by including social features such as user blogs and connecting with other social networking/media sites like Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/allrecipes |title=Allrecipes.com Facebook page |publisher=Facebook.com |date=2009-01-10 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to expand its presence on the social Web. The recipes found on this website become part of the social web as other members rank them, comment and provide feedback as to why the recipe was good or bad, or to share ways in which they would change it.

The integration of "social" features has also begun to extend into non-Web media forms including print and broadcast. Increasingly prevalent mobile devices have offered a platform for media companies to create hybridised media forms which draw upon the social web, such as the [[Yahoo!7#Fango mobile app|Fango mobile app]] offered by Australian partnership [[Yahoo!7]] which combines traditional TV programming with live online discussions and existing social networking channels.

===Social art===

Artists use the social Web to share their art, be it visual art on sites like [[deviantART]], video art on [[YouTube]], musical art on YouTube or [[iTunes]], or [[physical art]], such as posting and selling crafted items on [[Craigslist]].  Artists choose to post their art online so that they can gain critiques on their work, as well as just have the satisfaction of knowing others can experience and enjoy their work.  With this social web generation, students spend more time using social tools like computers, video games, video cameras and cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jovanović|first=Jelena|author2=Dragan Gašević |author3=Carlo Torniaic |author4=Scott Batemand |author5=Marek Hatalae |title=The Social Semantic Web in Intelligent Learning Environments: state of the art and future challenges|journal=Interactive Learning Environments|date=December 2008 |volume=17|issue=4|pages=273–309|doi=10.1080/10494820903195140}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools allow the art to be shared easily, and aid in the discussion.

===Collaborative efforts facilitated by the social web===

====Crowdsourcing====
{{Main|Crowdsourcing}}

Crowdsourcing has become one of the ways in which the social Web can be used collaborative efforts, particularly in the last few years, with the dawn of the [[semantic web]] and Web 2.0.  Modern web applications have the capabilities for crowdsourcing techniques, and consequently the term is now used exclusively for web-based activity.  Examples include sites such as SurveyMonkey.com and SurveyU.com; for example, SurveyMonkey enables users to administer surveys to a list of contacts they manage, then collect and analyze response data using basic tools provided on the website itself and finally export these results once they are finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SurveyMonkey User Manual|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/SurveyMonkeyFiles/UserManual.pdf|work=User Manual|accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdsourcing is used by researchers in order to emulate a traditional [[focus group]], but in a less expensive and less intimate atmosphere.
Due to the nature of the social Web, people feel more open to express what their thoughts are on the topic of discussion without feeling as though they will be as heavy scrutinized by the rest of the group when compared to a traditional setting.  The Internet serves as a screen, helping to evoke the purest feedback from the participants in the group, as it removes much of a [[mob mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Leah DeVun]] |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/07/crowd_captain?currentPage=all |title=Wired News. Web. 19 Nov. 2009 |publisher=Wired.com |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook has also been a mode in which crowdsourcing can occur, as users typically ask a question in their status message hoping those that see it on his or her news feed will answer the question, or users may opt to use the poll option now available to obtain information from those within their friends network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=411795942130 |title=Searching for Answers? Ask Facebook Questions |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community-based software projects====

Through the use of the social Web, many software developers opt to participate in community-based [[open-source software]] projects, as well as hacking projects for [[proprietary software]], [[kernel (computing)]] modifications, and [[freeware]] ports of games and software. [[Linux]] iterations are perfect examples of how effective and efficient this sort of collaboration can be.  Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] is another example, as many coders work on modifying existing hardware kernels and ROMs to create customized forms of a released Android version. These collaborative efforts for Android take place typically through [[xda-developers]] and androidforums.com.

===Mobile application development===

Most of the modern mobile applications, and indeed even browser applications, come from released [[software development kits]] to developers. The developers create their applications and share them with users via "app markets". Users can comment on their experiences with the applications, allowing all users to view the comments of others, and thus have a greater understanding of what is to be expected from the application. Typically there is also a rating a system in addition to comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?answer=138329 |title=Comment Posting Policy - Android Market Help |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile social Web applications are built using various [[API]]s. These APIs allow for the interaction and interconnection of data on one social database, be it Facebook, Twitter, or [[Google Account]], thus creating a literal web of data connections. These applications then add to the user experience specific to the application itself.  Examples include [[TweetDeck]] and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html |title=Package Index &amp;#124; Android Developers |publisher=Developer.android.com |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From the social web to real life==

The way in which individuals share intimate details, and perform tasks such as dating, shopping, and applying for jobs is very different from in previous generations. Now, one's preferences, opinions, and activities are routinely shared with a group of friends with whom they may or may not ever meet were it not for the social web.&lt;ref name="Kim 2010 215–236"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Won|author2=Ok-RanJeong|author3=Sang-WonLee|lastauthoramp=y|title=On social Websites|journal=Information Systems|year=2010|volume=35|pages=215–236|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/infosys|accessdate=14 June 2011|doi=10.1016/j.is.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many social websites use online social interaction to create a bridge to real life interaction. Relationships are formed between individuals via the internet and then become more personal through other forms of communication.&lt;ref name="Kim 2010 215–236"/&gt;  An example of this type of interaction is found on [[eBay]]: with more than 94 million active users globally, eBay is the world's largest [[online marketplace]], where anyone can buy and sell practically anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Michael|title=Absolute Beginner's Guide to EBay|year=2008|publisher=Que Publishing|isbn=978-0-7897-3783-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jip8SkAAruQC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=what+is+ebay&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jg72TciAOMX40gHIxcjsDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20ebay&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This website allows individuals to sell items and other to bid on these items. At the end of the auction, the buyer pays the seller; the buyer then sends the purchased product to the winner of the auction.  The relationship begins on the internet, but extends into real life interaction.  Ways in eBay facilitates this interaction include [[Skype]], a leading online communications service that enables people to communicate through voice or video online for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are - eBay Inc.|url=http://www.ebayinc.com/connect|work=Partnerships and Investments|publisher=eBay|accessdate=14 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619084609/http://www.ebayinc.com/connect|archivedate=19 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  eBay Inc. acquired Skype in 2005 and significantly expanded its customer base to more than 480 million registered users in nearly every country on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebay partnerships and investments|url=http://www.ebayinc.com/who|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result of all eBay transactions is a seller providing the buyer with a product, most commonly via mail: web interaction ending in a real world exchange.

The relationship that is formed with eBay users is similar to the users of [[Craigslist]].  Users place items that they want to sell on the website, and other users that are looking to purchase these items contact the seller. Craigslist is used to bring together individuals and organizations and connect them to the resources, tools, technology and ideas they need to effectively engage in [[community building]] and see the impact of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://craigslistfoundation.org/about/faqs/#what|publisher=Craigslist Fondation|accessdate=1 June 2011|title=FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done via email or over the telephone.  The buyer and the seller form a meeting in which goods are exchanged for money. Without this type of website, the buyer would not know that the product was available by the seller. This type of website allows members of a physical community to network with the other members of their community to exchange goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freese|first=Susan|title=Craigslist: Company and Its Founder|year=2011|publisher=ABDO Publishing Co.|isbn=978-1-61714-806-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzQagfblB20C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=craigslist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iRL2TZelCIPq0gHZ__3tDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transaction from web to real life is seen on a macro scale most recently on [[dating website]]s, which are used to search and match other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sprecher|first=Susan|title=Handbook of relationship initiation|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group |isbn=978-0-8058-6160-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UND7Ps1ZZkEC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=dating+sites&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ghf2TfCZFbSq0AG7hc3sDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dating%20sites&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These websites allow members with a common interest, to find others with this same interest.  Academics who have studied the industry believe that it and other forms of [[electronic communication]] such as e-mail and social networks are starting to have a significant effect on the ways in which people find love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Love at first byte|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pwh&amp;AN=56954396&amp;site=pov-live|publisher=Economist|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users are able to interact with one another and find if they have common interests.  Many sites have been developed that target many different [[Special interest group|interest group]]s, and relationships form and develop using the internet.  If the users decide that they share a mutual bond, they are able to interact via the telephone, and eventually in person.  The relationship begins on the internet, but can lead to real life dating and eventually even marriage.

The '''Swedish Women's Lobby''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Kvinnolobby}}) is a [[nonpartisan]] [[political advocacy]] organisation, and an [[umbrella organization]] for the Swedish [[women's rights]] and women's organisations. It was founded on the initiative of the [[Government of Sweden]] in 1997, based on the model of the [[European Women's Lobby]] (EWL) on the [[European Union|EU]] level, and has 40 member organizations. Its President is Anna Giotas Sandquist. The aim of the organisation is "to integrate women’s perspectives into all political, economical and social processes, locally as well as internationally," based on the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] and the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ Beijing Platform for Action], [[United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?rubrique94&amp;lang=en Swedish Women's Lobby], [[European Women's Lobby]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish Women's Lobby is the Swedish coordination of the European Women’s Lobby. Eva Fager of the Swedish Women's Lobby serves as Vice President of EWL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">The '''Treasurer of the Labour Party''' is a position on the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]].

Although a post with little power, in the past, it was often hotly contested by people who later became big names in British politics: [[Arthur Greenwood]] beat [[Herbert Morrison]] in 1943, [[Hugh Gaitskell]] beat [[Aneurin Bevan]] in 1954, who in turn beat [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] in 1956, while [[James Callaghan]] beat [[Michael Foot]] in 1967. Since the 1990s, the post has typically been held by a senior member of one of the larger Trade Unions.

Since the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] (PPERA) came into force, the Labour Party has had to register a Treasurer to the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], who becomes legally responsible for various returns to the Electoral Commission. It has been the practice of the NEC to register the full-time [[General Secretary of the Labour Party|General Secretary]] as Treasurer under PPERA, rather than the elected volunteer Treasurer. This has created two Treasurer roles within the party, so to disambiguate these roles the elected Treasurer is often called ''Party Treasurer'', and the PPERA Treasurer is often called ''Registered Treasurer''. The party accounts are signed by both treasurers using these titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/19877 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405105016/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/19877 |archivedate=2008-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though under PPERA only the General Secretary need sign them.

In 2008 the post was contested by the incumbent [[Jack Dromey]] and by human rights lawyer Mark McDonald, with Dromey being re-elected.  In 2010, former Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] was defeated by [[Diana Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11414834 Lord Prescott fails in Treasurer bid]", ''[[BBC News]]'', 26 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vice-President of the Democratic Republic of Congo''' is a former political position in Congo, which existed between 2003 and 2006 in the country's interim government after the [[Second Congo War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fi/books?id=FvAWPTaRvFYC Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the [[Second Congo War]], and until December 6, 2006, transitional institutions were established, consisting of the former warring parties, as well as representatives of the non-belligerent opposition, and representatives of the [[civil society]]. As part of these institutions, a transitional government was put in place, led by a President, and four Vice-presidents, each of the latter coordinating a Governmental commission, regrouping a number of ministries. The pentarchy was often referred to as the "'''1 + 4'''". The Vice-Presidents were : 

*[[Azarias Ruberwa]] ([[Congolese Rally for Democracy|RCD]]): Policy, Defense and Security Commission. He represents one of the 2 major former rebel groups. 
*[[Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma]]
*[[Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi]] ([[People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy|PPRD]]): Reconstruction and Development Commission. He represents the pre-peace agreement government.
*[[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] ([[Movement for the Liberation of Congo|MLC]]): Economic and Financial Commission. He represents one of the 2 major former rebel groups.

Under the 2006 constitution, which was promulgated in February 2006, the position of Vice-President becomes obsolete, after the inauguration of the first President of the DRC, elected democratically by direct universal suffrage. This inauguration occurred on December 6, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24970">'''Water Point Mapping''' ('''WPM''') is a tool for monitoring the distribution and status of water supplies. It collects data about different aspects related to the water facility and overlays this point data with information about population and administrative boundaries. WPM helps to visualize the spatial distribution of water supply coverage and can thereby be used to highlight equity issues. The information collected provides insights into schemes’ sustainability levels and management-related aspects of water points.

WPM can be used to (i) to inform the planning of investments to improve water supply coverage; (ii) to allocate resources to deliver basic services where they are most needed; (iii) to promote increased investments in the sector; and (iv) to measure progress and performance.

== Relevance of mapping ==
The [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) include a specific target (number 10 of Goal 7) to deal with people who do not access safe drinking water and basic [[sanitation]]. To adequately assess peoples’ access to these basic services it is vital that there is accessible, accurate and reliable data that is routinely collected and updated.

A variety of tools and techniques have been developed in recent years to collect such information. However, unless data is easily accessible and is presented in a user-friendly format, decision makers commonly do without the information. One alternative that has been designed to manage large volumes of data and to enable a user-friendly presentation is to use geo-referenced datasets, which provide a means of integration of data from different sources at any point on the globe.&lt;ref name="Henninger 1998" /&gt; Within such a framework, for any specific point on the map (identified by its grid reference) detailed and accurate data of different nature can be linked in an integrated way. Mapping therefore involves the presentation of certain information in a spatial context, and this enables policy planners to identify the geographic areas and communities in which to focus their efforts for maximum impact. In all, mapping presents many benefits, such as:

*It makes easier to integrate data from different sources (surveys, censuses, satellites, etc.) and from different disciplines (social, economic, and environmental data). It also allows the switch to new units of analysis from, for example, administrative boundaries (e.g. state) to ecological boundaries (e.g. basin).
*Maps are a powerful visual tool and are more easily understood by stakeholders, particularly in developing countries.
*The spatial nature of water poverty, such as the distance to the nearest water source or the water supply infrastructure, can also be incorporated easily in a GIS database.
*The allocation of resources can be improved, since geographic targeting is more efficient and cost-effective than to launch an equally expensive universal distribution programme.
*Geo-referenced databases can be enriched by additional data as they become available; and new attributes, such as better details on water quality, can be incorporated into the data structure, ensuring that the relevance of the data is sustained over time.
*Maps can be produced at a number of different resolutions depending on their purpose and the cost of data collection. A coarse resolution or a scale too small neglects the heterogeneity within each unit and provides insufficient detail for decision making, while a fine resolution or a scale too large increases the cost of compiling, managing, and analyzing the data.

== Methodology ==
Water Point Mapping (WPM) can be defined as an ‘exercise whereby the geographical positions of all improved water points in an area are gathered in addition to management, technical and demographical information’.&lt;ref name="WaterAid and ODI 2005" /&gt; A handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) unit is used to record the precise location and approximate altitude of all water points audited; a digital camera is used to capture photographs of each water point in order to show the status and physical conditions; and a structured questionnaire is completed to document main characteristics, such as: location, functionality, category of water supply, water quality perception, management issues, ownership and water tariff payment. All collected data is entered into a geographical information system and correlated with available demographic, administrative, and physical data. The information is finally displayed using digital maps.

WPM seeks to serve two different purposes:

*To easily show the distribution of water points in a territory. This could enhance efficiency and transparency in local government’s planning while enabling a higher degree of accountability towards population.
*To allow the definition of more reliable access indicators, which are to be constructed from the lowest geographical level with collected data.

The strength of water point maps is that they provide a clear message on who is and is not served; and particularly in rural areas, WPM can be used to highlight equity issues and schemes’ functionality levels below the district level.&lt;ref name="WaterAid 2010" /&gt; In many developing countries, water sector ministries are undertaking reforms towards decentralization, transferring the responsibility of services management and resource allocation to local planners. This requires adequate performance monitoring frameworks backed up by accurate and reliable data at local level. WPM is increasingly thought of as a way to collect this information and display it through easy-to-use maps.

As a survey tool, WPM was originally designed and promoted by [[WaterAid]] in [[Malawi]], although in recent years it has been carried out in different countries ([[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], Malawi, [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], etc.) by a number of stakeholders ([[WaterAid]], [[SNV Netherlands Development Organisation|SNV]], Ingeniería Sin Fronteras - ApD, Concern; etc.).

=== Improved and unimproved water points ===
Main goal of WPM is to develop a comprehensive record of improved water points at a particular geographic area. The types of water points considered as improved are consistent with those accepted internationally by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]],&lt;ref name="Joint Monitoring Programme 2010" /&gt; where definition of improved is technology-based. More specifically, an improved water point is a place with some improved facilities where water is drawn for various uses such as drinking, washing and cooking.&lt;ref name="Stoupy and Sugden 2003" /&gt;

&lt;small&gt;**Considered as “not improved” because of concerns about the quantity of water supplied, not because of concerns over the water quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== Water quality and seasonality issues ===
Despite its growing importance, the issue of water quality has long been nearly absent from water coverage assessments, since few countries could afford regular water quality surveillance. Instead, it is assumed that certain types of water sources categorized as ‘improved’ are likely to deliver drinking water of adequate quality for basic health needs.&lt;ref name="Joint Monitoring Programme 2000" /&gt; This assumption appears over-optimistic, and improved technologies are shown not to be providing in all circumstances safe water.&lt;ref name="Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutton 2008" /&gt; Similarly, health-related gains in water interventions are also dependent on service reliability; and it has been seen for example that annual health benefits attributed to the consumption of safe water are almost entirely lost if raw water is consumed over the course of few days.&lt;ref name="Hunter et al 2009" /&gt; This draws attention to the issue of reliability and seasonality of drinking water sources.

Against this background, the Spanish NGO Ingeniería Sin Fronteras - Asociación para el Dessarrollo (ISF-ApD) complements the standard WPM campaign with two additional actions: (i) basic water quality tests are carried out using portable water testing kits (measuring pH, turbidity, chlorine, electrical conductivity and concentration of faecal coliforms); and (ii) the year-round functionality of water points is assessed by means of direct questions to users. The methodology used is ultimately designed to estimate the coverage of year-round safe improved water points of a certain territory.&lt;ref name="Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2008" /&gt;

=== Indicators for sector performance monitoring ===
One drawback of water point maps is that they are only as accurate as the underlying data collected,&lt;ref name="WaterAid 2010" /&gt; so that there is a need to define reliable but simple indicators as the basis of the monitoring framework. Clearly, the core sector indicator is water supply coverage, and in rural areas, access to water is normally defined by establishing a ratio of the maximum distance and number of people served by each water point. Three different possibilities exist when defining access:

#Calculate coverage as the standard number of people served per water point (normally defined in the water policy) multiplied by the number of water points, regardless of distance from dwellings to the water point.
#Calculate coverage by considering the people served by water point as the number of people living at a certain distance from it, regardless the maximum number of people to be served by a water point as defined in the corresponding water policy.
#A case-specific approach combining both of the above conditions and applying the most restrictive one in each scenario.

In order to accurately assess the number of people served using distance as a criterion (no. 2) the spatial distribution of population is required, and this is problematic in the majority of cases. Despite the progress made with satellite free access images, many rural areas are still not covered with sufficient precision. On the other hand, due to periodic sociological census undertaken in nearly all countries, population distribution in administrative structures is usually quite well documented. Thus, first abovementioned criterion is the most commonly used.

With this information, the percentage of access to water in an area is estimated, and first indicator of access can be defined as Improved Community Water Point Density (ICWPD), which is equal to the number of ICWP per 1,000 inhabitants. A certain area would have access if its density of water points per 1,000 inhabitants is above the national threshold, and percentage of people not served in an area would be proportional to the lack of water points available compared to that threshold. However, to further improve ICWP indicator is simple since information on functionality for each water point is also collected during the survey. Non-functionality is an important obstacle to access to rural water supply, and in sub-Saharan Africa averages around 35%.&lt;ref name="Harvey and Reed 2007" /&gt; Consequently, Functional Community Water Point Density (FCWPD) can be used as more accurate access indicator. If water quality and seasonality issues are taken into consideration, other ‘access’ indicators can be defined, as shown in following Table.

=== Combining WPM data with household-based information ===
In addition to safe water supplies, basic sanitation and [[hygiene]] also have significant impact on household health.

Provision and use of sanitation isolates contaminated faeces from the environment, and therefore the consistent use of the facility, not its mere existence, is likely to lead to health and environmental improvements. However and in much the same way as with water supply, care is needed to define an acceptable form of excreta disposal. A wide range of technologies is used, particularly for settings where low-cost solutions are required, and relevant research conducted elsewhere concluded that all types of facility can be operated hygienically. As a result, sanitation technologies are considered as providing adequate access to sanitation as long as they are private (but not shared / public) and hygienically separate human faeces from human contact.&lt;ref name="Joint Monitoring Programme 2010" /&gt; Likewise, the addition of hygiene education is required to see health impacts materialize, in particular the basic issues of [[hand washing]], proper disposal of faeces, and protection of drinking water. An integrated [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] approach for data collection would consequently provide decision-makers with greater diagnostic power than focussing separately on each of these three components.

The strength of WPM is comprehensiveness with respect to the sample of water points audited, which results in the need of roughly covering the overall area of intervention. The drawback of the WPM approach, however, is that the focus is on water points, while sanitation and hygiene data need to be collected at the household. An approach for WASH data collection that combines a water points mapping with a household-based survey might overcome previous constraint. The new methodology takes the WPM as a starting point to comprehensively record all improved water points, being the water point basic sampling unit. This information can be then combined with data provided from a household survey to assess sanitation and hygienic habits. In terms of method, the approach adopted includes: (i) identification and audit of all improved water points; (ii) calculation of a sample size of households that is representative at and below the district level; and (iii) random household selection at the water point.&lt;ref name="Giné et al 2010" /&gt;

== Applications  ==
WPM can be used to support different types of analysis, and specific applications include among others broad strategic planning, priority setting exercises and performance monitoring.&lt;ref name="MacDonald et al 2009" /&gt; Potential users of WPM outcomes include organizations that have water poverty alleviation as their mandate, for example, at the international level, UN agencies, the [[World Bank]], bilateral development agencies and international NGOs.

=== Planning at local level ===
Maps have come out a powerful tool for identifying and targeting the most deprived population, and therefore support poverty reduction initiatives. However, its potential remains underexploited. A recent study developed by [[WaterAid]] concluded that the use of this tool for better planning at the district level was still low despite the acknowledgment of its potential usefulness.&lt;ref name="WaterAid 2010" /&gt; Two major challenges in this regard were related to the regular updating of information and to the mechanisms to include WPM evidence in the planning process. This created a vicious circle, since the more outdated WPM data became, the less useful it was for planning purposes.

The INGO ISF-ApD and Same District Council (Tanzania) developed a methodology to update WPM data and use them to help inform planning decisions.&lt;ref name="Mwita et al 2010" /&gt; First activity was to prepare a District Water and Sanitation priority document. A set of objective criteria were defined (using WPM information) in order to rank communities based on service level and infrastructure status. Criteria used included among others coverage, need for rehabilitation, seasonality of services, quality of water delivered, and poor management.&lt;ref name="Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2010a" /&gt; Each criterion produced one different ranking, and this enabled an accurate prioritization of future interventions and rehabilitations in the district, a part from defining a wide range of related supporting activities. The priority document was approved and issued in September 2009 by the District Authority, and it was also used to set the priorities for all sector-related stakeholders operating within the district.

=== Analysis of functionality of water points ===
WPM data can be used to analyze the durability of water points depending on different factors such as time after construction, technology, management framework, or the approach adopted in the implementation.&lt;ref name="Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaterAid 2009" /&gt; Lessons that have been learned from this analysis might help local governments and other agencies to address the sustainability challenge.The Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx), launched in 2015, is a global platform for sharing water point data collected by governments, non-profit organizations, researchers, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.waterpointdata.org/|title = Water Point Data Exchange|date = 2015|accessdate = 13 August 2015|website = Water Point Data Exchange|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocacy ===
Maps are also a powerful tool for advocacy, since they provide clear messages and communicate complex information quickly and accurately. In addition, local governments have used mapping evidences to lobby for additional funding, and citizens have used them to pressure their representatives for better services.&lt;ref name="MacDonald et al 2009" /&gt;

At the same time, diverse initiatives are underway to display maps via web, as an attempt to foster accountability and disseminate WPM outputs to a broader public. For example, the h2.0 initiative of UN Habitat and Google, the Water Point Mapper developed by WaterAid, or the support made by the Water and Sanitation program to the establishment of WatSan portals in many African countries.

Researchers at [[Overseas Development Institute|ODI]] found that Water Mapping could improve accountability in service delivery. Accountability could be achieved through the creation of Community Maps and the public availability of mapping knowledge which empower the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping for better accountability in service delivery|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=44&amp;title=mapping-better-accountability-service-delivery|work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monitoring the sector ===
WPM is an adequate tool to support monitoring and evaluation of the sector. Water poverty follows a highly heterogeneous pattern, widely varying between and within different geographic and administrative units; and mapping permits a feasible visualization of such heterogeneity. In addition, maps are well suited to illustrate spatial change over time.
