"'''The American's Creed'''" is the title of a resolution passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on April 3, 1918. It is a statement written in 1917 by [[William Tyler Page]] as an entry into a patriotic contest.

'''Badaga''' is a southern [[Dravidian language]] spoken by approximately 135,000 people in the [[Nilgiri Hills]] of  [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="Steever 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steever|first=Sanford B.|title=The Dravidian languages|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|pages=6–7|isbn=978-0-415-10023-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for its [[R-colored vowel|retroflex vowels]]. It has similarities with neighbouring [[Kannada language]] as Hale Kannada, and has now been identified as an independent language by a French linguistic scholar, Christiane Pilot-Raichoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Thiagarajan | first =Shantha | title = Badaga language not a dialect of Kannada, claims French linguistic scholar| newspaper =The Times of India | date =4 December 2012 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-04/coimbatore/35593445_1_badaga-community-nilgiris-language|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word Badaga, meaning "northerner", refers to the Badaga language as well as the [[Badagas|Badaga indigenous people]] who speak it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a74HA_RX3rIC&amp;pg=PA391|title=A Badada-English Dictionary|page=391|publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]]|isbn=978-3110126778|year=1992|last= Hockings|first=Paul|last2=Pilot-Raichoor|first2=Christiane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Badaga has five vowels qualities, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}, each of which may be long or short and until the 1930s were contrastively half and fully retroflexed, for a total of 30 vowel phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;Emenau (1931) reports no tokens of {{IPA|/i˞˞/}}, but suggests this is an accidental gap.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current speakers only distinguish retroflection for a few vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Badaga |publisher=UCLA Phonetics Lab |url=http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/badaga/badaga.html |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Badaga script==
Several attempts were made at constructing an orthography based on [[English language|English]] and [[Kannada]]. The earliest printed book using [[Kannada script]] was a Christian work, "Anga Kartagibba Yesu Kristana Olleya Suddiya Pustaka" by Basel Mission Press of [[Mangaluru]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;http://gospelgo.com/q/Badaga%20Bible%20-%20Gospel%20of%20Luke.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Badaga language is also written in the [[Tamil script]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6952">'''Bayesian poisoning''' is a technique used by e-mail [[Spam (electronic)|spammers]] to attempt to degrade the effectiveness of [[spam filter]]s that rely on [[Bayesian spam filtering]]. Bayesian filtering relies on [[Bayesian probability]] to determine whether an incoming mail is spam or is not spam. The spammer hopes that the addition of random (or even carefully selected) words that are unlikely to appear in a spam message will cause the spam filter to believe the message to be legitimate—a statistical [[type II error]]. 

Spammers also hope to cause the spam filter to have a higher false positive rate by turning previously innocent words into spammy words in the Bayesian database (statistical [[type I error]]s) because a user who trains their spam filter on a poisoned message will be indicating to the filter that the words added by the spammer are a good indication of spam.

==Empirical results==
===Graham-Cumming===
At the Spam Conference held at MIT in 2004 John Graham-Cumming presented two possible attacks on [[POPFile]]'s Bayesian engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jgc.org/SpamConference011604.pps |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012080443/http://www.jgc.org/SpamConference011604.pps |archivedate=2006-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One was unsuccessful and the other worked, but was impractical. In doing this they identified two types of poisoning attack: passive (where words are added without any feedback to the spammer) and active (where the spammer gets feedback after the spam has been received).

The passive method of adding random words to a small spam was ineffective as a method of attack: only 0.04% of the modified spam messages were delivered. The active attack involved adding random words to a small spam and using a [[web bug]] to determine whether the spam was received. If it was, another Bayesian system was trained using the same poison words. After sending 10,000 spams to a single user he determined a small set of words that could be used to get a spam through.

The simple countermeasure of disabling remote images ([[Web_beacon|web bugs]]) in emails eliminates this problem.

===Wittel and Wu===
At the [[Conference on Email and Anti-Spam]] in 2004, Wittel and Wu presented a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceas.cc/2004/170.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429141017/http://www.ceas.cc/2004/170.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they showed that the passive addition of random words to spam was ineffective against [[CRM114 (program)|CRM114]], but effective against [[SpamBayes]] with 100 words added per spam.

They also showed that a smarter passive attack, adding common English words, was still ineffective against CRM114, but was even more effective against SpamBayes. They needed to add only 50 words to a spam to get it past SpamBayes.

However, Wittel and Wu's testing has been criticized due to the minimal header information that was present in the emails they were using; most Bayesian spam filters make extensive use of header information and other message metadata in determining the likelihood that a message is spam. A discussion of the SpamBayes results and some counter evidence can be found in the SpamBayes mailing list archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-dev/2004-September/thread.html#3065|title=The spambayes-dev September 2004 Archive by thread|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these attacks are type II attacks: attacks that attempt to get spam delivered. A type I attack attempts to cause false positives by turning previously innocent words into spammy words in the Bayesian database.

===Stern, Mason, and Shepherd===
Also in 2004 Stern, Mason and Shepherd wrote a technical report at [[Dalhousie University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.dal.ca/research/techreports/2004/CS-2004-06.shtml|title=Technical Reports - Faculty of Computer Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they detailed a passive type II attack. They added common English words to spam messages used for training and testing a spam filter.

In two tests they showed that these common words decreased the spam filter's precision (the percentage of messages classified as spam that really are spam) from 84% to 67% and from 94% to 84%. Examining their data shows that the poisoned filter was biased towards believing messages were more likely to be spam than "ham" (good email), thus increasing the false positive rate.

They proposed two countermeasures: ignoring common words when performing classification, and smoothing probabilities based on the trustworthiness of a word. A word has a trustworthy probability if an attacker is unlikely to be able to guess whether it is part of an individual's vocabulary. Thus common words are untrustworthy and their probability would be smoothed to 0.5 (making them neutral).

===Lowd and Meek===
At the 2005 Conference on Email and Anti-Spam Lowd and Meek presented a paper&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceas.cc/2005/125.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they demonstrated that passive attacks adding random or common words to spam were ineffective against a naïve Bayesian filter. (In fact, they showed, as John Graham-Cumming demonstrated back in 2004, that adding random words improves the spam filtering accuracy.)

They demonstrated that adding hammy words - words that are more likely to appear in ham (non-spam email content) than spam - was effective against a naïve Bayesian filter, and enabled spam to slip through. They went on to detail two active attacks (attacks that require feedback to the spammer) that were very effective against the spam filters. Of course, preventing any feedback to spammers (such as non-delivery reports, SMTP level errors or web bugs) defeats an active attack trivially.

They also showed that retraining the filter was effective at preventing all the attack types, even when the retraining data had been poisoned.

The published research shows that adding random words to spam messages is ineffective as a form of attack, but that active attacks are very effective and that adding carefully chosen words can work in some cases. To defend against these attacks it is vital that no feedback is received by spammers and that statistical filters are retrained regularly.

The research also shows that continuing to investigate attacks on statistical filters is worthwhile. Working attacks have been demonstrated and countermeasures are required to ensure that statistical filters remain accurate.

'''''Being and Time''''' ({{lang-de|Sein und Zeit}}) is a 1927 book by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], in which the author seeks to analyse the concept of Being. Heidegger maintains that this has fundamental importance for philosophy and that, since the time of the Ancient Greeks, philosophy has avoided the question, turning instead to the analysis of particular beings. Heidegger attempts to revive ontology through a reawakening of the question of the meaning of  being. He approaches this through a [[fundamental ontology]] that is a preliminary analysis of the being of the being to whom the question of being is important, i.e., ''[[Dasein]]''.

Heidegger wrote that ''Being and Time'' was made possible by his study of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900&amp;ndash;1901), and it is dedicated to Husserl "in friendship and admiration". Although Heidegger did not complete the project outlined in the introduction, ''Being and Time'' remains his most important work. It was immediately recognized as an original and groundbreaking philosophical work, and later became a focus of debates and controversy, and a profound influence on [[20th-century philosophy]], particularly [[existentialism]], [[hermeneutics]], [[deconstruction]], and the [[enactivism|enactivist]] approach to [[cognition]]. ''Being and Time'' has been described as the most influential version of existential philosophy, and Heidegger's achievements in the work have been compared to those of [[Immanuel Kant]] in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781) and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) and ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812&amp;ndash;1816). The work influenced philosophical treatises such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943). ''Sein und Zeit'' was first translated into English in 1962.

==Background==
According to Heidegger's statement in ''Being and Time'', the work was made possible by his study of Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900-1901).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heidegger, Martin |title=Being and Time |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York |year=2008 |page=62 |isbn=978-0-06-157559-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Being and Time'' was originally intended to consist of two major parts, each part consisting of three divisions.&lt;ref&gt;''Sein und Zeit'', pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger was forced to prepare the book for publication when he had completed only the first two divisions of part one. The remaining divisions planned for ''Being and Time'' (particularly the divisions on [[time]] and [[being]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Aristotle]]) were never published, although in many respects they were addressed in one form or another in Heidegger's other works. In terms of structure, ''Being and Time'' remains as it was when it first appeared in print; it consists of the lengthy two-part introduction, followed by Division One, the "Preparatory Fundamental Analysis of Dasein," and Division Two, "Dasein and Temporality."

==Summary==

===Being===
Heidegger describes his project in the following way: "our aim in the following treatise is to work out the question of the sense of ''being'' and to do so concretely."&lt;ref&gt;"Die konkrete Ausarbeitung der Frage nach dem Sinn von “''Sein''” ist die Absicht der folgenden Abhandlung." ''Sein und Zeit'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger claims that traditional [[ontology]] has prejudicially overlooked this question, dismissing it on the basis that being is the most universal and emptiest concept, that is indefinable or obvious.&lt;ref&gt;''Sein und Zeit'', pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead Heidegger proposes to understand being itself, as distinguished from any specific entities (beings).&lt;ref&gt;In other words, being is distinguished from beings such as physical objects or even, as Heidegger explains in his discussion of the "worldhood of the World," that entire collection of things that constitutes the physical universe. To preserve Heidegger's distinction, translators usually render ''Sein'' as "being," the gerund of "to be," and ''Seiend'' (singular) and ''Seiendes'' (plural) as the verb-derived noun "a being" and "beings," and occasionally, perhaps preferably, as "an entity" and "entities"."&lt;/ref&gt; "'Being' is not something like a being."&lt;ref&gt;"'Sein' ist nicht so etwas wie Seiendes." ''Sein und Zeit'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Being, Heidegger claims, is "what determines beings as beings, that in terms of which beings are already understood."&lt;ref&gt;"...das Sein, das, was Seiendes als Seiendes bestimmt, das, woraufhin Seiendes, mag es wie immer erörtert werden, je schon verstanden ist,"''Sein und Zeit'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger is seeking to identify the criteria or conditions by which any specific entity can show up at all (see [[world disclosure]]).&lt;ref&gt;In English, using the word "existence" instead of "being" might seem more natural and less confusing, but Heidegger, who stresses the importance of the origins of words, uses his understanding of grammar to assist in his investigation of "being," and he reserves the word "existence" to describe that defining type of being that Dasein (human consciousness) has.&lt;/ref&gt;

If we grasp Being, we will clarify the meaning of being, or "sense" of being (''Sinn des Seins''), where by "sense" Heidegger means that "in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something."&lt;ref&gt;"aus dem her etwas als etwas verständlich wird," ''Sein und Zeit'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in relation to the quality of knowledge, according to Heidegger,  this sense of being precedes any notions of how or in what manner any particular being or beings exist, and is thus pre-scientific.&lt;ref&gt;''Sein und Zeit'', pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Heidegger's view, the question of the meaning of being would be an explanation of the understanding preceding any other way of knowing, such as the use of logic, theory, specific regional ontology.&lt;ref name="Ibid., p. 12"&gt;''Sein und Zeit'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is no access to being other than via beings themselves—hence pursuing the question of being inevitably means questioning a being with regard to its being.&lt;ref&gt;''Sein und Zeit'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger argues that a true understanding of being (''Seinsverständnis'') can only proceed by referring to particular beings, and that the best method of pursuing being must inevitably, he says, involve a kind of [[hermeneutic circle]], that is (as he explains in his critique of prior work in the field of [[hermeneutics]]), it must rely upon repetitive yet progressive acts of interpretation. "The methodological sense of phenomenological description is ''interpretation''."&lt;ref&gt;"der methodische Sinn der Phänomenologischen Deskription ist ''Auslegung,''" ''Sein und Zeit'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dasein''===
Thus the question Heidegger asks in the introduction to ''Being and Time'' is: what is the being that will give access to the question of the meaning of Being? Heidegger's answer is that it can only be that being for whom the question of Being is important, the being for whom Being matters.&lt;ref name="Ibid., p. 12"/&gt; As this answer already indicates, the being for whom Being is a question is not a ''what'', but a ''who''. Heidegger calls this being ''[[Dasein]]'' (an ordinary German word literally meaning "being-there," i.e., ''existence''), and the method pursued in ''Being and Time'' consists in the attempt to delimit the characteristics of ''Dasein'', in order thereby to approach the meaning of Being itself through an interpretation of the temporality of Dasein. ''Dasein'' is not "man," but is nothing other than "man"—it is this distinction that enables Heidegger to claim that ''Being and Time'' is something other than [[philosophical anthropology]].

Heidegger's account of Dasein passes through a dissection of the experiences of ''[[Angst]]'' and mortality, and then through an analysis of the structure of "care" as such. From there he raises the problem of "authenticity," that is, the potentiality or otherwise for mortal ''Dasein'' to exist ''fully'' enough that it might actually understand being. Heidegger is clear throughout the book that nothing makes certain that ''Dasein'' is capable of this understanding.

===Time===
Finally, this question of the authenticity of individual ''Dasein'' cannot be separated from the "historicality" of ''Dasein''. On the one hand, ''Dasein'', as mortal, is "stretched along" between birth and death, and thrown into its world, that is, thrown into its ''possibilities'', possibilities which ''Dasein'' is charged with the task of assuming. On the other hand, ''Dasein's'' access to this world and these possibilities is always via a history and a tradition—this is the question of "world historicality," and among its consequences is Heidegger's argument that ''Dasein's'' potential for authenticity lies in the possibility of choosing a "hero."

Thus, more generally, the outcome of the progression of Heidegger's argument is the thought that the being of ''Dasein'' is time. Nevertheless, Heidegger concludes his work with a set of enigmatic questions foreshadowing the necessity of a destruction (that is, a transformation) of the history of philosophy in relation to temporality—these were the questions to be taken up in the never completed continuation of his project:

{{bquote|The existential and ontological constitution of the totality of Dasein is grounded in temporality. Accordingly, a primordial mode of temporalizing of ecstatic temporality itself must make the ecstatic project of being in general possible. How is this mode of temporalizing of temporality to be interpreted? Is there a way leading from primordial ''time'' to the meaning of ''being''? Does ''time'' itself reveal itself as the horizon of ''being''?&lt;ref&gt;''Sein und Zeit'', p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Phenomenology in Heidegger and Husserl==
Although Heidegger describes his method in ''Being and Time'' as phenomenological, the question of its relation to the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of Husserl is complex. The fact that Heidegger believes that ontology includes an irreducible hermeneutic (interpretative) aspect, for example, might be thought to run counter to Husserl's claim that phenomenological description is capable of a form of scientific positivity. On the other hand, however, several aspects of the approach and method of ''Being and Time'' seem to relate more directly to Husserl's work.

The central Husserlian concept of the directedness of all thought—[[intentionality]]—for example, while scarcely mentioned in ''Being and Time'', has been identified by some with Heidegger's central notion of ''[[Care (philosophy)|Sorge]]'' (''cura'', care or concern).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, D. C., ed., ''The Presocratics after Heidegger'' ([[Albany, New York|Albany]]: [[SUNY Press|State University of New York Press]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Oo5u3IMZe8IC&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 129].&lt;/ref&gt; However, for Heidegger, ''theoretical'' knowledge represents only one kind of intentional behaviour, and he asserts that it is grounded in more fundamental modes of behaviour and forms of practical engagement with the surrounding world. Whereas a theoretical understanding of things grasps them according to "presence," for example, this may conceal that our first experience of a being may be in terms of its being "ready-to-hand." Thus, for instance, when someone reaches for a tool such as a hammer, their understanding of what a hammer ''is'' is not determined by a theoretical understanding of its presence, but by the fact that it is something we need at the moment we wish to do hammering. Only a ''later'' understanding might come to contemplate a hammer ''as'' an object.

==Hermeneutics==
The total understanding of being results from an explication of the implicit knowledge of being that inheres in ''Dasein''. Philosophy thus becomes a form of interpretation, but since there is no external reference point outside being from which to begin this interpretation, the question becomes to know in which way to proceed with this interpretation. This is the problem of the "hermeneutic circle," and the necessity for the interpretation of the meaning of being to proceed in stages: this is why Heidegger's technique in ''Being and Time'' is sometimes referred to as [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

==Destruction of metaphysics==
As part of his [[ontology|ontological]] project, Heidegger undertakes a reinterpretation of previous Western philosophy. He wants to explain why and how theoretical knowledge came to seem like the most fundamental relation to being. This explanation takes the form of a destructuring (''[[Destruktion]]'') of the philosophical tradition, an interpretative strategy that reveals the fundamental experience of being at the base of previous philosophies that had become entrenched and hidden within the theoretical attitude of the [[metaphysics of presence]]. This use of the word ''Destruktion'' is meant to signify not a negative operation but rather a positive transformation or recovery.

In ''Being and Time'' Heidegger briefly undertakes a destructuring of the philosophy of [[René Descartes]], but the second volume, which was intended to be a ''Destruktion'' of Western philosophy in all its stages, was never written. In later works Heidegger uses this approach to interpret the philosophies of Aristotle, Kant, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Plato]], among others.

==Related work==
''Being and Time'' is the major achievement of Heidegger's early career, but he produced other important works from this period:
*The publication in 1992 of the early lecture course, ''Platon: Sophistes'' (''Plato's Sophist'', 1924), made clear the way in which Heidegger's reading of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' was crucial to the formulation of the thought expressed in ''Being and Time''.
*The lecture course, ''Prolegomena zur Geschichte des Zeitbegriffs'' (''History of the Concept of Time: Prolegomena'', 1925), was something like an early version of ''Being and Time''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Kisiel|Kisiel, T.]], ''The Genesis of Heidegger's'' Being and Time ([[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Los Angeles]], [[London]]: [[University of California Press]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_64wDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA568#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 568].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The lecture courses immediately following the publication of ''Being and Time'', such as ''Die Grundprobleme der Phänomenologie'' (''The Basic Problems of Phenomenology'', 1927), and ''Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik'' (''Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics'', 1929), elaborated some elements of the destruction of metaphysics which Heidegger intended to pursue in the unwritten second part of ''Being and Time''.

Although Heidegger did not complete the project outlined in ''Being and Time'', later works explicitly addressed the themes and concepts of ''Being and Time''. Most important among the works which do so are the following:
*Heidegger's inaugural lecture upon his return to [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], "''Was ist Metaphysik?''" ("What Is Metaphysics?," 1929), was an important and influential clarification of what Heidegger meant by being, non-being, and nothingness.
*''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Einführung in die Metaphysik]]'' (''An Introduction to Metaphysics''), a lecture course delivered in 1935, is identified by Heidegger, in his preface to the seventh German edition of ''Being and Time'', as relevant to the concerns which the second half of the book would have addressed.
*''[[Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)|Beiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis)]]'' (''Contributions to Philosophy [From Enowning]'', composed 1936–38, published 1989), a sustained attempt at reckoning with the legacy of ''Being and Time''.

This was Heidegger's most direct confrontation with ''Being and Time''. It was followed by a seminar on the lecture, which took place at [[Todtnauberg]] on September 11–13, 1962, a summary of which was written by Alfred Guzzoni.{{refn|"There is put to the thinking of Being the task of thinking Being in such a way that oblivion essentially belongs to it."—Alfred Guzzoni, 1972, p. 29|group=n}} Both the lecture and the summary of the seminar are included in ''Zur Sache des Denkens'' (1969; translated as ''On Time and Being'' [New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972]).

==Influence and reception==
''Being and Time'' has been seen as a product of the crisis of German culture following Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], and has been compared in this respect to works such as [[Ernst Bloch]]'s ''The Spirit of Utopia'' (1918), [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918), [[Franz Rosenzweig]]'s ''The Star of Redemption'' (1921), [[Karl Barth]]'s ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' (1922), and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steiner, George |title=Martin Heidegger |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1991 |pages=vii-viii |isbn=0-226-77232-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its publication, it was recognized as a groundbreaking philosophical work, with reviewers crediting Heidegger with "brilliance" and "genius".&lt;ref name="Schmidt" /&gt; The book, which has been described as the "most influential version of existential philosophy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wagner, Helmut R. |title=Phenomenology of Consciousness and Sociology of the Life-world: An Introductory Study |publisher=The University of Alberta Press |location=Edmonton |year=1983 |page=214 |isbn=0-88864-032-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; quickly became "the focus of debates and controversy".&lt;ref name="Schmidt" /&gt; Heidegger claimed in the 1930s that commentators had attempted to show similarities between his views and those of Hegel in order to undermine the idea that ''Being and Time'' was an original work. In response, Heidegger maintained that his thesis that the essence of being is time is the opposite of Hegel's view that being is the essence of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heidegger, Martin |title=Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1994 |pages=144-145 |isbn=0-253-20910-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Jaspers]], writing in the first volume of his work ''Philosophy'' (1932), credited Heidegger with making essential points about "being in the world" and also about "existence and historicity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaspers, Karl |title=Philosophy. Volume 1 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1969 |page=103 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's work has been suggested as a possible influence on [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity]]'' (1932), though Marcuse later questioned the political implications of Heidegger's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Benhabib, Seyla |author2=Marcuse, Herbert |title=Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1987 |pages=xxxii, x, xl |isbn=0-262-13221-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who wrote ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943) under the influence of Heidegger's work,&lt;ref name="Scrutonp181" /&gt; has been said to have responded to ''Being and Time'' with "a sense of shock".&lt;ref name="Scrutonp240" /&gt; Sartre's existentialism has been described as "a version and variant of the idiom and propositions" in ''Being and Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steiner, George |title=Martin Heidegger |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1991 |page=5 |isbn=0-226-77232-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Heidegger's revival of the question of being, ''Being and Time'' also influenced other philosophers of Sartre's generation,&lt;ref name="Scrutonp181" /&gt; and it altered the course of [[French philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Scrutonp240"&gt;{{cite book |author=Scruton, Roger |title=Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |year=2016 |page=240 |isbn=978-1-4729-3595-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] argued in ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' (1945) that ''Being and Time'', "springs from an indication given by Husserl and amounts to no more than an explicit account of the 'natürlicher Weltbegriff' or the 'Lebenswelt' which Husserl, towards the end of his life, identified as the central theme of phenomenology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Merleau-Ponty, Maurice |title=Phenomenology of Perception |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |location=London |year=1965 |page=vii |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger influenced psychoanalysis through [[Jacques Lacan]], who quotes from ''Being and Time'' in a 1953 text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lacan|first=Jacques|date=2006|orig-year=1953|editor-last=Fink|editor-first=Bruce|title=The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis|url=|journal=Ecrits: The First Complete Edition in English|publisher=W.

He considers Heidegger's language "metaphorical" and almost incomprehensible. Scruton suggests that this necessarily follows from the nature of Heidegger's phenomenological method. He finds Heidegger's "description of the world of phenomena" to be "fascinating, but maddeningly abstract". He suggests that much of ''Being and Time'' is a "description of a private spiritual journey" rather than genuine philosophy, and notes that Heidegger's assertions are unsupported by argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Scruton, Roger |title=A Short History of Modern Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2002 |pages=269-271, 274 |isbn=0-415-26763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Houlgate compares Heidegger's achievements in ''Being and Time'' to those of Kant in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781) and Hegel in ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) and ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812-1816).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Houlgate, Stephen |title=The Hegel Reader |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Oxford |year=1999 |page=ix |isbn=0-631-20347-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Critchley]] calls the work Heidegger's ''[[magnum opus]]'', and writes that it is impossible to understand developments in continental philosophy after Heidegger without understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Critchley|first1=Simon|title=Being and Time, part 1: Why Heidegger Matters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/05/heidegger-philosophy|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis J. Schmidt]] praises the "range and subtlety" of ''Being and Time'', and describes its importance by quoting a comment the writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] made in a different context, "from here and today a new epoch of world history sets forth."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schmidt, Dennis J. |author2=Heidegger, Martin |title=Being and Time |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2010 |pages=xv, xviii |isbn=978-1-4384-3276-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger has become common background for the political movement concerned with protection of the environment, and his narrative of the history of Being frequently appears when capitalism, [[consumerism]] and technology are thoughtfully opposed. [[Michael E. Zimmerman]] writes that, "Because he criticized technological modernity’s domineering attitude toward nature, and because he envisioned a postmodern era in which people would “let things be,” Heidegger has sometimes been read as an intellectual forerunner of today’s “deep ecology” movement.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/ArtsSciences/CHA/profiles/zimmpdf/heidegger_deep_ecology.pdf |title=intellectual forerunner of today’s "deep ecology" movement |publisher=University of Colorado Boulder |work=Heidegger and Deep Ecology |date=November 2011 |accessdate=May 24, 2015 |author=Michael E.

'''Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay''' ({{audio|Bibhutibhushan_Bandopadhyay_pronunciation.ogg|listen|''Bibhutibhushon Bôndopaddhae''}}) (12 September 1894 – 1 November 1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbpublibnet.gov.in/scl/html/departed_writers.php|title=State Central Library Kolkata|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[India]]n [[Bengali language|Bengali]] author, and one of the leading writers of modern [[Bengali literature]]. His best known work is the autobiographical novel, ''[[Pather Panchali (novel)|Pather Panchali]]'' (''The Song of the Road''). He was posthumously awarded the [[Rabindra Puraskar]] in 1951, the most prestigious literary award in [[West Bengal]], for his novel ''Ichhamati''.&lt;ref name="Sekhar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sekhar |first=Saumitra |year=2012 |chapter=Bandyopadhyay, Bibhutibhushan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bandyopadhyay,_Bibhutibhushan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The Bandyopadhyay family originated in the Panitar village near [[Basirhat]], located in the [[North 24 Parganas district]] of modern-day West Bengal. Bandyopadhyay's great-grandfather, who was an [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] physician, eventually settled in Barakpur village, near [[Gopalnagar, North 24 Parganas|Gopalnagar]], Banagram (now [[Bangaon]]), North 24 Parganas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chattopadhyay |first1= Sunil Kumar |title= Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay |edition= 1st|series=Makers of Indian Literature |year= 1994 |publisher= Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi  |isbn= 81-7201-578-X |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bandyopadhyay was born in Muratipur village, near [[Kalyani, West Bengal|Kalyani]] in [[Nadia district|Nadia]], at his maternal uncle's house. His father, Mahananda Bandyopadhyay, was a [[Sanskrit]] scholar and story-teller by profession. Bandyopadhyay was the eldest of the five children of Mahananda and his wife Mrinalini. His childhood home was at Barakpur village, near Gopalnagar.

==Education==
Bandyopadhyay studied at [[Bongaon High School]], one of the oldest institutions in [[Presidencies and provinces of British India#Provinces of India (1858–1947)|British India]], and was considered as a talented student. Following a first division placement in the Entrance and Intermediate Arts examinations, Bandyopadhyay completed his undergraduate degree in economics, history, and [[sanskrit]] at the [[Surendranath College]] (then Ripon College) in [[Kolkata]]. He was admitted to the [[Master's degree#Titles|master's degree (MA)]] and Law classes, but could not afford to enroll for the postgraduate course at the [[University of Calcutta]], and joined as a teacher in a school in [[Jangipara]], [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]].&lt;ref name=Sekhar /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/bibhutibhushan-bandopadhyay-biography.html Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay] ''iloveindia.com''. Retrieved 19 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bandyopadhyay worked in a variety of jobs to support both himself and his family before becoming a writer. His first job was as a teacher, but he also served as a travelling publicist for [[Cow protection movement#1800s|Goraksini Sabha]], and later as a secretary for [[Pathuriaghata#The Ghosh family|Khelatchandra Ghosh]], a role that included the management of his [[Bhagalpur]] estate. He became involved with Khelatchandra, a prominent name in music and charity, while tutoring his family. He also taught at the Khelatchandra Memorial School.&lt;ref name=Sekhar /&gt; Eventually, Bandyopadhyay returned to his native place. He started working as a teacher in the Gopalnagar School, which he continued alongside his literary work, until his death. He wrote and published ''Pather Panchali w''hile staying at [[Ghatshila]], a town in [[Jharkhand]].

==Works==
Bandyopadhyay's works are largely set in rural Bengal, with characters from that area. Several of his novels are set in [[Bangaon|Bongaon]], including ''Pather Panchali'', ''Adarsha Hindu Hotel'', ''Ichamati,'' and ''Bipiner Sansar''. In 1921, Bandyopadhyay's first published short story, "Upekshita" appeared in ''[[Prabasi]]'', at the time one of Bengal's leading literary magazines. However, he did not receive any critical attention until 1928, when his first novel ''Pather Panchali'' (also known in English as ''Song of the Little Road'') was published (initially as a serial, then as a book in 1929). ''Pather Panchali'' brought Bandyopadhyay to prominence in Bengali literature, and the novel and its sequel ''Aparajito'', were subsequently translated into numerous languages.&lt;ref name="Sekhar" /&gt; Additionally, these two were made into films by [[Satyajit Ray]], and together with ''[[The World of Apu|Apur Sansar]]'', formed the highly successful ''[[Apu Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref name="Middle"&gt;{{cite web|title=The world of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay|url=http://middlestage.blogspot.com/2005/09/world-of-bibhutibhushan-bandyopadhyay.html|work=The Middle Stage: Essays on Indian and world literature|publisher=Chandrahas|accessdate=3 April 2012|author=Chandrahas|format=Web page (blog)|date=18 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray referred aspiring scriptwriters to the works of Bandyopadhyay, and praised him by saying, "His lines fit the characters so well, they are so revealing that even when the author provides no physical description, every character seems to present itself before us simply through the words it speaks".&lt;ref name="Middle" /&gt;

===Ichhamati===
''Ichhamati'' reflects and documents a period of caste stratified culture, the life of rural society along the banks of the [[Ichamati River]], in undivided Bengal. The novel captures [[Indigofera|indigo]] planters, plantation life, and [[Caste system in India|caste society]] in Bengal during the early 20th century, in vivid detail. Relationships are sensitively portrayed in the narrative, with the author exploring the subtle nuances contained therein. Readers have praised the detailed descriptions of nature and the unselfconscious, but poetic portrayal of the flora and fauna on the banks of the Ichamati River. ''Ichamati'' has also been described as a deeply spiritual piece of writing, with [[Advaita Vedanta]] holding particular relevance to the contained dialogue.

===Critical reception===
Bandyopadhyay wrote 16 novels, and over two hundred short stories. His style as a Bengali novelist has often been compared to [[Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay|Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]]. ''Pather Panchali'' is considered Bandyopadhyay's masterpiece, and is included in the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] syllabus for students choosing to study [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Author [[Humayun Azad]] opined, that the novel form of ''Pather Panchali'' is superior to its cinematic rendition. Azad's view is not necessarily a commonly held one in the West, as the ''Apu Trilogy'' is considered among the finest films in the history of cinema. The unavailability of a complete English translation of the novel creates difficulty in comparing the two separate works for the English-speaking audience (the available translation by T. W. Clark and Tarapada Mukherji is a truncated version). However, in the Bengali-speaking world, the stature of the novel is uncontested.

[[Amit Chaudhuri]] has translated a few excerpts from the novel for inclusion in the anthology, ''The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature''. In his introduction to these excerpts, Chaudhuri wrote, "Unique for its tenderness and poetry ... ''Pather Panchali'' rejects both nineteenth-century [[Literary realism|realism]] and [[social realism]] (the social milieu described in it would have logically lent itself to the latter) for an inquiry into perception and memory."&lt;ref&gt;The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature, edited by Amit Chaudhuri, (p. 66)&lt;/ref&gt; The complete text of ''Aparajito'' has been translated into English by Gopa Majumdar. The novel ''Aranyak'' has been translated into English in January 2017 by Suchismita Banerjee Rai, and it has been published by Mitra and Ghosh Publishers based in [[Kolkata]].

[[Martin Seymour-Smith]], in his ''Guide to Modern World Literature'' (1973), describes Bandyopadhyay (he uses the form Banerji) as "perhaps the best of all modern Indian novelists", going on to write that, "probably nothing in twentieth-century Indian literature, in prose or poetry, comes to the level of ''Pather Panchali''".&lt;ref&gt;Guide to Modern World Literature, Martin Seymour-Smith (p. 712)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:House of Bibhutibhuasan.jpg|thumb|250px|Bibhutibhusan's House, Ghatshila.]]
Bandyopadhyay spent his early days in abject poverty, and subsequently he supported his family financially, though the extent of his support is unknown. He had a stout build and walked miles in the woods every day, usually taking his notebook for the purpose of writing whilst surrounded by the wilderness.

His first wife Gouri Devi died of [[cholera]], a year after their marriage. Her death and Bandopadhyay's consequent loneliness led to a theme of tragedy that became a recurrent [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] in his early writings. At the age of 46, he married Rama Chattopadhyay. Their son, Taradas, was born in 1947.

===Death===
Bandopadhyay died on 1 November 1950, in [[Ghatshila]]. The cause of death was identified as a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bandopadhyay's Death|url=http://www.bengalibooksonline.com/author-profile.php?author_id=542|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conrad Neitz==
The first [[Bible translation]] into the [[Kalmyk language]] was about 1750 by Conrad Neitz, Morovian missionary at [[Sarepta]].&lt;ref&gt;George Anthony King, In Our Tongues, p77&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Schmidt==
[[Isaac Jacob Schmidt]], a Moravian, translated the gospels, publishing Matthew in St. Petersburg in 1815. This was the first book to be printed in the Kalmyk language. The remaining gospels and Acts were published by 1821, and the whole New Testament by 1827.

==Pozdneev==
In 1880 [[Aleksei Matveevich Pozdneev]] (1851–1920) and Archpriest Smirnoff were employed to translate Matthew. Prof. Pozdneev made two journeys to [[Astrakhan]] to work at the translation among the people; and in 1884 2,000 copies of the four gospels were authorised, new type being cut at the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]'s expense: the number was increased to 4,000 with 1,000 additional of each Gospel, and Gospels published in 1887. 

On the death of Smirnoff, M. D. Kutusov, a native speaker of Kalmyk and lecturer in St. Petersburg University, assisted Pozdneev (1887). In 1887 Pozdneev visited Astrakhan, correcting his Acts and distributing Gospels; he also visited nomadic camps and read to all, including Buddhists. After three more journeys to the steppes he completed the New Testament, Acts to Revelation (Dordzhe Kulusoff assisted Pozdneev for this part of the translation). Printing was delayed by his having to undertake an expedition to Chinese Turkestan in 1893; but with the aid of Docent Pussell{{Who|date=May 2011}} printing was completed in 1895. The individual gospels were reprinted again in 1896 by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Shanghai.

==Mather==
[[Percy Mather]] also worked on Kalmyk Bible translation in Xinjiang, but his work seems to have been lost. 

==IBT==
The Institute for Bible Translation is working on a translation into modern Kalmyk. The New Testament is complete, and was published in 2002 as Шин Бооцан.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}

'''Bloody''', as an [[adverb]], is a commonly used [[expletive attributive]] ([[intensifier]]) in [[British English]], [[Australian English]], and a number of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. It has been used as an intensive since at least the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;Sterfania Biscetti, The diachronic development of ''bloody'': a case study in historical pragmatics. In Richard Dury, Maurizio Gotti, Marina Dossena (eds.) "English Historical Linguistics 2006 Volume 2: Lexical and semantic change". Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company. 2008, pg 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered "respectable" until about 1750, it was heavily tabooed during c. 1750&amp;ndash;1920, considered equivalent to heavily obscene or profane speech.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Public use continued to be seen as controversial until the 1960s, but since the later 20th century, the word has become a comparatively mild expletive or intensifier. In [[American English]], the word is uncommon and is seen by American audiences as a stereotypical marker of British English, without any significant obscene or profane connotation.

==Origin==
Use of the adjective ''bloody'' as a profane intensifier predates the 18th century. Its ultimate origin is unclear, and several hypotheses have been suggested.

It may be a direct loan of Dutch ''bloote'', used "in the adverbial sense of entire, complete, pure, naked", which was suggested by Ker (1837) to have been "transformed into ''bloody'', in the consequently absurd phrases of ''bloody good'', ''bloody bad'', ''bloody thief'', ''bloody angry'', etc., where it simply implies completely, entirely, purely, very, truly, and has no relation to either blood or murder, except by corruption of the word."&lt;ref&gt;John Bellenden Ker, An Essay on the Archæology of our Popular Phrases and Nursery Rhymes, London:Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Co., 1837, pg 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "blood" in Dutch and German is used as part of [[minced oath]]s, in abbreviation of expressions referring to "God's blood", i.e. [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]] or the [[Eucharist]]. [[Ernest Weekley]] (1921) relates English usage to imitation of purely intensive use of Dutch ''bloed'' and German ''Blut'' in the early modern period.

A popularly reported theory suggested euphemistic derivation from the phrase  ''by Our Lady''. The contracted form ''by'r Lady'' is common in [[Shakespeare]]'s plays around the turn of the 17th century, and [[Jonathan Swift]] about 100 years later writes both "it grows by'r Lady cold" and "it was bloody hot walking to-day"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_15/Journal_to_Stella_%E2%80%93_Letter_24 |title=The Journal to Stella, by Jonathan Swift : Letter 24 |publisher=Etext.library.adelaide.edu.au |date=1711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that ''bloody'' and ''by'r Lady''  had become exchangeable generic intensifiers.
However, [[Eric Partridge]] (1933) describes the supposed derivation of ''bloody'' as a further contraction of ''by'r lady'' as "phonetically implausible".

{{
[[Geoffrey Hughes]] in ''Swearing: A social history of foul langyuage, oaths and profanity in English'' ([[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]], 1991), points out that "by my lady" is not an adjective whereas ''bloody'' is, and suggests that the slang use of the term started with ''bloody drunk'' meaning "fired up and ready for a fight".

In contrast, *this* immediately following text seems to be a comment by an editor who removed the previous brace-enclosed material from the rendered portion of the article text:
{{
not sure what this is supposed to add other than that this author in 1991(!) was not even aware of the adverbial use of ''by'r lady'' just cited

According to ''Rawson's dictionary of Euphemisms'' (1995), attempts to derive ''bloody'' from minced oaths for "by our lady" or "God's blood" are based on the attempt to explain the word's extraordinary shock power in the 18th to 19th centuries, but they disregard that the earliest records of the word as an intensifier in the 17th to early 18th century do not reflect any taboo or profanity. It seems more likely, according to Rawson, that the taboo against the word arose secondarily, perhaps because of an association with [[menstruation]].&lt;ref&gt;"More likely, the taboo stemmed from the fear that many people have of blood and, in the minds of some, from an association with menstrual bleeding. Whatever, the term was debarred from polite society during the whole of the nineteenth century." Rawson (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxford English Dictionary prefers the theory that it arose from aristocratic rowdies known as "bloods", hence "bloody drunk" means "drunk as a blood".&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bloody&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of use==
Until at least the early 18th century, the word was used innocuously.  
It is used as an intensifier without apparent implication of profanity by 18th-century authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] and [[Jonathan Swift]] (''“It was bloody hot walking today”'' in 1713) and [[Samuel Richardson]] (''“He is bloody passionate.”'' in 1742).

After about 1750 the word assumed more [[profanity|profane]] connotations. [[A Dictionary of the English Language|Johnson (1755)]] already calls it "very vulgar", and the original [[Oxford English Dictionary]] article of 1888 comments the word is "now constantly in the mouths of the lowest classes, but by respectable people considered 'a horrid word', on par with obscene or profane language."

On the opening night of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s comedy ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' in 1914, [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], in the role of Eliza Doolittle, created a sensation with the line "Walk! Not bloody likely!" and this led to a fad for using "Pygmalion" itself as a pseudo-oath, as in "Not Pygmalion likely",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/apps26/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=106299&amp;section=filmfact]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-blo1.htm |title=Bloody |publisher=World Wide Words |date=2006-04-01 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''bloody'' was referred to as "the Shavian adjective" in polite society.

The character Geoffrey Fisher in [[Keith Waterhouse]]'s play [[Billy Liar]] (1959) is notable for his continual use of the word 'bloody'. Waterhouse's stage directions make it clear that if this is considered offensive the word should be omitted entirely and not [[bowdlerisation|bowdlerised]] to ''ruddy'' or some other word.

The use of 'bloody' in adult UK broadcasting aroused controversy in the 1960s and 1970s, but it has since become mild expletive and is used more freely.

==Usage outside the UK==
''Bloody'' has always been a very common part of [[Australian English|Australian speech]] and has not been considered profane there for some time. The word was dubbed "the Australian adjective" by ''[[The Bulletin]]'' on 18 August 1894. One Australian performer, [[Kevin Bloody Wilson]], has even made it his middle name. Also in Australia, the word ''bloody'' is frequently used as a verbal hyphen,  or infix, correctly called [[tmesis]] as in "fanbloodytastic". In the 1940s an Australian divorce court judge held that "the word ''bloody'' is so common in modern parlance that it is not regarded as swearing".  Meanwhile, [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government was fining Britons for using the word in public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The word as an expletive is seldom used in the [[United States|United States of America]]. In the US the term is usually used when the intention is to mimic an Englishman. 
Because it is not perceived as profane in [[American English]], "bloody" is generally not censored when used in American television and film, for example in the 1961 film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' the actor [[Richard Harris]] at one point says: ''"You can't even see the bloody cave, let alone the bloody guns. And anyway, we haven't got a bloody bomb big enough to smash that bloody rock..."'' - but ''bloody'' was replaced with ''ruddy'' for British audiences of the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The term is used somewhat frequently in Canada, especially in the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Newfoundland]]. Younger Canadians generally do not consider the term to be offensive; however, older Canadians of British origin might.

In [[Singapore]], the word ''bloody'' is commonly used as a mild expletive in [[Singlish|Singapore's colloquial English]]. The roots of this expletive derives from the influence and informal language British officers used during the dealing and training of soldiers in the [[Singapore Volunteer Corps]] and the early days of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]. When more Singaporeans were promoted officers within the Armed Forces, most new local officers applied similar training methods their former British officers had when they were cadets or trainees themselves. This includes some aspects of British Army lingo, like "bloody (something)". When the newly elected Singapore government implemented compulsory conscription, all 18 year old able bodied Singapore males had to undergo training within the Armed Forces. When National servicemen completed their service term, some brought the many expletives they picked up during their service into the civilian world and thus became a part of the common culture in the city state. The word 'bloody' also managed to spread to the north in neighbouring Malaysia, to where the influence of Singapore English has spread. The use of 'bloody' as a substitute for more explicit language increased with the popularity of British and Australian films and television shows aired on local television programmes. The term ''bloody'' in Singapore may not be considered explicit, but its usage is frowned upon in formal settings.

The term is frequently used among [[South Africa]]ns in their colloquial English and it is an [[intensifier]]. It is used in both [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] and non-explicit ways. It also spread to [[Afrikaans]] as "bloedige" and is popular amongst all citizens in the country. It is also used by [[Minor (law)|minors]] and is not considered to be offensive.

==Euphemisms==
Many substitutions were devised{{year needed|date=November 2015}} to convey the essence of the oath, but with less offence; these included ''bleeding'', ''bleaking'', ''cruddy'', ''smuddy'', ''blinking'', ''blooming'', ''bally'', ''woundy'', '' flaming'' and ''ruddy''.

Publications such as newspapers, police reports, and so on may{{year needed|date=November 2015}} print ''b__y'' instead of the full profanity.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{Citation|title=Oxford English Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A spoken language equivalent is ''blankety'' or, less frequently, ''blanked'' or ''blanky''; the spoken words are all variations of ''blank'', which, as a verbal representation of a [[dash]], is used as a [[euphemism]] for a variety of "bad" words.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

==In composition==
Use of ''bloody'' as an adverbial or generic intensifier is to be distinguished from its fixed use in the expressions "bloody murder" and "bloody hell".

In "bloody murder", it has the original sense of an adjective used literally. 
The [[King James Version]] of the Bible frequently uses ''bloody'' as an adjective in reference to bloodshed or violent crime, as in "bloody crimes" (Ezekiel 22:2), "Woe to the bloody city" (Ezekiel 24:6, Nahum 3:1). "bloody men" (26:9, Psalms 59:2, 139:19), etc. The expression of "bloody murder" goes back to at least Elizabethan English, as in Shakespeare's ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (c. 1591), "bloody murder or detested rape".
The expression "scream bloody murder" (in the figurative or desemanticised sense of "to loudly object to something" attested since c. 1860)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/idioms/scream+bloody+murder |title=Idioms Dictionary &amp;#124; Common Idioms and Phrases in English Language &amp;#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now considered American English, while in British English, the euphemistic "blue murder" had replaced "bloody murder" during the period of "bloody" being considered taboo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-blu4.htm worldwidewords.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression "bloody [[hell]]" is now  used as a (slightly rude) general expression of surprise or as a general intensifier; e.g. "bloody hell" being used repeatedly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001, [[PG Rating]]).

In March 2006 [[Australia]]'s national tourism commission launched an [[advertising campaign]] targeted at potential visitors in several English-speaking countries.  The ad sparked controversy because of its ending (in which a cheerful, bikini-clad spokeswoman delivers the ad's call-to-action by saying "...[[so where the bloody hell are you?]]"). In the UK the [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre|BACC]] required that a modified version of the ad be shown in the United Kingdom, without the word "bloody",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315091147/http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/bloody-ad-ban-incredibly-ludicrous/2007/03/28/1174761533507.html|title=Brit ban on 'bloody' ad 'incredibly ludicrous' - Travel|last=|first=|date=28 March 2007|website=Sunday Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315091147/http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/bloody-ad-ban-incredibly-ludicrous/2007/03/28/1174761533507.html|archive-date=15 March 2016|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in May 2006, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|ASA]] ruled that the word ''bloody'' was not an inappropriate marketing tool and the original version of the ad was permitted to air.

The longer "bloody hell-hounds" appears to have been at least printable in early 19th century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;so in ''London Theatre: A Collection of the Most Celebrated Dramatic Pieces, Correctly Given, from Copies Used in the Theatres'' Volumes 11-12 (1815), p. 59 "Bloody hell-hounds, I overheard you!"&lt;/ref&gt; "Bloody hell's flames" as well as "bloody hell" is reported as a profanity supposedly used by Catholics against Protestants in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;
John Ryan, ''Popery unmasked. A narrative of twenty years' Popish persecution'' (1845), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--It is talked about in a [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]] about the letter H (aitch):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-6dyn/articles/A28637-2004Sep17.html |title=More Honorable Mentions |publisher=Washington Post |date=2004-09-19 |accessdate=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12139">'''Cabotage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|b|ə|t|ᵻ|dʒ|,_|-|t|ɑː|ʒ}}) is the [[transport]] of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country. It originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to [[aviation]], [[railways]], and [[road transport]] as well.

'''Cabotage rights''' are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic [[protectionism]], [[national security]], or [[public safety]]. One notable exception is the [[European Union]], whose Member States all grant cabotage rights to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |title="European transport policy for 2010: time to decide" EU Commission White paper |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927035247/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2001_white_paper_en.htm |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Cabotage originally meant simply [[Short sea shipping|coasting trade]], from the French ''caboter'', to travel by the coast. Its ultimate origin is uncertain. The air transport meaning is attested in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, 1888, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25785 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==In shipping==
Cabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adherence to the cabotage system|url=http://www.naiko-kaiun.or.jp/e/union/union10.html|publisher=Japan Federation of Coastal Shipping Associations|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the history of cabotage in UK law, see [[Navigation Acts]].

In the United States, the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]] (Jones Act) requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] states that no foreign vessels shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States, either directly or by way of a foreign port.

[[Indonesia]] implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabotage provides a big  boost to shipping industry |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/09/23/cabotage-provides-a-big-boost-shipping-industry.html|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=The Jakarta Post|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts [[coastwise trade]] or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise license from the [[Maritime Industry Authority]]. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Republic Act No. 10668: Policy Considerations to Improve Coastwise Trade|url=http://industry.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Beyond-Republic-Act-No-10668-Policy-Considerations-to-Improve-Coastwise-Trade.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=Sector Planning Bureau of the Department of Trade and Industry|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU, rights to cabotage in newly-admitted Member States (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/exceptions-from-eu-free-movement-law-9781849466202/ EU derogations]&lt;/ref&gt; but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros ferry disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html Paros ferry disaster] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xbfGMxu6?url=http://www.greekislandhopping.com/Updates/updatepages/u_disaster.html |date=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hague–Visby Rules]], a convention which imposes duties on maritime carriers, apply only to "carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states", and thus do not apply to cabotage shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby rules, Article X&lt;/ref&gt; However, section 1(3) of the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] declares that the Rules "shall have effect ... where the port of shipment is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ...".

==In passenger aviation==
Cabotage rights remain rare in passenger aviation. The [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|Chicago Convention]] prohibits member states from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability of cabotage as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations.&lt;ref name="havel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Havel|first1=Brian F.|title=The Principles and Practice of International Aviation Law|date=31 March 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107020528|pages=50–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8H2AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=ShuKdGSAP2&amp;dq=chile%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabotage is not granted under most [[open skies]] agreements.

===European Union===
Carriers licensed under EU law are permitted to engage in cabotage in any EU member state, with some limitations.&lt;ref name="havel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/haulage/cabotage_en "Cabotage"] European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryanair]], [[easyJet]], [[Vueling]], [[Wizz Air]], and [[Aer Lingus]] have bases and operate domestic services outside their home countries.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The [[Closer Economic Relations]] agreement allows Australian air carriers to fly domestically and internationally from [[New Zealand]] and vice versa. An Australian carrier, [[Jetstar]] (a [[Qantas]] subsidiary), flies domestic routes within New Zealand. [[Air New Zealand]] offers one international destination from Australia outside New Zealand, flying between [[Sydney]], Australia and [[Rarotonga]] of the [[Cook Islands]]. Previously, [[Jetconnect|Qantas Jetconnect]],  [[Pacific Blue Airlines|Pacific Blue]] (a [[Virgin Australia]] subsidiary) and [[Ansett New Zealand]] were Australian-owned airlines based in New Zealand that operated domestic New Zealand services.

Australia also permits foreign-owned airlines incorporated under Australian law (such as [[Tiger Airways Australia]] and the domestic arm of [[Virgin Australia]]) to operate on domestic routes, although it prohibits such airlines from operating international routes as Australian flag carriers.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

===Chile===
[[Chile]] has the most liberal cabotage rules in the world, enacted in 1979, which allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights, conditional upon reciprocal treatment for Chilean carriers in the foreign airline's country. This unusual regime is partly due to Chile's geographical need for air service, and partly to incentivize liberalization in other countries amid the international expansion of its flag carrier [[LATAM Chile]], which now has major operations in many other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt; Like Australia, Chile allows foreign companies to set up Chilean subsidiaries to offer domestic flights in Chile, regardless of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0406:EN:NOT |title=Communication from the Commission – Strengthening aviation relations with Chile |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===

Before 1991, [[Lufthansa]] was prohibited from flying to [[West Berlin]], so [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Airways]], and [[Air France]] operated the routes between [[West Germany]] and West Berlin. For a short time in the late 1980s, [[Trans World Airlines]] also flew between then-West Germany and West Berlin. During this time, Pan&amp;nbsp;Am flew to Tegel, in Berlin, from [[Munich-Riem Airport]] (now closed) and Frankfurt. Air France flew from [[Düsseldorf]]. British Airways flew from [[Münster]]-[[Osnabrück]], [[Hannover]], and some other cities.

In 2003&amp;ndash;2004, the [[United States Department of Transportation]] authorized [[Polynesian Airlines]] to provide temporary cabotage service in [[American Samoa]] after the existing US flag carrier ceased operations, one of very few instances where the US has granted cabotage rights in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabotage definition and standards for emergency exemption|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/igia/2011/upload/20-AviationCabotageDOT.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October&amp;nbsp;2007, the [[United Kingdom]] granted [[Singapore]] carriers the right to fly domestic UK&amp;nbsp;routes as part of an [[open skies]] agreement, which also allows British carriers to fly to any city from Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/303608/1/.html |title=Channelnewsasia.com |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal cabotage rights exist by treaty between New Zealand and Brunei and between the People's Republic of China and Albania.&lt;ref name="havel" /&gt;

==="Modified sixth freedom"===

The "modified [[freedoms of the air|sixth freedom]]" refers to the right to carry passengers between two points in country A through a hub in country B; for instance, a Boston-Toronto-Seattle itinerary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasigh|first1=Bijan|title=Introduction to Air Transport Economics: From Theory to Applications|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|pages=156–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzPekWiS9I0C&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;ots=Abr6R5Ihxl&amp;dq=qantas%20new%20york%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such services are currently considered to constitute cabotage and are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Canada's new government delivers greater Air Travel choice through Open Skies agreement with the United States|publisher=[[Government of Canada]]|date=12 March 2007|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=283149|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the United States fined [[Asiana Airlines]] for selling tickets from the mainland US to [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]] via Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Compart|first1=Andrew|title=DOT fines Asiana for violating cabotage laws|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/DOT-fines-Asiana-for-violating-cabotage-laws/|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=Travel Weekly|date=31 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tag rights===

Certain airlines operate services within a foreign country without the right to carry local traffic. For instance, [[Qantas]] operates service between New York and Los Angeles solely for use by international connecting passengers. Such services are not generally considered to be cabotage.

[[File:Origo Mundi kynsa gwersow.jpg|thumb|The opening verses of Origo Mundi, the first play of the Ordinalia (the magnum opus of mediaeval Cornish literature), written by an unknown monk in the late 14th century]]

'''Cornish literature''' refers to written works in the [[Cornish language]]. The earliest surviving texts are in verse and date from the 14th century. There are virtually none from the 18th and 19th centuries but writing in revived forms of Cornish began in the early 20th century.

==Medieval verse and drama==
[[File:The green at st just in penwith cornwall.jpg|right|thumb|A '[[Plain-an-gwarry (theatre)|Plain an Gwarry]]' (Cornish - playing place), an open-air performance area used historically for entertainment and instruction. This Plain an Gwarry is in [[St Just in Penwith]].]] 
''[[Prophecy of Merlin|The Prophecy of Ambrosius Merlin concerning the Seven Kings]]'' is a 12th-century poem written ''ca.'' 1144 by [[John of Cornwall (theologian)|John of Cornwall]] in [[Latin]], with some of the marginal notes in Cornish. John stated that the work was a translation based on an earlier document written in the Cornish language. The manuscript of the poem, on a [[codex]] currently held at the [[Vatican Library]], is unique. It attracted little attention from the scholarly world until 1876, when [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] undertook a brief analysis of the Cornish and Welsh vocabulary found in John's [[marginalia|marginal commentary]].&lt;ref&gt;David Iredale, John Barrett, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0EG-17syB2AC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=cornish+manuscript+held+by+the+vatican#v=onepage&amp;q=cornish%20manuscript%20held%20by%20the%20vatican&amp;f=false Discovering local history]'', page 44&lt;/ref&gt; These notes are among the earliest known writings in the Cornish language.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Literature'' -, Volume 1 By Joseph T. Shipley (page 176) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtmASIRhosAC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=John+of+Cornwall's+Seven+Kings&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 this important work was translated back into Cornish by [[Julyan Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;''An dhargan a Verdhin, The prophecy of Merlin'', translated by [[Julyan Holmes]], full parallel English and Cornish text (2nd ed., Kesva an Taves Kernewek / The Cornish Language Board, Gwinear, 2001; {{ISBN|1-902917-19-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Pascon agan Arluth]]'' ('The Passion of our Lord'), a poem of 259 eight-line verses probably composed around 1375, is one of the earliest surviving works of Cornish literature. The most important work of literature surviving from the Middle Cornish period is the Cornish ''[[Ordinalia]]'', a 9000-line religious [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] which had probably reached its present form by 1400. The ''Ordinalia'' consists of three [[mystery play]]s, ''Origo Mundi'', ''Passio Christi'' and ''Resurrexio Domini'', meant to be performed on successive days. Such plays were performed in a ''[[Plain-an-gwarry (theatre)|Plain an Gwarry]]'' (Playing place). In 1981, the [[Breton language|Breton]] library Preder edited it in modern scripture under the name of ''Passyon agan arluth''.

The longest single surviving work of Cornish literature is ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]'' (The Life of [[Meriasek]]), a two-day verse drama dated 1504, but probably copied from an earlier manuscript.

Other notable pieces of Cornish literature include the ''Creation of the World (with Noah's Flood)'' which is a miracle play similar to ''Origo Mundi'' but in a much later manuscript (1611); the ''Charter Fragment'', a short poem about marriage, believed to be the earliest connected text in the language; and ''[[Beunans Ke]]'', another saint's play only discovered in 2000, notable for including some [[Arthurian]] material.

==Prose works==
{{wikisourcelang||Homelyes XIII in Cornysche|Tregear Homilies}}
The earliest surviving examples of Cornish prose are the Tregear Homilies, a series of 12 Catholic [[sermon]]s written in English and translated by [[John Tregear]] around 1555-1557, to which a thirteenth homily ''The Sacrament of the Alter'' was added by another hand. Twelve of [[Edmund Bonner]]'s ''Homelies to be read within his diocese of London of all Parsons, vycars and curates'' (1555; nine of these were by [[John Harpsfield]]) were translated into [[Cornish language|Cornish]] by [[John Tregear]], and are now the largest single work of traditional Cornish prose.

[[Nicholas Boson]] (1624−1708) wrote three significant texts in Cornish, ''Nebbaz gerriau dro tho Carnoack'' (A Few Words about Cornish) between 1675 and 1708; ''Jowan Chy-an-Horth, py, An try foynt a skyans'' (John of Chyannor, or, The three points of wisdom), published by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in 1707, though written earlier; and ''The Dutchess of Cornwall's Progress'', partly in English, now known only in fragments. The first two are the only known surviving Cornish prose texts from the 17th century. Boson's work is collected, along with that of his son [[John Boson (writer)|John Boson]] and his cousin [[Thomas Boson]] (1635–1719) in [[Oliver Padel]]'s ''The Cornish writings of the Boson family'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornish writings of the Boson family: Nicholas, Thomas and John Boson, of Newlyn, circa 1660 to 1730'', Edited with translations and notes by O. J. Padel (Redruth: Institute of Cornish Studies, 1975) {{ISBN|0-903686-09-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late period and revival==

===18th century to 1950===
Fragments of Cornish writing continued to appear as the language was becoming extinct during the 18th century. However, in the late 19th century a few works by non-native speakers were produced; these efforts were followed by a more substantial revival in the 20th and 21st centuries. Of the early pieces the most significant is the so-called "[[Cranken Rhyme]]" produced by [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]] of [[Boswednack]], one of the last people with some traditional knowledge of the language.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;Ellis, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch4&gt;Koch, pp. 492–493.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, published by [[John Hobson Matthews]] in 1892, may be the last piece of traditional Cornish literature. In 1865 German language enthusiast [[Georg Sauerwein]] composed two poems in the language. Later Hobson Matthews wrote several poems, such as the patriotic "Can Wlascar Agam Mamvro" ("Patriotic Song of our Motherland"), and [[Robert Morton Nance]], a disciple of [[Henry Jenner]], created a body of verse, for example "Nyns yu Marow Myghtern Arthur" ("[[King Arthur]] is not Dead"), which concerns the popular Cornish subject of [[King Arthur's messianic return|King Arthur's legendary immortality]]. Both of these writers' works are characterised by a specifically revivalist mode.&lt;ref name=Koch4/&gt;

These efforts were followed in the early 20th century by further works of revivalist literature by Cornish language enthusiasts. Works of this period were generally printed in limited publications by authors far removed from Cornwall and each other; their importance to the later revival movement was not fully recognized for decades.&lt;ref name=Koch4/&gt; The literary output of the Cornish revival has largely been poetry. Notable writers of the time include [[Edward Chirgwin]] and [[A. S. D. Smith]], whose epic poem ''Trystan hag Isolt'', a reworking of the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend, is one of the most celebrated pieces of Cornish revival writing.&lt;ref name=Koch4/&gt; Another significant early text is [[Peggy Pollard]]'s 1941 play ''Beunans Alysaryn'', modelled on the 16th-century saints' plays.&lt;ref name=Koch4/&gt;

====William Bodinar's letter (1776)====
This is an example of Cornish written by the hand of a native speaker [https://web.archive.org/web/20130708145153/http://corpus.kernewek.cymru247.net/wb.txt]. The text is also interesting from a sociolinguistic point of view in that Bodinar speaks about the contemporary state of the Cornish language in 1776.

Below it is written in Bodinar's original spelling, then in modern Cornish spelling (SWF), then a translation in English:

===Later 20th century and after===
The later 20th century saw increasing interest in the Cornish language and its literature, and an expansion into other media. The dearth of Cornish readers has made the production of novels difficult, though three have been published. The earliest was Melville Bennetto's ''An Gurun Wosek a Geltya'' (''The Bloody Crown of the Celtic Countries'') in 1984; subsequently Michael Palmer published ''Jory'' (1989) and ''Dyroans'' (1998).&lt;ref name=Koch4/&gt; [[Tim Saunders]] and [[Nicholas Williams]] are among the contemporary poets writing in Cornish. Additionally, writers such as [[Nick Darke]] and [[Alan M. Kent]] have incorporated a Cornish background into English writing.&lt;ref name=Koch4/&gt; Others have translated foreign works into Cornish. Jowann Richards (1926-2005) produced a Cornish translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' ({{ISBN|0-907064-29-9}}) in 1990. Beginning in the 2000s, translators set about translating the [[Bible]] in order to redress the handicap unique to Cornish, in that of all the modern Celtic languages, only Cornish had no Bible translation. The first complete edition of the New Testament in Cornish, [[Nicholas Williams]]'s translation ''Testament Noweth agan Arluth ha Savyour Jesu Cryst'', was published at Easter 2002 by Spyrys a Gernow ({{ISBN|0-9535975-4-7}}); it uses Unified Cornish Revised orthography. The translation was made from the Greek text, and incorporated John Tregear's existing translations with slight revisions. In August 2004, [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]] published its edition of the New Testament in Cornish ({{ISBN|1-902917-33-2}}), translated by Keith Syed and Ray Edwards; it uses Kernewek Kemmyn orthography. It was launched in a ceremony in [[Truro Cathedral]] attended by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. A translation of the Old Testament is currently in preparation.

2009 saw the publication of a number of novels in Cornish. [[Nicholas Williams]]'s translation of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' appeared as ''Alys in Pow an Anethow'' ({{ISBN|978-1-904808-19-0}}), as did his translation of Craig Weatherhill's novel ''The Lyonesse Stone'', titled in Cornish ''Jowal Lethesow'' ({{ISBN|978-1-904808-30-5}}). Kaspar Hocking's abridgement of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' was published as ''Adro dhe'n Bÿs in Peswar Ugans Dëdh'' ({{ISBN|978-1-904808-21-3}}), and Eddie Foirbeis Climo's ''Kensa Lyver Redya'' ({{ISBN|978-1-904808-24-4}}) 'First Reading Book', a translation of Harriette Taylor Treadwell and Margaret Free's ''Primer'', was published as well.

'''''Cunt''''' {{IPAc-en|k|ʌ|n|t}} is a [[Vulgarism|vulgar word]] for the [[vulva]] or [[vagina]] and is also used as a [[Pejorative|term of disparagement]]. Reflecting [[List of dialects of the English language|different national usages]], ''cunt'' is described as "an unpleasant or stupid person" in the ''[[Compact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English|Compact Oxford English Dictionary]]'', whereas [[Merriam-Webster]] states that it is a "usually disparaging and obscene" term for a woman&lt;ref name="Cunt 1"&gt;{{citation |title=cunt |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cunt
|work=Dictionary – Merriam-Webster online
|publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an "offensive way to refer to a woman" in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cunt 2"&gt;{{citation |title=cunt|url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/cunt|work=Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' of [[Australian English]] gives "a contemptible person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cunt|url=https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/features/word/search/?word=cunt&amp;search_word_type=Dictionary|website=Macquarie Dictionary|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=25 June 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, it can also be used as a neutral or, when used with a positive qualifier (e.g., ''good, funny, clever''), a positive way of referring to a person.

The earliest known use of the word, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', was as part of a [[placename]] of a London street, [[Gropecunt Lane]], c.&amp;nbsp;1230. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name = "Morton"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Lover's Tongue: A Merry Romp Through the Language of Love and Sex|last= Morton |first= Mark |authorlink= |year= 2004|publisher= Insomniac Press|location= Toronto, Canada|isbn= 978-1-894663-51-9 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word appears not to have been [[taboo]] in the [[Middle Ages]], but became taboo towards the end of the eighteenth century, and was then not generally admissible in print until the latter part of the twentieth century. The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses. [[Feminist]] writer and English professor [[Germaine Greer]] argues that ''cunt'' "is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock."&lt;ref name="Balderdash &amp; Piffle sacred"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''cunt'' is a matter of debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language Most Foul |last=Wajnryb |first=Ruth |publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]] |year=2005 |location=Australia |isbn=1-74114-776-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most sources consider the word to have derived from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word ([[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*kuntō'', [[word stem|stem]] ''*kuntōn-''), which appeared as ''{{lang|non|kunta}}'' in [[Old Norse]]. Scholars are uncertain of the origin of the Proto-Germanic form itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cunt |title=Cunt |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[cognate]]s in most Germanic languages, such as the Swedish, [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Nynorsk]] ''{{lang|sv|kunta}}''; [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] and [[Middle Low German]] ''{{lang|fy|kunte}}''; [[Middle Dutch]] ''{{lang|dum|conte}}''; Dutch ''{{lang|nl|kut}}'' (cunt) and ''{{lang|nl|kont}}'' (ass); [[Middle Low German]] ''{{lang|gml|kutte}}''; [[Middle High German]] ''{{lang|gmh|kotze}}'' ("{{lang|en|[[prostitution|prostitute]]}}"); German ''{{lang|de|kott}}'', and perhaps [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|cot}}''. The [[etymology]] of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed. It may have arisen by [[Grimm's law]] operating on the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''{{PIE|*gen/gon}}'' "{{lang|en|create, become}}" seen in [[gonads]], [[genital]], [[gamete]], [[genetics]], [[gene]], or the Proto-Indo-European root ''{{PIE|*gʷneh₂/guneh₂}}'' "{{lang|en|woman}}" ({{lang-el|italic=yes|gunê}}, seen in [[gynaecology]]). Relationships to similar-sounding words such as the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|cunnus}}'' ("{{lang|en|vulva}}"), and its derivatives French ''{{lang|fr|con}}'', Spanish ''{{lang|es|coño}}'', and Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|cona}}'', or in [[Persian language|Persian]] ''{{lang|fa-Latn|kun}}'' ({{lang|fa|کون}}), have not been conclusively demonstrated. Other Latin words related to ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female genitals|cunnus]]'' are ''{{lang|la|cuneus}}'' ("{{lang|en|wedge}}") and its derivative ''{{lang|la|cunēre}}'' ("{{lang|en|to fasten with a wedge}}", (figurative) "{{lang|en|to squeeze in}}"), leading to English words such as ''[[cuneiform]]'' ("{{lang|en|wedge-shaped}}"). In [[Middle English]], ''cunt'' appeared with many spellings, such as ''{{lang|enm|coynte}}'', ''{{lang|enm|cunte}}'' and ''{{lang|enm|queynte}}'', which did not always reflect the actual [[pronunciation]] of the word.

The word in its modern meaning is attested in Middle English. ''[[Proverbs of Hendyng]]'', a [[manuscript]] from some time before 1325, includes the advice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Unknown |title=An Old English Miscellany Containing a Bestiary, Kentish Sermons... |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |year=2001 |location=Delaware |isbn=0-543-94116-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offensiveness==

===Generally===
The word ''cunt'' is generally regarded in [[English-speaking countries]] as unsuitable for normal public discourse. It has been described as "the most heavily tabooed word of all English words",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rawson | first = Henry |title=A Dictionary of Invective |year=1991 |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-7090-4399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/21/broadcasting.uknews | title = TV's most offensive words | date = 21 November 2005 | accessdate= 5 May 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; although John Ayto, editor of the ''[[Slang dictionary|Oxford Dictionary of Slang]]'', says "[[nigger]]" is more taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Margolis |first=Jonathan |date=21 November 2002 |title=Expletive deleted |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/21/britishidentity.features11 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |quote=Nigger is far more taboo than fuck or even cunt. I think if a politician were to be heard off-camera saying fuck, it would be trivial, but if he said nigger, that would be the end of his career.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist perspectives===
Some American [[Second-wave feminism|feminists of the 1970s]] sought to eliminate disparaging terms for women, including "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]" and "cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston| first = Hank|author2=Bert Klandermans|title = Social Movements and Culture | publisher = Routledge| location = | year = 1995| page = 174 | isbn = 1-85728-500-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[pornography]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argued that use of the word acts to reinforce a [[dehumanisation]] of women by reducing them to mere body parts;&lt;ref name = Lacombe&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacombe | first = Dany | title = Blue Politics: Pornography and the Law in the Age of Feminism | year = 1994| publisher = University of Toronto Press| page = 27 | location = Toronto| isbn = 0-8020-7352-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1979 [[Andrea Dworkin]] described the word as reducing women to "the one essential – 'cunt: our essence ... our offence'".&lt;ref name = Lacombe/&gt;

Despite criticisms, there is a movement among feminists that seeks to [[reclaimed word|reclaim]] ''cunt'' not only as acceptable, but as an [[honorific]], in much the same way that ''[[queer]]'' has been reappropriated by [[LGBT]] people and ''[[nigger]]'' has been by some [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Germaine Greer]], the feminist writer and professor of English who once published a magazine article entitled "Lady, Love Your Cunt" (anthologised in 1986),&lt;ref&gt;anthologized in Germaine Greer, ''The Madwoman's Underclothes: Essays and Occasional Writings'', (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; discussed the origins, usage and power of the word in the BBC series ''[[Balderdash and Piffle]]'', explaining how her views had developed over time. In the 1970s she had "championed" use of the word for the female genitalia, thinking it "shouldn't be abusive"; she rejected the "proper" word ''[[vagina]]'', a Latin name meaning "sword-sheath" originally applied by male anatomists to all muscle coverings (see [[synovial sheath]]) – not just because it refers only to the internal canal but also because of the implication that the female body is "simply a receptacle for a weapon".&lt;ref name="Balderdash &amp; Piffle vagina"&gt;{{cite episode |title= The C Words |series= Balderdash and Piffle |serieslink= Balderdash and Piffle | network= [[BBC Two]] |airdate= 2006-01-30 |series-no=1 |number5=|minutes=26 |quote = ... in the 1970s I thought this word for the female genitalia shouldn't be abusive.

I refuse to think of my sex as simply a receptacle for a weapon. |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMckJrxxY6I}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2006, referring to its use as a term of abuse, she said that, though used in some quarters as a term of affection, it had become "the most offensive insult one man could throw at another"&lt;ref name="Balderdash &amp; Piffle offensive"&gt;{{cite episode |title= The C Words |series= Balderdash and Piffle |serieslink= Balderdash and Piffle | network= [[BBC Two]] |airdate= 2006-01-30 |series-no =1 |number5=|minutes=31 |quote= ... unlike other words for women's genitals, this one sounds powerful – it demands to be taken seriously.

The fracas caused uproar. Yet only one newspaper, ''The Independent'', dared print the expletive-laden exchange in full. Nearly twenty years later, in some quarters, it is used as a term of affection. Yet for most people the C-word is still a very offensive term...". |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMckJrxxY6I}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that the word was "sacred", and "a word of immense power, to be used sparingly".&lt;ref name="Balderdash &amp; Piffle sacred"&gt;{{cite episode |title= The C Words |series= Balderdash and Piffle |serieslink= Balderdash and Piffle | network= [[BBC Two]] |airdate= 2006-01-30 |series-no=1 |number5=|minutes=31 |quote= I love the idea that this word is still so sacred that you can use it like a torpedo: you can hole people below the water line; you can make strong men go pale. ... It is a word of immense power, to be used sparingly.|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMckJrxxY6I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage: pre-twentieth century==
''Cunt'' has been attested in its anatomical meaning since at least the 13th century. While [[Francis Grose]]'s 1785 ''A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue'' listed the word as "C**T: a nasty name for a nasty thing",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HoSAAAAIAAJ|last1= Grose |first1= Francis |title= A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |date=1788 |location=London |publisher= S. Hooper |quote=C**T. ... a nasty name for a nasty thing}} (immediately following ''Cunny-thumbed'')&lt;/ref&gt; it did not appear in any major English dictionary from 1795 to 1961, when it was included in ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' with the comment "usu. considered obscene". Its first appearance in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was in 1972, which cites the word as having been in use from 1230 in what was supposedly a London street name of "Gropecunte Lane". It was, however, also used before 1230, having been brought over by the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s, originally not an [[obscenity]] but rather an ordinary name for the vulva or vagina. [[Gropecunt Lane]] was originally a street of prostitution, a [[red light district]]. It was normal in the [[Middle Ages]] for streets to be named after the goods available for sale therein, hence the prevalence in cities having a medieval history of names such as "Silver Street" and "Fish Street." In some locations, the former name has been [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]], as in the City of York, to the more acceptable "Grape Lane."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, N &amp; Holt, R. (2000). "Towards a geography of sexual encounter: prostitution in English medieval towns," in L. Bevan: ''Indecent Exposure: Sexuality, Society and the Archaeological Record''. Cruithne Press: Glasgow, 187-98&lt;/ref&gt;

The word appears several times in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (c. 1390), in [[bawdy]] contexts, but since it is used openly, does not appear to have been considered obscene at that time.&lt;ref name="Siebert"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Eve |last1=Siebert |publisher=Skeptical Humanities |title=Chaucer's Cunt |url=http://skepticalhumanities.com/2011/01/18/chaucers-cunt/ |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable use is from the "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|Miller's Tale]]": "Pryvely he caught her by the queynte." The [[Wife of Bath]] also uses this term, "For certeyn, olde dotard, by your leave/You shall have queynte right enough at eve ... What aileth you to grouche thus and groan?/Is it for ye would have my queynte alone?" In modernised versions of these passages the word "queynte" is usually translated simply as "cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarius.com/canttran/wifetale/wifetale330-342.htm |title=From Geoffrey Chaucer's ''The Canterbury Tales'', The Wife of Bath's Prologue, lines 330–342 |publisher=Librarius.com |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4literature.net/Geoffrey_Chaucer/Wife_of_Bath_s_Prologue/3.html|title=Wife of Bath's Prologue by Geoffrey Chaucer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Chaucer's usage there seems to be an overlap between the words "cunt" and "quaint" (possibly derived from the [[Latin]] for "known"). "Quaint" was probably pronounced in Middle English in much the same way as "cunt". It is sometimes unclear whether the two words were thought of as distinct from one another. Elsewhere in Chaucer's work the word ''queynte'' seems to be used with meaning comparable to the modern "quaint" (curious or old-fashioned, but nevertheless appealing).&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|'''4''' quaint, a. (adv.) (at '''7''', '''8''') c'''1369''' Chaucer ''Dethe Blaunche'' 1330 This is so queynt a sweuyn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ambiguity was still being exploited by the 17th century; [[Andrew Marvell]]'s ''... then worms shall try / That long preserved virginity, / And your quaint honour turn to dust, / And into ashes all my lust'' in ''[[To His Coy Mistress]]'' depends on a pun on these two senses of "quaint".&lt;ref&gt;Marvell, Andrew. "To His Coy Mistress". ''[[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]''. Seventh Edition. M. H. Abrams. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000. 1691–1692.&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] day, the word seems to have become obscene. Although Shakespeare does not use the word explicitly (or with [[derogatory]] meaning) in his plays, he still uses [[Word play|wordplay]] to sneak it in obliquely. In Act III, Scene 2, of ''[[Hamlet]]'', as the castle's residents are settling in to watch the [[subplot|play-within-the-play]], Hamlet asks his girlfriend [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], "Lady, shall I lie in your lap?" Ophelia replies, "No, my lord." Hamlet, feigning shock, says, "Do you think I meant ''country matters''?" Then, to drive home the point that the [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]] is definitely on the first [[syllable]] of ''country'', Shakespeare has Hamlet say, "That's a fair thought, to lie between maids' legs."&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric, ''Shakespeare's Bawdy'', Routledge, London, 2001, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (Act II, Scene V) the puritanical Malvolio believes he recognises his employer's handwriting in an anonymous letter, commenting "There be her very Cs, her Us, and her Ts: and thus makes she her great Ps", unwittingly punning on "cunt" and "piss",&lt;ref name=Silverton/&gt; and while it has also been argued that the slang term "cut" is intended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce R.|last=Smith|title=Twelfth night, or, What you will: texts and contexts |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2001|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauline Kiernan writes that Shakespeare ridicules "prissy puritanical party-poopers" by having "a Puritan spell out the word 'cunt' on a public stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pauline|last=Kiernan|title=Filthy Shakespeare: Shakespeare's Most Outrageous Sexual Puns|publisher=Quercus|year=2006|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related scene occurs in ''Henry V'': when Katherine is learning English, she is appalled at the "''gros, et impudique''" words "foot" and "gown", which her teacher has mispronounced as "''coun''". It is usually argued that Shakespeare intends to suggest that she has misheard "foot" as "''foutre''" (French, "fuck") and "coun" as "''con''" (French "cunt", also used to mean "idiot").&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric, ''Shakespeare's Bawdy'', Routledge, London, 2001, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly [[John Donne]] alludes to the obscene meaning of the word without being explicit in his poem ''[[The Good-Morrow]]'', referring to sucking on "country pleasures." The 1675 [[Restoration comedy]] ''[[The Country Wife]]'' also features such word play, even in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Country Wife  |last= Wycherley |first=William |editor1-last=Ogden |editor1-first=James |editor2-last= Stern |editor2-first= Tiffany |edition=2nd, annotated |isbn=9781408179901 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=ALlMAgAAQBAJ |date= 2014 |publisher= Bloomsbury, A&amp;C Black |at = page 15, editor's note for line 189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century a softer form of the word, "cunny", came into use. A well-known use of this derivation can be found in the 25 October 1668 entry of the diary of [[Samuel Pepys]]. He was discovered having an affair with Deborah Willet: he wrote that his wife "coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con [with] my hand sub [under] su [her] coats; and endeed I was with my main [hand] in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbot |first=Mary |title=Life Cycles in England, 1560–1720: Cradle to Grave |publisher= Routledge |year= 1996 |page=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCI1nnR1_zAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA91,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cunny'' was probably derived from a [[pun]] on ''[[coney (disambiguation)|coney]]'', meaning "rabbit", rather as ''[[pussy]]'' is connected to the same term for a cat. ([[Philip Massinger|Philip Massinger (1583–1640)]]: "A pox upon your Christian [[cockatrices]]! They cry, like poulterers' wives, 'No money, no coney.'")&lt;ref&gt;Ship, Joseph Twadell, ''The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', JHU Press, 1984, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this slang use as a synonym for a taboo term, the word "coney", when it was used in its original sense to refer to rabbits, came to be pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|n|i}} (rhymes with "phoney"), instead of the original {{IPA|/ˈkʌni/}} (rhymes with "honey"). Eventually the taboo association led to the word "coney" becoming deprecated entirely and replaced by the word "rabbit".&lt;ref&gt;Shipley, Joseph Twadell, ''The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', JHU Press, 1984, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carney, Edward, ''A survey of English spelling'', Routledge, 1994, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Mark, ''Cupboard Love: A Dictionary of Culinary Curiosities'', Insomniac Press, 2004, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan &amp; Burridge, ''Forbidden Words'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Burns]] (1759–1796) used the word in his ''[[:wikisource:Merry Muses of Caledonia|Merry Muses of Caledonia]]'', a collection of bawdy verses which he kept to himself and were not publicly available until the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.robertburns.org.uk/merrymuses.htm | title= Merry Muses of Caledonia by Robert Burns | accessdate=6 March 2008 |format = HMTL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Yon, Yon, Yon, Lassie", this couplet appears: "For ilka birss upon her cunt, Was worth a ryal ransom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.robertburns.org.uk/Assets/Documents/merrymuses.PDF |title= Merry Muses of Caledonia by Robert Burns | accessdate=6 March 2008 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage: modern==

===As a term of abuse===
[[Merriam-Webster]] states it is a "usually disparaging and obscene" term for a woman,&lt;ref name="Cunt 1"/&gt; and that it is an "offensive way to refer to a woman" in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cunt 2"/&gt; As a broader derogatory term, it is comparable to ''[[Prick (slang)|prick]]'' and means "a fool, a dolt, an unpleasant person – of either sex".&lt;ref name=Green1995&gt;

In American [[slang]], the term can be used to refer to "a fellow male homosexual one dislikes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chapman |first=Robert L. |date=1995 |title= The Macmillan Dictionary of American Slang |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0333634055| page=91}}&lt;br /&gt;An example of usage given by the dictionary is {{Cite book |quote="And this one is from Max.

Australian scholar Emma Alice Jane describes how the term as used on social media is an example of what she calls "gendered vitriol," and an example of [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] e-bile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jane|first=Emma Alice|date=2014|title='Back to the kitchen, cunt': Speaking the unspeakable about online misogyny|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2014.924479|journal=Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies|volume=28|issue=4|pages=558-570|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other meanings===
It can also be used to refer to something very difficult or unpleasant (as in "a cunt of a job"),&lt;ref name="Green unpleasant cunt"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green's Dictionary of Slang|first=Jonathon |last=Green |volume=1 |publisher=Chambers |date=2008 |isbn=978-0550-10443-4|pages=1454–1456 |url= https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/w7hgqcy |accessdate=30 October 2016 |quote=something very unpleasant or difficult to do or achieve ...

He's a good cunt."

In the [[Survey of English Dialects]] the word was recorded in some areas as meaning "the vulva of a cow". This was pronounced as [kʌnt] in [[Devon]], and [kʊnt] in the [[Isle of Man]], [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Northumberland]]. Possibly related was the word ''cunny'' [kʌni], with the same meaning, at [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Upton |first1=Clive| last2=Parry| first2=David|last3=Widdowson| first3=JDA |title=Survey of English Dialects: the dictionary and the grammar |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415020298 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "cunty" is also known, although used rarely: a line from [[Hanif Kureishi]]'s ''[[My Beautiful Laundrette]]'' is the definition of England by a [[British Asian|Pakistani immigrant]] as "eating hot buttered toast with cunty fingers", suggestive of hypocrisy and a hidden sordidness or immorality behind the country's quaint façade. This term is attributed to British novelist [[Henry Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theparisreview.org/media/GREEN.pdf#search=%22cunty%20fingers%22|title= The Art Of Fiction No. 22 – Henry Green|accessdate=6 March 2008 |format= PDF|work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229021024/http://www.theparisreview.org/media/GREEN.pdf#search=%22cunty%20fingers%22 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate =29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, "cunty" is sometimes used in [[cross-dressing]] drag [[ball culture]] for a [[drag queen]] that "projects feminine beauty"&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Senelick, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Changing_Room.html?id=DUk008nvuhgC The Changing Room: Sex, Drag and Theatre, Psychology Press, 2000], p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; and was the title of a hit song by [[Kevin Aviance|Aviance]].&lt;ref&gt;José Esteban Muñoz, Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity, NYU Press, 30 November 2009, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; A visitor to a New York drag show tells of the emcee praising a queen with "cunty, cunty, cunty" as she walks past.&lt;ref&gt;David Valentine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VOv-kTqi8tsC&amp;dq=cunty+transgender&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category, Duke University Press, 30 August 2007], p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cunt a declaration of independence.jpg|thumb|upright|''Cunt: A Declaration of Independence'' front cover]]

[[James Joyce]] was one of the first of the major 20th-century novelists to put the word "cunt" into print. In the context of one of the central characters in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), [[Leopold Bloom]], Joyce refers to the [[Dead Sea]] and to {{quote|... the oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more.

Joyce uses the word figuratively rather than literally; but while Joyce used the word only once in ''Ulysses'', with four other wordplays ('cunty') on it, [[D H Lawrence]] used the word ten times in ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' (1928), in a more direct sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Doris Lessing |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1819727,00.html |title=Review of "Lady Chatterley" |publisher=Books.guardian.co.uk |date= 2006-07-14|accessdate=2011-12-18 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mellors, the gamekeeper and eponymous lover, tries delicately to explain the definition of the word to Lady Constance Chatterley: "If your sister there comes ter me for a bit o' cunt an' tenderness, she knows what she's after."

[[Samuel Beckett]] was an associate of Joyce, and in his ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1956), he writes: "His young wife had abandoned all hope of bringing him to heel, by means of her cunt, that [[Trump (card games)|trump card]] of young wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Women in Beckett | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-252-06256-6 | publisher = University of Illinois | last = Ben-Zvi | first = Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Inga Muscio]] published ''[[Cunt: A Declaration of Independence]]''. In [[Ian McEwan]]'s novel ''[[Atonement (novel)|Atonement]]'' (2001), set in 1935, the word is used in the draft of a [[love letter]] mistakenly sent instead of a revised version, and although not spoken, is an important plot pivot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalereviewofbooks.com/archive/spring02/review15.shtml.htm |title=Ian McEwan's Fictional Act of Atonement. |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317055448/http://www.yalereviewofbooks.com/archive/spring02/review15.shtml.htm |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
Theatre censorship was effectively [[Theatres Act 1968|abolished in the UK in 1968]]; prior to that all theatrical productions had to be vetted by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]].

Presented by British comedian [[Will Smith (comedian)|Will Smith]], viewers were taken to a street in [[Oxford]] once called "[[Gropecunt Lane]]" and presented with examples of the acceptability of "cunt" as a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007sj0x|title= The C Word: How We Came to Swear By It|accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that "the C-word" is also a long-standing euphemism for cancer; [[Lisa Lynch]]'s book led to a BBC1 drama, both with that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groskop|first1=Viv|title=Lisa Lynch obituary Writer who recounted her experience of cancer with engaging candour and published a book based on her popular blog|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/18/lisa-lynch|accessdate=20 May 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The ''Attitudes to potentially offensive language and gestures on TV and radio'' report by [[Ofcom]], based on research conducted by [[Ipsos MORI]], categorised the usage of the word 'cunt' as a highly unacceptable pre-[[Watershed (broadcasting)#United Kingdom|watershed]], but generally acceptable post-watershed, along with 'fuck' and 'motherfucker'. Discriminatory words were generally considered as more offensive than the most offensive non-discriminatory words such as 'cunt' by the UK public, with discriminatory words being more regulated as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/91624/OfcomOffensiveLanguage.pdf|date=September 2016|title=''Attitudes to potentially offensive language and gestures on TV and radio''|work=[[Ipsos MORI]]|publisher=[[Ofcom]]|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====US====
The first scripted use on US television was on the ''[[Larry Sanders Show]]'' in 1992, and a notable use occurred in ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref name=Silverton/&gt; In the US, an episode of the [[NBC]] TV show ''[[30 Rock]]'', titled "[[The C Word]]", centred around a subordinate calling protagonist [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) a "cunt" and her subsequent efforts to regain her staff's favour.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Characters in the popular TV series, ''[[The Sopranos]],'' often used the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/739713784|title=The essential Sopranos reader|last=Lavery|first=David|date=2011|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|others=Lavery, David, 1949-, Howard, Douglas L., 1966-, Levinson, Paul.|year=2011|isbn=9780813130149|location=Lexington, KY|pages=93-104|oclc=739713784}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Fonda]] uttered the word on a live airing of the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', a network broadcast-TV news program, in 2008 when being interviewed about ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/15/fonda_slip/|title=Jane Fonda c-word slip shocks US |accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, controversy erupted when Canadian comedian [[Samantha Bee]] used the term as a slur targeting [[Ivanka Trump]], a [[White House]] official and the daughter of US President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/samantha-bee-ivanka-trump-c-word-america|title=Samantha Bee proves there's still one word you can't say in America|last=Mahdawi|first=Arwa|date=2018-06-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
On 6 December 2010 on the [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today programme]], presenter [[James Naughtie]] referred to the British Culture Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] as "Jeremy Cunt"; he later apologized for what the BBC called the inadvertent use of "an offensive four-letter word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11925556 |title=Today presenter James Naughtie slips up on air |accessdate=2010-12-06 | work=BBC News |date=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the programme following, about an hour later, [[Andrew Marr]] referred to the incident during ''[[Start the Week]]'' where it was said that "we won't repeat the mistake" whereupon Marr slipped up in the same way as Naughtie had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Jasper|title=Radio 4 newsreader got champagne reward for handling Jeremy Hunt gaffe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/10/radio-4-jeremy-hunt-gaff-jim-naughtie-rory-morrison|work=the Guardian|date=10 August 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
&lt;!-- Additions here will need verifiable sources to avoid [[WP:OR|original research]] problems--&gt;
The word appears in graffiti on a wall in the 1969 film ''[[Bronco Bullfrog]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/bronco-bullfrog-1969 BBFC page for Bronco Bullfrog], under "insight" section – ''LANGUAGE: Infrequent strong language ('f**k') occurs, as well as a single written use of very strong language ('c**t') which appears as graffiti on a wall.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first spoken use of the word in mainstream cinema occurs in ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971), in which Jonathan ([[Jack Nicholson]]) asks, "Is this an ultimatum? Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son of a cunt bitch! Is this an ultimatum or not?" In the same year, the word was used in the film ''[[Women in Revolt]]'', in which [[Holly Woodlawn]] shouts "I love cunt" whilst avoiding a violent boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=JJ |title=The Black Hole of the Camera: The Films of Andy Warhol |page=239 |publisher=University of California Press |date=4 March 2012 |isbn=9780520271876|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ4DyN1OmoAC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=women+in+revolt+cunt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hmtAdNgXL-&amp;sig=FaBlujw5xlEkax-3adLhXQJJJwc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT4re-gsDQAhWEMGMKHe55D3IQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20in%20revolt%20cunt&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson later used it again, in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/100-random-movie-facts-you-really-need-to-know|title=100 Random Movie Facts You Really Need To Know|last=Nicholls|first=Owen|date=29 March 2012|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two early films by [[Martin Scorsese]], ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973) and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), use the word in the context of the [[Madonna–whore complex|virgin-whore dichotomy]], with characters using it after they were rejected (in ''Mean Streets'') or after they have slept with the woman (in ''Taxi Driver'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Emmanuel |title=Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of American Independent Film |page=118 |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] |date=1 March 2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-5124-4 |url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=L_j3ninWUdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019075627/http://books.google.com/books?id=L_j3ninWUdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |archivedate=19 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In notable instances, the word has been edited out. ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) was released in two versions, "R" (Restricted) and "PG" (Parental Guidance), the latter omitting or replacing dialogue such as Tony Manero ([[John Travolta]])'s comment to Annette ([[Donna Pescow]]), "It's a decision a girl's gotta make early in life, if she's gonna be a nice girl or a cunt".&lt;ref name=Silverton&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverton|first=Peter|title=Filthy English: The How, Why, When And What Of Everyday Swearing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSErq0ssG74C&amp;pg=PT64|year=2011|publisher=Granta|isbn=9781846274527|pages=64|chapter=Vulvas, Vaginas and Breasts}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differential persists, and in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), [[Clarice Starling|Agent Starling]] ([[Jodie Foster]]) meets [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]] ([[Anthony Hopkins]]) for the first time and passes the cell of "Multiple Miggs", who says to Starling: "I can smell your cunt."

&lt;!-- In view of the now-entrenched use of this word in movies, it is recommended that any further additions to this chronological list be the subject of restraint, i.e. ask yourself "What makes this use of the word NOTABLE?". Non-notable and unreferenced uses will be removed with extreme prejudice --&gt;
In Britain, use of the word "cunt" may result in an "18" rating from the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC), and this happened to [[Ken Loach]]'s film ''[[Sweet Sixteen (2002 film)|Sweet Sixteen]]'', because of an estimated twenty uses of "cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/censorship/news/0,,804490,00.html |title=Loach tells sweet sixteens to ignore BBFC |work=The Guardian |date=4 October 2002 |accessdate=2009-02-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the BBFC's guidelines at "15" state that "very strong language may be permitted, depending on the manner in which it is used, who is using the language, its frequency within the work as a whole and any special contextual justification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbfc.co.uk/what-classification/15|title=15 – British Board of Film Classification|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also directed by Loach, ''[[My Name is Joe]]'' was given a 15 certificate despite more than one instance of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/my-name-joe-1970-3|title=My Name is Joe rated 15 by the BBFC |publisher=Bbfc.co.uk |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 [[Ian Dury]] biopic ''[[Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll (film)|Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll]]'' was given a "15" rating despite containing seven uses of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/550684df5d1e6da9802576930054b16d?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1#_Section1 |title=Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll rated 15 by the BBFC |publisher=Bbfc.co.uk |accessdate=2011-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007154124/http://bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/550684df5d1e6da9802576930054b16d?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1 |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy===
In their [[Derek and Clive]] dialogues, [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]], particularly Cook, arguably made the word more accessible in the UK; in the 1976 sketch "This Bloke Came Up To Me", "cunt" is used approximately thirty-five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.phespirit.info/derekandclive/live_02.htm | title = Derek &amp; Clive – "This Bloke Came Up To Me" | accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used extensively by British comedian [[Roy 'Chubby' Brown]], which ensures that his [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] act has never been fully shown on UK television.&lt;ref name = "Chubby"/&gt;

Australian stand-up comedian [[Rodney Rude]] frequently refers to his audiences as "cunts" and makes frequent use of the word in his acts, which got him arrested in Queensland and Western Australia for breaching obscenity laws of those states in the mid-1980s. Australian comedic singer [[Kevin Bloody Wilson]] makes extensive use of the word, most notably in the songs ''Caring Understanding Nineties Type'' and ''You Can't Say "Cunt" in Canada''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/oztabs/uvw/wilson_kevinbloody/Caring%20Understanding%20Nineties%20Type.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050709141654/http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/oztabs/uvw/wilson_kevinbloody/Caring%20Understanding%20Nineties%20Type.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-07-09 |title=Caring Understanding Nineties Type |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word appears in American comic [[George Carlin]]'s 1972 standup routine on the list of the [[seven dirty words]] that could not, at that time, be said on American broadcast television, a routine that led to a U. S. Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/george-carlin-seven-words-that-shook-a-nation-852833.html |title=George Carlin: Seven words that shook a nation, The Independent, June 24, 2008 |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2011-12-18 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of the original seven are now heard on US broadcast television from time to time, "cunt" remains generally taboo except on premium paid subscription cable channels like HBO or Showtime. Comedian [[Louis C.K.]] uses the term frequently in his stage act as well as on his television show ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'' on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] network, which bleeps it out.

In 2018, Canadian comedian Samantha Bee, ignited a firestorm when she used the term disparagingly in a comedy routine on an American late night TV show, [[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/samantha-bee-ivanka-trump-c-word-america|title=Samantha Bee proves there's still one word you can't say in America| last=Mahdawi|first=Arwa|date=2018-06-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The 1977 [[Ian Dury and The Blockheads]] album, ''[[New Boots and Panties]]'' used the word in the opening line of the track "Plaistow Patricia", thus: "Arseholes, bastards, fucking cunts and pricks",&lt;ref name=Plaistow&gt;{{cite web |title=Ian Dury : New Boots and Panties |url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article.aspx?id=4487 |last=Clarkson |first=John |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly notable as there is no musical lead-in to the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Alan|title=Can's Tago Mago|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0ogBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT27|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-62892-110-6|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads -New Boots And Panties!! 40th Anniversary album review | first = Everett | last =True | work = Classic Rock | date = 3 November 2017 | accessdate = 21 March 2018 | url = http://teamrock.com/review/2017-11-03/ian-dury-the-blockheads-new-boots-and-panties-40th-anniversary-album-review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, during a concert at New York's [[The Bottom Line (venue)|Bottom Line]], [[Carlene Carter]] introduced a song about mate-swapping called "Swap-Meat Rag" by stating, "If this song don't put the cunt back in country, I don't know what will."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlenecarterfanclub.com/press-group-299.html Carlene Carter: Hot Country Singer With Lots Of Cool] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408213656/http://www.carlenecarterfanclub.com/press-group-299.html |date=8 April 2014}}.

The [[Happy Mondays]] song, "Kuff Dam" (i.e. "Mad fuck" in reverse), from their 1987 debut album, ''[[Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)]]'', includes the lyrics "You see that Jesus is a cunt / And never helped you with a thing that you do, or you don't." Biblical scholar James Crossley, writing in the academic journal, ''Biblical Interpretation'', analyses the Happy Mondays' reference to "Jesus is a cunt" as a description of the "useless assistance" of a now "inadequate Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/156851511x557343 |last=Crossley |first=James |date=April 2011 |title=For EveryManc a Religion: Biblical and Religious Language in the Manchester Music Scene, 1976–1994 |journal=Biblical Interpretation |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=151–180 |doi=10.1163/156851511X557343 |publisher=Brill |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phrase from the same lyric, "Jesus is a cunt" was included on the notorious [[Cradle of Filth]] T-shirt which depicted a [[masturbating]] nun on the front and the slogan "Jesus is a cunt" in large letters on the back.

[[Liz Phair]] in "Dance of Seven Veils" on her 1993 album ''[[Exile in Guyville]]'', uses the word in the line "I only ask because I'm a real cunt in spring".{{cite AV media |people=Liz Phair |date=22 June 1993 |title=Exile in Guyville |medium=vinyl |format=Double LP|url=http://www.discogs.com/Liz-Phair-Exile-In-Guyville/master/26390 |id=Matador Records, OLE 051-1}}

The word has been used by numerous non-mainstream bands, such as Australian band [[TISM]], who released an [[extended play]] in 1993 ''[[Australia the Lucky Cunt]]'' (a reference to Australia's label the "lucky country"). They also released a single in 1998 entitled "[[I Might Be a Cunt, but I'm Not a Fucking Cunt]]", which was banned. The American [[grindcore]] band [[Anal Cunt]], on being signed to a bigger label, shortened their name to AxCx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=10 July 2013 | title=The Dumbest Band Names of All Time: Anal Cunt | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-dumbest-band-names-of-all-time-20130710/9-anal-cunt-0855465 | accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in 2012, the word appears at least 10 times in [[Azealia Banks]]' song "[[212 (song)|212]]". She is also known to refer to her fans on Facebook as "kuntz". Banks has said she is "tired" of defending her profanity-laden lyrics from critics, saying they reflect her everyday speech and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Lisa |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/06/azealia-banks-broke-with-expensive-taste-debut-album |title=Hot Tracks: Azealia Banks |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer and video games===
The 2004 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' was the first major video game to use the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas |developer=Rockstar North |level=Don Peyote |quote='''Maccer''': I can't feel me legs, our P; I've wanked the use out of them! / '''Kent Paul''': Just stand up, you soppy cunt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with being the first in the series to use the words ''nigga'', ''motherfucker'', and ''cocksucker''. It was used just once, by the British character [[Kent Paul]] (voiced by [[Danny Dyer]]), who refers to [[Maccer]] as a "soppy cunt" in the mission ''Don Peyote.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://sabotagetimes.com/life/gta-v-the-10-greatest-characters-in-grand-theft-auto-history "GTA V &amp; The 10 Greatest Characters In Grand Theft Auto History"], Matthew Cooper, Sep 10, 2013, Sabotage Times&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 title ''[[The Getaway: Black Monday]]'' by [[Sony Computer Entertainment|SCEE]] used the word several times during the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.ign.com/articles/2004/11/30/the-getaway-black-monday "THE GETAWAY: BLACK MONDAY"], 30 Nov 2004, {{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210224149/http://au.ign.com/ |archivedate=2014-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 title ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (developed by [[Rockstar North]] and distributed by [[Take Two Interactive]]), the word, amongst many other expletives, was used by James Pegorino who, after finding out that his personal bodyguard had [[Turn state's evidence|turned states]], exclaimed "The world is a cunt!" while aiming a shotgun at the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2007/03/FF_160_rockstar?currentPage=all |title=The Road to Ruin: How Grand Theft Auto Hit the Skids |date=March 29, 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-17 |work=Wired |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505235747/http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2007/03/FF_160_rockstar/?currentPage=all |archivedate=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Popular singer, [[Rihanna]], has been outspoken about her use of the word "cunt". She was photographed in 2011 wearing a necklace spelling the word. She later explained why she uses it in an interview with [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']]. The Barbados-born singer said she "never knew" that the word was offensive until she moved to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Fascinating History of the "C Word"|url = http://www.alternet.org/gender/fascinating-history-c-word|newspaper = AlterNet|date = 2012-08-14|access-date = 2015-10-22|first = Lindsay|last = Zoladz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic variants and derivatives==
Various [[euphemism]]s, [[minced oath|minced]] forms and [[in-joke]]s are used to imply the word without actually saying it, thereby escaping obvious censure and censorship.

===Spoonerisms===
{{See also|Spoonerism}}

Deriving from a [[dirty joke]]: "What's the difference between a circus and a strip club?"- "The circus has a bunch of cunning stunts...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/537724?uid=3739616&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102646211393 |last=Dundes |first= Alan |authorlink= |author2=Georges, Robert A. |date=September 1962 |title=Some Minor Genres of Obscene Folklore |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=75 |issue=297 |pages=221–226 |doi=10.2307/537724 |publisher=American Folklore Society |jstor=537724 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''cunning stunt'' has been used in popular music. Its first documented appearance was by the English band [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], who released the album ''[[Cunning Stunts (Caravan album)|Cunning Stunts]]'' in July 1975;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caravan-info.co.uk/backcatalogue/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124212230/http://www.caravan-info.co.uk/backcatalogue/ |archivedate=2010-01-24 | title=Caravan discography |publisher=Caravan Information Service |date = September 2005|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the title was later used by [[Metallica]] for a [[Cunning Stunts (Metallica)|CD/Video compilation]], and in 1992 [[the Cows]] released an [[Cunning Stunts (Cows album)|album with the same title]]. In his 1980s BBC television programme, [[Kenny Everett]] played a vapid starlet, ''Cupid Stunt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/kennyeverett/gallery/09.shtml |title=Classic TV – The Kenny Everett Television Show – Gallery |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acronyms===
There are numerous informal acronyms, including various apocryphal stories concerning academic establishments, such as the ''Cambridge University [[National Trust]] Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standanddeliver.blogs.com/dombo/bill_oddie/index.html | title=My Chat with Graeme Garden, Full Blown |last=Romeo |first=Demetrius |date=22 February 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variants of the covering phrase "[[wikt:see you next Tuesday|See you next Tuesday]]". Creative works with that phrase as a title include a play by [[Ronald Harwood]], [[See You Next Tuesday (album)|the second album]] by hip hop group FannyPack, [[See You Next Tuesday (film)|a 2013 independent film]] by Drew Tobia, a song by deathcore band The Acacia Strain on their 2006 album ''[[The Dead Walk (album)|The Dead Walk]]'', a song by Kesha from the 2010 EP ''[[Cannibal (EP)|Cannibal]]'', and [[See You Next Tuesday (band)|an experimental deathcore band]].

A more recent acronym is "Can't Use New Technology" which is thought to originate from IT staff.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Puns===
The name "Mike Hunt" is a frequent pun on ''my cunt''; it has been used in a scene from the movie ''[[Porky's]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084522/quotes | title = Porky's (1982) | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a character in the [[BBC]] radio comedy ''[[Radio Active (radio series)|Radio Active]]'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcomedy.org.uk/comedy/radioactive.htm|title=Radio Active|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Has Anyone Seen Mike Hunt?" were the words written on a "pink neon sculpture" representing the letter C, in a 2004 exhibition of the alphabet at the [[British Library]] in collaboration with the [[International Society of Typographic Designers]].&lt;ref name = Pretorius&gt;{{cite web |title=Etymology Of Cunt |url=http://www.tanyapretorius.co.za/content/infoholism/etymology/etymology%20cunt.htm |last=Pretorius |first=Tanya |work=Tanya Pretorius' Bookmarks |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Maev | last=Kennedy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/23/education.arts |title=Library show for word rhyming with hunt|publisher=Guardian |date= 2004-10-23|accessdate=2011-12-18 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as obvious references, there are also allusions. On ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', [[Stephen Fry]] once defined ''countryside'' as the act of "murdering [[Piers Morgan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/des-kelly-my-life-in-media-519169.html | title = Des Kelly – My Life in Media | accessdate = 2008-04-06 | work=The Independent | location=London | date=2005-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Parliaments are not immune from punning uses; as recalled by former [[prime minister of Australia|Australian prime minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]]:
{{quote|Never in the House did I use the word which comes to mind. The nearest I came to doing so was when [[Sir Winton Turnbull]], a member of the cavalleria rusticana, was raving and ranting on the adjournment and shouted: "I am a [[Australian Country Party (1920)|Country]] member". I interjected "I remember". He could not understand why, for the first time in all the years he had been speaking in the House, there was instant and loud applause from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/speeches/00-05-24_politicians-humour-debate.shtml |title=That Politicians Have Lost Their Sense Of Humour |date=24 May 2000 |publisher=Whitlamdismissal.com |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129192011/http://whitlamdismissal.com/speeches/00-05-24_politicians-humour-debate.shtml |archivedate=29 January 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}and [[Mark Lamarr]] used a variation of this same gag on BBC TV's ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''. "[[Stuart Adamson]] was a [[Big Country]] member... and we do remember".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115286/quotes | title=Never Mind the Buzzcocks (1996) |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate =2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhyming slang===
Several celebrities have had their names used as euphemisms, including footballer [[Roger Hunt]],&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|author2=Tom Dalzell|author3=Terry Victor|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=New York|year=2006|isbn=0-415-25938-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; actor [[Gareth Hunt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/g.htm |title=A dictionary of slang – "G" – Slang and colloquialisms of the UK|publisher=Peevish.co.uk|accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/slang/gareth_hunt|title=Gareth Hunt is rhyming slang|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous ''Dirty Cockney Rhyming Slang'' Michael O'Mara Books Ltd. {{ISBN|1-84317-035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; singer [[James Blunt]],&lt;ref name=Pretorius/&gt; politician [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watt|first=Holly|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9224722/Jeremy-Hunt-profile-rising-star-who-survived-expenses-scandal.html|title=Jeremy Hunt profile: rising star who survived expenses scandal|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=2013-09-13|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1970s motor-racing driver [[James Hunt]], whose name was once used to introduce the British radio show ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]'' as "the show that is to panel games what James Hunt is to rhyming slang".&lt;ref name = Pretorius/&gt;

Scottish comedian [[Chic Murray]] claimed to have worked for a firm called "Lunt, Hunt &amp; Cunningham".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/haldaneduncan/chic_murray_remembered.php |title=TV Heroes: Part 09: Chic Murray Remembered |accessdate=2008-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608032031/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/haldaneduncan/chic_murray_remembered.php |archivedate=2008-06-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derived meanings===
The word "cunt" forms part of some technical terms used in seafaring and other industries.

* In nautical usage, a '''cunt splice''' is a type of [[Rope splicing|rope splice]] used to join two lines in the [[rigging]] of ships.&lt;ref name="falconers"&gt;William Falconer, ''[http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ss-refs-falc-1243 William Falconer's Dictionary of the Marine]'' (London: Thomas Cadell, 1780), 1243.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name has been [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]] since at least 1861, and in more recent times it is commonly referred to as a "cut splice".&lt;ref name="ashley461"&gt;Clifford W. Ashley, ''The Ashley Book of Knots'' (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 461.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Dictionary of Sea Terms'', found within [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|Dana's]] 1841 maritime [[compendium]] ''The Seaman's Friend'', defines the word '''cuntline''' as "the space between the bilges of two casks, stowed side by side. Where one cask is set upon the cuntline between two others, they are stowed ''bilge and cuntline''."&lt;ref name="seamans"&gt;Richard Henry Dana, Jr., ''[http://www.hmssurprise.org/Resources/DanaSFLex.html The Seaman's Friend: A Treatise on Practical Seamanship, 14th Edition]'' (Boston: Thomas Groom &amp; Co., 1879; Dover Republication 1997), 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The "bilge" of a barrel or cask is the widest point, so when stored together the two casks would produce a curved V-shaped gap. The glossary of ''[[The Ashley Book of Knots]]'' by [[Clifford Ashley|Clifford W. Ashley]], first published in 1944, defines '''cuntlines''' as "the surface seams between the strands of a rope."&lt;ref name="ashley598"&gt;Ashley, 598.&lt;/ref&gt; Though referring to a different object from Dana's definition, it similarly describes the crease formed by two abutting cylinders.&lt;ref name="ashleynote"&gt;Examples of Ashley's usage of "cuntline" are found in the descriptions for illustrations #3338 and #3351.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In US military usage personnel refer privately to a common uniform item, a flat, soft cover (hat) with a fold along the top resembling an invagination, as a '''cunt cap'''.&lt;ref name = Dickson&gt;{{cite book |title= War Slang: American Fighting Words and Phrases Since the Civil War|last= Dickson|first= Paul|authorlink= |year= 2004|publisher= Brassey's|location= Dulles, Virginia|isbn= 978-1-57488-710-5|page= 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proper name for the item is [[garrison cap]] or overseas cap, depending on the organization in which it is worn.
&lt;!-- commented out pending sourcing
* In [[hot-metal printing]], a '''cunt lead''' (pronounced like the soft metal) was a term that was formerly used to describe a small additional inter-line gap, usually of less than 1[[Point (typography)|pt]]. The term is derived from the term [[leading]] which describes more generally inter-line gaps (from the strips of lead that were used to provide the separations).
--&gt;
* '''Cunt hair''' (sometimes as [[red cunt hair]])&lt;ref name = Dickson/&gt; has been used since the late 1950s to signify a very small distance.&lt;ref name = "Morton"/&gt;
* '''Cunt-eyed''' has been used to refer to a person with narrow, squinting eyes.&lt;ref name="Green cunt-eyed"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green's Dictionary of Slang|first=Jonathon |last=Green |volume=1 |publisher=Chambers |date=2008 |isbn=978-0550-10443-4|page=1456 |url= https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/w7hgqcy |accessdate=15 February 2018 |quote=... used of a person with narrow, squinting eyes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ebullism''' is the formation of [[gas]] [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s in [[bodily fluids]] due to reduced environmental pressure, for example at high [[altitude]].  It occurs because a system of liquid and gas at equilibrium will see a net conversion of liquid to gas as pressure lowers, for example, liquids reach their boiling point at lower temperatures when the pressure on them is lowered.

==Description==
In the atmospheric pressure present at [[sea level]], water boils at {{convert|100|°C}}. At an altitude of {{convert|63,000|feet}}, it boils at only {{convert|37|°C}}, the normal [[body temperature]] of humans.  This altitude is known as ''[[Armstrong limit|Armstrong’s Line]].''&lt;ref name="Fundamentals"&gt;Davis, Jeffrey R., Johnson, Robert, and Stepanek,Jan,  ''Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine'', 4th Edition (2008), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice bodily fluids do not boil off at this altitude. This is because the skin and outer organs have enough strength to withstand this pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Geoffrey A., "[http://www.geoffreylandis.com/vacuum.html Human Exposure to Vacuum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721182306/http://www.geoffreylandis.com/vacuum.html |date=July 21, 2009 }}" (Retrieved 2010-02-16).&lt;/ref&gt; thus pressure inside the body would be significantly higher—however, bubbles starting to form is still an issue.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of ebullism&lt;ref&gt;Czarnik, Tam, "[http://www.geoffreylandis.com/ebullism.html Ebullism at 1 Million Feet]" (Retrieved 2010-02-16).&lt;/ref&gt; include bubbles in the membranes of the mouth and eyes, swelling of the [[skin]], and bubbles in the blood. Blood circulation and breathing may be impaired or stopped. The [[brain]] tissue may be [[Hypoxia (medical)|starved]] of [[oxygen]] because of blockage of [[artery|arteries]], and the [[lungs]] may swell and [[hemorrhage]]. Death results unless recompression is rapid enough to reduce the bubbles before tissue damage occurs.

In 1960, [[Joseph Kittinger]] experienced localised ebullism during a {{convert|31|km}} ascent in a [[helium]]-driven gondola.&lt;ref name = Pilmanis2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pilmanis|first=Andrew|author2=William Sears |title=Physiological hazards of flight at high altitude|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2003|volume=362|pages=s16–s17|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15059-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603150593}}&lt;/ref&gt; His right-hand glove failed to pressurise and his hand expanded to roughly twice its normal volume&lt;ref name="NYT May 24, 2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/sports/othersports/24jump.html|title=20-Year Journey for 15-Minute Fall|last=Higgins|first=Matt|date=May 24, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]] (online)|accessdate=2012-09-23|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/escape/skydive.html "Skydive from the Stratosphere"], ''NOVA Online'', [[Public Broadcasting Service]](PBS). November 2000. Retrieved 2012-09-23&lt;/ref&gt;  accompanied by disabling pain. His hand took about 3 hours to recover after his return to the ground.

==Prevention==
To prevent ebullism, a pure oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) atmosphere was used in early space flights to eliminate nitrogen in the blood. There are major fire hazards associated with using pure O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a breathing gas, which was central to the death of three astronauts in a fire during a ground test with [[Apollo 1]].&lt;ref name="apollo1" /&gt; Nonetheless NASA continued to use a [nominally] pure oxygen atmosphere throughout the Apollo Program but switched to air for the follow-on Space Transport System "Space Shuttle". Russian cosmonauts used pure oxygen before changing to a higher-pressure [[nitrox]] mixture, leading to incompatibility problems in 1975 on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.&lt;ref name="spaceline" /&gt; Space suits are often pressurized to several [[pounds per square inch|psi]] lower than stations' capsules or shuttles and since they still use pure O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an acclimation period is common in the airlock to remove nitrogen and other gases from the bloodstream.

'''Ernesto Laclau''' ({{IPA-es|laˈklau|lang}}; 6 October 1935 – 13 April 2014) was an Argentine [[political theory|political theorist]]. He is often described as an 'inventor' of [[Post-marxism|post-Marxist]] political theory. He is well known for his collaborations with his long-term partner, [[Chantal Mouffe]].

He studied History in Buenos Aires, graduating from the [[Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires]] in 1964, and received a PhD from the [[University of Essex]] in 1977.

Since 1986 he served as Professor of Political Theory at the University of Essex, where he founded and directed for many years the graduate programme in [[Ideology]] and [[Discourse Analysis]], as well as the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Under his directorship, the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme has provided a research framework for the development of a distinct type of discourse analysis that draws on post-structuralist theory (especially the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], and [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]), post analytic thought ([[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and [[Richard Rorty]]) and psychoanalysis (primarily the work of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]) to provide innovative analysis of concrete political phenomena, such as identities, discourses and hegemonies. This theoretical and analytical orientation is known today as the '[[Essex School of discourse analysis]]'.&lt;ref&gt;See Jules Townshend, 'Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 5, No. 1, February 2003, pp. 129–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over his career Laclau lectured extensively in many universities in North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia, and South Africa. Most recently he has held positions at [[SUNY Buffalo]] and [[Northwestern University]], both in the US.

Laclau died of a [[heart attack]] in Seville in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rivadavia.com.ar/articulos/ultimo-momento-fallecio-en-sevilla-el-teorico-y-politologo-ernesto-laclau/ |title=ÚLTIMO MOMENTO: Falleció en Sevilla, el téorico y politólogo argentino, Ernesto Laclau &amp;#124; Radio Rivadavia |publisher=Rivadavia.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2014-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414130300/http://rivadavia.com.ar/articulos/ultimo-momento-fallecio-en-sevilla-el-teorico-y-politologo-ernesto-laclau/ |archivedate=2014-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn |first=Robin |url=http://www.versobooks.com/blogs/1556-ernesto-laclau-1935-2014 |title=Ernesto Laclau, 1935-2014 |publisher=VersoBooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Laclau studied History at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]&lt;ref name="La Nacion"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1680569-cuales-eran-las-principales-ideas-de-la-obra-de-ernesto-laclau Cuáles eran las principales ideas de la obra de Ernesto Laclau] - La Nacion, 13 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[National Left (Argentina)|PSIN]] (Socialist Party of the National Left) until 1969, when the British historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] supported his entrance to Oxford.&lt;ref name=P12&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-2286-2005-06-09.html Las manos en la masa - Ernesto Laclau contra Negri, Hardt y Zizek], ''[[Pagina/12]]'', June 5, 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had close links with [[Jorge Abelardo Ramos]], the founder of the PSIN, although he stated in 2005 that the latter had evolved in a direction he did not appreciate.&lt;ref name=P12/&gt; In the same interview, he claimed that he came from a [[Hipólito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyenista]] family, and that the Peronist politician [[Arturo Jauretche]], a strong opponent of [[Agustín Pedro Justo|Justo]]'s dictatorship during the [[Infamous Decade]] of the 1930s, was a close friend of his father.&lt;ref name=P12/&gt;

In his later years, he had close ties with the Argentine Socialist Confederation (Spanish: ''Confederación Socialista Argentina''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavanguardiaweb.com/detalle.php?a=una-apuesta-por-la-transformacion&amp;t=30&amp;d=203 Una apuesta por la transformación] - La Vanguardia&lt;/ref&gt; and in Argentina he is associated with [[Peronism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.perfil.com/2014-04-13-46955-ernesto-laclau-el-ideologo-de-la-argentina-dividida/ Ernesto Laclau, el ideólogo de la Argentina dividida] - Perfil, 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Laclau's early work was influenced by Althusserian Marxism and focused on issues debated within Neo-Marxist circles in the 1970s, such as the role of the state, the dynamics of capitalism, the importance of building popular movements, and the possibility of revolution. Laclau's most significant book is ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'', which he co-authored with [[Chantal Mouffe]] in 1985. The position outlined in this book is usually described as post-Marxist because it rejects (a) [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[economic determinism]] and (b) the view that [[class struggle]] is the most important antagonism in society. In their 2001 introduction to the second edition Laclau and Mouffe commented on this label, stating that whilst '''post''-Marxist' they were also 'post-''Marxist''&lt;nowiki/&gt;':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hegemony and Socialist Strategy|last = Laclau|first = Erneso|publisher = Verso|year = 2001 |origyear=1985|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; their work, though a departure from traditional Western Marxism, retained similar concerns and ideas. A key innovation in ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy'' was Laclau and Mouffe's argument that left-wing movements need to build alliances with a wide variety of different groups if they are to be successful and establish a left-wing 'hegemony'. In the final chapter of the book, the project of "radical and plural democracy" was advocated: a democracy in which subjects accept the importance of the values of liberty and equality, but fight over what the terms mean.

In ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy'' Laclau and Mouffe also offered a constructivist account of 'discourse'. By drawing on the work of the later Wittgenstein, they argued that social entities only become meaningful through discursive articulation. As such, the meaning of something is never pre-given but is, instead, constructed through social practices. Laclau subsequently used this account of discourse to re-consider the nature of identity, arguing that all political identities are discursive - even if they are experienced by individuals as 'natural' (even to the point where one's identity is not recognised as an identity). For example, though an individual may think that they are just 'born male' this is, for Laclau, not the case: 'maleness' is a socially constructed category that has no innate meaning.

In his more recent works Laclau returned to a topic that was prevalent in his earliest writings: populism. In ''On Populist Reason'', Laclau considered the nature of populism in political discourse, the creation of a popular hegemonic bloc such as "the people", and the importance of affect in politics. Building on his earlier work, Laclau argued that the basis of populism lies in the creation of "empty signifiers": words and ideas that express a universal idea of justice, and symbolically structure the political environment. Against those who see populism as a threat to democracy, Laclau argued that it is an essential component of it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = On Populist Reason|last = Laclau|first = Ernesto|publisher = Verso|year = 2005|isbn = |location = London|pages = 232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laclau's relationship with Slavoj Žižek ===
Laclau is known for his long standing dialogue with Lacanian 'arch-Marxist' [[Slavoj Žižek]]. This dates back to at least 1989, when Laclau wrote the introduction to Žižek's first book in English (''The Sublime Object of Ideology''). Žižek is widely recognized as responsible for Laclau's increased acceptance of Lacanian ideas, and his essay 'Beyond Discourse Analysis',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beyond Discourse Analysis|last = Žižek|first = Slavoj|publisher = Verso|year = 1990|isbn = |location = London|pages = 249–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in Laclau's ''New Reflections on the Revolutions of Our Time'' (1990), provided a psychoanalytic critique of Laclau's work. In 2000 Laclau, Žižek, and Judith Butler published the trialogue ''Contingency, Hegemony, Universality'', in which each responded to the others' works in a three-essay cycle. Though Žižek and Laclau noted their similarities and mutual respect, significant political and theoretical differences emerged between all three interlocutors. Following several acrimonious publications in the early 2000s Laclau wrote in 2005's ''On Populist Reason'' that Žižek had an impractical and confused approach to politics, describing him as 'waiting for the martians'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their disagreement escalated in the pages of ''Critical Inquiry'' in 2006 where, in a spate of essays, the two argued in an increasingly hostile manner about political action, Marxism and class struggle, Hegel, populism, and the Lacanian Real.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 10.1086/508086|title = Why Constructing A People is the Main Task of Radical Politics|last = Laclau|first = Ernesto|date = 2006|journal = Critical Inquiry|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 10.1086/509751|title = Schlagend, aber nicht Treffend!|last = Žižek|first = Slavoj|date = 2006|journal = Critical Inquiry|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More recently, in a 2014 interview with David Howarth, Laclau stated that his relationship with Žižek had deteriorated due to the latter adopting a 'frantic ultra-Leftist stance, wrapped in a Leninism of kindergarten'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ernesto Laclau: Post-Marxism, Populism and Critique|last = Laclau|first = Ernesto|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = Abingdon|pages = 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fact-finding''' is the job of a person or group of persons in a judicial or administrative proceeding that has or have the responsibility of determining the facts relevant to decide a controversy. The term '''[[trier of fact]]''' generally denotes the same function.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/fact-finding Law Dictionary: Fact-Finder]. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The process is an extremely important part of the communication process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/problem/factfinding.htm General Information on Fact-Finding]. Colorado University. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fact-finding was first established during the [[Hague Convention of 1907]], which dealt with international commissions of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations===
On 9 December 1991, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] approved the ''[[Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field of the Maintenance of International Peace and Security]]''. The resolution emphasized
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...that the ability of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security depends to a large extent on its acquiring detailed knowledge about the factual circumstances of any dispute or situation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
to encourage States to bear in mind the role that competent organs of the United Nations can play in ascertaining the facts in relation to disputes or situations.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/46/a46r059.htm Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field of the Maintenance of International Peace and Security]. 9 December 1991. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is also a range of fact-finding procedures in the [[United Nations]] relating to serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law, as well as fact-finding on the crimes of aggression, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity which is carried out by the [[International Criminal Court]].  Professor [[Lyal S. Sunga]] discusses how UN human rights special procedures fact-finding can help the International Criminal Court find facts and how the two should be made complementary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyal S. Sunga]], "How Can UN Human Rights Special Procedures Sharpen ICC Fact-Finding?" 15(2) ''The International Journal of Human Rights'' (2011) 187–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triers of fact==
{{main article|Trier of fact}}

Fact finders often have the job of determining what facts are available and their relevancy.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Norman. [http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/fact-finding/ Fact-Finding]. Accessed 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of fact finder is determined by the type of proceeding. In a jury trial, it is the role of a jury in a jury trial. In a non-jury trial, the judge sits both as a fact-finder and as the trier of law. In administrative proceedings it may be a hearing officer or a hearing body.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Characteristics of fact-finding==
According to the United Nations, fact-finding should be comprehensive, [[Journalistic objectivity|objective]], [[impartiality|impartial]] and [[timeliness|timely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution 46/59 Declaration of fact-finding missions |url=http://undocs.org/A/RES/46/59 |publisher=UN |location =New York |date=9 December 1991 |quote=Fact-finding should be comprehensive, objective, impartial and timely.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenlandic Norse''' is an extinct [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] that was spoken in the Norse settlements of [[Greenland]] until their demise in the late 15th century. The language is attested through some 80 [[runic inscriptions]], many of which are difficult to date and not all of which were necessarily carved by people born in Greenland.&lt;ref name='Bandle'&gt;Bandle, p. 1234.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to identify specifically Greenlandic linguistic features in the limited runic material. Nevertheless, there are inscriptions showing the use of ''t'' for historical ''[[þ]]'' in words such as ''torir'' rather than ''þorir'' and ''tana'' rather than ''þana''. This linguistic innovation has parallels in West Norwegian in the [[late Middle Ages|late medieval period]].&lt;ref name='Bandle'/&gt; On the other hand, Greenlandic appears to have retained some features which changed in other types of Scandinavian. This includes initial ''hl'' and ''hr'', otherwise only preserved in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and the long vowel ''œ'', which merged with ''æ'' in Icelandic but was preserved in [[Old Norwegian|Norwegian]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenlandic Norse is believed to have been in [[language contact]] with [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], the language of the indigenous [[Kalaallit]], and to have left [[loanword]]s in that language. In particular, the Greenlandic word ''Kalaaleq'' (older ''Karaaleq''), meaning ''Greenlander'', is believed to be derived from the word ''[[Skræling]]r'', the Norse term for the people they [[Norse colonization of the Americas|encountered in North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Jahr, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the word ''kona'', meaning ''woman'', is of Norse origin.&lt;ref&gt;Jahr, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The available evidence does not establish the presence of [[language attrition]]; the language most likely disappeared with the ethnic group that spoke it.&lt;ref name='Bandle'/&gt;

A main characteristic of Greenlandic Norse was that it was very conservative. The older forms of speaking, which had come from Iceland and Norway, were kept intact. In keeping with this conservatism, the Greenlanders likewise maintained the older runic characteristics, most of which had fallen out of use in other countries. Notwithstanding this, they created new designs for the ð-, b-, p- and r-runes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arild-hauge.com/egronrun.htm|title=THE RUNES OF GREENLAND|last=Hauge|first=Arild|date=|website=www.arild-hauge.com|publisher=July 13, 2004|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample text==
The [[Kingittorsuaq Runestone]] dates from c. 1300, discovered near [[Upernavik]], far north of the Norse settlements. It was presumably carved by Norse explorers.

The patronymic ''Tortarson'' ([[Old Norse orthography#Normalized spelling|standardized Old Norse]]: ''Þórðarson'') shows the change from ''þ'' to ''t'' while the word ''hloþu'' (Old Icelandic ''hlóðu'', Old Norwegian ''lóðu'') shows the retention of initial ''hl''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2656">In [[United States]] [[military terminology]], a '''high-value target''' ('''HVT''') is a person or resource that an enemy commander requires to complete a mission. The term has been widely used in the [[news media]] for [[Osama Bin Laden]] and high-ranking officers of [[Al-Qaeda]] who are considered essential for completing their operations. Former Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] was known as High Value Target Number One by the United States military before [[Operation Red Dawn|his capture]].

Soldiers are often asked to do all that is possible to capture an HVT alive but, if that is impossible, they are given clearance to fire.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Various tasked Joint Special Operations Task Forces ([[Task Force 145]], [[Task Force 121]], [[Task Force 11]]) have been established for the main purposes of capturing or killing these high-value targets. Forces assigned to these tasked forces include units mainly from the [[Joint Special Operations Command ]] and [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] such as the US Navy SEALs, US Army [[Delta Force]], US Navy [[SEAL Team Six]], US Army [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] and elements of the [[British Army]]'s [[Special Air Service]] (SAS).&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M.

'''Jamaican Maroon spirit-possession language''', '''Maroon Spirit language''', '''Jamaican Maroon Creole''' or '''Deep patwa''' is a [[Sacred language|ritual language]] and formerly mother tongue of [[Jamaican Maroons]].  It is an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole]] with a strong [[Akan language|Akan]] component, specifically from the [[Asante language]] of the [[Ashanti Region]] of [[Ghana]].  It is distinct from usual [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican Creole]], being similar to the creoles of [[Sierra Leone]] ([[Krio language|Krio]]) and [[Suriname]] such as [[Sranan Tongo|Sranan]] and [[Ndyuka language|Ndyuka]].  It is also more purely [[Akan language|Akan]] than regular [[Jamaican Patois|Patois]], with little to no contribution from other African languages.  Today, the Maroon Spirit language is used by [[Jamaican Maroons]] (largely [[Coromantee]]s) while [[spirit possession|possessed]] by the spirits of ancestors during Coromantee (Kromanti) ceremonies or when addressing those who are possessed.

The term "Kromanti" is used by participants in such ceremonies in order to refer to the language spoken by ancestors in the distant past, prior to the creolization of Jamaican Maroon Creole. This term is used to refer to a language which is "clearly not a form of Jamaican Creole and displays very little English content" (Bilby 1983: 38). While Kromanti is not a functioning language, those possessed by ancestral spirits are attributed the ability to speak it. More remote ancestors are compared with more recent ancestors on a gradient, such that increasing strength and ability in the use of the non-creolized Kromanti are attributed to increasingly remote ancestors (as opposed to the Jamaican Maroon Creole used to address these ancestors).

The language was brought along by the Maroon population from [[Trelawny town]] to [[Nova Scotia]] in [[1796]] where they were sent in exile. They eventually traveled to [[Sierra Leone]] in [[1800]]. Their creole language highly influenced the local creole language that evolved into present day [[Krio language|Krio]].

'''Jizhao''' ({{zh|吉兆话}}) is an unclassified [[Kra-Dai language]] spoken in Jizhao Village 吉兆村, Tanba Town 覃巴镇, [[Wuchuan, Guangdong]]. It may be most closely related to [[Be language|Be]].&lt;ref name="Ostapirat1998"/&gt; In Wuchuan, Jizhao is locally referred to as '''Haihua 海话''', which is the term used elsewhere in [[Leizhou]] 雷州, [[Xuwen]] 徐闻, and [[Maoming]] 茂名 to refer to the local [[Southern Min|Minnan Chinese]] dialect of Leizhou.&lt;ref name="Shao2016"&gt;Shao Lanzhu [邵兰珠]; Meng Yuanyao [蒙元耀]. 2016. "Loanwords of Min dialect in Jizhao dialect in Guangdong" [广东吉兆话中的闽方言借词]. In ''Journal of Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology'' [广东石油化工学院学报], Vol. 26, No. 2, April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Jizhao is a highly endangered language that only has speakers above the age of 60 (Shao 2016:70). Within Jizhao Administrative Village 吉兆行政村, it is spoken in the hamlets (natural villages) of Jizhao 吉兆, Meilou 梅楼, and Hong 洪村 villages (Shao 2016:9).

As of 2017, there are fewer than 100 speakers of Jizhao, most of whom are above the age of 70.&lt;ref name="Li2017"&gt;Li Jinfang [李锦芳]; Wu Yan [吴艳]. 2017.

==Classification==
Shao &amp; Meng (2016) observe some similarities with the [[Ong Be language|Be language]] of northern [[Hainan]], but provisionally consider Jizhao to be unclassified within the Kam-Tai (壮侗) branch. Jizhao has many loanwords from [[Yue Chinese]] and [[Southern Min|Minnan Chinese]].

Weera Ostapirat (1998),&lt;ref name="Ostapirat1998"&gt;Ostapirat, W. (1998). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23756759 A Mainland Bê Language? / 大陆的Bê语言？].

"Guangdongsheng Wuchuan fangyan jilve" [广东省吴川方言记略]. In ''Fangyan'' [方言] 1992(3).&lt;/ref&gt;, notes that Be and Jizhao share many lexical similarities and sound correspondences, and that Jizhao may be a remnant Be-related language on the Chinese mainland.

In a 100-item [[Swadesh list]], Shao (2016) found lexical matches between Jizhao and the following languages.
*[[Ong Be language|Ong Be]]: 56 words
*[[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]]: 6 words
*[[Yue Chinese]]: 7 words
*[[Min Chinese]]: 1 word
*No parallels: 30 words

==Phonology==
Jizhao has 6 tones (Shao 2016:15).

#[31]
#[32]
#[33]
#[55]

Jizhao, like [[Hlai language|Hlai]], also has the [[implosive consonant]]s /[[ɓ]]/ and /[[ɗ]]/ (Li &amp; Wu 2017).

'''Kia ora''' ({{IPA-mi|kia ora|lang}}, approximated in English as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|iː|ə|_|ˈ|ɔːr|ə}} {{respell|KEE|ə|_|OR|ə}}) is a [[Māori language]] [[greeting]] which has entered [[New Zealand English]]. It means, literally, ''have life'' ''be well/healthy'' and is translated as an informal ''hi'' or "hello" at the [[Māori Language Commission]] website Kōrero Māori.

==Uses==
It might be used as a [[salutation]], a farewell or an expression of thanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.korero.maori.nz/forlearners/protocols/geetings.html |title=Ngā Mihi – Greetings |publisher=Kōrero Māori |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also signifies agreement with a speaker at a meeting, as part of a culture which prizes [[public speaking|oratory]]. These other Māori greetings, ''tēnā koe''; ''tēnā kōrua''; and ''tēnā koutou'' (respectively, one; two; and three or more people), are also widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korero.maori.nz/forlearners/protocols/geetings.html|title=Ngā Mihi – Greetings |publisher=Kōrero Māori|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] website NZ History lists it as one of 100 Māori words every New Zealander should know, with a definition "Hi!, G'day! (general informal greeting)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/maori-language-week/100-maori-words#greeting |title=100 Maori words every New Zealander should know |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kia ora'' can follow a similar pattern to address different specific numbers of people. By itself, it can be used to address any number of people, but by adding ''koe'' (i.e., ''kia ora koe''); ''kōrua''; and ''koutou'' one can specify a greeting to, respectively, a single; two; or three or more people). Similarly, by following with ''tātou'', one addresses all the people present, including the speaker themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Māori words every New Zealander should know|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/100-maori-words|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
New Zealand's national airline, [[Air New Zealand]], uses ''Kia Ora'' as the name for its [[inflight magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KiaOra Air New Zealand inflight magazine |url= http://www.bauermedia.co.nz/Magazines/kiaora-air-new-zealand-inflight-magazine.htm |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water Safety New Zealand, a [[water safety]] advocacy organisation, has a specific Maori water safety programme, ''Kia Maanu Kia Ora'', which makes use of the literal meaning of kia ora, as their message translates as ''stay afloat; stay alive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maori |url= http://www.watersafety.org.nz/education/maori/ |publisher=Water Safety New Zealand |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 1984, at a time when the use of Māori phrases was uncommon in New Zealand, an Auckland telephone operator, [[Naida Glavish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://e-tangata.co.nz/news/naida-glavish-she-wouldnt-comply|title=Naida Glavish – she wouldn’t comply|date=6 September 2015|work=E-Tangata – A Māori and Pasifika Sunday magazine|access-date=19 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was instructed to stop using ''kia ora'' when greeting callers after the post office had received a complaint. She refused to do so and was consequently stood down, with the whole affair attracting much public interest. The Postmaster-General, [[Rob Talbot]], convinced the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[Robert Muldoon]], to overturn that prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/8115292/Rob-Talbot-dies-top-advocate-for-Sth-Canty | title= Rob Talbot dies, top advocate for Sth Canty | date=22 December 2012 | work=[[The Timaru Herald]] | accessdate=15 March 2015 | first=Mike | last=Crean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elsewhere==
''Kia ora'' has a similar meaning to the word ''kia orana'', found in related [[Polynesian languages]], such as [[Cook Islands Māori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cookislands.org.uk/raro1.html |title=Rarotonga |publisher=The Cook Islands website |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kuot language''', or '''Panaras''', is a [[language isolate]], the only non-[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language spoken on the island of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. There are about 2,400 speakers, concentrated primarily on the northwest coast of the island.  Perhaps due to the small speaker base, there are no significant dialects present within Kuot.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Chul-Hwa &amp; Chung, Kyung-Ja, [http://www.sil.org/pacific/png/abstract.asp?id=37101 Kuot Grammar Essentials],  1993:p1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
Kuot is an [[endangered language]] with most if not all children growing up speaking [[Tok Pisin]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Lindström (November 12, 2002). "Kuot Language and Culture". Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University. Retrieved October 14, 2016. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===

The vowels /i/ and /u/ tend to become glide-vowels in occurrence with other vowels. The length of the vowels is not making differences for the meaning of words. The appearance of /i/ and /u/ with other vowels can not be seen as [[diphthong]] or a combination of vowel and glide-vowel. There are never more than three vowels per syllable. The combination of diphthong and vowel is also possible but they are pronounced in conditions of the syllable. Diphthongs are spoken like one sound.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Lindström (November 12, 2002). "Kuot Language and Culture". Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University. Retrieved October 14, 2016. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphophonemic Alternations===

===='t' to 'r' Alternation====

The phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} in certain possessive markers, such as "''-tuaŋ''", "''-tuŋ''" and "''-tuo''" becomes {{IPA|/r/}} when it comes after a stem ending in a vowel.  Compare:

* ''ira-ruaŋ'' – my father
* ''luguan-tuaŋ''  – my house
* ''i'rama-ruo'' – my eye
* ''nebam-tuaŋ'' – my feather

====Vowel Shortening====

Where the third person singular masculine suffix "-oŋ" is used on a noun that ends with a vowel, this vowel is typically not pronounced.  For instance, "''amaŋa-oŋ''" is pronounced {{IPA|[aˈmaŋɔŋ]}}, not {{IPA|[aˈmaŋaɔŋ]}}.

====Voicing Rule====

When vowel-initial suffixes are added to stems that end in voiceless consonants, those consonants become voiced. For example:

* {{IPA|/obareit-oŋ/}} {{IPA|[obaˈreidoŋ]}} ''he splits it''
* {{IPA|/taɸ-o/}} {{IPA|[taˈβo]}} ''he drinks''
* {{IPA|/marik-oŋ/}} {{IPA|[maˈriɡoŋ]}} ''he prays''

The phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} becomes {{IPA|[β]}}, not {{IPA|[b]}}.

* {{IPA|/sip-oŋ/}} {{IPA|[ˈsiβɔŋ]}} ''it comes out''
* {{IPA|/irap-a/}} {{IPA|[iˈraβa]}} ''her eyes''

==Grammar==
The language uses a VSO word order, similar to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ling.su.se/staff/evali/kuot.htm |title=Kuot Language and Culture |author=Eva Lindström |date=November 12, 2002 |publisher=Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language is primarily [[agglutinative]].  There are two grammatical genders, male and female, and distinction is made in the first person between singular, dual, and plural, as well as between exclusive and inclusive.

For instance, the sentence {{lang|kto|parak-oŋ ira-ruaŋ kamin}} literally means 'my father eats sweet potato'.  ''Parak-oŋ'' is a [[continuous aspect]] of the verb meaning 'to eat', ''ira'' means 'father', ''-ruaŋ'' is a suffix used to indicate [[inalienable possession]] ('my father'), and ''kamin'' is a simple noun meaning '[[sweet potato]]'.

'''Lala-Bisa''' is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Zambia]] that is closely related to [[Bemba language|Bemba]].

Swaka dialect is divergent, and sometimes classified as a separate language (Nurse 2003). Maho (2009) lists Biisa (Wisa), Lala, Ambo, Luano, and Swaka as distinct languages, with Ambo and Luano closest to Lala.

== Immigrant languages ==

Languages spoken by immigrants and their descendants are found in Venezuela. The most important are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (400,000), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (254,000), [[Italian language|Italian]] (200,000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernasconi|first1=Giulia|title=L’ITALIANO IN VENEZUELA|journal=Italiano LinguaDue|date=2012|issue=2|page=20|doi=10.13130/2037-3597/1921|url=https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=doajarticles::e2c6e2d8ae5915079007d321c21defb0|accessdate=22 January 2017|publisher=Università degli Studi di Milano|language=Italian|quote=L'italiano come lingua acquisita o riacquisita è largamente diffuso in Venezuela: recenti studi stimano circa 200.000 studenti di italiano nel Paese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (110,000), [[German language|German]] (20,000) and [[English language|English]] (20,000).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/VE|website=Ethnologue|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people who live next to the border of [[Brazil]] speak Portuguese. In the areas located near to [[Guyana]] English language is used by some inhabitants, especially on [[Ankoko Island]]. [[Colonia Tovar dialect]], a dialect of [[German language]], is spoken in the [[Colonia Tovar]].

== Languages taught in schools ==

=== English ===

English is a foreign language with a great demand in Venezuela.  It is spoken by many academics and professionals and by some members of the middle and high social classes. There is an English language newspaper in Caracas: ''The Daily Journal'', founded in 1946. The use of English arose in part due to the presence of oil companies from English speaking countries (especially from the United States) since the beginning of the 20th century.

English is taught as a compulsory subject in the secondary education and in the ''bachillerato'' for five years. Bachillerato is a segment of secondary education similar to the [[baccalaureat]], [[secondary school]] or American [[high school]] and is divided into two branches: sciences and humanities. According to the syllabus approved by the Venezuelan Ministry of Education in 1986 English language is considered as a tool to communicate with people from other countries and to obtain information in the areas of humanities, technology and science.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio de Educación: ''Programas de Estudio, Educación Básica, INGLÉS, 7o, 8o, 9o grados''. Caracas: 1986 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason it is taught using a [[Communicative Language Teaching|Notional Functional Approach]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio de Educación: ''Programas de Estudio, Educación Básica, INGLÉS, 7o, 8o, 9o grados''. Caracas: 1986 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the bachillerato a [[Structuralism|Structuralistic Approach]] is used. Despite the lines provided by the syllabus, few people learn to speak the language with only the knowledge acquired at school.

In some universities degree programs to train teachers or translators of English language are offered. In the rest of universities English is studied as a compulsory subject to understand texts written in this language.

=== Italian ===
{{main|Italian language in Venezuela}}
In the second half of the twentieth century, more than 300,000 Italians mostly from [[Veneto]] moved to this oil rich country and left -linguistically - many words in the local language. For example, "Ciao" (English: Bye) is now a usual friendly salute in Caracas, not only between [[Italo-Venezuelans]]. There are even expressions in the local young people that mix Italian and Spanish words: "Muérete que chao" is an example.

According to the Italian Embassy in Caracas the "....Italian language teaching is guaranteed by the presence of a consistent number of private Venezuelan schools and institutions, where Italian language courses and Italian literature are active. Other similar courses are organized and sponsored by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Associations.

The Didactic Office of the General Consulate of Caracas, together with the Embassy, is negotiating an Agreement with the Venezuelan Authorities for the recognition of the Study Diplomas emitted by the Italian School (in Venezuela there is a Civil Association called “Agostino Codazzi” which offers the complete didactic cycle from elementary to high school) so that there can be access to the University system in Venezuela with an Italian high school Diploma.

=== French ===
[[French language]] is taught as a compulsory subject in the branch of humanities of the ''bachillerato'' or high school for two years. Students learn French grammar in their first year of study, then construct and translate French texts in the second year.

In some universities degree programs to train teachers or translators of French language are offered.

=== Latin and Greek ===
In [[Venezuela]] Latin is taught as a compulsory subject in the branch of humanities of the high school for two years. Students learn Latin grammar in their first year, then construct and translate Latin texts in the second year.&lt;ref&gt;Duque Arellano, José Gonzalo [http://servidor-opsu.tach.ula.ve/ascen_acro/duque_j/latin/capitulo2.pdf Pertinencia y vigencia del latín en la enseñanza de la lengua española, en las áreas de la morfología y de la sintaxis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227060653/http://servidor-opsu.tach.ula.ve/ascen_acro/duque_j/latin/capitulo2.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}; ''Universidad de los Andes'' {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At university level, the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela|University of the Andes]] offers a degree program for ''Letras Mención Lengua y Literaturas Clásicas'' (''Classical Languages and Literatures''). In this program (the only one of its type in Venezuela), the students learn Latin, [[Ancient Greek]] and the literature of both languages for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loe.cnu.gov.ve/ver_info_carrera.php?cod_carrera=349&amp;cod_area=7&amp;cod_subarea=22 Detalle de la Carrera: "Letras Mención Lengua y Literaturas Clasicas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164949/http://loe.cnu.gov.ve/ver_info_carrera.php?cod_carrera=349&amp;cod_area=7&amp;cod_subarea=22 |date=2008-02-09 }}; ''CNU-OPSU: Oportunidades de Estudio de Educación Superior en Venezuela'' {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Venezuelan universities, Latin is a compulsory subject of the program for ''Letras'' (''Hispanic Literature'') and ''Educación, mención: Castellano y Literatura'' (''Education of Spanish language and Hispanic Literature'').

Latin and [[Koine Greek]] are also taught in [[Seminary|Roman Catholic seminaries]].

In [[BDSM]], '''limits''' refer to issues that participants in a [[Play (BDSM)|play]] [[BDSM#Scenes|scene]] or dynamic feel strongly about, usually referring to prohibited activities. Participants typically [[Consent (BDSM)#Negotiation|negotiate]] an outline of what activities will and will not take place. The participants describe what they desire, do not desire, will and will not tolerate, including the determination of limits. For example, it is common to set a [[safeword]] and to establish certain types of play as prohibited.

The BDSM usage of the terminology "limits" derives from the concept of "off limits", the idea of limiting a scene to a specific set of activities, and the limitations (in terms of interest, as well as physical and emotional tolerance) of the participants.

==Setting limits==
Both [[Top (BDSM)|dominant]]s and [[Bottom (BDSM)|submissive]]s can set limits. Limits can be agreed to verbally or they can be incorporated into a formal contract. Sometimes the participants engage in a formal conversation about limits and boundaries; this is referred to as [[Consent (BDSM)#Negotiation|negotiation]]. Other couples discuss their likes and dislikes in a similar manner to "[[Vanilla sex|Vanilla]]" relationships.

==="No limits"===
Some partners choose not to set limits. This is commonly seen in [[Master/slave (BDSM)|total power exchange]] dynamics, [[Consent (BDSM)#Consensual non-consent|consensual non-consent]], and [[edgeplay]]. Whether or not this type of arrangement is considered "[[safe, sane and consensual]]" is a matter of some controversy in BDSM communities, those favoring the approach pointing that limits are either wishful thoughts which can never be reliably enforced, or sometimes,  just deceptions in order to find acceptance by society.

==Types of limits==
The terminology varies slightly across different local communities and Internet forums. However, there are general usages recognized across most BDSM populations.

===Hard limit===
A hard limit is something that must not be done. Violating a hard limit is often considered a just cause for ending a scene or even a relationship. Examples include  “[[feces|scat]] is a hard limit for me” or “I have a back injury, so striking on the back is a hard limit”.

===Soft limit===
A soft limit is something that a person hesitates about or places strict conditions on, but for which they may still give informed consent. An action could be prohibited except under specific circumstances or an area of discomfort that someone wishes to avoid. Soft limits can also include actions that require a cautious approach or — while somewhat appealing — still generate an uncomfortable amount of apprehension in one or more partners.

===Requirement limit===
A requirement limit, or must-limit, is something without which one or more partners will not participate in the scene. Examples include “lots of hair pulling is a must-limit for me” or “if you’re going to flog me, I’ll need lots of [[Aftercare (BDSM)|aftercare]].”

===Time limit===
A time limit is a set time period for which an activity or temporary relationship takes place. This is most common for [[BDSM#Scenes|scenes]] and casual [[Play (BDSM)|play]].

Some couples practice time limitations for relationships. They can be used to set time limits on phases of relationships, such as training or consideration.

Data is from the 18th edition of [[Ethnologue|''Ethnologue: Languages of the World'']].]]

'''Linguistic diversity index''' ('''LDI''') may refer to either [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg’s]] (language) Diversity Index&lt;ref name="greenberg1956"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=410659 | title=The Measurement of Linguistic Diversity | journal=Language | year=1956 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=109–115 | last=Greenberg | first=Joseph H. | doi=10.2307/410659}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the related Index of Linguistic Diversity (ILD) from [[Terralingua]], which measures changes in the underlying LDI over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=97–151 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenberg's Diversity Index (LDI) is the probability that two people selected from the population at random will have different mother tongues; it therefore ranges from 0 (everyone has the same mother tongue) to 1 (no two people have the same mother tongue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=country |title=Summary by country |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILD measures how the LDI has changed over time; a global ILD of 0.8 indicates a 20% loss of diversity since 1970, but ratios above 1 are possible, and have appeared in regional indexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=106–107 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computation of the diversity index is based on the population of each language as a proportion of the total population.  The index cannot fully account for the vitality of languages.  Also, the distinction between a language and a [[dialect]] is fluid and often political. A great number of languages are considered to be dialects of another language by some experts and separate languages by others.  The index does not consider how different the languages are from each other, nor does it account for second language usage; it considers only the total number of distinct languages, and their relative frequency as mother tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/overview/ |title=overview of Linguistic Diversity |publisher=terralingua.org |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis Notari''' ([[Monaco]], 1879-1961) was the pioneer of Monégasque [[literature]]. He wrote in the [[French language|French]] and [[Monégasque language|Monégasque]] languages.

==Principal writings==

He wrote the text of the [[Hymne Monégasque|Monaco national anthem]] and he is considered as the first writer in Monégasque; before him, there was just [[oral literature]]. He wrote three books.

*''A legenda de Santa Devota''/''Santa Devota'' (1927) -about the legend of [[Saint Devota]].
*''Bülüghe munegasche'' (1941).
*''Quelques notes sur les traditions de Monaco'' (1960).

Notari's writing in Monégasque has led to a veritable flowering of literature published in the language. A grammar and a dictionary by [[Louis Frolla]] and numerous other works, including by [[Georges Franzi]], [[Louis Barral]] and Suzanne Simone (dictionary) [[Louis Canis]], [[Jules Soccal]], Lazare Sauvaigo and Robert Buisson, combine to allow this small country's own language to take its visible and permanent place among the other Romance languages.

However, while a substantial proportion of Notari's work was religious in inspiration, Monégasque is probably unique among the Romance languages in that it possesses, as yet, no Bible translation.

==Former fascist sympathies==

In his researches in Monégasque identity, Notari got in touch in the 1930s with Italian academics sustaining regional languages for a Latin federation pledged to the [[Italian fascism|fascist Italian]] government.&lt;ref&gt;''Un rocher bien occupé, [[Monaco]] pendant la guerre 1939-1945'', [[Pierre Abramovici]], Seuil, Paris, 2001,&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, he wrote a few poems celebrating [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;Annales du comté de Nice (1934-1935), FM17-Bibliothèque Notari (Monaco)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[post-War]] era, however, any fascist sympathies which Notari may once have held were not stressed.

==Personal legacy==
The decision by the late [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]] to sponsor Monégasque teachers in local schools owed much to the groundwork in promoting Monégasque which writers such as Notari and others laid. Louis Notari was also prominent in [[civil engineering]] in the Principality, and was noted for his work on Monaco's renowned [[Jardin Exotique de Monaco|exotic garden]], which annually hosts large numbers of visitors from many countries.

A street in the suburb of [[La Condamine]], Monaco, is named after Louis Notari. A library, the  [[Bibliothèque Louis Notari]], which serves as the national [[copyright]] library for Monaco, is also named after him.

'''Luna''' is a [[Bantu language]] of eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Assigned by Guthrie to a group called ''Songe'' (L.20), it is presumably one of the [[Luban languages]] established by Ahmed (1995), like most of the other Songe languages, though it was not specifically addressed.&lt;ref name=Nurse&gt;Nurse &amp; Phillipson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruhlen (1987) agrees in placing it with the Luban languages.

A media '''scrum''' is an impromptu [[press conference]], often held immediately outside an event such as a legislative session or meeting.&lt;ref&gt;''In the News: The Practice of Media Relations in Canada'' by William W.

The same term is now also used for similar gatherings of journalists in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/why-iowans-cant-make-up-their-minds/250754/ |title=Why Iowans Can't Make Up Their Minds - Garance Franke-Ruta |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
A [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]] in [[Rugby football|rugby]] is a procedure to restart the game.  From the outside, it may seem to involve players from both teams clustering tightly around the ball competing for possession.  Analogously, in a media scrum reporters cluster around a public figure competing for his or her attention.

==Canada==

In Canada, the scrum is a daily ritual in the hallway outside the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. Members of the [[Parliamentary Press Gallery]] surround politicians as they exit the chamber.  The disorganization and pressure of the scrum makes it notorious for drawing remarks that are unplanned or controversial.&lt;ref name="Ira"/&gt; Liberal MP [[Carolyn Parrish]] remarked, "damn Americans, I hate those bastards" during a scrum in the run-up to the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20030228/parrish_remark030226?hub=Torontohome |title=CTV Toronto - Parrish faces heat from the House and the South |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20030304/parrish_bullard_20030303?hub=Torontohome |title=CTV Toronto - Parrish mainly unrepentant for anti-U.S. remark |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these concerns, politicians have sometimes tried to avoid the scrum in favour of more formal venues.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;[http://www.rrj.ca/issue/2007/summer/695/ Ryerson Review of Journalism: The 140-Year War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615210405/http://www.rrj.ca/issue/2007/summer/695/ |date=June 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Alliance]] leader [[Stockwell Day]] declined to scrum, instead holding a daily press conference.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;[http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/canadian_politics/49148 Rhonda Parkinson: What a Difference a Day Makes]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; [[Brian Mulroney]] restricted scrums during his time as [[Prime Minister of Canada]] by positioning himself on the stairway up to his office. This allowed him to tower over the media on the steps below him.&lt;ref name=ScrumWars&gt;''Scrum Wars: The Prime Ministers and the Media''
 by Allan Levine. Dundurn Press. {{ISBN|1-55002-207-5}}. Some text [https://books.google.com/books?id=_3R8q8uOgkMC&amp;pg=PP1 available online].&lt;/ref&gt; The media so resented this practice that when [[Jean Chrétien]] held a "staircase scrum" soon after assuming office, their reaction was so negative that he promised never to do it again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embassymag.ca/pdf/2006/051706_em.pdf Embassy Magazine, May 17, 2006]: Brown-Bagging it for the Harper Family, Sean Durkin&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, although [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s relationship with the press was rocky, he was famously quick-witted and enjoyed deflecting — or returning — barbs from reporters.&lt;ref name="ScrumWars"/&gt; Many of his famous quotations, including "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation" and "[[just watch me]]", were made during scrums.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12306">A '''mint mark''' is a letter, symbol or an inscription on a [[coin]] indicating the [[mint (coin)|mint]] where the coin was produced.

==History==
Mint marks were first developed to locate a problem. If a coin was underweight, or overweight, the mint mark would immediately tell where the coin was minted, and the problem could be located and fixed. Another problem which could occur would be a dishonest mint official [[debasement|debasing]] the coin, or putting less [[precious metal]] in the coin than specified. The first mint marks, called "Magistrate Marks" were developed by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and named the [[Magistrate]] in charge of producing that coin. Debasing a coin, or otherwise tampering with it, was a very serious crime, often punishable by death in many civilizations. For example, in 1649, the directors of the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial American Mint at [[Potosí|Potosi]], in what is today [[Bolivia]], were condemned to death for seriously debasing the coinage. The initials of the [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] as well as the mint mark were immediate identifiers when the coins were inspected.

In some cases the symbols found in the field of ancient Greek coins indicated mints, not magistrates.  Mints in territories conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] struck coins with the types he used in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] but marked with a local symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Greek Coins and Their Values, H. A. Seaby, Kings of Macedon coin 539&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Rhodes struck coins with Alexander’s types marked with a rose, a local symbol previously used on its own coins.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Numorum, Barcay Head, introduction page lix&lt;/ref&gt;

A reform of [[Diocletian]] made mint marks a regular feature of ancient Roman coinage.  These mint marks were placed at the bottom of the reverse of the coin and contained three parts.   The first part indicates that this was a coin with either SM for Sacra Moneta, M for Moneta, or P for Pecurnia.  The second part was an abbreviation of the name of the mint such as ROM for Rome or LON for London.  The final part indicated the workshop within the mint.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Coins and Their Values, David Sear page 47&lt;/ref&gt;  The reform of [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]], which is the traditional dividing point between the  coinage of the Roman and the Later Roman (a.k.a. Byzantine) empires, replaced the mint marks on gold coins by the inscription CONOB, meaning the pure standard of Constantinople, which was used by a variety of mints.  Mint marks continued on copper coinage until the second half of the seventh century, however.&lt;ref&gt;Byzantine Coins, P. D. Whiting, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PrivyMark.jpg|thumb|Mint mark and privy marks on [[Cochinchina Piastre|French Cochinchina 20 Cents 1879]], [[Paris Mint]] ]]
Mint names began to appear on French coins under Pepin and became mandatory under [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1389, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] adopted a system called Secret Points.  This scheme placed a dot under the first letter of the legend on coins of Crémieu, under the second letter for Romans, up to the twenty-second letter for Bourges.&lt;ref&gt;The Silver Coins of Medieval France, James Roberts, page 202&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fifteenth century letters or symbols placed at the end of the legend indicating the mint were used in addition to Secret Points.&lt;ref&gt;The Silver Coins of Medieval France, James Roberts, page 203&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1540, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] discontinued Secret Points in favor of a system of letters; A for Paris, B for Rouen, …, Z for Lyon; in the field.&lt;ref&gt;The Silver Coins of Medieval France, James Roberts, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; He also made it the rule for mint-masters to place their personal marks on coins, as they had done with increasing frequency since the coinage of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]].  This was one of the few royal practices continued by the Republic of France.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;   The mint letters continued until 1898 (briefly revived in 1914 and from 1942-58) and the mint-masters marks, supplemented by the mark of the Chief Engraver, are still used.&lt;ref&gt; Standard Catalog of World Coins by Krause Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Medieval English coins used mint names .&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[William III of England|William III]] retired hammered coinage, branch mints which helped strike machine made coins to replace it put their initials below his bust.&lt;ref&gt;Coins in History, John Porteous, page 214&lt;/ref&gt;   The Royal Mint established branches to coin [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] near the sources of gold.  These issues show the initials of Sydney, Melbourne, Victoria, and Perth Australia as well as Canada, South Africa, and India.&lt;ref&gt;Historic Gold Coins of the World, Burton Hobson, pages 129 and 132&lt;/ref&gt;  The privately owned [[Soho Mint]] obtained a contract to strike royal copper coins with steam presses and put its name on these coins and on coins it minted for other countries.  When it closed, Ralph Heaton acquired its equipment, founded the [[Birmingham Mint]], and put his H mint mark on coins of Canada, among others.

[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Spanish Milled Dollar with Mexico City Mint Mark.]]
The Spanish Empire introduced mint marks to the New World when they authorized Mexico City to open a mint on 11 May 1535.  The Spanish Empire established mints throughout its American territories, each with their own mint mark.  After its revolution, Mexico continued to use its colonial Mo monogram mint mark shown on either side of the date in the [[Spanish dollar|Spanish Milled Dollar]].  The United States of America established mints in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dahlonega, Georgia in 1838 after the  [[Georgia Gold Rush]] and put its first mint marks on the gold coins struck there.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide Book of United States Coins, R. S. Yeoman&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other countries, the United States has since placed mint marks not only on its own coins but also those of its territories, such as the Philippines, and other countries for which it has contracts to strike coins, such as Fiji.

==Mint marks in numismatics==
In the 19th century, [[numismatists]] (coin collectors) did not generally collect coins according to mint mark; rather, they attempted to obtain date sets of coins. A turnaround began after 1893, when [[A. G. Heaton]]'s "A Treatise on Coinage of the United States Branch Mints" was published. Heaton cited example after example of mint-marked coins that were much scarcer than [[Philadelphia]] products and that should bring high premiums. When the [[United States]] abandoned [[silver]] coinage in 1964, mint marks were removed from the new [[copper-nickel]] coins in the belief that it would reduce the removal of coins from circulation by collectors. The silver coins quickly disappeared from circulation, and it was feared that if collectors saved too many of the new coins, there would be a serious shortage of coinage. Mint marks were returned to United States coins in 1968.

==United States Mint Marks==
The current mint marks on [[United States coinage]]  are P, D,S,and W for the 4 currently operating US Mints.  The letter P is used for the [[Philadelphia Mint]], D for the [[Denver Mint]], S for the [[San Francisco Mint]], and W for the [[West Point Mint]].  Over time there have been 9 official United States Mints.  The first US Mint was in Philadelphia which began coin production with large cents and the half cents of pure copper in early 1793. Other US Mints, prior to the twentieth century, were considered "branch mints".  United States mint marks were  originally used to distinguish coins not made in Philadelphia.  The 8 mint marks used to distinguish coins not minted in Philadelphia (in the chronological order of their first coinage) are: D for the [[Dahlonega Mint]] (production of coins started on February 12, 1838), C for the [[Charlotte Mint]] (March 27, 1838), O for the [[New Orleans Mint]] (May 8, 1838), S for the [[San Francisco Mint]] (April 3,1854), CC for the [[Carson City Mint]] (February 11, 1870), D again (Dahlonega had closed in 1861 never to reopen) now for the [[Denver Mint]] (March 12 1906),  M for Manilla (where an official US Mint began with the coinage of a one centavo coin on July 15, 1920) and lastly a W for the [[West Point Mint]].  The West Point Mint began coin production on July 29,1974 to ease the shortage of quarters and other minor coinage and bore no mint mark.  Thus West Point coins could not be distinguished from those made at the Philadelphia Mint. The West Point mint mark, "W", was first used on the $10 gold coins commemorating the 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles.  Most Philadelphia Mint coins from earlier than 1980 were unmarked with the notable exception being wartime nickels (1942-1945).  The P mint mark was first used on the Susan B. Anthony Dollars starting 1979.  From 1980 until 2017, the [[Lincoln cent]] was the only coin that did not always have a mint mark, using a "D" when struck in Denver but lacking a "P" when ostensibly struck at the Philadelphia mint.  This practice allowed the additional minting of coins at the San Francisco mint ("S") and West Point mint ("W") without the use of their respective mint marks to address circulating coinage needs without the concern of creating scarce varieties that would be plucked from circulation by collectors.  In the single year of 2017 the Philadelphia "P" was added to the Lincoln cent to celebrate 225 years of Philadelphia Mint service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's really true: Cents struck at Philadelphia Mint in 2017 bear P Mint mark|url=http://www.coinworld.com/news/us-coins/2017/01/p-mint-mark-added-to-lincoln-cent-for-first-time.all.html|publisher=Coin World|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Generally 21st century coins with an "S" or "W" coins do not circulate, being mostly produced as [[bullion]], [[commemorative coin|commemorative]], [[proof coinage]] or other "collector coinage" sold by the US Mint to either authorized bullion wholesalers or directly to collectors.

Although the US and several other countries use the initial letter of the city for its mint marks, this practice is not universal.  For instance, Germany used A for Berlin, D for Munich, E for Muldenhutten, F for Stuttgart, G for Karlsruhe and J for Hamburg.  When Spain adopted decimal coinage in 1848, it used stars with different numbers of points as mint marks. Madrid used six pointed stars, Barcelona used eight pointed stars, and so on.  After the revolution of 1868, small dates were placed in these stars.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Catalog of World Coins, C. Krause and C Michler, Spain&lt;/ref&gt;  The small dates indicated the year the coin was struck, as opposed to the large date on the coin which was the year it was authorized.&lt;ref&gt;The Coin Atlas, Crib, Cook, and Carradice, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mints of the world commonly use a [[Privy mark]], which is a symbol unique to each mint. The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] commonly uses a [[maple leaf]] privy mark.   Segovia, Spain used an aqueduct, a local landmark, before it switched over to the star system in 1868.  The private mint of the French Coinage Society Poissy Branch used a thunderbolt mint mark on coins of France, its colonies, Romania and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Catalog of World Coins, C. Krause and C Michler, Spain, France, French Indo-China and Romania&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Muntteken muntmeesterteken.png|thumb|[[Privy mark]] (left) and mint mark on a Dutch coin. The mint mark is that of the mint of Utrecht. Since 1830 (with an interruption in 1941-1945) this mark is pressed on all Dutch coins.]]

Many [[Islamic]] coins bear an inscription telling which mint produced the coin. This inscription is often the name of the city where the coin was minted spelled out in [[Arabic]] script.

Several [[euro coins]] have mint marks of their respective Mint. See [[Identifying marks on euro coins]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14615">'''Natural-language user interface''' ('''LUI''' or '''NLUI''') is a type of [[User interface|computer human interface]] where linguistic phenomena such as verbs, phrases and clauses act as UI controls for creating, selecting and modifying data in software applications.

In [[interface design]], natural-language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use, but most suffer the challenges to [[natural language understanding|understanding]] wide varieties of [[semantic ambiguity|ambiguous input]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, I. (1983). "Natural language versus computer language." In M. Sime and M. Coombs (Eds.) Designing for Human-Computer Communication. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Natural-language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of [[natural-language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]]. An intuitive general natural-language interface is one of the active goals of the [[Semantic Web]].

Text interfaces are "natural" to varying degrees. Many formal (un-natural) programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language. Likewise, a traditional [[keyword search]] engine could be described as a "shallow" natural-language user interface.

==Overview==
A natural-language search engine would in theory find targeted [[question answering|answers to user questions]] (as opposed to keyword search). For example, when confronted with a question of the form 'which [[United States|U.S.]] state has the highest [[income tax]]?', conventional search engines ignore the question and instead search on the [[index term|keywords]] 'state', 'income' and 'tax'. Natural-language search, on the other hand, attempts to use natural-language processing to understand the nature of the question and then to search and return a subset of the web that contains the answer to the question. If it works, results would have a higher relevance than results from a keyword search engine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Challenges==
Natural-language interfaces have in the past led users to anthropomorphize the computer, or at least to attribute more intelligence to machines than is warranted. On the part of the user, this has led to unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system. Such expectations will make it difficult to learn the restrictions of the system if users attribute too much capability to it, and will ultimately lead to disappointment when the system fails to perform as expected as was the case in the [[AI winter]] of the 1970s and 80s.

A [https://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9503016 1995 paper] titled 'Natural Language Interfaces to Databases – An Introduction', describes some challenges:&lt;ref name="edin"/&gt;
;Modifier attachment
:The request "List all employees in the company with a driving licence" is ambiguous unless you know that companies can't have driving licences.
;Conjunction and disjunction
:"List all applicants who live in California and Arizona" is ambiguous unless you know that a person can't live in two places at once.
;[[Anaphora resolution]]
:resolve what a user means by 'he', 'she' or 'it', in a self-referential query.

Other goals to consider more generally are the speed and efficiency of the interface, in all algorithms these two points are the main point that will determine if some methods are better than others and therefore have greater success in the market. In addition, localisation across multiple language sites requires extra consideration - this is based on differing sentence structure and language syntax variations between most languages.

Finally, regarding the methods used, the main problem to be solved is creating a general algorithm that can recognize the entire spectrum of different voices, while disregarding nationality, gender or age. The significant differences between the extracted features - even from speakers who says the same word or phrase - must be successfully overcome.

==Uses and applications==

The natural-language interface gives rise to technology used for many different applications.

Some of the main uses are:

* ''Dictation'', is the most common use for [[automated speech recognition]] (ASR) systems today. This includes medical transcriptions, legal and business dictation, and general word processing. In some cases special vocabularies are used to increase the accuracy of the system.
* ''Command and control'', ASR systems that are designed to perform functions and actions on the system are defined as command and control systems. Utterances like "Open Netscape" and "Start a new xterm" will do just that.
* ''Telephony'', some PBX/[[Voice Mail]] systems allow callers to speak commands instead of pressing buttons to send specific tones.
* ''Wearables'', because inputs are limited for wearable devices, speaking is a natural possibility.
* ''Medical, disabilities'', many people have difficulty typing due to physical limitations such as repetitive strain injuries (RSI), muscular dystrophy, and many others. For example, people with difficulty hearing could use a system connected to their telephone to convert a caller's speech to text.
* ''Embedded applications'', some new cellular phones include C&amp;C speech recognition that allow utterances such as "call home". This may be a major factor in the future of automatic speech recognition and [[Linux]].
* ''[[Software development]]'': An [[integrated development environment]] can embed natural-language interfaces to help developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimmig|first=Markus|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mezini|first3=Mira|title=Querying source code with natural language|url=https://oadoi.org/10.1109/ase.2011.6100076|journal=2011 26th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2011)|doi=10.1109/ase.2011.6100076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the concept of a '''possible world''' is used to express [[modal logic|modal claims]]. The concept of possible worlds is common in contemporary philosophical discourse but has been disputed.

== Possibility, necessity, and contingency ==
{{Further|Modal logic#The ontology of possibility}}
Those theorists who use the concept of possible worlds consider the ''actual'' world to be one of the many possible worlds. For each distinct way the world could have been, there is said to be a distinct possible world; the actual world is the one we in fact live in. Among such theorists there is disagreement about the nature of possible worlds; their precise [[Modal logic#The ontology of possibility|ontological status]] is disputed, and especially the difference, if any, in ontological status between the actual world and all the other possible worlds. One position on these matters is set forth in [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s modal realism (see below). There is a close relation between [[proposition]]s and possible worlds. We note that every proposition is either true or false at any given possible world; then the ''[[modal logic|modal status]]'' of a proposition is understood in terms of the ''worlds in which it is true'' and ''worlds in which it is false''. The following are among the assertions we may now usefully make:

* '''[[Truth|True propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969").
* '''[[Falsity|False propositions]]''' are those that are ''false in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Ronald Reagan]] became president in 1969"). (Reagan did not run for president until 1976, and thus couldn't possibly have been elected.)
* '''[[Logical possibility|Possible propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in at least one possible world'' (for example: "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969"). (Humphrey did run for president in 1968, and thus could have been elected.) This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
* '''[[Contradiction|Impossible propositions]]''' (or ''necessarily false propositions'') are those that are ''true in no possible world'' (for example: "Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time").
* '''[[Logical truth|Necessarily true propositions]]''' (often simply called '''necessary propositions''') are those that are ''true in all possible worlds'' (for example: "2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4"; "all bachelors are unmarried").&lt;ref&gt;See "A Priori and A Posteriori" (author: Jason S. Baehr), at ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]'': "A necessary proposition is one the truth value of which remains constant across all possible worlds. Thus a necessarily true proposition is one that is true in every possible world, and a necessarily false proposition is one that is false in every possible world. By contrast, the truth value of contingent propositions is not fixed across all possible worlds: for any contingent proposition, there is at least one possible world in which it is true and at least one possible world in which it is false." Accessed 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingent propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in some possible worlds and false in others'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently false'' and "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently true'').

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of [[God]] and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be "the [[best of all possible worlds]]". [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, "De Welt als Wille and Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens" p. 2222, see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;"Nor could we doubt that, if God had created many worlds, they would not be as true in all of them as in this one. Thus those who could examine sufficiently the consequences of these truths and of our rules, could be able to discover effects by their causes, and, to explain myself in the language of the schools, they could have a priori demonstrations of everything that could be produced in this new world." -The World, Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; a major influence on Leibniz, [[Al-Ghazali]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), [[Averroes]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''),&lt;ref name=Kukkonen&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (''Matalib al-'Aliya'')&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name=Kukkonen/&gt; The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Saul Kripke]].

== Formal semantics of modal logics ==
{{Main|Modal logic#Semantics}}

A semantics for modal logic was first introduced in the late-1950s work of [[Saul Kripke]] and his colleagues. A statement in modal logic that is ''possible'' is said to be true in at least one possible world; a statement that is ''necessary'' is said to be true in all possible worlds.

== From modal logic to philosophical tool ==
From this groundwork, the theory of possible worlds became a central part of many philosophical developments, from the 1960s onwards &amp;ndash; including, most famously, the analysis of [[counterfactual conditional]]s in terms of "nearby possible worlds" developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]]. On this analysis, when we discuss what ''would'' happen ''if'' some set of conditions ''were'' the case, the truth of our claims is determined by what is true at the nearest possible world (or the ''set'' of nearest possible worlds) where the conditions obtain. (A possible world W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be near to another possible world W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R to the degree that the same things happen in W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R; the more different something happens in two possible worlds in a certain respect, the "further" they are from one another in that respect.) Consider this conditional sentence: "If George W. Bush hadn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore would have." The sentence would be taken to express a claim that could be reformulated as follows: "In all nearest worlds to our actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore became president of the U.S. then instead." And on this interpretation of the sentence, if there is or are some nearest worlds to the actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president but Al Gore didn't either, then the claim expressed by this counterfactual would be false.

Today, possible worlds play a central role in many debates in philosophy, including especially debates over the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie Argument]], and [[physicalism]] and [[supervenience]] in the [[philosophy of mind]]. Many debates in the [[philosophy of religion]] have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds. Intense debate has also emerged over the [[ontology|ontological]] status of possible worlds, provoked especially by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s defense of [[modal realism]], the doctrine that talk about "possible worlds" is best explained in terms of innumerable, ''really existing'' worlds beyond the one we live in. The fundamental question here is: ''given'' that modal logic works, and that some possible-worlds semantics for modal logic is correct, ''what has to be true'' of the world, and just what ''are'' these possible worlds that we range over in our interpretation of modal statements? Lewis argued that what we range over are real, concrete ''worlds'' that exist just as unequivocally as our actual world exists, but that are distinguished from the actual world simply by standing in no spatial, temporal, or causal relations with the actual world. (On Lewis's account, the only "special" property that the ''actual'' world has is a relational one: that ''we'' are in it. This doctrine is called "the indexicality of actuality": "actual" is a merely [[indexicality|indexical]] term, like "now" and "here".) Others, such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] and [[William Lycan]], reject Lewis's picture as metaphysically extravagant, and suggest in its place an interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions of or propositions about the world, so that a "possible world" is conceived of as a complete ''description'' of ''a way the world could be'' &amp;ndash; rather than a ''world that is that way''. (Lewis describes their position, and similar positions such as those advocated by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]], as "''ersatz'' modal realism", arguing that such theories try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics for modal logic "on the cheap", but that they ultimately fail to provide an adequate explanation.) [[Saul Kripke]], in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', took explicit issue with Lewis's use of possible worlds semantics, and defended a ''stipulative'' account of possible worlds as purely ''formal'' (logical) entities rather than either really existent worlds or as some set of propositions or descriptions.

== Possible-world theory in literary studies ==
Possible worlds theory in literary studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that are created by fictional texts, [[fictional universe]]. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is a specific type of possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of actual worlds (actual events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time.{{vague|date=April 2015}} Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy in much the same way as the actual universe.

Literary critics, such as [[Marie-Laure Ryan]], [[Lubomír Doležel]], and [[Thomas Pavel]], have used possible-worlds theory to address notions of literary truth, the nature of fictionality, and the relationship between fictional worlds and reality. Taxonomies of fictional possibilities have also been proposed where the likelihood of a fictional world is assessed. Possible-world theory is also used within narratology to divide a specific text into its constituent worlds, possible and actual. In this approach, the modal structure of the fictional text is analysed in relation to its [[narrative]] and thematic concerns. [[Rein Raud]] has extended this approach onto "cultural" worlds, comparing possible worlds to the particular constructions of reality of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Identity, Difference and Cultural Worlds", in Lang, V. &amp; Kull, K. (eds) (2014) Estonian Approaches to Culture Theory. Approaches to Culture Theory 4, 164–179. University of Tartu Press, Tartu, https://www.academia.edu/9128313/Identity_Difference_and_Cultural_Worlds&lt;/ref&gt; However, the metaphor of the "cultural possible worlds" relates to the framework of [[cultural relativism]] and, depending on the ontological status ascribed to possible worlds, warrants different, often controversial claims ranging from ethnocentrism to cultural imperialism.

[[File:Precastbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of the walls, supports, and roof of a precast commercial shop. Utilities are preassembled into the precast components.&lt;br&gt;Williston, North Dakota, USA.]]

'''Precast concrete''' is a construction product produced by casting concrete in a reusable [[molding (process)|mold]] or "form" which is then cured in a controlled environment, transported to the construction site and lifted into place ("[[tilt up]]"). In contrast, [[concrete|standard concrete]] is poured into site-specific forms and cured on site. '''Precast stone''' is distinguished from precast concrete using a fine [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] in the mixture, so the final product approaches the appearance of naturally occurring rock or stone. More recently [[expanded polystyrene]] is being used as the cores to precast wall panels. This is lightweight and has better thermal insulation.

Precast is used within exterior and interior walls. By producing precast concrete in a controlled environment (typically referred to as a precast plant), the precast concrete is afforded the opportunity to properly cure and be closely monitored by plant employees. Using a precast concrete system offers many potential advantages over onsite casting. Precast concrete production can performed on ground level, which helps with safety throughout a project. There is greater control over material quality and workmanship in a precast plant compared to a construction site. The forms used in a precast plant can be reused hundreds to thousands of times before they have to be replaced, often making it cheaper than onsite casting when looking at the cost per unit of formwork.&lt;ref name="Allen, EA. 2009"&gt;Allen, EA. (2009). Fundamentals of building construction materials and methods. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc..&lt;/ref&gt;

Many state and federal transportation projects in the United States require precast concrete suppliers to be certified by either the Architectural Precast Association (APA), National Precast Concrete Association (NPCA) or Precast Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).

There are many different types of precast concrete forming systems for architectural applications, differing in size, function, and cost. Precast architectural panels are also used to [[cladding (construction)|clad]] all or part of a building [[facade]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or free-standing walls used for landscaping, [[soundproofing]], and security walls, and some can be [[prestressed concrete]] structural elements. Stormwater drainage, water and sewage pipes, and tunnels make use of precast concrete units.

The [[New South Wales Government Railways]] made extensive use of precast concrete construction for its stations and similar buildings. Between 1917 and 1932, they erected 145 such buildings.&lt;ref&gt;'''''Precast Concrete Station Buildings in New South Wales''''' Longworth, Jim [[Australian Railway History]], May, 2005 pp163-185&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond cladding panels and structural elements, entire buildings can be assembled from precast concrete. Precast assembly enables fast completion of commercial shops and offices with minimal labor. For example, the Jim Bridger Building in Williston, North Dakota, was precast in Minnesota with air, electrical, water, and fiber utilities preinstalled into the building panels. The panels were transported over 800 miles to the Bakken oilfields, and the commercial building was assembled by three workers in minimal time. The building houses over 40,000 square feet of shops and offices. Virtually the entire building was fabricated in Minnesota.

To complete the look of the four precast wall panel types — sandwich, plastered sandwich, inner layer and cladding panels — many surface finishes are available. Standard cement is white or grey, though different colors can be added with pigments or paints. The color and size of aggregate can also affect the appearance and texture of concrete surfaces. The shape and surface of the precast concrete molds have an effect on the look: The mold can be made of timber, steel, plastic, rubber or fiberglass, each material giving a unique finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concreteissues.com/en/stories/1-15/precast-concrete-facades-bring-buildings-to-life/ Concrete Issues: Precast concrete facades brings buildings to life]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
Ancient Roman builders made use of concrete and soon poured the material into moulds to build their complex network of [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s, [[culvert]]s, and tunnels. Modern uses for pre-cast technology include a variety of architectural and structural applications — including individual parts, or even entire building systems.

In the modern world, precast panelled buildings were pioneered in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], in 1905. The process was invented by city engineer [[John Alexander Brodie]], a creative genius who also invented the idea of the football goal net. The tram stables at Walton in [[Liverpool]] followed in 1906. The idea was not taken up extensively in Britain. However, it was adopted all over the world, particularly in Eastern Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.144 |title=Port Cities |publisher=Mersey-gateway.org |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013154609/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.144 |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Million Programme|Scandinavia]].

In the US, precast concrete has evolved as two sub-industries, each represented by a major association. The precast concrete products industry focuses on utility, underground and other non-prestressed products, and is represented primarily by the National Precast Concrete Association (NPCA). The precast concrete structures industry focuses on prestressed concrete elements and on other precast concrete elements used in above-ground structures such as buildings, parking structures, and bridges. This industry is represented primarily by of the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).

==Reinforcement==
Reinforcing concrete with steel improves strength and durability. On its own, concrete has good compressive strength, but lacks tension and shear strength and can be subject to cracking when bearing loads for long periods of time. Steel offers high tension and shear strength to make up for what concrete lacks. Steel behaves similarly to concrete in changing environments, which means it will shrink and expand with concrete, helping avoid cracking.

Rebar is the most common form of concrete reinforcement. It is typically made from steel, manufactured with ribbing to bond with concrete as it cures. Rebar is versatile enough to be bent or assembled to support the shape of any concrete structure. Carbon steel is the most common rebar material. However, stainless steel, galvanized steel, and epoxy coatings can prevent corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/technology/reinforced-concrete|title=reinforced concrete {{!}} building material|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural products===
Precast concrete products can withstand the most extreme weather conditions and will hold up for many decades of constant usage. Products include bunker silos, cattle feed bunks, [[cattle grid]], agricultural fencing, H-bunks, J-bunks, livestock slats, livestock watering trough, feed troughs, concrete panels, slurry channels, and more. [[Prestressed concrete]] panels are widely used in the UK for a variety of applications including agricultural buildings, grain stores, silage clamps, slurry stores, livestock walling and general retaining walls. Panels can be used horizontally and placed either inside the webbings of RSJs ([[I-beam]]) or in front of them. Alternatively panels can be cast into a concrete foundation and used as a cantilever retaining wall.

===Building and site amenities===
[[File:Precast parking structure.jpg|thumb|Precast parking structure showing an interior column, girders, and [[double-tee]] structural floors. The two gray circles are covers to close the lifting anchor holes.]]

Precast concrete building components and site amenities are used architecturally as fireplace mantels, cladding, trim products, accessories and curtain walls. Structural applications of precast concrete include foundations, beams, floors, walls and other structural components. It is essential that each structural component be designed and tested to withstand both the tensile and compressive loads that the member will be subjected to over its lifespan. Also in building homes, they used EPS now in building precast concrete as this is much better in terms of the materials and the insulation. 

[[Multi-storey car park]]s are commonly constructed using precast concrete. The constructions involve putting together precast parking parts which are multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, girders, wall panels, stairs, and slabs. These parts can be large; for example, double-tee structural floor modules need to be lifted into place with the help of [[precast concrete lifting anchor system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Precast Parking Systems|url=http://www.highconcrete.com/resources/technical/upload/Hi_ParkBro_18.pdf|publisher=High Concrete Group|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When designed with heavy weight in mind, precast products counteract the buoyant forces of water significantly better than most materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solutions.precast.org/precast-concrete-marine-products Precast Concrete Marine Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precast concrete structures==
===Prestressed concrete===
Prestressing is a technique of introducing stresses into a structural member during fabrication and/or construction to improve its strength and performance. This technique is often employed in concrete beams, columns, spandrels, single and double tees, wall panels, segmental bridge units, bulb-tee girders, I-beam girders, and others. Many projects find that prestressed concrete provides the lowest overall cost, considering production and lifetime maintenance.&lt;ref name="McCormac, JCM. 2006"/&gt;

===Precast concrete sandwich wall (or insulated double-wall) panels===
====Origin====
The precast concrete double-wall panel has been in use in Europe for decades. The original double-wall design consisted of two [[wythe]]s of reinforced concrete separated by an interior void, held together with embedded steel trusses. With recent concerns about energy use, it is recognized that using steel trusses creates a "thermal bridge" that degrades thermal performance. Also, since steel does not have the same thermal expansion coefficient as concrete, as the wall heats and cools any steel that is not embedded in the concrete can create thermal stresses that cause cracking and spalling.

====Development====
To achieve better thermal performance, insulation was added in the void, and in many applications today the steel trusses have been replaced by composite (fibreglass, plastic, etc.) connection systems. These systems, which are specially developed for this purpose, also eliminate the differential thermal expansion problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compositeglobal.com/products/thermomass |title=THERMOMASS - Wall Insulation and More &amp;#124;Composite Global Solutions – Insulation |publisher=Compositeglobal.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best thermal performance is achieved when the insulation is continuous throughout the wall section, i.e., the wythes are thermally separated completely to the ends of the panel. Using continuous insulation and modern composite connection systems, R-values up to R-28.2 can be achieved.

====Characteristics====
The overall thickness of sandwich wall panels in commercial applications is typically 8&amp;nbsp;inches, but their designs are often customized to the application. In a typical 8-inch wall panel the concrete wythes are each 2-3/8&amp;nbsp;inches thick), sandwiching 3-1/4&amp;nbsp;inches of high [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] insulating foam. The interior and exterior wythes of concrete are held together (through the insulation) with some form of connecting system that is able to provide the needed structural integrity. Sandwich wall panels can be fabricated to the length and width desired, within practical limits dictated by the fabrication system, the stresses of lifting and handling, and shipping constraints. Panels of 9-foot clear height are common, but heights up to 12 feet can be found.
[[File:Prefabricated house construction.gif|right|thumb|A [[single-family detached home]] being built up from precast concrete parts]]

The fabrication process for precast concrete sandwich wall panels allows them to be produced with finished surfaces on both sides. Such finishes can be very smooth, with the surfaces painted, stained, or left natural; for interior surfaces, the finish is comparable to drywall in smoothness and can be finished using the same prime and paint procedure as is common for conventional drywall construction. If desired, the concrete can be given an architectural finish, where the concrete itself is colored and/or textured. Colors and textures can provide the appearance of brick, stone, wood, or other patterns through the use of reusable [[formliners]], or, in the most sophisticated applications, actual brick, stone, glass, or other materials can be cast into the concrete surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalconcrete.com/downloads/APA_Precast-Finishes-Guide.pdf|title=APA Precast Finishes Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Window and door openings are cast into the walls at the manufacturing plant as part of the fabrication process. In many applications, electrical and telecommunications conduit and boxes are cast directly into the panels in the specified locations. In some applications, utilities, plumbing and even heating components have been cast into the panels to reduce on-site construction time. The carpenters, electricians and plumbers do need to make some slight adjustments when first becoming familiar with some of the unique aspects of the wall panels. However, they still perform most of their job duties in the manner to which they are accustomed.

====Applications and benefits====
Precast concrete sandwich wall panels have been used on virtually every type of building, including schools, office buildings, apartment buildings, townhouses, condominiums, hotels, motels, dormitories, and single-family homes. Although typically considered part of a building's enclosure or "envelope," they can be designed to also serve as part of the building's structural system, eliminating the need for beams and columns on the building perimeter. Besides their energy efficiency and aesthetic versatility, they also provide excellent noise attenuation, outstanding durability (resistant to rot, mold, etc.), and rapid construction.

In addition to the good insulation properties, sandwich panels require fewer work phases to complete. Compared to double-walls, for example, which have to be insulated and filled with concrete on site, sandwich panels require much less labor and scaffolding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concreteissues.com/en/stories/1-08/let-s-grab-a-sandwich-/ Concrete Issues: Let´s grab a sandwich]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Precast Concrete Market====
The precast concrete industry is largely dominated by Government initiated projects for infrastructural development. However, these are also being extensively used for residential (low and high rise) and commercial constructions because of their various favourable attributes. The efficiency, durability, ease, cost effectiveness, and sustainable properties&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfbrickmachine.com/sandwich-wall-panel-machine/ How Sandwich Wall Panels Realize These Features]&lt;/ref&gt; of these products have brought a revolutionary shift in the time consumed in construction of any structure.Construction industry is a huge energy consuming industry, and precast concrete products are and will continue to be more energy efficient than its counterparts. The wide range of designs, colours, and structural options that these products provide is also making it a favourable choice for its consumers.

'''Pulaar''' is a [[Fula language]] spoken primarily as a first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pulaar|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; language by the [[Fula people|Fula]] and [[Toucouleur people]]s in the [[Senegal River]] valley area traditionally known as [[Futa Tooro]] and further south and east. Pulaar speakers, known as ''[[wikt:Haalpulaar'en|Haalpulaar'en]]'' live in [[Senegal]], [[Mauritania]], [[the Gambia]], and western [[Mali]].

According to ''Ethnologue'' there are several dialect differences, but all are mutually intelligible.

Pulaar is not to be confused with [[Pular language|Pular]], another variety of Fula spoken in [[Guinea]] (including the [[Fouta Djallon]] region). The Pulaar and Pular varieties of Fula are to some extent mutually intelligible, but require a separate literature.

Pulaar is written in a [[Latin script]], but historically was written in an [[Arabic script]] known as "[[Ajami script]]" (see [[Fula alphabets]]).

==Linguistic features==
{{main|Fula language}}

The negative accomplished verb form ends in ''-aani''. (This is slightly different from [[Maasina Fulfulde]] and [[Pular language|Pular]].)

He is known for his ''Odisara Itihasa'' (History of Odisha) which was published in 1879. Pyarimohan wrote his history in response to an advertisement by the colonial government of the time looking for a textbook for use in schools. While the book was accepted by the government, its publication caused a controversy and was consequently not inducted into the school syllabus.

A '''salute''' is a [[gesture]] or other action used to display respect. Salutes are primarily associated with [[armed forces]], but other organizations and civilians also use salutes.

==Military salutes==
[[File:USNsalute.jpg|thumb|[[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Jay L. Johnson]] and Admiral [[Vern Clark]] of the [[United States Navy]] salute each other during a [[change of command]] ceremony. Clark is replacing Johnson as [[Chief of Naval Operations]].]]

In military traditions of various times and places, there have been numerous methods of performing salutes, using [[hand]] gestures, [[cannon]] or [[rifle]] shots, hoisting of [[flag]]s, removal of [[headgear]], or other means of showing respect or deference. In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], only commissioned [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] are saluted, and the salute is to the commission they carry from their respective commanders-in-chief representing the Monarch, not the officers themselves.

The British Army's salute is almost identical to the French salute, with the palm facing outward. The customary salute in the [[Polish Armed Forces]] is the [[two-fingers salute]], a variation of the British military salute with only two fingers extended. In the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian military]], the right hand, palm down, is brought to the right temple, almost, but not quite, touching; the head has to be covered. In the [[Hellenic Army]] salute the palm is facing down and the fingers point to the coat of arms.

In the [[United States Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps]], [[United States Coast Guard]], [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]], [[Colombian Army]] and [[Ecuadorian Army]], as well as in all branches of the [[French Armed Forces]], [[British Armed Forces]] (with the exception of the [[Blues and Royals#Regimental_traditions|Blues and Royals]]), [[Canadian Forces]], [[Danish Defence|Danish Armed Forces]], [[Hellenic Armed Forces]], [[Italian Armed Forces]], [[Norwegian Armed Forces]], [[Polish Armed Forces]], Irish Defence Forces, [[Australian Defence Force]], [[South African National Defence Force]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhs.mil.za/news/news2007/mar/salutation.htm|title=Compliments and Saluting|last=|first=|date=|website=South African Military Health Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Swedish Defence Forces, [[Turkish Armed Forces]] and [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian]] and all former Soviet republic forces, hand salutes are only given when a [[Cover (military)|cover]] (protection for the head, usually a [[hat]]) is worn.

When the presence of enemy [[sniper]]s is suspected, military salutes are generally forbidden, since the enemy may use them to recognize officers as valuable targets.

===Saluting with left hand===
Some soldiers may salute with the left hand when the right hand is encumbered in some way (though it is rare), for example, a soldier with a rifle at Right Shoulder Arms; if movement of a weapon would be encumbered when making the armed salute; if the performance of duty requires the right hand for use or operation of equipment such as riding a motorcycle; if it is not possible to use the hand due to injury or amputation; when escorting a woman and it is not possible to walk on her right side.  A right-handed boatswain Mate piping an Officer aboard may salute with his/her left hand.

=== Origin ===
[[File:Rustic civility.jpg|thumb|''Rustic Civility'' by [[William Collins (painter)|William Collins]] showing a child "tugging his forelock" as a person of higher standing passes on horseback (only visible by the shadow)]]

According to some modern military manuals, the modern Western salute originated in France when [[knight]]s greeted each other to show friendly intentions by raising their [[Visor (armor)|visors]] to show their faces, using a salute. Others also note that the raising of one's visor was a way to identify oneself saying "This is who I am, and I am not afraid." Medieval visors were, to this end, equipped with a protruding spike that allowed the visor to be raised using a saluting motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123rf.com/photo_11279838_heavy-medieval-iron-helmet-from-a-german-knight.html |title=See external picture |publisher=123rf.com |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dougherty|first1=Martin|title=Weapons and Fighting Techniques of the Medieval Warrior 1000–1500 AD|date=2008|publisher=Chartwell Books|isbn=9780785834250|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Army Quartermaster School provides another explanation of the origin of the hand salute: that it was a long-established [[military courtesy]] for subordinates to remove their headgear in the presence of superiors. As late as the American Revolution, a British Army soldier saluted by removing his hat. With the advent of increasingly cumbersome headgear in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, the act of removing one's hat was gradually converted into the simpler gesture of grasping or touching the visor and issuing a courteous salutation.

As early as 1745, a British order book stated that: "The men are ordered not to pull off their hats when they pass an officer, or to speak to them, but only to clap up their hands to their hats and bow as they pass."  Over time, it became conventionalized into something resembling our modern hand salute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qmmuseum.lee.army.mil/history/vignettes/respect1.html "Origin of the Hand Salute"], US Army Quartermaster Center &amp; School, retrieved 27 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the Austrian Army the practice of making a hand salute replaced that of removing the headdress in 1790, although officers wearing [[bicorne|cocked hats]] continued to remove them when greeting superiors until 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Lucas|page=207|title=Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914|ISBN=0-946771-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naval salute, with the palm downwards is said to have evolved because the palms of naval ratings, particularly [[sailor|deckhands]], were often dirty through working with lines and was deemed insulting to present a dirty palm to an officer; thus the palm was turned downwards. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], British crews saluted officers by touching a clenched fist to the brow as though grasping a hat-brim between fingers and thumb.

=== Small arms salutes ===
{{Main|Present arms (command)}}
[[File:Salute-IMG 8784b.jpg|thumb|A captain of the [[French Navy]] salutes by holding the back of his saber to his face during the ceremonies of the 14th of July in Toulon.]]

When carrying a sword (which is still done on ceremonial occasions), European military forces and their cultural descendants use a two-step gesture.  The sword is first raised, in the right hand, to the level of and close to the front of the neck. The blade is inclined forward and up 30 degrees from the vertical; the true edge is to the left. Then the sword is slashed downward to a position with the point close to the ground in front of the right foot.  The blade is inclined down and forward with the true edge to the left.  This gesture originated in the [[Crusades]].  The [[hilt]] of a [[sword]] formed a cross with the blade, so if a [[crucifix]] was not available, a Crusader could kiss the hilt of his sword when praying, before entering battle, for oaths and vows, and so on.  The lowering of the point to the ground is a traditional act of submission.

In [[fencing]], the fencers salute each other before putting their masks on to begin a bout. There are several methods of doing this, but the most common is to bring the sword in front of the face so that the blade is pointing up in front of the nose. The fencers also salute the referee and the audience.

When armed with a rifle, two methods are available when saluting. The usual method is called "[[Present arms (command)|present arms]]"; the rifle is brought to the vertical, muzzle up, in front of center of the chest with the trigger away from the body.  The hands hold the stock close to the positions they would have if the rifle were being fired, though the trigger is not touched.  Less formal salutes include the "order arms salute" and the "shoulder arms salutes."  These are most often given by a sentry to a low-ranking superior who does not rate the full "present arms" salute.  In the "order arms salute," the rifle rests on its butt by the sentry's right foot, held near the muzzle by the sentry's right hand, and does not move.  The sentry brings his flattened left hand across his body and touches the rifle near its muzzle.  When the rifle is being carried on the shoulder, a similar gesture is used in which the flattened free hand is brought across the body to touch the rifle near the rear of the receiver.

A different type of salute with a rifle is a ritual firing performed during military funerals, known as a [[three-volley salute]]. In this ceremonial act, an [[Parity (mathematics)|odd number]] of rifleman fire three blank cartridges in unison into the air over the casket. This originates from an old European tradition wherein a battle was halted to remove the dead and wounded, then three shots were fired to signal readiness to reengage.

=== Heavy arms: gun salutes ===
[[File:Soldiers firing a 40mm saluting cannon.JPEG|thumb|A cannon on a naval vessel's deck fired during the arrival of a dignitary.]]
[[File:Valletta Saluting battery Malta 2014 7.jpg|thumb|The [[Saluting Battery (Valletta)|Saluting Battery]] in [[Valletta]] firing a gun salute.]]

====Naval cannon fire====
{{See also|21-gun salute}}
The custom of '''firing cannon salutes''' originated in the [[Royal Navy]]. When a cannon was fired, it partially disarmed the ship, so needlessly firing a cannon showed respect and trust.  As a matter of courtesy a warship would fire her guns harmlessly out to sea, to show that she had no hostile intent. At first, ships were required to fire seven guns, and forts, with their more numerous guns and a larger supply of gunpowder, to fire 21 times.  Later, as the quality of gunpowder improved, the British increased the number of shots required from ships to match the forts.

The system of odd numbered rounds originated from [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to the Navy in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], as a way of economising on the use of powder, the rule until that time having been that all guns had to be fired. Odd numbers were chosen, as even numbers indicated a death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salutingbattery.com/events.html|title=Maritime Gun Salutes|accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As naval customs evolved, the [[21-gun salute]] came to be reserved for [[Head of state|heads of state]], with fewer rounds used to salute lower-ranking officials. Today, In the US Armed Forces, [[Head of Government|heads of government]] and cabinet ministers (e.g., the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[United States Cabinet|U.S. cabinet members]], and service secretaries&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], and [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and military officers with [[five-star rank]] receive 19 rounds; [[four-star rank|four-stars]] receive 17 rounds; [[three-star rank|three-stars]] receive 15; [[two-star rank|two-stars]] receive 13; and a [[one-star rank|one-star]] general or admiral receives 11. These same standards are currently adhered to by ground-based saluting batteries.

Multiples of 21-gun salutes may be fired for particularly important celebrations. In monarchies this is often done at births of members of the royal family of the country and other official celebrations associated with the royal family.

====United States Army Presidential Salute Battery====
A specialty platoon of the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]], the Presidential Salute Battery is based at [[Fort Myer]], Virginia. The Guns Platoon (as it is known for short) has the task of rendering military honors in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area|National Capital Region]], including [[Military funeral|armed forces full-honors funerals]]; [[State funerals in the United States|state funerals]]; [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inaugurations]]; full-honors [[wreath]] ceremonies at the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]; [[State Arrival Ceremony|state arrivals]] at the White House and [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], and retirement ceremonies for [[General officer|general-grade officers]] in the [[Military District of Washington]], which are normally conducted at Fort Myer.

The Presidential Salute Battery also participates in [[A Capitol Fourth]], the Washington [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration; the guns accompany the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] in performing the "[[1812 Overture]]".

The platoon maintains its battery of ten ceremonially-modified World War II-vintage [[3 inch Gun M5|M-5]] [[anti-tank guns]] at the Old Guard regimental motor pool.

====Aerial salutes====
A ceremonial or celebratory form of aerial salute is the [[flypast]] (known as a "flyover" in the United States), which often follows major parades such as the annual [[Trooping the Colour]] in the United Kingdom or the French [[Bastille Day Military Parade|''défilé du 14 juillet'']].  It is seen in other countries as well, notably Singapore and Canada. In Singapore, the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] usually conducts aerial salutes during the annual [[Singapore National Day Parade|National Day Parade]] and major state events, such as during the [[death of Lee Kuan Yew|funeral of Lee Kuan Yew]].

Gun salute by aircraft, primarily displayed during funerals, began with simple flypasts during [[World War I]] and have evolved into the [[missing man formation]], where either a formation of aircraft is conspicuously missing an element, or where a single plane abruptly leaves a formation

A casual salute by an aircraft, somewhat akin to waving to a friend, is the custom of "waggling" the wings by partially rolling the aircraft first to one side, and then the other.

===Military salutes in different countries===
==== Australia and New Zealand ====
In both countries, the right-hand salute is generally identical to, and drawn from the traditions of, the British armed forces. The salute of the Australian or New Zealand Army is best described as the right arm taking the path of the longest way up and then the shortest way down. Similar in many ways, the salute of the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force takes the longest way up and the shortest way down. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy, however, take the shortest way up, palm down, and the shortest way down. The action of the arm rotating up is slower than the action of the conclusion of the salute which is the arm being quickly "snapped" down to the saluter's side. Junior members are required to salute first and the senior member is obliged to return the compliment.  Protocol dictates that the Monarch, members of the Royal Family, the Governor-General and State Governors are to be saluted at all times by all ranks.  Except where a Drill Manual (or parade) protocol dictates otherwise, the duration of the salute is timed at three beats of the quick-time march (approximately 1.5 seconds), timed from the moment the senior member first returns it.  In situations where cover (or "headdress", as it is called in the Australian Army) is not being worn, the salute is given verbally; the junior party (or at least the senior member thereof) will first come to attention, then offer the salute "Good morning/afternoon Your Majesty/Your Royal Highness/Prime Minister/Your Grace/Sir/Ma'am", etc., as the case may be.  It is this, rather than the act of standing to attention, which indicates that a salute is being offered.  If either party consists of two or more members, all will come to attention, but only the most senior member of the party will offer (or return) the physical or verbal salute.  The party which is wearing headdress must always offer, or respond with, a full salute.  At the Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) no salutes of any kind are given, under any circumstances; it is always sensible to assume that there are snipers in the area.  In this case, parties personally known to each other are addressed familiarly by their first or given names, regardless of rank;  senior officers are addressed as one might address a stranger, courteously, but without any naming or mark of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origins of Saluting|url=http://www.army.gov.au/Saluting.asp|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=9 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091012163005/http://www.army.gov.au/Saluting.asp|archivedate=12 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tri-Service Personnel Saluting MOD 45151321.jpg|thumb|Personnel from the [[Royal Air Force]], the British Army and the [[Royal Navy]] saluting.]]

===== British Army =====
Since 1917, the British Army's salute has been given with the right hand palm facing forwards with the fingers almost touching the cap or beret. Before 1917, for Other Ranks (i.e. not officers) the salute was given with whichever hand was furthest from the person being saluted, whether that was the right or the left.  Officers always saluted with the right hand (as the left, in theory, would always be required to hold the scabbard of their sword)&lt;ref&gt;''General Jack's Diary'' ed by John Terraine&lt;/ref&gt;  The salute is given to acknowledge the Queen's commission. A salute may not be given unless a soldier is wearing his regimental headdress, for example a [[beret]], [[caubeen]], [[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanter]], [[Glengarry]], field service cap or peaked cap. This does not apply to members of The Blues and Royals (RHG/1stD) The Household Cavalry who, after The [[Battle of Warburg]] were allowed to salute without headdress. If a soldier or officer is not wearing headdress then he or she must come to attention instead of giving/returning the salute. The subordinate salutes first and maintains the salute until the superior has responded in kind.

There is a widespread though erroneous belief that it is statutory for "all ranks to salute a bearer of the [[Victoria Cross]]". There is no official requirement that appears in the official Warrant of the VC, nor in Queen's Regulations and Orders, but tradition dictates that this occurs and as such the Chiefs of Staff will salute a Private awarded either a VC or [[George Cross]].

===== Royal Air Force =====
The custom of saluting commissioned officers relates wholly to the commission given by Her Majesty the Queen to that officer, not the person.&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal Air Force website: ''Frequently Asked Questions – Who do you salute'' |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/links/faqs.cfm |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502065436/http://www.raf.mod.uk/links/faqs.cfm |archivedate=2010-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when a subordinate airman salutes an officer, he is indirectly acknowledging Her Majesty as Head of State. A salute returned by the officer is on behalf of the Queen.

The RAF salute is similar to the British Army, the hand is brought upwards in a circular motion out from the body, it is stopped 1 inch (20&amp;nbsp;mm) to the rear of the right of the right eye, the elbow and wrist are kept inline with the shoulder. The hand is then brought straight down back to the position of attention, this movement is completed to the timing "UP TWO-THREE/DOWN"&lt;ref&gt;Air Officer Administration Headquarters Personnel and Training Command. Royal Air Force Publication AP818 (RAF DRILL
AND CEREMONIAL) 7th edition. Royal Air force, No date, P.73, [available at: https://learning.bader.mod.uk/Global/AP818%20Drill%20and%20Ceremonial/20061003%20-%20AP%20818%20-%20u.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Royal Navy =====
The Naval salute differs in that the palm of the hand faces down towards the shoulder. This dates back to the days of sailing ships, when tar and pitch were used to seal a ship's timbers from seawater. To protect their hands, officers wore white gloves and it was considered most undignified to present a dirty palm in the salute, so the hand was turned through 90 degrees. A common story is that Queen Victoria, having been saluted by an individual with a dirty palm, decreed that in future sailors of the fleet would salute palm down, with the palm facing the ground.

====== Royal Marines ======
The Royal Marines follow the British Army and salute with the right hand palm facing forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Royal Navy |url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/august/02/170802-duke-of-edinburgh-receives-royals-salute |title=Duke of Edinburgh receives Royal’s salute at last public engagement |publisher=Royal Navy |date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sgt.

=====In the colonial context=====
In the British Empire (originally in the maritime and hinterland sphere of influence of the [[East India Company]], HEIC, later transformed into crown territories), mainly in [[British India]], the numbers of guns fired as a ''gun salute'' to the ruler of a so-called [[princely state]] became a politically [[salute state|highly significant indicator of his status]], not governed by objective rules, but awarded (and in various cases increased) by the British paramount power, roughly reflecting his state's socio-economic, political and/or military weight, but also as a prestigious reward for loyalty to the Raj, in classes (always odd numbers) from three to twenty-one (seven lacking), for the "vassal" indigenous rulers (normally hereditary with a throne, sometimes raised as a personal distinction for an individual ruling prince). Two sovereign monarchies officially outside the Empire were granted a higher honor: thirty-one guns for the royal houses of Afghanistan (under British and Russian influence), and [[Siam]] (which was then ruled by the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]).

In addition, the right to style himself ''Highness'' ([[Majesty]], which since its Roman origin expresses the sovereign authority of the state, was denied to all "vassals"), a title of great importance in international relations, was formally restricted to rulers of relatively high salute ranks (originally only those with eleven guns or more, later also those with nine guns).

====Canadian military====

Much as the British salute, described above, the [[Canadian military]] salutes to demonstrate a mark of respect and courtesy for the commissioned ranks.  When in uniform and not wearing headdress one does not salute.  Instead, compliments shall be paid by standing at attention. If on the march, arms shall be swung and the head turned to the left or right as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CF Manual of Drill and Ceremonial|publisher=Directorate of History and Heritage|pages=1–2–3|chapter=1 section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Remembrance Day]], 2009, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] attended the national ceremony in [[Ottawa]] with [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]]—both wearing Canadian military dress. [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] live television coverage of the event noted that, when Prince Charles saluted, he performed the Canadian form of the salute with a cupped hand (the British "naval salute"—appropriate, as he did his military service as an officer in the Royal Navy), adopted by all elements of the Canadian Forces after unification in 1968, rather than the British (Army) form with the palm facing forward.

====Danish military====
[[File:Danish Army Salute.png|thumb|Danish Army Salute]]
In the [[Danish Defence|Danish military]], there are two types of military salutes. The first type is employed by the [[Royal Danish Navy]], [[Royal Danish Air Force]], and [[Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron]], and is the same as the one used by the U.S..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niess|first1=Amanda|editor1-last=Lind|editor1-first=Vickie|title=SBU (Søvernets basisuddannelse)|journal=Soldaten|date=April 2015|issue=3|page=22|url=https://issuu.com/soldaten/docs/191318_soldaten_03-15_web|accessdate=14 November 2017|publisher=Forsvarets Kommunikationssektion|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is employed by the [[Royal Danish Army]], and goes as follows: Raise the right arm forward, as to have upper arm 90 degrees from the body. Move the right hand to the temple, and have it parallel to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Salute Like a Soldier|url=http://wko.olipot.com/sadan-honnor-som-en-soldat|website=wko.olipot.com|accessdate=14 November 2017|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French military====
[[File:Pierre de Villiers (détail).jpg|thumb|A French military salute by the French general [[Pierre de Villiers]].]]

The [[French military]] salutes to demonstrate a mark of respect, fraternity and courtesy for all soldiers ; subordinates salute superiors and every salute is given back. Salutes are not performed if a member is not wearing a headdress or if he is holding a weapon. The French salute, as the original template, is performed with a flat hand, palm facing forwards; the upper arm is horizontal and the tips of the fingers come near the corner of the eyes. It perfectly mirrors the gesture made when [[knight]]s greeted each other to show friendly intentions by raising their [[visor]]s to show their faces. A crisp tension may be given when the salute is broken.

====German military====
In the German [[Bundeswehr]], the salute is performed with a flat hand, with the thumb resting on the index finger. The hand is slightly tilted to the front so that the thumb can not be seen. The upper arm is horizontal and the fingers point to the temple but do not touch it or the headgear. Every soldier saluting another uniformed soldier is entitled to be saluted in return. Soldiers below the rank of [[Feldwebel]] are not permitted to speak while saluting. Since the creation of the Bundeswehr, soldiers are required to salute with and without headgear. Originally, in the [[Reichswehr]] it was not permitted to perform the salute when the soldier is not wearing uniform headgear. In the [[Wehrmacht]], the traditional military salute was required when wearing headgear, but the [[Nazi salute]] was performed when not wearing headgear. [[East Germany|East German]] [[National People's Army]] followed the Reichswehr protocol.

==== Indian military ====
In India, the three forces have different salutes with the [[Indian Army]] and the [[Indian Navy]] following the British tradition. In the Indian army, the salute is performed by keeping the open palm forward, with fingers and thumb together and middle finger almost touching the hatband or right eyebrow. This is often accompanied by the regimental salutation, e.g.:"Sat Sri Akal" in the [[Sikh Regiment]]. The Navy salute has the palm facing towards the ground at a 90-degree angle. The [[Indian Air Force]] salute involves the right arm being sharply raised from the front by the shortest possible way, with the plane of the palm at 45-degree angle to the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/article607468.ece|title=Different forces, different salutes|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, the salute is [[Salute#Royal Navy|similar]] to the British [[Royal Navy]]. The salute is a gesture that every person must know and is commonly used for the flag raising ceremony. It is a very common gesture amongst every part of the country, starting from school to [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|military]], [[Indonesian National Police|police]], firefighters, and even [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia|scouts]] (using five fingers, [[Scout sign and salute|contrary to other countries]]). In the military, this gesture is known as [[Present arms (command)|Present Arms]] or in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Hormat Senjata, Gerak'' (with weapons) or ''Hormat, Gerak'' (without weapons).

====Israel Defense Forces====
[[File:IDF Ceremony for the Newly Appointed Commander in Chief of Israeli Navy - Flickr - Israel Defense Forces (1).jpg|thumb|Israeli style salute at IDF ceremony for the newly appointed Commander in Chief of Israeli Navy, Brig. General Ram Rotenberg]]
In the [[Israel Defense Forces]], saluting is normally reserved for special ceremonies. Unlike in the US Army, saluting is not a constant part of day to day barracks life.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Gutmann. The other war: Israelis, Palestinians, and the struggle for media supremacy. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan Armed Forces ====
In Pakistan, the salute is generally identical to that of British armed forces. Salute is given with the right hand palm facing forward and fingers slightly touching the right side of the forehead, but not on the forehead. The salute must be performed by the lower rank officials to the higher rank officials under all conditions except when the higher rank official is not in uniform or if the lower rank official is the driver and the vehicle is in motion.&lt;ref&gt;The Army Regulations: Instructions corrected upto 30 November 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The salute is sometimes also performed by left hand if the right hand of the person is completely occupied.

====People's Republic of China====
Military personnel of the [[People's Liberation Army]] salute according to Chinese standards{{Vague|date=November 2010}} and similar to the Royal Navy salute.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Polish military====
[[File:Ludwik Solski.jpg|thumb|Polish style salute, using two fingers]]
In Polish military forces, military men use two fingers to salute, and when they wear headdress (including helmet) because soldiers are supposed to salute to the Coat of Arms on the military headdress, out of respect to the national symbols (This is called the [[Two-finger salute]]). There are some exceptions in Polish regulations when salute is not demonstrated, for instance after proclaiming alert in military unit area. As above, salute is marking respect for higher rank or command. Untrained recruits are obliged to salute as without headdress, i.e. to stand at attention (or—during walking—to march at attention).

====Swedish military====
Salutes are similar to those of the [[Royal Navy]]. The official instruction for stationary salute states: "The right hand is quickly raised straight up to the headgear. The fingers straight but not stiff next to each other, the little finger edge facing forward. One or two finger tips lightly resting against the right part of the head gear (visor), so that the hand does not obstruct the eye. The wrist straight, the elbow angled forward and slightly lower than the shoulder." Salutes to persons are normally not made when further away than 30 m. Hand salutes are performed only when carrying head gear, if bare headed (normally only indoors) a swift turning of the head towards the person that is being saluted is made instead. The same applies if the right hand is carrying any item that cannot easily be transferred to the left hand. During inspections and when on guard duty, the salute is made by coming to attention. Drivers of moving vehicles never salute. In formations, only the commander salutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Svensk soldat'' soldier manual&lt;/ref&gt;

====Swiss Armed Forces====
Swiss soldiers are required to salute any higher-ranking military personnel whenever they encounter them. When the soldier announces to a higher-ranking person he has to state the superior's rank, his rank and his name. When a military formation encounters a superior, it has to state the name of the formation. The salute is given like that of the British navy with the palm pointing towards the shoulder, the tips of the fingers pointing towards the temple.

====Turkish Armed Forces====
[[File:Two Turkish soldiers salute (4699895014).jpg|thumb|Turkish soldiers salute while the band plays the national anthem.]]

Within the Turkish military hand salutes are only given when a cover (protection for the head, usually a hat) is worn.

If head is not covered or when the personnel is carrying a rifle on the shoulder the ''head salute'' is performed by nodding the head forward slightly while maintaining erect posture.

The salute (hand or head) must be performed first by the lower ranking personnel to the higher ranking personnel, and higher official is expected to return the salute, under all conditions except:
* Personnel who are driving vehicles.
* Personnel who are on sentry, patrol, observation duty or defending a specific point.
* Personnel on combat orders.
* Personnel who are transporting live ammuniton.
* Military prisoners and personnel escorting them.

Despite of the rank, casket of a martyr personnel while in transport or on stand has to be saluted by all ranks of personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mevzuat.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Metin.Aspx?MevzuatKod=7.5.5905&amp;sourceXmlSearch=&amp;MevzuatIliski=0 TSK İç Hizmet Yönetmeliği]{{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. Armed Forces====
Within United States' military, the salute is a courteous exchange of greetings, with the junior member always saluting first. When returning or rendering an individual salute, the head and eyes are turned toward the [[Colours, standards and guidons|Colors]] or person saluted. Military personnel in uniform are required to salute when they meet and recognize persons entitled to a salute, except when it is inappropriate or impractical (in public conveyances such as planes and buses, in public places such as inside theaters, or when driving a vehicle).&lt;ref name="thebalance.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-military-salute-3331994|title=Everything You Need to Know About the US Military Salute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the U.S. military's salute was influenced by British military, although differs slightly, in that the palm of the hand faces down towards the shoulder. This difference may date back to the days of sailing ships, when tar and pitch were used to seal the timber from seawater. During such times, it was considered undignified to present a dirty palm in the salute, so the hand was turned through 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="thebalance.com"/&gt;

Specifically, a proper salute goes as follows: Raise the right hand sharply, fingers and thumb extended and joined, palm facing down, and place the tip of the right forefinger on the rim of the visor, slightly to the right of the eye. The outer edge of the hand is barely [[wikt:canted|canted]] downward so that neither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible from the front. The hand and wrist are straight, the elbow inclined slightly forward, and the upper arm is horizontal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/army_board_study_guide_topics/customs_and_courtesies/hand-salute-how-to.shtml|title=Hand Salute{{snd}}How To |website=www.ArmyStudyGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force]] give salutes both covered and uncovered, but saluting indoors is forbidden except when formally reporting to a superior officer or during an indoor ceremony. It should be noted that when outdoors, a cover is to be worn at all times when wearing [[Battle Dress Uniform]]s/[[Army Combat Uniform]]s, but is not required when wearing physical training (PT) gear.

====Zogist salute====
[[File:Royal Albanian army 2.jpg|thumb|Albanian soldiers performing the Zogist salute]]
{{Main|Zogist salute}}
The Zogist salute is a military salute that was instituted by [[Zog I of Albania]]. It is a gesture whereby the right hand is placed over the heart, with the palm facing downwards. It was first widely used by Zog's personal police force and was later adopted by the [[Royal Albanian Army]].

In Mexico, a salute similar to the Zogist one is rendered by Mexican civilians during the playing of the Mexican national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://vacations.com/flag-day-in-mexico |title=Flag Day in Mexico |publisher=Vacations.com |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KsxZvwCuOUQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=mexican+flag+day+salute#v=onepage&amp;q=mexican%20flag%20day%20salute&amp;f=false|title=Pledging Allegiance: Learning Nationalism at the El Paso-Juarez Border|last=Rippberger|first=Susan J.|last2=Staudt|first2=Kathleen A.|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136063060|location=|pages=53|language=en|quote=Students, teachers, and others stand at attention with their right hand held precisely at right angle to their chest, hand flat, parallel to their heart.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State military (U.S.)==

===State defense forces (U.S.)===

[[State Defense Forces]] ('''SDF'''; also known as '''state military''', '''state guards''', state [[Militia (United States)|militia]]s, or state [[military reserve]]s) in the United States are '''[[military]]''' units that operate under the sole authority of a [[State governments of the United States|state government]]. State defense forces are authorized by [[State law|state]] and [[federal law]] and are under the command of the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] of each state.

State defense forces soldiers are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The UCMJ Applies to State Defense Force Soldiers|url=http://csmrsoldier.com/2013/01/31/ask-a-jag-what-about-the-ucmj/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also subject to their state military laws and regulations and render the same customs and courtesies as active duty, Reserve and National Guard personnel.

==Non-military services==

===Canadian police===

Most police forces salute similar to the [[Canadian Forces]] standard, with the exception of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]], which follow the [[British Army]] standard of saluting with the full palm facing forward, touching the brim of the hat, if worn.

====Non-police====

Similar salutes are used by honour guards for non-police services (e.g. [[Toronto Fire Services]], [[Toronto Transit Commission]]) during funerals or ceremonial events.

===Hong Kong===

All uniform branches of the Hong Kong (Police, Police Auxiliary, Police Pipeband, Fire (including Ambulance service members), Immigration, Customs, Correctional Services, Government Flying Service, Civil Aid Service) salute according to [[British Army]] traditions. Personnel stationed with the [[People's Liberation Army]] in [[Hong Kong]] salute using the Chinese military standards and similar to those used by the [[Royal Navy]].

Non-government organizations like [[Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps]], [[Hong Kong Adventure Corps]], the [[Boys' Brigade, Hong Kong]], [[Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps]] and [[St. John Ambulance]] all follow the same military salutes due to their ties with the [[British Armed Forces]].

==Civilian military auxiliaries (U.S.)==

===Civil Air Patrol===

In the United States, civilian military auxiliaries such as the [[Civil Air Patrol]] are required to salute all commissioned and warrant officers of higher rank and return the salute of those with lower ranks of the U.S. Uniformed Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps) senior in rank to them, as well as all friendly foreign officers, though military members are not required to reciprocate (they may salute voluntarily if they choose).  CAP officers are required to salute one another though this is not uniformly observed throughout the CAP.  Cadets are required to salute all senior members and military/uniformed services personnel.

===U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary===
The [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]] requires its members to salute all commissioned and warrant officers of higher rank and return the salute of those with lower ranks; since Auxiliarists hold "office" rather than "grade" (indicated by modified military insignia), all Auxiliarists are required to perform this courtesy.  Saluting between Auxiliarists is not usually the custom, but is not out of protocol to do so.  When operating in direct support of the USCG, or when on military installations in general, Auxiliarists usually wear "member" insignia unless specified otherwise by the officer/NCO in charge.

== Civilian salutes ==
In most countries, civilians have their own form of salutes.

===Albania===
The same salute of the United States was instituted in [[Albania]] as the "Zog salute" by [[Zog of Albania|King Zog I]].

===Iran===
In Iran a salute similar to the United States is given. In ancient times a salute would be given by raising a flat hand in front of the chest with the thumb facing the saluters face.

===Latin America===
In Latin America, except in Mexico, a salute similar to the United States flag salute is used, with the hand over the heart.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, civilians salute to the [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] during flag raising and upon hearing the [[Lupang Hinirang|Philippine National Anthem]] by standing at attention and doing the same hand-to-heart salute as their American, Italian, Nigerian, and South African counterparts. People wearing hats or caps must bare their heads and hold the headwear over their heart. Members of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], the [[Philippine National Police]] and the [[Philippine Coast Guard]] and sometimes airline pilots and civilian ship crews, meanwhile do the traditional military salutes if they are in uniform on duty; off-duty personnel do the hand-to-heart salutes. During the [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law years from 1972–1981]] up to the [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]], the "clenched fist" salute was done during the singing and playing of the National Anthem by some groups.

===Scouting===
[[Scouting|Boy Scouts]] and [[Scouting|Girl Scouts]] meanwhile have their [[Scout sign and salute|own form of salutes]].

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, civilians may either place their right hand to their left-breast (heart) or salute the flag as per a military salute, which may be that of the ''[[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]]'' Revolutionaries, or as per modern military drill. All persons present regardless of nationality are expected to stand silently and respectfully during its raising and lowering. It is a severe criminal offense in Indonesia to dishonour [[Flag of Indonesia|the national flag]] (known in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as ''Sang Saka Merah Putih'', "The Red and White") and its ceremonies, or the national anthem, "[[Indonesia Raya]]".

===Thailand===
[[Thailand]] also has the same rule like Indonesia wherein all persons present regardless of nationality are expected to stand at attention and respectfully during the flag raising and lowering and upon hearing the [[Thai National Anthem]] every 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or hearing the [[Sansoen Phra Barami]]. The [[Lèse majesté in Thailand]] says that it is a serious criminal offense to dishonor the flag of Thailand or National/Royal Anthem.

=== Roman salute ===
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Oath of the Horatii|The Oath of the Horatii]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]

The [[Roman salute]] is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palm down and fingers extended straight and touching. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. A well known symbol of [[Nazism]], it is commonly perceived to be based on a [[ancient Rome|classical Roman]] custom.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Martin M.|title=The Roman Salute: Cinema, History, Ideology|publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]],|location=Columbus|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-8142-0864-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; but no known [[Roman art|Roman work of art]] displays this salute, and no known [[Roman literature|Roman text]] describes it.&lt;ref name="Winkler" /&gt;

Beginning with [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1784), an association of the gesture with Roman republican and imperial culture emerged through 18th-century [[French art]].&lt;ref name="Winkler" /&gt;{{rp|42–56}} The association with ancient Roman traditions was further developed in France during the [[Napoleonic]] era and again in popular culture through late 19th- and early 20th-century [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and films.&lt;ref name="Winkler" /&gt;{{rp|70–101}} These include the epic ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914), whose screenplay was attributed to Italian [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]].&lt;ref name="Winkler" /&gt; In a case of [[life imitating art]], d'Annunzio appropriated the salute as a neo-imperial ritual when he led the occupation of [[Fiume (city)|Fiume]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="Falasca-Zamponi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Falasca-Zamponi|first=Simonetta|title=Fascist spectacle: the aesthetics of power in Mussolini's Italy|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2000|edition=illustrated|pages=110–113|series=Studies on the history of society and culture|volume=28|isbn= 978-0-520-22677-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was soon adopted by the [[Italian Fascist]] party,&lt;ref name="Falasca-Zamponi" /&gt; whose use of the salute inspired the [[Nazi]] party salute.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|title=The Coming of the Third Reich|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2005|edition=reprint, illustrated|pages=184–185|chapter=The Rize of Nazism|isbn= 978-0-14-303469-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') of the Third Reich used a German form of the military salute until, in the wake of the [[July 20 plot]] on Hitler's life in 1944, the Nazi salute or ''Hitlergruss'' was imposed on them.

The [[Bellamy salute]] was a similar gesture and was the civilian salute of the United States from 1892 to 1942. The United States, considering itself the new [[Roman Empire]], adopted the salute in 1892 in an effort to create a historical link with the [[Romans]].

In Germany showing the Roman salute is today prohibited by law. Those rendering similar salutes, for example raising the left instead of the right hand, or raising only three fingers, are liable to prosecution. The punishment derives from § 86a of the German Criminal Code and can be up to three years imprisonment or a fine (in minor cases).&lt;ref name="Tilman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allert|first=Tilman|author2=Translated by Jefferson Chase |title=The Hitler Salute: On the Meaning of a Gesture|publisher=Picador|date=April 2009|edition=Picador|page=94|isbn= 978-0-312-42830-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Airline industry ===
According to SOPs (standard operating procedures) of most airlines, the ground crew that handles departure of an aircraft from a gate (such handling normally includes: disconnecting of required for engine start pneumatic generators or aircraft power and ventilation utilities, aircraft push-back, icing inspection, etc.) is required to salute the captain before the aircraft is released for taxi. Captain normally returns the salute. Since a large percentage of airline pilots are ex-military pilots, this practice was transferred to the airline industry from the military. Exactly the same saluting practice is appropriate to most military aircraft operations, including Air Force, Navy and Army.

===One-finger salute===
In Islam raising the index finger signifies the [[Tawhid|Tawhīd]] (تَوْحِيد), which denotes the indivisible oneness of God. It is used to express the unity of God ("there is no god but God").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam for Nerds – 500 Questions and Answers|last=Drißner|first=Gerald|publisher=createspace|year=2016|isbn=978-1530860180|location=Berlin|page=521|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture has recently become widespread among supporters of Islamism, particularly members of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], though its use does not necessarily signal extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nathaniel |last=Zelinsky |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812213157/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2014-09-03/isis-sends-message |title=ISIS Sends a Message: What Gestures Say About Today's Middle East |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=3 September 2014 |archivedate=12 August 2015 |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2014-09-03/isis-sends-message}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arabic, the index or fore finger is called musabbiḥa (مُسَبِّحة), mostly used with the definite article: al-musabbiḥa (الْمُسَبِّحة). Sometimes also as-sabbāḥa (السَّبّاحة) is used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Arabic verb سَبَّحَ, which shares the same root as the Arabic word for index finger, means to praise or glorify God by saying: "[[Subhan Allah|Subḥāna Allāh]]" (سُبْحانَ الله).

=== Clenched fist salute ===
The [[raised fist|raised clenched fist]], symbolizing unity in struggle, was popularized in the 19th century by the [[socialism|socialist]], [[communism|communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] movements, and is still used today.

In the United States, the raised fist was associated with the [[Black Power]] movement, symbolized in the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]]; a clenched-fist salute is also proper in many African nations, including South Africa. However, the two salutes are somewhat different: in the Black Power salute, the arm is held straight, while in the salute of leftist movements the arm is bent slightly at the elbow.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Greetings ===
{{Main|Greeting}}
[[File:Secretary General of NATO Luns tips his hat as a troop review 1983.jpg|thumb|left|The civilian [[Secretary General of NATO]] [[Joseph Luns]] tips his hat at a troop review in 1983, in lieu of a military salute.  This (the full gesture is shown here) was by then becoming old-fashioned as a general social greeting, but had once been normal.]]
Many different gestures are used throughout the world as simple greetings.  In Western cultures the handshake is very common, though it has numerous subtle variations in the strength of grip, the vigour of the shake, the dominant position of one hand over the other, and whether or not the left hand is used.

Historically, when men normally wore hats out of doors, male greetings to people they knew, and sometimes those they did not, involved touching, raising slightly ("tipping"), or removing their hat in a variety of gestures, see [[hat tip]].  This basic gesture remained normal in very many situations from the Middle Ages until men typically ceased wearing hats in the mid-20th century. Hat-raising began with an element of recognition of superiority, where only the socially inferior party might perform it, but gradually lost this element; King [[Louis XIV of France]] made a point of at least touching his hat to all women he encountered.  However the gesture was never used by women, for whom their head-covering included considerations of modesty.  When a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair to the side of the front of his head to replicate a hat tipping gesture.  This was typically performed by lower class men to social superiors, such as peasants to the land-owner, and is known as "tugging the forelock", which still sometimes occurs as a metaphor for [[Agonistic behaviour#Submissive behaviour|submissive behaviour]].

In Europe, the formal style of upper-class greeting used by a man to a woman in the [[Early Modern Period]] was to hold the woman's presented hand (usually the right) with his right hand and kiss it while bowing, see [[hand-kissing]] and [[kissing hands]].  This style has not been widespread for a century or more.  In cases of a low degree of intimacy, the hand is held but not kissed. The ultra-formal style, with the man's right knee on the floor, is now only used in [[marriage proposal]]s, as a romantic gesture.

The Arabic term ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (literally "peace", from the spoken greeting that accompanies the gesture), refers to the practice of placing the right palm on the heart, before and after a handshake.

A Chinese greeting, Bao Quan Li (抱拳礼 or "fist wrapping rite"), features the right fist placed in the palm of the left hand and both shaken back and forth two or three times; it may be accompanied by a head nod or bow. The gesture may be used on meeting and parting, and when offering thanks or apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wushu Greeting|url=http://www.jocasta.me/TaiChi/Classes/greeting.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, it is common to see the [[Namaste]] greeting (or "Sat Sri Akal" for [[Sikhs]]) where the palms of the hands are pressed together and held near the heart with the head gently bowed.

[[Adab (gesture)|Adab]], meaning respect and politeness, is a hand gesture used as a Muslim greeting of south Asian Muslims, especially of Urdu-speaking communities of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Hyderabadi]] Muslims, [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Muslims and [[Muhajir people]] of Pakistan. The gesture involves raising the right hand towards the face with palm inwards such that it is in front of the eyes and the finger tips are almost touching the forehead, as the upper torso is bent forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gambhir|first=Vijay|title=The Teaching and Acquisition of South Asian Languages|year=1996|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=0-8122-3328-X|pages=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mB7TQc_OpdcC&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical for the person to say "''adab arz hai''", or just "''adab''". It is often answered with the same or the word "''Tasleem''" is said as an answer or sometimes it is answered with a facial gesture of acceptance.

In Indonesia, a nation with a huge variety of cultures and religions, many greetings are expressed, from the formalized greeting of the highly stratified and hierarchical [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to the more egalitarian and practical greetings of outer islands. Javanese, [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] and other ethnicities currently or formerly involved in the armed forces will salute a Government-employed superior, and follow with a deep bow from the waist or short nod of the head and a passing, loose handshake. Hand position is highly important; the superior's hand must be higher than the inferior's.
Muslim men will clasp both hands, palms together at the chest and utter the correct Islamic ''slametan'' (greeting) phrase, which may be followed by cheek-to-cheek contact, a quick hug or loose handshake. Pious Muslim women rotate their hands from a vertical to perpendicular prayer-like position in order to barely touch the finger tips of the male greeter and may opt out of the cheek-to-cheek contact.
If the male is an ''Abdi Dalem'' royal servant, courtier or particularly "peko-peko" (taken directly from Japanese to mean obsequious) or even a highly formal individual, he will retreat backwards with head downcast, the left arm crossed against the chest and the right arm hanging down, never showing his side or back to his superior. His head must always be lower than that of his superior.
Younger Muslim males and females will clasp their elder's or superior's outstretched hand to the forehead as a sign of respect and obeisance.
If a manual worker or a person with obviously dirty hands salutes or greets an elder or superior, he will show deference to his superior and avoid contact by bowing, touching the right forehead in a very quick salute or a distant "slamet" gesture.

The traditional Javanese ''[[Sungkem]]'' involves clasping the palms of both hands together, aligning the thumbs with the nose, turning the head downwards and bowing deeply, bending from the knees. In a royal presence, the one performing ''sungkem'' would kneel at the base of the throne.

A gesture called a ''wai'' is used in Thailand, where the hands are placed together palm to palm, approximately at nose level, while bowing.  The ''wai'' is similar in form to the gesture referred to by the Japanese term ''[[Buddhist terms and concepts#G|gassho]]'' by Buddhists.  In Thailand, the men and women would usually press two palms together and bow a little while saying "Sawadee ka" (female speaker) or "Sawadee krap" (male speaker).

Some cultures use [[hug]]s and [[kiss]]es (regardless of the sex of the greeters), but those gestures show an existing degree of intimacy and are not used between total strangers.  All of these gestures are being supplemented or completely displaced by the handshake in areas with large amounts of business contact with the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Etiquette: Greetings|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/business-etiquette-greetings-2897.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These bows indicate respect and acknowledgment of social rank, but do not necessarily imply obeisance.

=== Obeisances ===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
An ''obeisance'' is a gesture not only of respect but also of submission.  Such gestures are rarer in cultures that do not have strong class structures; citizens of the Western World, for example, often react with hostility to the idea of bowing to an authority figure.  The distinction between a formally polite greeting and an obeisance is often hard to make; for example, ''[[proskynesis]]'' (from the words πρός ''pros'' (towards) and κυνέω ''kyneo'' (to kiss))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dkune%2Fw |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon, κυνέω |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is described by the Greek researcher [[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]], who lived in the 5th century BC in his ''Histories'' 1.134:

:When they meet each other in the streets, you may know if the persons meeting are of equal rank by the following token: if they are, instead of speaking, they kiss each other on the lips. In the case where one is a little inferior to the other, the kiss is given on the cheek; where the difference of rank is great, the inferior prostrates himself upon the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/herodotus-persians.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his conquest of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], [[Alexander the Great]] introduced Persian etiquette into his own court, including the practice of proskynesis.  Visitors, depending on their ranks, would have to prostrate themselves, bow to, kneel in front of, or kiss the king. His [[Greeks|Greek]] countrymen objected to this practice, as they considered these rituals only suitable to the gods.

In countries with recognized social classes, bowing to nobility and royalty is customary.  Standing bows of obeisance all involve bending forward from the waist with the eyes downcast, though variations in the placement of the arms and feet are seen.  In western European cultures, women do not bow, they "[[curtsey]]" (a contraction of ''courtesy'' that became its own word), a movement in which one foot is moved back and the entire body lowered to a crouch while the head is bowed.

The European formal greeting used from men to women can be transformed into an obeisance gesture by holding the suzerain's hand with both hands. This kind of respect is due to kings, princes, sovereigns (in their kingdoms), archbishops (in their metropolitan province) or the Pope (everywhere). In ultra-formal ceremonies (a coronation, oath of allegiance or episcopal inauguration) the right knee shall touch the ground.

In South Asia traditions, obeisance also involves prostrating oneself before a king.

Many religious believers kneel in [[prayer]], and some ([[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]]) ''[[genuflection|genuflect]]'', bending one knee to touch the ground, at various points during religious services; the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christian equivalent is a deep bow from the waist, and as an especially solemn obeisance the Orthodox make [[poklon|prostrations]], bending down on both knees and touching the forehead to the floor. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] also employ prostrations on [[Good Friday]] and at [[ordinations]]. During Islamic [[prayer]], a kneeling bow called ''[[sajdah]]'' is used, with forehead, nose, hands, knees, and toes all touching the ground. Jews bow from the waist many times during prayer. Four times during the Yom Kippur service, and once on each day of Rosh Hashanah, many Jews will kneel and then prostrate.  With [[the Salvation Army]], when becoming a soldier, at a christening or other official event, underneath the flag, a salute is often used. This involves holding the hand, palm forwards, with all the fingers held in a clenched fist position. The index finger is left raised pointing towards God, and the hand is often held at chest height, in a similar position to that of Girl Guides.

=== Marching bands and Drum &amp; Bugle Corps ===
Hand salutes similar to those used in the military are rendered by the Drum Major of a marching band or drum corps just prior to beginning their performance (after the show announcer asks if the group is ready), following completion of the performance and at other appropriate times. In all cases the salute is rendered to the audience.

The classic "corps style" salute is often known as the "punch" type, where the saluting party will first punch their right arm straight forward from their body, arm parallel to the ground, hand in a fist, followed by the more traditional salute position with the right hand, left arm akimbo.  Dropping the salute typically entails snapping the saluting hand to the side and clenching the fist, then dropping both arms to the sides.

In the US, a Drum Major carrying a large baton or mace will often salute by bringing the right hand, holding the mace with the head upward, to the left shoulder.

There are occasional, more flamboyant variations, such as the windmill action of the saluting arm given by the [[Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps|Madison Scouts]] drum major, or the running of the saluting hand around the brim of the hat worn by the [[The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps|Cavaliers]] drum major.

===United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations===
United Kingdom and Commonwealth Canada, civilians do not salute the flag, although some may stand [[at attention]] when a [[national anthem]] is played or the national flag raised or lowered. In the United Kingdom, certain civilian individuals, such as officers of [[HM Revenue and Customs]], salute the [[quarterdeck]] of [[Royal Navy]] vessels on boarding.
In many countries, gestures such as tipping one's hat when passing another on the street can be considered appropriate civilian salutes. A more formal hat tip-and-lift is common in Britain, especially by [[doorman (profession)|doormen]] in [[hotel]]s.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, citizens stand at attention when the national anthem "[[Amhrán na bhFiann]]" is played. They either sing or remain completely silent during the playing of the anthem. This practice usually takes place before Gaelic Games begin. It is also observed at bars and pubs if live music is played. When the performer(s) are finished playing it is traditional to perform the national anthem but less common in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In many countries, gestures such as tipping one's hat when passing another on the street can be considered appropriate civilian salutes. A more formal hat tip-and-lift is common in Britain, especially by [[doorman (profession)|doormen]] in [[hotel]]s.

===United States===
In the United States, civilians may salute the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] by placing their right hand over their heart or by standing at attention during the playing of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] or while reciting the U.S. [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], or when the flag is passing by, as in a parade. Men and boys remove their hats and other headgear during the salute; religious headdress (and military headdress worn by veterans in uniform, who are otherwise civilians) are exempt. The nature of the headgear determines whether it is held in the left or right hand, tucked under the left arm, etc. However, if it is held in the right hand, the headgear is not held over the heart but the hand is placed in the same position it would be if it were not holding anything.

The Defense Authorization Act of 2009, signed by President Bush, contained a provision that gave veterans and active-duty service members not in uniform the right to salute during the playing of the national anthem. Previous legislation authorized saluting when not in uniform during the raising, lowering and passing of the flag.  However, because a salute is a form of communication protected by the [[Freedom of speech in the United States|Free Speech clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], legislative authorization is not required for any civilian—veteran or non-veteran—to salute the U.S. flag.

== Military salutes in popular culture ==

Many artefacts of popular culture have created military salutes for fictional purposes, more often than not with a cynical or sarcastic purpose.

In his 1953 comic book album ''[[Le dictateur et le champignon|Le Dictateur et le Champignon]]'', which is part of the ''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'' series, Belgian artist [[Franquin]] creates a silly salute, used in a fictional Latin American country named [[Palombia]]. When saluting, subordinates of General Zantas must raise their hands over their heads, with the palm facing forward, then point to the top of their heads with their thumbs. Franquin repeats this idea in his 1957 comic book album ''[[Z comme Zorglub]]'', another episode of the ''Spirou et Fantasio'' series. Here, almighty science wizard [[Zorglub]]'s conscripted soldiers salute their leader by pointing to their heads with their index fingers to cynically underline how much of a genius they consider him to be.

In the [[Marvel Comics]] universe members of the organisation [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] salute in a similar way to a fascist salute but instead raise both hands with fists clenched. This is also accompanied by chanting "Hail Hydra".

In the 1987 parodic science fiction film ''[[Spaceballs]]'', directed by [[Mel Brooks]], all subordinates of Supreme leader President Skroob salute him by first bending their forearms over their opposed hands as though they are about to give him the [[arm of honor]] salute, but at the last moment, use their raised hands to wave him good bye, rather than showing him the middle finger.

In the manga ''[[Attack on Titan]]'' the members of the armed forces (and sometimes civilians in a show of respect towards military) salute by bending their arms and placing their clenched fist over their hearts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Melia|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nycc-what-every-teen-is-wearing-2013-10|title=This Is The Costume Every Teen Is Wearing To New York Comic Con|publisher=''[[Business Insider]]''|date=October 12, 2013|accessdate=January 19, 2016|quote=As they pass each other they stop, crumpling their right hands into fists over their hearts and placing the other hand behind their backs—a salute.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture, known as "offering hearts" is meant to demonstrate that the soldiers are willing to give their bodies and lives to protect humanity and to ensure its survival.

In the BBC TV science fiction comedy ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', Arnold J. Rimmer continually performs an elaborate special salute that he has invented for the Space Corps, in spite of the fact that he is not a member of the Corps. It consists of extending the hand out in front of the body, palm down and rotating it about the wrist five times (to represent the five rings of the Space Corps) followed by bringing the hand close to the head with the palm facing out.

Research in semantic spaces dates back more than 20 years. In 1996, two papers were published that raised a lot of attention around the general idea of creating semantic spaces: [[latent semantic analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/plato/plato.annote.html|title=LSA: A Solution to Plato's Problem|website=lsa.colorado.edu|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hyperspace Analogue to Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lund|first=Kevin|last2=Burgess|first2=Curt|date=1996-06-01|title=Producing high-dimensional semantic spaces from lexical co-occurrence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03204766|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, &amp; Computers|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=203–208|doi=10.3758/BF03204766|issn=0743-3808}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their adoption was limited by the large computational effort required to construct and use those semantic spaces. A breakthrough with regard to the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of modelling associative relations between words (e.g. "spider-web", "lighter-cigarette", as opposed to synonymous relations such as "whale-dolphin", "astronaut-driver") was achieved by [[explicit semantic analysis]] (ESA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Evgeniy Gabrilovich  |author2=Shaul Markovitch |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2007|title=Computing Semantic Relatedness using Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/papers/ijcai-2007-sim.pdf|journal=Proc. 20th Int'l Joint Conf. on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI). pp. 1606–1611.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. ESA was a novel (non-machine learning) based approach that represented words in the form of vectors with 100,000 [[dimension]]s (where each dimension represents an Article in [[Wikipedia]]). However practical applications of the approach are limited due to the large number of required dimensions in the vectors.

More recently, advances in [[Neural networks|neural networking]] techniques in combination with other new approaches ([[tensor]]s) led to a host of new recent developments: [[Word2vec]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1310.4546|title=Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality|author1=Tomas Mikolov |author2=Ilya Sutskever |author3=Kai Chen |author4=Greg Corrado |author5=Jeffrey Dean |date=2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Google]], [[GloVe (machine learning)|GloVe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf|title=GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation|author1=Jeffrey Pennington |author2=Richard Socher |author3=Christopher D.

'''Shambala''' or '''Shambaa''' is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Tanzania]].

==Overview==
Shambala, also Kishambala, (ki)Sambaa, (ki)Shambaa is spoken by the [[Shambaa people|Shambaa]] in the [[Usambara]] mountains in the [[Lushoto District]] and [[Muheza]] District, [[Tanga Region]], of northern [[Tanzania]]. Some dialectal variation exists between the language as spoken in the area around [[Lushoto]] and the areas around [[Mlalo]] and [[Mtae]], possibly also between the Shambaa of the [[Western Usambara Mountains]] and the [[Eastern Usambara Mountains]].

'''South Bergish''' (German: ''{{lang|de|Südbergische Dialekte}}'') or '''Upper Bergish''' (German: ''{{lang|de|Oberbergische Dialekte}}'') is a group of German dialects of the [[Bergisches Land|Bergisches Land Region]] East of the [[Rhine]] and approximately south of the [[Wupper]] and north of the [[Sieg]]. These dialects are part of the [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian group]] and thus are also called East Ripuarian.  Ripuarian dialects are also spoken west of the Rhine up to the German border, and in some small areas next to the respective borders in [[Belgium]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. Ripuarian Bergish dialects belong to the [[Middle High German|Middle German]] group, and thus are varieties of [[High German]], where they belong to the northmost ones. In the North, they border to the [[East Bergish]] and the West Bergish language groups, which are part of the [[Low Franconian]] group like [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

In popular view, rather than scientific, South Bergish dialects are often referred to as ''[[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]'' by locals, or as ''[[Rhinelandic]]'' by outsiders.

'''Ughele''' is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] spoken by about 1200 people on [[Rendova Island]],  located in the [[Western Province (Solomon Islands)|Western Province]] of the [[Solomon Islands]].

There is no internal dialect differentiation.

==Phonology==
'' The following information is gathered from Benedicte Haraldstad Frostad. "A Grammar of Ughele: A Language of The Solomon Islands". 2012. '' Pages 35–48

=== Vowel Inventory === 
Ughele contains a five vowel inventory that is typical of most Oceanic languages.
These are differentiated by changes in the place of articulation and the degree of stricture required to produce the sound.
Lip rounding only accounts for the differentiation of two segments.
These are the close-mid back vowel /o/ and the close back vowel /u/.

This inventory consists of three front vowels: /i/, /e/, /a/; two back /o/, /u/ and no central phonemes.

There is no variation in vowel length.
====Minimal pairs==== These are distinguished by places of articulation

===== Distinguished by place of articulation =====
'' /veke/ '' and '' /veko/ '' - 'flying fox’ and ‘bald’
'' /ɣami/ '' and '' /ɣamu/ '' - ‘we/us’ and ‘you’

===== Distinguished by level of stricture=====
'' /patu/ '' and '' /petu/ '' - ‘stone’ and ‘mangrove’
'' /tina/ '' and '' /tini/ '' - ‘thousand ‘ and ‘body’
'' /neka/ '' and '' /nika/ '' - ‘slippery cabbage’ and ‘fire’
'' /kopi/ '' and '' /kupi/ '' - ‘lake’ and ‘to pick’

=== Consonant Inventory===
Ughele has 18 consonants and no consonant clusters, unless spoken accidentally.

==== Stops ====
Ughele contains bilabial, alveolar and velar stops. These are '' /b + p/ '', '' /d + t/ '' and '' /g + k/ '' respectively.
As well as voiced and unvoiced pairs for all plosives. -
'' /ba/ '' and '' /pa/ ''
'' /made/ '' and '' /mate/ '' (four and die/dead)
'' /poga/ '' and '' /poka/ '' (to make pudding/pudding and nail)
All voiced stops are pre-nasalised, however the degree of this varies between speakers. Pronunciation of this runs from barely audible nasalisation to almost fully nasalised segments. E.g. '' /b/ → /b̃/,  /d/ → /d̃/,  /g/ → /g̃/ ''

* ''' Nasal and oral pairs for all voiced stops '''.  E.g. '' /b/ → /m/, /d/ → /n/, /g/ → /ŋ/''
* ''' Voiced bilabial nasals and non-nasals ''' E.g. '' /ma/ and /ba/, /na/ and /da/ '' 
* ''' Voiced velar nasals and non-nasals ''' E.g. '' /mamaŋa/ '' open → '' /mamaga/ '' a fish species
* ''' Voiced bilabial, alveolar and velar stops ''' E.g. '' /mabo/ '' tired → '' /mado/ '' happy → '' /mago/ ''  spirit, devil
* ''' Unvoiced stops ''' '' /ka/ '' (negation indicator), '' /pa/ '' (location phrase indicator), '' /ta/ '' (possession indicator)
* ''' Voiced bilabial/alveolar/velar nasals ''' E.g. '' /madi/ '' obey, '' /nadi/ '' sagopalm pudding, '' /ŋadi/ '' sharp, long

==== Alveolar Trill ====
There is only one found in Ughele, this is in the lexeme '' /arozo/ '' (rope)

==== Fricatives ====
* Labiodental, alveolar, velar and glottal '' /v/, /s/, /z/, /ɣ/ and /h/ ''
* Labiodental '' /v/ '' and velar '' /ɣ/ '' are voiced and → ''/ɣoi/ '' you and '' /voi/ '' to put
* Glottal fricatives are unvoiced '' /puha/ '' to wipe and '' /pusa/ '' to tie
* Voiced and unvoiced alveolars '' /soi/ '' hot drink and '' /zoi/ '' penis

==== The Affricate d͡ʒ ====
This post-alveolar affricate is sometimes realised as a palatal nasal stop '' /ɲ/ '', although this is relatively rare in spoken language and therefore is speaker-dependent. 
'' /d͡ʒ/ → /ɲ/ ~ /d͡ʒ/ ''
Thus '' ‘ngajiri’ '' (angry) may be pronounced '' /ŋad͡ʒiri/ '' or '' /ŋapiri/ ''
==== Approximants ==== 
Ughele contains one alveolar lateral approximant '' /l/ '' and one labial velar '' /w/. ''
However '' /w/ '' only occurs in a small set of loanwords from English and Roviana (another Solomon Island language originally developed for trade)
'''Window ''' - '' /wida/ ''
''' Week ''' - /wiki/ ''
''' Win ''' - /wini/ ''
''' ‘Vaseni’ Year ''' -  ''/waseni/ ''

==== Minimal Pairs Based on Manner of Articulation ====
Voiced alveolar plosive '' /mada/ '' ‘to let’, and fricative, '' /maza/ '' ‘flesh’
Unvoiced alveolar plosive '' /tabu/ '' ‘holy’, and fricative '' /sabu/ '' ‘hunt’
Voiced velar plosive ''' /gu/ '' ‘1st/p possessive’, and fricative '' /ɣu/ '' ‘just’

==Written language==
Prior to the efforts of Frostard et al. Ughele had no documented history or written language standard. After these efforts Ughele is now written in Latin script as shown in these notes.

== Morphology ==

=== Pronouns and Person Marking ===
Ughele, like many other [[Oceanic languages]], possesses a complex [[pronominal]] system that includes personal, relative and interrogative pronouns (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;81-88).

'''Personal pronouns'''

[[Personal pronoun]]s predominate in terms of quantity; there are six types of pronoun forms: independent pronouns, preverbal subject partial clitics, postverbal subject pronouns, object clitics, preposed possessive pronouns and attributive suffixes (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;81-88). Personal pronouns are marked for [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[clusivity]]. In each of these types, distinctions are made between singular and plural forms, as well as 1st. 2nd and 3rd person (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;81). Inclusive and exclusive forms for 1st person plural are separated; the inclusive form extends to include the addressee whereas the addressee is then excluded from the extension of the exclusive form (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;81). There are partial formal similarities, and in some cases a complete overlap of forms between the types (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;81). The table below is an overview of the various types of personal pronouns.

Personal pronouns in Ughele can occupy various positions throughout the [[clause]], with some types being more restricted in their use than others.

==== Independent pronouns ====
Independent pronouns may act as the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] of a [[noun phrase]], taking on the forms of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[direct object]], or [[indirect object]] as a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] to prepositions (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;81). They may also appear in [[possessive]] constructions.

|}

Above is an example of the 3rd person plural pronoun ''rie'' and 1st person plural exclusive pronoun ''ghita'' in noun phrases headed by pronouns. The numeral [[Modifier (grammar)|modifier]] ''ka ru'' follows the pronoun head, whereas it would typically precede a noun head (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;82).

Ughele has object marking [[clitic]]s and two different sets of subject markers, and these occur in specific fixed positions relative to the verb (Frostad, 2012, 169).

==== Object clitics ====
Object clitics are pronominal forms, which only occur with [[verb stem]]s and only mark direct object (Frostad, 2012, 85).

[[Transitive verb]]s rarely occur without object marking clitics (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;169), and are either attached directly to the verb stem (2), or follow the transitive [[suffix]], either ''–i'' (3) or ''–ni'' (4).

==== Preverbal subject partial clitics ====
Preverbal subject marking pronouns in Ughele can appear in the form of partial clitics. These clitics precede the verb complex, but only in very specific constructions (Frostad, p.&amp;nbsp;82). They cliticize to two particles, the homophonous imperative mood marker ''ma'' (7), and conjunction ''ma'' ‘then’ (8), and they occur as independent forms indicating pivots in complex clauses (9) (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;171). This aspect of Ughele’s grammar bears resemblance to that of three of its nearest neighbouring languages, [[Hoava language|Hoava]], [[Roviana language|Roviana]] and [[Marovo language|Marovo]], with that of Marovo being the most similar (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;171).

==== Postverbal subject pronouns ====
In Ughele, postverbal subject pronouns overlap completely with preposed possessive pronouns (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;84). Postverbal subject pronouns mark various types of [[Focus (linguistics)|foci]], where the pronouns would refer to the focused constituent (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;85). Below is an example of the 3rd person plural postverbal subject pronoun used in a sentence.

==== Preposed possessive pronouns ====
Preposed possessive pronouns make up one of the three indirect possessive marking strategies in Ughele (Frostad, p. 86). It may occur in constructions which has a noun phrase expressing the possessor (11) or not, as in (12).

|}

==== Attributive suffixes ====
[[Attributive]] [[suffix]]es are what are often labeled as possessive suffixes in most other Oceanic languages (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;87), but in Ughele, they also have other functions (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;87).

In direct possessive constructions, attributive suffixes may either agree with the possessor noun (13) or be the only expression of the possessor (14).

{|

|-
|
| colspan="3" |‘Ghorehe is the name of the thing.’ (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;120) 
|}

Attributive suffixes are also used to derive [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] attributive modifiers from adjectival verbs, indicating the number and person of the referent of the head noun (15) (Frostad, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;87).  
{|
