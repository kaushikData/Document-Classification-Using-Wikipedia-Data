{{Administrative levels and divisions of China sidebar}}
'''Administrative division codes of the People's Republic of China''' identify [[administrative division]]s of the PRC at [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county level]] and above. They are published by the [[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China]] with the latest version issued on September 30, 2015.

==Coding scheme==
Reading from left to right, administrative division codes contain the following information:
* The first and second digits identify the highest level administrative division, which may be a [[Provinces of the People's Republic of China|province]], [[Autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China|autonomous region]], [[Direct-controlled municipality of the People's Republic of China|municipality]] or [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region (SAR)]].
* Digits three and four show summary data for the associated [[Prefecture-level cities|city]], prefecture (地区 ''dìqū''), [[Autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China|autonomous prefecture]], [[Leagues of China|Mongolian league]], [[District (PRC)|municipal city district]] or county. Codes 01 - 20 and 51 - 70 identify provincial level cities, codes 21 - 50 represent prefectures, autonomous prefectures and Mongolian leagues.
*The fifth and sixth digits represent the county level division - city districts, [[County-level city|county-level cities]], [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]] and the [[Banner (Inner Mongolia)|banner areas of Inner Mongolia]]. Codes 01 - 18  represent municipal districts or regions (autonomous prefectures and Mongolian leagues) under the jurisdiction of county-level cities. Codes 21 - 80 stand for counties and Mongolian banner areas while codes 81 - 99 represent county level cities directly administered by a province.

==Division codes for statistic use==
Division codes for statistic use consist of administrative division codes and another 6 digits, identify [[administrative division]]s of the PRC at [[Villages of the People's Republic of China|village level]] and above.
For example, 110102 007 003, 110102 refers to [[Xicheng District|'''Xicheng District, Beijing''']], 007 refers to [[Yuetan Subdistrict]] and 003 refers to [[Yuetan Community]].

'''Aurel Krause''' (December 30, 1848 &amp;ndash; March 14, 1908) was a German geographer known today for his early ethnography of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] Indians of southeast [[Alaska]], published in 1885.

Krause was born in [[Polski Konopat|Polnisch Konopath]] near [[Świecie|Schwetz]], [[West Prussia]]. 
He and his brother Arthur Krause were employed by the Geographical Society of [[Bremen]] in Germany when they conducted ethnological research in [[Siberia]], followed by Aurel Krause's mostly solo research with the Tlingit of [[Klukwan, Alaska]], in 1881 and 1882.

''' Bucks Lake Game Reserve''' is a [[protected area]] located in the [[Limestone Coast]] of [[South Australia]] about {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} south-west of [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]] and immediately east of the township of [[Carpenter Rocks]].  The game reserve was originally created as a National Park in 1968 under the ''National Parks Act 1966'' and was re-proclaimed as a game reserve under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' for the purpose of the conservation of wildlife and management of game.  The game reserve is used for duck hunting with species being harvested including [[grey teal]], [[chestnut teal]], [[Pacific black duck]], [[pink-eared duck]] and [[Australian shelduck]].  Hunting is conducted during a proclaimed open season with hunters requiring to have an ‘endorsed hunting permit’ and only to harvest maximum numbers (i.e. bag limit) of specific species.  The game reserve is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category VI – Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources|Category VI protected area]].&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite web|title= Carpenter Rocks Conservation Park and Bucks Lake Game Reserve Management Plan|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/88b589fe-d50d-47a5-b561-9e4f00b16ac4/CARPENTERCP_BUCKSGR_MP.pdf|publisher=Department for Environment and Heritage|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=2007|pages=1, 2, 7, 20 &amp; 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazateer&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia|name=    Bucks Lake Game Reserve |feature= SA0010460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cap of the North''' (''Nordkalotten'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], or ''Pohjoiskalotti'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) consists of the counties [[Finnmark]], [[Nordland]] and [[Troms]] in [[Norway]], [[Norrbotten County]] in [[Sweden]], [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland/Lappi Region]] in [[Finland]] and [[Murmansk Oblast]] in [[Russia]].

This area is roughly equal to the parts of [[Fennoscandia]] (including the [[Kola Peninsula]] in Russia) lying north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. The region has a [[subarctic climate]] and is home to the majority of the [[Sámi people]].

Historian Per Guttorm Kvenanger has criticized the term ''Nordkalotten'' for displacing the overlapping term [[Sápmi]] and hiding the "[[Sami people|Sami]] character" of northern Fennoscandia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kvenanger | first = P.

'''Dembiya''' ([[Amharic language|Amharic]]: ደምቢያ, ''dembīyā''; also transliterated Dembea, Dambya, Dembya, Dambiya, etc.) is a historic region of [[Ethiopia]], intimately linked with [[Lake Tana]]. According to the account of [[Manuel de Almeida]], Dembiya was "bounded on East by [[Begemder]], on South by [[Gojjam]], on West by [[Agaw]]s of [[Achefer]] and Tangha. [[Lake Tana|Lake Tsana]], formerly called Dambaya, is in this region."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Herbert Weld Blundell|H. Weld Blundell]], ''The Royal chronicle of Abyssinia, 1769-1840'', (Cambridge: University Press, 1922), p. 538&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Murray (linguist)|Alexander Murray]], in his preface to the third volume of [[James Bruce|Bruce's]] account, further describes it as "on the east it includes [[Fogera|Foggora]], [[Dera, Amhara (woreda)|Dara]], and Alata; on the north-east [[Gondar]], the metropolis, and the rich district beneath it; on the southwest, the district of Bed (the plain barren country) and, on the west, the lands around Waindaga and [[Dengel Ber|Dingleber]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile'', (1805 edition), vol. 3 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Dembiya was incorporated into the [[Begemder]] province (which previously only included lands to the east of Lake Tana) during the reign of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], and in 1996 became a [[Dembiya (woreda)|woreda]] of the [[Amhara Region]].

[[Image:GB Virgin Islands.png|thumb|right|250px]]
The five administrative subdivisions mentioned on some web pages are just statistical divisions, without any administrative relevance:

{| class="wikitable"
! Subdivision || Main town || Area&lt;br&gt;km² || Population&lt;br&gt;(2010 census)
|-
| [[Anegada]] || [[The Settlement, British Virgin Islands|The Settlement]] || align="right" | 38.6 || align="right" | 285
|-
| [[Jost Van Dyke]] || [[Belle Vue (Jost Van Dyke)]] ||align="right" |  8.3 || align="right" | 298
|-
| [[Tortola]] || [[Road Town]] ||align="right" |  59.2 || align="right" | 23,419
|-
| [[Virgin Gorda]] || [[Spanish Town, British Virgin Islands|Spanish Town]] ||align="right" | 21.2 || align="right" | 3,939
|-
| Other Islands || Great Harbour ([[Peter Island]])||align="right" | 23.7 || align="right" | 122
|- style="background: #DDDDDD;"
|'''British Virgin Islands'''||[[Road Town]] || align="right" | 151.0 || align="right" | 28,054
|-
|}

The "Other Islands" are mainly the islands south of Tortola (separated from it by the [[Sir Francis Drake Channel]] and southwest of Virgin Gorda and detached [[Ginger Island]], mainly [[Norman Island]], [[Peter Island]], [[Cooper Island (British Virgin Islands)|Cooper Island]] and [[Salt Island, British Virgin Islands|Salt Island]]. These islands are also known under the informal name [[Little Sisters]] or ''Southern Islands''.

The present-day Administrative Districts of the British Virgin Islands were established since 2003, following the provisions of the Sister Islands Programme, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/AnegadaEnvironmentalProfile_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Tortola, the surrounding islets, and the Little Sisters/Southern Islands are directly administered by the BVI Government, as an "Island". The 3 "Sister Islands", including the neighbouring islets, are administered through 3 Districts, run by District Officers, under the Deputy Governor of the BVI&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bvi.gov.vg/sites/default/files/2014{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Budget Estimates.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "in order to monitor, promote and facilitate the delivery of Government services to the sister islands of Virgin Gorda, Anegada, and Jost Van Dyke". This administrative setting is similar to that of some existing or former British dependencies - The Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands, or the Cook Islands - among others.

The Sister Islands Programme, 2003, establishes a Coordinator which works with, and supervises the District Officers, as a liaison with the central government.&lt;ref&gt;http://bviguides.com/Domains/bvipropertyguide/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=137&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are no local government structures in the Territory.

== Civil Registry Districts==

There are six [[Civil Registry]] Districts in the British Virgin Islands:

{| class="wikitable"
! Civil Registry District || Area
|-
| District A || [[Virgin Gorda]]
|-
| District B || [[Anegada]]
|-
| District C || East End ([[Tortola]])
|-
| District D || [[Road Town]] ([[Tortola]])
|-
| District E || West End ([[Tortola]])
|-
| District F || [[Jost Van Dyke]]
|-
|}
Civil Registry Districts C, D and E are subdivisions of the main island [[Tortola]].

==Electoral Districts==
*By the Constitution and Elections Ordinance 1954, which established a new Legislative Council with an elected majority, the presidency was divided into '''five''' districts. Road Town District (area of the [[Capital (political)|capital]]) sent two members to the legislative council, the other districts one each.
*A new constitution of 1967 provided for '''seven''' electoral districts, with one representative per district.
*In 1977, the number of electoral districts was augmented to '''nine'''. Each electoral district sends a member to the Legislative Council, which has 13 seats (including four at large members).

{| class="wikitable"
! Electoral District || Area
|-
| First Electoral District || West End, Carrott Bay ([[Tortola]])
|-
| Second Electoral District || Meyers, Cane Garden Bay, Brewers Bay ([[Tortola]]) and [[Jost Van Dyke]]
|-
| Third Electoral District || Sea Cow's Bay and surroundings ([[Tortola]])
|-
| Fourth Electoral District || [[Road Town]] and surroundings ([[Tortola]])
|-
| Fifth Electoral District || Huntum's Ghut and Long Trench ([[Tortola]])
|-
| Sixth Electoral District || Baugher's Bay and East Central Tortola
|-
| Seventh Electoral District || Long Look ([[Tortola]]) and [[Beef Island]]
|-
| Eighth Electoral District || East End, Greenland and Hope Estate ([[Tortola]])
|-
| Ninth Electoral District || [[Virgin Gorda]] and [[Anegada]] 
|-

A '''geodetic control network''' (also '''geodetic network''', '''reference network''', '''control point network''', or '''control network''') is a network, often of [[triangle]]s, which are measured precisely by techniques of terrestrial [[surveying]] or by [[satellite geodesy]].

A geodetic control network consists of stable, identifiable points with published datum values derived from observations that tie the points together.&lt;ref&gt;
Rear Adm. John D. Bossler.
[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/tech_pub/1984-stds-specs-geodetic-control-networks.htm "Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks"].
1984.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classically, a control is divided into horizontal (X-Y) and vertical (Z) controls (components of the control), however with the advent of [[satellite navigation]] systems, [[GPS]] in particular, this division is becoming obsolete.

Many organizations contribute information to the geodetic control network.&lt;ref&gt;
Minnesota Geospatial Information Office.
[http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/MSDI/workgroups/geodetic.htm "MSDI Data: Geodetic Control"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher-order (high precision, usually millimeter-to-decimeter on a scale of continents) control points are normally defined in both space and time using global or space techniques, and are used for "lower-order" points to be tied into. The lower-order control points are normally used for [[engineering]], [[construction]] and [[navigation]]. The scientific discipline that deals with the establishing of coordinates of points in a high-order control network is called [[geodesy]], and the technical discipline that does the same for points in a low-order control network is called [[surveying]].

== Cartography ==
After a cartographer registers key points in a digital map to the real world coordinates of those points on the ground, the map is then said to be "in control". Having a base map and other data in geodetic control means that they will overlay correctly.

When map layers are not in control, it requires extra work to adjust them to line up, which introduces additional error.
Those real world coordinates are generally in some particular [[map projection]], unit, and [[geodetic datum]].&lt;ref&gt;
Minnesota Geospatial Information Office.
[http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/cadastral/iisac/plan2.html "Plan for GIS implementation"].
1997.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triangulation ==
{{main article|Triangulation}}
In "classical geodesy" (up to the sixties) control networks were established by [[triangulation]] using measurements of [[angle]]s and of some spare distances.  The precise orientation to the [[geographic north]] is achieved through methods of [[geodetic astronomy]]. The principal instruments used are [[theodolite]]s and [[tacheometer]]s, which nowadays are equipped with [[infrared]] distance measuring, [[data base]]s, communication systems and partly by satellite links.

== Trilateration ==
{{see also|Trilateration}}
[[Electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) was introduced around 1960, when the [[prototype]] instruments became small enough to be used in the field. Instead of using only sparse and much less accurate distance measurements some control networks was established or updated by using [[trilateration]] more accurate distance measurements than was previously possible and no angle measurements.

EDM increased network [[accuracy|accuracies]] up to 1:1 million (1&amp;nbsp;cm per 10&amp;nbsp;km; today at least 10 times better), and made surveying less costly.

== Satellite geodesy ==
{{main article|Satellite geodesy}}
The geodetic use of [[satellite]]s began around the same time. By using bright satellites like [[Echo satellite#Echo 1|Echo I]], [[Echo satellite#Echo 2|Echo II]] and [[Pageos]], global networks were determined, which later provided support for the theory of [[plate tectonics]].

Another important improvement was the introduction of [[radio]] and electronic satellites like [[GEOS (satellite)|Geos A]] and B (1965–70), of the [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] system ([[Doppler effect]]) 1967-1990 &amp;mdash; which was the predecessor of GPS - and of [[laser]] techniques like [[Lageos]] (USA) or [[Starlette]] (F). Despite the use of spacecraft, small networks for [[cadastral]] and [[Technology|technical]] projects are mainly measured terrestrially, but in many cases incorporated in national and global networks by satellite geodesy.

== Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) ==
{{see also|Satellite navigation}}
Nowadays, several hundred geodetic satellites are in orbit, supplemented by a large number of [[remote sensing]] satellites and [[navigation]] systems like [[GPS]] and [[Glonass]], which will be followed by the European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] satellites in 2020.

While these developments have made satellite-based geodetic network surveying more flexible and cost effective than its terrestrial equivalent, the continued existence of [[Benchmark (surveying)|fixed point]] networks is still needed for administrative and legal purposes on local and regional scales. Global geodetic networks cannot be defined to be fixed, since [[geodynamic]]s are continuously changing the position of all [[continent]]s by 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;cm per year. Therefore, modern global networks like [[ETRS89]] or [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] show not only [[coordinate]]s of their "fixed points", but also their annual [[velocity|velocities]].

The '''geology of [[Ascension Island]]''' is the geologically young, exposed part of a large volcano, 80 kilometers west of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. The island formed within the last six to seven million years and is primarily [[mafic]] rock with some [[felsic]] rock. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |year=2016|title=The geology of Ascension Island|publisher=Ascension Island Volcanology|url=https://ascension-island-volcanology.com/the-geology-of-ascension-island/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ile de l'ascension routes.svg|thumb|Physical map of Ascension Island]]
==Origins &amp; Petrology==
Geologists debate the exact origins of the island and some have proposed that Ascension Island may overly a diverted shallow [[mantle plume]]. Alternately, the island may have originated from anomalously enriched magma, originally at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, but now situated to the west of it. 

The [[petrology]] of Ascension is unusual. Compared to most other volcanic islands, which only have a few mafic and felsic endmembers such as [[basalt]] or [[rhyolite]], Ascension has a full-range from some of the most mafic to most felsic. This includes basalt, [[hawaiite]], [[mugearite]], [[benmoreite]],[[trachyte]] and [[rhyolite]].
 
[[Potassium-argon dating]] indicates that the oldest rocks exposed above the water are one million year old rhyolites. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Nielsen &amp; Sibbett |year=1996|title=Geology of ascension Island, South Atlantic Ocean|publisher=Geothermics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375650596000181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geologists have divided the island's mafic and felsic rocks into different named sequences and sub-divided mafic rocks based on their ratio of [[zirconium]] and [[niobium]]. 

===Sister's Peak Region===
The Sister's Peak region in northwest Ascension has intermediate mafic lava flows, [[scoria]] cones and mafic ash fall deposits near Long Beach. The flows formed approximately 829,000 years ago and range between basalt, hawaiite and [[mugearite]] compositions. [[Benmoreite]] flows outcrop near Long Bay and west of Lady Hill. Additionally, benmoreite cinder cones are found near Broken Tooth and Hollow Tooth.

===Eastern Felsic Complex===
The Eastern Felsic Complex (EFC), in northeastern Ascension has a ring-shape geometry with [[felsic]] flows and pyroclastic deposits. Rocks in the EFC constitute trachyte, [[rhyolite]] and formations such as lava domes and thick flows. Pyroclastics exhibit a blend of ash and pumice. These rocks formed approximately 517,000 years ago. 

===Letterbox area===
The Devil's Inkpot lava flows formed from a fissure around the same time as the Sister's Peak region 829,000 years ago. Bentmoreite scoria cones record evidence of mafic volcanism, although older rhyolite and trachye flows, domes and pyroclastic deposits point to felsic eruptions as well. 

===Central Felsic Complex===
The Central Felsic Complex (CFC), centers on Green Mountain and Middleton Ridge and is older than the Eastern Felsic Complex. Here, ash is typically welded together and [[breccia]] is laden with rhyolite and [[obsidian]] fragments. Middleton Ridge formed more than one million years ago and is accompanied trachyte and rhyolite flows. By comparison, Green Mountain formed as recently as 395,000 years ago with trachyte flows and pyroclastics grouped around a mafic scoria cone. 

The scoria hosts [[pluton]] [[xenoliths]]. 

===Wideawakes===
The 758,000 year old intermediate bentmoreite lava flows of southwest Ascension are interspersed with scoria cones and periodically mafic ash falls. 

===South Coast===
The South Coast of Ascension has old, highly mafic lava flows. Bentmoreite flows are most common, although a basalt flow outcrops in Crystal Bay, a mafic scoria cone forms Ragged Hill and trachyte outcrops immediately south of the hill. {{sfn|Ascension Island Volcanology|2016}}

[[Igneous rocks]] are found in [[Bukit Timah]], [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], and [[Pulau Ubin]] island. [[Granite]] makes up the bulk of the igneous rock. [[Gabbro]] is also found in the area and is found in an area called [[Little Guilin]], named for its resemblance to Guilin in Southern [[China]]. This area is in Bukit Gombak.  [[Sedimentary rock]]s are found on the western part of Singapore, and is mainly made of [[sandstone]] and [[mudstones]]. It also includes the [[Ordinal directions|southwestern]] area. [[Metamorphic rock]]s are found in the [[Ordinal direction|northeastern]] part of Singapore, and also on [[Pulau Tekong]], off the east coast of Singapore. The rocks are mainly made up of [[quartzite]], and also make up the [[Sajahat Formation]].

== Specific areas ==
The following are the list of local geology:
* Kallang Formation:
*:Reef Member: Coral, unconsolidated calcareous sand and lesser quartz, ferruginous and [[lithic sand]].
*:Transitional Member: Unconsolidated black to blue-grey [[estuarine mud]], muddy sand or sand, often with a higher organic content and [[peat]] layers.
*:Littoral Member: Well sorted unconsolidated beach and near-shore [[quartz]] sand with minor lateritic, shell and lithic fragments. Iron-cemented beach rock is also included in this member.
*:Alluvial Member: A variable terrestrial sediment ranging from pebble beds through sand, muddy sand, and clay to peat. The member is usually unconsolidated but lightly consolidated beds may be found.
*:Marine Member: Dominantly a blue-grey clayey mud but peat and sand horizons are also present. The member is usually unconsolidated but  lightly consolidated beds do occur. 
* Tekong Formation: Unconsolidated marine and littoral well sorted sand with minor pebble beds and wood.
* Huat Choe Formation: A lacustrine deposit containing white [[kaolin clay]] and minor quartz gravel.
* Old Alluvium: Terrestrial to deltaic loose coarse quartz-feldspar sand and gravel, and lightly cemented sandstone-conglomerate. The top 8 metres are usually deeply weathered.
* Fort Canning Boulder Bed: Late Cretaceous colluvial deposit of strata from Rimau and possibly Queenstown [[Facies]]
* [[Jurong Formation]]:
*:Murai Schist: Strongly cleaved and sheared sediment of the Jurong Formation. Results from dynamic metamorphism.
*:Tengah Facies: Muddy marine sandstone with occasional grit beds and conglomerate. The member is usually deeply weathered but appears not to have been strongly lithified at any stage.
*: St. John Facies: Flysch-like marine muddy fine sandstone with minor laminae of carbonaeous matter. Usually moderately well lithified.
*: Rimau Facies: Transitional to marine quartz conglomerate and quartz sandstone. The clasts and usually angular to sub-angular and loosely packed but the rock is well cemented.
*: Pandan Facies: Grey to dark grey fossiliferous limestone, carbonaceous limestone, micritic limestone, and sparitic limestone. Minor dolomite and marble.
*: Ayer Chawan Facies: Well bedded marine muddy sandstone and mudstone, often black. Red roundstone conglomerate is common and all beds are tuffaceous. Lithic tuff and spilite are mapped separately. A number of fossil collections have been made from this member.
*: Jong Facies: Well cemented sandstone conglomerate and sandstone with occasional mudstone beds and spilite pillows.
*: Queenstown Facies: Red to purple mudstone and sandstone with minor conglomerate. Minor tuffs can also be found within the member. The red colouration is thought to come from tropic weathering in Triassic time, but volcanic material present may also have added to the colour.
* Dyke Rocks: Igneous rocks intruded into the Palaeozoic Formations and Bukit Timah Granite. Dykes are grouped as Acid Dykes and Basic Dykes. Within the acid dykes granophyre, trachyte, and granite porphyry, and within the basic dykes, [[dolerite]], and spessatite have been mapped.
* [[Bukit Timah]] Granite: The granite varies from granite through adamelilite to granodiorite, and several hybrid rocks are included within the formation. Both hornblende-rich granite and biotite-rich granite occur. Zones of norite-granite mixed rocks are also seen. Hybrid granodiorite is also recognised.
* Palaeozoic Volcanics: Andesitic ashy tuff and agglomerate tuff.
* [[Gombak]] Norite: Gabbroic and noritic rock. Shows metasomatic formation close to the Bukit Timah Granite.
* Sajahat Formation: Well lithified quartzite, quartz sandstone, and argilite.

The '''geology of [[Somaliland]]''' is very closely related to the [[geology of Somalia]]. Somaliland is a de facto independent country within the boundaries that the international community recognizes as Somalia. Because it encompasses the former territory of [[British Somaliland]], the region is historically better researched than former [[Italian Somaliland]]. Somaliland is built on more than 700 million year old igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock.. These ancient units are covered in thick layers of sedimentary rock formed in the last 200 million years and influenced by the rifting apart of the [[Somali Plate]] and the [[Arabian Plate]]. 

==Stratigraphy &amp; Geologic History==
The oldest rock units in Somaliland date back over 700 million years to the [[Proterozoic]], forming crystalline basement rock. Many rock units date to the [[Mesozoic]] and the current [[Cenozoic]] eons. 

===Proterozoic===
Somaliland preserves good examples of Proterozoic rocks. As basement rocks, they form a composite terrane, with younger rocks in the east and older rocks in the west. The older rocks pre-date the [[Pan-African orogeny]] and were affected by both igneous and metamorphic activity 840, 800 to 760 and 720 million years ago.
 
The early geology of Somaliland is divided into four major events. The [[Qabri Bahar complex]] formed  in the [[Paleoproterozoic ]]through the [[Mesoproterozoic]] with [[mafic]] and [[granitoid]] rocks, as well as rocks metamorphosed up to [[granulite]] grade in the sequence of [[metamorphic facies]]. Some geologists propose that the Qabri Bahar complex may preserve rocks from before the Pan-African orogeny. Major Event II, more than 700 million years ago, marked deformation, partial melting (also known as [[anataxis]] and rocks metamorphosed up to [[amphibolite]] grade. 

Major Event III happened 700 to 640 million years ago, bringing crustal thinning and extension, mafic volcanism in the [[Abdulkadir complex]] and [[Mait complex]], regional heating, metamorphism and the emplacement of [[gabbro]] and [[syenite]] through the thinned crust. Major Event IV continued for 100 million years, from 600 to 500 million years ago, spanning into the [[Paleozoic Era]] of the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]. Granites were emplaced and the deposition of the low-grade, [[metasedimentary]] [[Inda Ad sequence]] occurred, followed by more deformation and regional heating. 

The sequence of events in Somaliland in the Proterozoic correlates with the [[Arabian-Nubian Shield]] to the north, which experienced igneous activity related to subduction and witnessed the formation of marginal basins and island arcs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=225-226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
In the [[Early Jurassic]], the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], which included Africa, began to break apart. The [[marine transgression]] of the [[Tethys Ocean]] flooded large parts of East Africa and Arabia and new sedimentary rock units were deposited. In the west of Somaliland, the [[Cretaceous]] at the end of the [[Mesozoic]] brought crustal upwarping, which is preserved in the [[Yesomma Sandstone]]. 

Basins formed due to the movements of India, Madagascar and East Africa and the opening of the Indian Ocean. The Late Jurassic through the Cretaceous left [[marl]] and [[ammonite]] fossils, from an open sea environment, followed by shales and [[belemnite]] fossils from an [[epicontinental sea]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Kassim, Carmignani, Conti &amp; Fantozzi |year=2002|title=Geology of the Mesozoic-Tertiary sedimentary basins in southwestern Somalia|publisher=Elsevier|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899536201001026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
Sedimentation continued in the [[Cenozoic]]. Deposition of the Yesomma Sandstone continued until another regional marine transgression in the [[Middle Eocene]]. The opening of the [[Gulf of Aden]] created brackish basins, which filled with marine deposits in the [[Miocene]] and [[Oligocene]]. Outcrops of these rock units are limited to a few coastal areas in Somaliland, but rapid faulting created offshore basins with up to two kilometers of sediments from the late Cenozoic. In fact, Cenozoic sediments cover much of Somaliland. 

The formation of the [[Somali Plate]] began 60 million years ago and accelerated at the end of the [[Oligocene]], approximately 23 million years ago. As the [[Arabian Plate]] and Somali Plate rifted apart, forming the Gulf of Aden through sea floor spreading in the [[Late Miocene]] magma intruded between the two plates. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=227-228}}

Of particular significance for Somaliland, rifting in the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] reactivated Mesozoic normal faults, forming the [[Guban Basin]]. The basin is situated within a topographic high, known as the Somaliland escarpment and is filled with up to three kilometers of [[Late Cretaceous]] and [[Cenozoic]] sedimentary rocks. In places within the basin, the Late Cretaceous Jesomma sandstone is overlain by the eroded remnants of the [[Eocene]] Taleh Anhydrite. The basin contains shale, limestone, mudstone, sandstone and evaporite. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Ali, M.Y. |year=2015|title=Petroleum Geology and Hydrocarbon Potential of the Guban Basin, Northern Somaliland |publisher=Journal of Petroleum Geology|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammed_Ali58/publication/282072913_PETROLEUM_GEOLOGY_AND_HYDROCARBON_POTENTIAL_OF_THE_GUBAN_BASIN_NORTHERN_SOMALILAND/links/59dc33e3aca2728e20183f79/PETROLEUM-GEOLOGY-AND-HYDROCARBON-POTENTIAL-OF-THE-GUBAN-BASIN-NORTHERN-SOMALILAND.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogeology==
Dozens of springs have been in Somaliland, where they are more common in karst aquifers. Most people in Somaliland get their drinking water from aquifers, although poor quality water often means that boreholes go abandoned. 

The [[Eocene]] [[Karkar Limestone]], [[Auradu Limestone]] and [[Taalex Limestone]] are important karstic aquifers in [[Somaliland]] and [[Puntland]], along with thick, unconsolidated sediment aquifers up to 100 meters thick formed in the past 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]] in [[wadi]] locations throughout the county. Fractured [[Pleistocene]] basalt flows, particularly near Las Dhure and Agabar have potential as aquifers. The [[Yesomma Sandstone]] is a high productivity aquifer.

Fourteen water utilities serve towns in Somaliland and neighboring Puntland, although at least 750,000 people on the outskirts of [[Hargeisa]] lack piped water. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Somalia|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Somalia#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Mining is not a significant part of the economy of Somaliland. During British administration of Somaliland, geologists Thompson and Bell launched initial hydrocarbon research in 1918. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company initiated a large scale mapping project of the Guban Basin in 1920. 

Comprehensive geologic reports were made available in 1954 by the Geological Survey of British Somaliland and Somaliland Oil Exploration Company. Relatively few studies have been published since Somali independence in 1960. As of 2015, 11 wells had been drilled offshore and two onshore. Studies resumed in the 1980s and 1990s and in some cases, small oil plays were found in the Jesummah sandstone. Hydrocarbon research on the basin remains ongoing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Ali, M.Y. |year=2015|title=Petroleum Geology and Hydrocarbon Potential of the Guban Basin, Northern Somaliland |publisher=Journal of Petroleum Geology|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammed_Ali58/publication/282072913_PETROLEUM_GEOLOGY_AND_HYDROCARBON_POTENTIAL_OF_THE_GUBAN_BASIN_NORTHERN_SOMALILAND/links/59dc33e3aca2728e20183f79/PETROLEUM-GEOLOGY-AND-HYDROCARBON-POTENTIAL-OF-THE-GUBAN-BASIN-NORTHERN-SOMALILAND.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakarta is administratively equal to a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] with special status as the capital of [[Indonesia]]. Executive head of Jakarta is a [[governor]], instead of a [[mayor]]. The '''Governor of Jakarta''' is an elected politician who, along with Deputy Governor and 106 members of [[Jakarta Council|People's regional representative council (DPRD)]], is accountable for the strategic government of Jakarta.

==Background==
Governing system of Jakarta has changed throughout its history. On March 5, 1942, Japanese occupied [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] from the Dutch control and the city was named Jakarta ({{Nihongo|Jakarta Special City|ジャカルタ特別市|Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi}}, in accordance with the special status that was assigned to the city). After the collapse of Japan, Indonesian nationalists who declared independence on August 17, 1945, {{sfn|Waworoentoe|2013}} the government of Jakarta City was changed from the Japanese  into the Jakarta National Administration in September,1945. After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognized until full Indonesian independence was achieved on December 27, 1949 and Jakarta was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia. Based on the ''Act No. 5 of 1974'' relating to the '''Fundamentals of Regional Government''', Jakarta was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of Indonesia's  26 provinces in 1974 at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Statistics DKI Jakarta Provincial Office, Jakarta|title=Jakarta in Figures |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
This first government was held by a [[mayor]] until the end of 1960, when the office was changed to that of a [[governor]]. The last mayor of Jakarta was Sudiro, until he was replaced by [[Soemarno Sosroatmodjo|Dr Sumarno]] as governor of the province. In August 2007, Jakarta held its first ever election to choose a governor, whereas previously the city's governors were elected by members of DPRD. The poll is part of a country-wide decentralisation drive, allowing for direct local elections in several areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6936276.stm |title=Jakarta holds historic election |work=BBC News  |publisher=BBC  |date=8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elections for governor and deputy governor are held for a fixed five-year term. 

===Most recent election===
{{main article|Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2017}}
The most recent election was held in Jakarta on 15 February 2017. There were 3 contesting pairs in that election, but no one obtained 50% of the vote. As per law, a runoff election was held between the top two pairs on 19 April, 2017. The official results of the election is Anies Baswedan - Sandiaga Uno won the election with 57.96% of vote defeating Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - Djarot Saiful Hidayat, who got 42.04% of the vote. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joe Cochrane|title=Jakarta Governor Concedes Defeat in Religiously Tinged Election|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/asia/jakarta-election-ahok-anies-baswedan-indonesia.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 April 2017|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jakarta’s ‘Ahok’ concedes heavy defeat in governor race|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2088996/jakartas-ahok-concedes-heavy-defeat-governor-race|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia has been mercifully resistant to extremism—until now|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721202-local-election-shows-how-unscrupulous-can-manipulate-religion-win-office-indonesia-has|accessdate=21 April 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2017/04/20/21125081/hasil.final.real.count.kpu.anies-sandi.57.95.ahok-djarot.42.05.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''greenskeeper''' is a person responsible for the care and upkeep of a [[golf course]] or a sport turf playing surface.

[[Image:Golf Range 02801r.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Practice range with 43 tees (20 covered). Greenskeepers often have the responsibility of mowing the driving range for a golf course.]]

== Work description and duties ==
A professional who maintains a golf course's or country club's grounds. This includes all cultural practices along with setting of pins and marking of hazards for regular club play along with tournament play. Greenskeepers work under the direction of the [[golf course superintendent|Golf Course Superintendent]] or Director of Golf Course Operations. For a greenskeeper, it is more important to have experience and capability than formal education.

=== Measuring green speed with a stimpmeter ===
Greenskeepers measure the "speed" of golf {{anchor|Greens (golf)}}greens with a [[stimpmeter]]. The stimpmeter is used to compare green speed within a facility to ensure consistency. Stimpmeter readings should not be used to compare one facility with another; many factors, including design, undulation and grass type affect green speed. The tool measures how fast a green allows the golf ball to travel. A greenskeeper can increase the speed of the green by mowing the grass shorter, mowing more than once in multiple directions, or by topdressing the green with a small amount of fine sand to alter the putting surface.

=== Responsibility of setting the pins for play ===
Setting pins and tee markers is the one part of the job that differ from the job of other [[groundskeeper]]s and [[horticulturist]]s. Otherwise, most [[groundskeeping]] tasks are nearly the same.

Many people who have played golf, know that the hole and pin (flag) on a green are moved routinely. When setting or moving the pins on greens, a greenskeeper must think about these factors all together.

* The pin location will affect the golf course difficulty.
* Turf grass on the golf green wears and tears around the putting hole.
* A pin and hole cannot be legitimately placed at every place on the green.

In most cases, the greenskeeper that sets the greens pins also moves and sets the tee markers. The tee markers are the pieces stuck in the ground that mark the line from which to tee-off or strike the golf ball. If a greenskeeper moves all the tee markers to the back of the tees and then, in addition, moves all the holes and pins to the back of the green, the accumulation of total yards to cover would be drastically increased.

Almost every golf course is measured and rated according to yards/distance. Because of this, it is wise to keep the accumulative yardage for daily play close to the rating for the course. There is no total number of yards to guide greenskeepers for each day's moving of the pins. It's a judgement call, an estimation. 

A course should be measured from the medal plate (furthest distance possible on each hole, minus approx 2 yards from rear of the tee to allow for backswing) of the tee to the centre of the golf green following the center of the fairways. The actual distance of the hole may be slightly longer, with a pin at the rear of the green, but golfers should check scorecards or stroke-savers to find the depth of the green to aid club selection. 

If a greenskeeper sets several golf green pins back behind the center of the green, it's logical and reasonable to set some other greens pins in front of the green center, on the fairway side.

In similar fashion – not in reference to yardage – some pins should be placed on the left of the green, some on the right, and a few in the center in regards to left and right placement.

For general daily golf play, some pin placements should be easy, some medium and some hard. The closer the pin is to the fairway does not mean an easier shot, especially if there is a bunker (sand trap) immediately in front of the green. In that case, the rear of the green may be the easier pin placement even though the distance is greater.

Learning the layout of a golf course helps for setting both the pins and the tee markers. If all the tee markers and greens pins are set on the right, that will bring the trees on the right side into play. If all tee markers and greens pins are set on the left, that brings the trees on the left into play.

The trees on the left, and the trees on the right, affect different players. Some players "SLICE" the ball to the right. Some golfers "HOOK" the golf ball to the left. A slice or hook are when the ball's path curves in flight after it is hit.

Since some players may chronically hit the ball to the left or to the right, it's only fair to give a near equal advantage to every player. So a greenskeeper should bring trees into play from both the right and left sides of the tees, fairways and greens. This is controlled by the setting and position of the tee markers, golf, green holes, and pins.

As much as possible, a pin should be set in an upright or "PLUMB" position. Plumb is at 90 degrees to a level or horizontal plane. A golf green pin should not be perpendicular to the green surface because a green surface is not usually level. If the pin is set at a 90 degree angle to what we would consider a "level line", then a golfer can look down the fairway and see how drastic or how little a green surface deviates from a level surface.

Placing pins is done by "feel" and experience. Typically, a greenskeeper lets the weight of the cup cutting tool dangle so that gravity makes it vertical and plumb. Then the greenskeeper twists the handles to slice the round cutting cylinder into the green while trying to keep the tool in a vertical position. After the tool cuts in, it lifts a cylindrical core out of the new hole. This core of soil is saved to repair the old or previous hole after the cup is snagged and lifted out. Once the old hole is plugged with the soil and turf core, the greenskeeper places the cup into the new hole.

The greenskeeper then sets a round gadget called a cup-setter onto the cup and presses it down. This sets the top of the cup below the green's surface by about 1" according to golf standards. If the cup is located too high, a golf ball may roll into the hole and ride the rim of the cup, then roll back out. By setting the cup down properly, a ball should stay in the golf green hole.

Because the green wears around the hole from daily putting and play, the new greens pin location should be located at least 12' to 20' away from the previous one. The wear and tear can mean moving the greens pin daily during summer time golf play. In summer, if a pin is left in the same spot for a few days, the turf can be practically destroyed.

It is okay to place a golf hole on a slope. If a ball is putted uphill toward a golf hole and pin, if the ball stops rolling uphill before it goes in the hole, that ball should stop in place and not roll back downhill again. If the ball is hit uphill and then rolls back downhill, that slope is too steep for a golf pin placement.

Various tournaments, men's clubs and women's clubs, may have their rules, but in general, a golf green pin should not be placed closer to the golf green's edge than about 8' to 10'.

=== Right of way ===
Never hit a ball onto the green when a greenskeeper is there unless they clearly motion for you to do so. Generally, golfers have the right of way on a golf course, and workers will wait or yield to players. But if a greenskeeper is on the green, and the pin is out, they have the right of way.

The structures will be categorised into three grades, namely, Grades I, II, and III. Grade I structures will be prime landmarks upon which no alterations will be permitted. Under Grade II, external changes on structures will be subject to scrutiny. Buildings under Grade III may be changed for 'adaptive reuse' with suitable internal and external changes.&lt;ref name="Hindu_42GovtBldgAmong70HeritageStatus"/&gt;

==Heritage activism==
Heritage buildings are defined as notified structures of historical, architectural, or cultural significance.&lt;ref name="Hindu_42GovtBldgAmong70HeritageStatus"/&gt; The heritage activism in the city began with the erstwhile [[Moore Market]] building fire in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1998, a committee headed by Director of Town and Country Planning was constituted by the government to investigate aspects related to enactment of the Heritage Act.&lt;ref name="Hindu_ConservingChennaiPast"&gt;{{cite news

In the same year, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) constituted a Heritage Conservation Committee to draft regulations to conserve heritage buildings and precincts in the [[Chennai Metropolitan Area]] (CMA).&lt;ref name="Hindu_ConservingChennaiPast"/&gt; After the second master plan for the city was approved by the government on 2 September 2008, special rules for conservation of heritage buildings/precincts came into force.&lt;ref name="Hindu_42GovtBldgAmong70HeritageStatus"&gt;{{cite news

In 2012, a list of heritage buildings was released by the [[Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority]] (CMDA) under the heritage conservation committee's (HCC) supervision. Criteria considered for notification as heritage structure include period of construction, exhibited trend, events or persons associated with the structure, and design, style, designer, physical condition, and design integrity for architecturally significant buildings.&lt;ref name="Hindu_42GovtBldgAmong70HeritageStatus"/&gt; The CMDA was expected to clear the first list of 70 heritage buildings compiled by the HCC. However, in 2013, the process of notification was delayed after 65 owners objected to the inclusion of their premises in the list. The Heritage Conservation Committee, however, overruled their objections.&lt;ref name="Hindu_ConservingChennaiPast"/&gt; Of the structures/precincts that figure on the list, 42 are government buildings and the remaining are private ones. The government buildings include the main building of the College of Engineering Guindy under [[Anna University]], [[Madras High Court]], [[General Post Office, Chennai|General Post Office]], Music and Dance College, Government Teacher Training Institute at [[Saidapet]], and King Institute of Preventive Medicine. [[Theosophical Society]] is one of the private premises that are expected to get listed as a heritage structure. When a building is notified as a heritage structure, the onus of repair and maintenance of the heritage structure will be on the structure's owner.&lt;ref name="Hindu_42GovtBldgAmong70HeritageStatus"/&gt; In July 2018, documentation of the last phase covering 192 of the 467 buildings listed by Justice E. Padhmanaban Committee began.&lt;ref name="Hindu_ConservingChennaiPast"/&gt;

==Grading of heritage structures==
The heritage structures have been classified into three grades, viz. Grade I, II, and III. Grade I includes buildings and precincts of national or historical importance, with excellence in architecture, style and design. These structures remain the chief landmarks of the city. Save for some minimal changes approved by the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), no intervention, both on the interior and on the exterior, will be permitted in these structures. Grade II includes those structures of regional or local importance with special architectural or aesthetic merit, cultural or historical value. Although internal changes to the structures and adaptive reuse are allowed, here, too, external changes are allowed after scrutiny by the HCC. Extension or construction of additional buildings in the same plot are permissible as long as they are in harmony with the existing structure, especially in terms of facade and height. Grade III includes structures of importance for town spaces. These structures evoke architectural or aesthetic interest, but not as much as the Grade II structures. Changes to both external and internal portions of the buildings are generally permissible for Grade III buildings.&lt;ref name="Hindu_ConservingChennaiPast"/&gt;

The '''''Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales''''' is a substantial [[topography|topographical]] [[dictionary]] first published between 1870 and 1872, edited by the Reverend [[John Marius Wilson]]. It contains a detailed description of [[England and Wales]]. Its six volumes have a brief article on each [[county]], [[city]], [[borough]], [[civil parish]], and [[diocese]], describing their political and physical features and naming the principal people of each place.

The publishers were A. Fullarton and Co., of London &amp; Edinburgh. The work is a companion to Wilson's ''[[Imperial Gazetteer of Scotland]]'', published in parts between 1854 and 1857.

The text of the Imperial Gazetteer is available online in two forms, as images you pay for on the Ancestry web site,&lt;ref name=ukg&gt;[http://www.ukgenealogy.co.uk/favorites/gazetteers.html Gazetteers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230223913/http://www.ukgenealogy.co.uk/favorites/gazetteers.html |date=2007-12-30 }} at ukgenealogy.co.uk (accessed 4 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and as freely accessible searchable text on ''[[A Vision of Britain through Time]]'',&lt;ref name=vob&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions Descriptive Gazetteer Search] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203192802/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions |date=2008-12-03 }} at visionofbritain.org.uk (accessed 1 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; which also accesses [[Francis Hindes Groome|Groome's]] ''Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland'' and the Bartholomew ''Gazetteer of the British Isles''. Volumes 1-4 and 6 (i.e. all but volume 5) are available at the [[Internet Archive]]. However, it should be treated with some caution. The scale of the project was such that Wilson was unable to check all statements himself, and for many smaller places the information given is out of date or even wrong.

'''Integrated modification methodology''' ('''IMM''') is a procedure encompassing an open set of scientific techniques for morphologically analyzing the [[built environment]] in a multiscale manner and evaluating its performance in actual states or under specific design scenarios.

The methodology is structured around a nonlinear phasing process aiming for delivering a systemic understanding of any given urban settlement, formulating the modification set-ups for improving its performance, and examining the modification strategies to transform that system. The basic assumption in IMM is the recognition of the built environment as a [[Complex adaptive system|Complex Adaptive System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=J|date=2007|title=Complex Adaptive Systems|url=|journal=CIS Technical Report|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMM has been developed by IMMdesignlab, a research lab based at [[Polytechnic University of Milan|Politecnico di Milano]] at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC).

==History==

IMM began in 2010 as an academic research at Politecnico di Milano. That research criticized the analytical approach frequently used to study and evaluate the built environment by most of the sustainable development methods. By Recognizing the built environment as a [[Complex Adaptive System]] (CAS), IMM is urged towards a holistic simulation rather than simplifying the complex mechanisms within the cities with [[reductionism]].

In 2013, Massimo Tadi established the ''IMMdesignlab'' at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC) of the Politecnico di Milano. The purpose of the mentioned laboratory is to develop IMM through research and education.

IN 2015, ''Integrated Modification Methodology for the Sustainable Built Environment'' has been approved as an academic course in the curriculum of the ''Architectural Engineering'', an International Master Program in Politecnico di Milano.

==Background==

At its theoretical background, Integrated Modification Methodology refers to the contemporary urban development as a highly paradoxical context arisen from the social and economic significance of the cities on the one hand and their arguably negative environmental impacts on the other. Asserting the inevitably of [[urbanization]], IMM declares that the only way to overcome that paradox for the cities is to develop in a profound integration with the [[ecology]]. According to IMM, the fundamental prerequisite of ecologically [[sustainable development]] is to have a comprehensive systemic understanding of the built environment.

IMM suggests that the advancement in construction techniques, building materials quality and transportation technologies alone have not solved the complex problems of the urban life simply because such improvements are not necessarily dealing with the systemic integration. The core argument of IMM is that the performance of the city is being chiefly driven by the complex relationships subsystems rather than the independent qualities of the urban elements. Thus, it aims at portraying the systemic structure of the built environment by introducing a logical framework for modeling the linkage between the city’s static and dynamic elements.

== Methodology ==

Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first2=S|date=2014|title=Transformation of an urban complex system into a more sustainable form via integrated modification methodology (I.M.M)|url=|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Investigation
# Formulation
# Modification
# Retrofitting and Optimization 
The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with ''Horizontal Investigation'' in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with ''Vertical Investigation'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first=S|last2=Tadi|first2=Massimo|date=2011|title=, Sustainable urban morphology emergence via Complex Adaptive System analysis|url=|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=|pages=89–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named ''[[Key Categories]]''. In a nutshell they are types of [[emergence]] that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as) an additive result of the proprieties of the elementary parts. 
IMM declares that the city’s functioning manner is chiefly driven from the Key Categories, hence, they have the most fundamental role in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System. The Investigation phase concludes with the ''Evaluation'' step which is basically an examination of the system’s performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. The same indicators are later used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the final evaluation of the system performance, after the transformation design process occurred.

The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category and the urban element within the  area deduced from the Investigation phase. These critical attributes are being interpreted as the Catalysts of transformation and are to come to the designer’s use to set a contextual priority list of ''[[Design Ordering Principals]]''.

The third phase is the introduction of the modification/design scenarios to the project and advances with examining them by the exact procedure of the Investigation phase in a repetitive manner until the transformed context is predicted to be acceptable in arrangement and evaluation.

The fourth phase, Retrofitting and Optimization, is a testing process of the outcomes of the modification phase, then a local optimization by technical strategies (e.g. installing photovoltaic panels, designing green roofs, studying building orientations etc.) is initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Mohammad Zadeh|first2=Hadi|date=2014|others=Naraghi, Vahabzadeh Manesh|title=Environmental and energy performance optimization of a neighborhood in Tehran, via IMM methodology|url=|journal=International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology (IJESIT)|volume=|pages=409–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6995">The '''International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement (INECE)''' is a global network of environmental compliance and enforcement practitioners dedicated to raising awareness of compliance and enforcement across the regulatory cycle; developing networks for enforcement cooperation; and strengthening capacity to implement and enforce environmental requirements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://inece.org/INECE_SIP_2006.pdf INECE Strategic Implementation Plan, 2006-2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1989 by The Netherlands [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] (VROM) and by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (US EPA), INECE links the environmental compliance and enforcement efforts of more than 4,000 practitioners - inspectors, prosecutors, regulators, parliamentarians, judges, [[international organizations]],and [[non-governmental organization]]s - from 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inece.org/ The INECE Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
INECE's organizational structure consists of its Executive Planning Committee, its implementing Secretariat, and its participants.

The Executive Planning Committee (EPC), as the governing body of INECE, defines INECE's cooperative efforts and makes decisions to realize the INECE mission.  It is co-chaired by representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Netherlands Ministry of Environment, Housing and Urban Development (VROM), and the Brazil Supreme Court (STJ). The INECE Secretariat provides technical, administrative, and communications support for Executive Planning Committee functions and helps to implement the INECE work program. [[Durwood Zaelke]], President of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, is the current Director of the INECE Secretariat.

INECE participants include inspectors, prosecutors, regulators, parliamentarians, judges, other governmental officials, and members of international and non-governmental organizations. INECE is an informal network, and any environmental compliance and enforcement practitioners may join the network by registering through the INECE Web site.&lt;ref&gt;http://inece.org/INECERegistration.html&lt;/ref&gt; INECE participants support the mission and objectives of the network, and may carry out these activities on an individual, organizational, bilateral, and/or multilateral basis as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inece.org/overview/structure.html The INECE Website: INECE Organizational Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Projects and Activities==
===International Conference===
INECE conferences bring together enforcement officials from both developed and developing countries all over the world to share experiences and make plans to take environmental compliance and enforcement efforts to the next level. INECE has hosted eight international conferences since 1990:

'''Ireland''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Ireland.ogg|ˈ|aɪər|l|ə|n|d}}; {{lang-ga|[[Éire]]}} {{IPA-ga|ˈeːɾʲə||Eire_pronunciation.ogg}}; [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: {{lang|sco|Airlann}} {{IPA-sco|ˈɑːrlən|}}) is an [[island]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. It is separated from [[Great Britain]] to its east by the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]], the [[Irish Sea]], and [[St George's Channel]]. Ireland is the [[List of islands of the British Isles|second-largest island]] of the [[British Isles]], the [[List of European islands by area|third-largest]] in [[Europe]], and the [[List of islands by area|twentieth-largest]] on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name='unep'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://islands.unep.ch/Tiarea.htm |title=Islands by Area |date=18 February 1998 |website=[[UN System-Wide Earthwatch]] |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] |access-date=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Ireland is divided between the [[Republic of Ireland]] (officially [[Names of the Irish state|named Ireland]]), which covers five-sixths of the island, and [[Northern Ireland]], which is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. In 2011, the [[Irish population analysis|population of Ireland]] was about 6.6&amp;nbsp;million, ranking it the [[List of European islands by population|second-most populous island in Europe]] after [[Great Britain]]. Just under 4.8&amp;nbsp;million live in the Republic of Ireland and just over 1.8&amp;nbsp;million live in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="2011population"&gt;The 2016 population of the Republic of Ireland was 4,761,865 and that of Northern Ireland in 2011 was 1,810,863.

The island's [[geography]] comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with [[Rivers of Ireland|several navigable rivers]] extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. It was covered by thick woodlands until the [[Middle Ages]]. As of 2013, the amount of land that is wooded in Ireland is about 11% of the total, compared with a European average of 35%.&lt;ref name=guardexa&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/total-forest-area-by-country |title=Total forest coverage by country |last=Brown |first=Felicity |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 September 2009 |access-date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.ie/media/00061_EPA_SoE12_Chp07.pdf |title=EPA, Land Use Cover |website=EPA.ie |publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] |location=Wexford |access-date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are twenty-six extant [[mammal]] species native to Ireland.&lt;ref name="Costello, M.J 93"/&gt; The [[Climate of Ireland|Irish climate]] is [[oceanic climate|influenced by the Atlantic Ocean]] and thus very moderate,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.met.ie/climate-ireland/climate-of-ireland.asp Climate of Ireland]. [[Met Éireann]]. Retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in [[Continental Europe]]. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.

The earliest evidence of human presence in Ireland is dated at 10,500 BC (12,500 years ago).&lt;ref name=BBC2016-03-21&gt;{{cite news |title=Earliest evidence of humans in Ireland |work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=21 March 2016 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35863186 |access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaelic Ireland]] had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was [[Christianised]] from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.

[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the fields of [[Irish literature|literature]]. Alongside mainstream [[Western culture]], a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through [[Gaelic games]], [[Irish music]] and the [[Irish language]]. The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the [[English language]], and sports such as [[association football]], [[rugby union|rugby]], [[horse racing]], and [[golf]].

==Name==
The names ''Ireland'' and Éire derive from [[Old Irish]] ''{{lang|sga|Eriu}}''. This in turn comes from the [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*Iveriu'' (compare [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''{{lang|cy|Iwerddon}}''), which is also the source of Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Hibernia]]}}''. ''Iveriu'' derives from a root meaning 'fat, prosperous'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Irish&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Irish |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |first=Douglas |last=Harper |publisher=self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=October 2017}}

During the [[last glacial period]], and up until about 10,000 BC, most of Ireland was periodically covered in ice. [[Sea levels]] were lower and Ireland, like [[Great Britain]], formed part of [[continental Europe]]. By 16,000 BC, rising sea levels due to ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain.&lt;ref name=drowning&gt;Edwards, Robin &amp; al.

Some time before 4000&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Neolithic]] settlers arrived introducing cereal [[cultivar]]s, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, large timber building, and stone monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooney |first1=Gabriel |title=Landscapes of Neolithic Ireland |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415169776}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence for farming in Ireland or Great Britain is from [[Ferriter's Cove]], [[County Kerry|Co.Kerry]], where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep's tooth were [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-dated]] to c.&amp;nbsp;4350&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Ireland's DNA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Genocide in Ireland?|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/genetic-ancestry/guff_documents/Genocide_in_Ireland.pdf|website=Ireland's DNA|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field systems were developed in different parts of Ireland, including at the [[Céide Fields]], that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day [[Tyrawley]]. An extensive [[field system]], arguably the oldest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/west/ceidefields/ |title=Céide Fields |author=Heritage Ireland |publisher=Office of Public Works |access-date=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of small divisions separated by [[dry-stone wall]]s. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] were the principal crops.

The [[Bronze Age]]&amp;nbsp;– defined by the use of metal&amp;nbsp;– began around 2500 BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the [[wheel]]; harnessing [[oxen]]; [[weaving|weaving textiles]]; brewing [[alcohol]]; and skilful [[metalworking]], which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine [[gold]] decoration and jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[torc]]s. According to [[John T.

====Emergence of Celtic Ireland====
During the [[Iron Age]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite [[Beaker culture]], with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reich|first=David|title= Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past |year=2018|url= |publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK|isbn=978 0 19 882125 0|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uragh Stone Circle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Uragh Stone Circle|The Uragh Stone Circle]], a [[Neolithic]] [[stone circle]] in [[Tuosist]], close to Gleninchaquin Park, [[County Kerry]]]]
The long-standing traditional view, once widely accepted,{{by whom |date=December 2015}} is that the Celtic language, [[Ogham]] script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating [[Celts]] from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the Belgae from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;The Celts: A History By Dáithí Ó hÓgáin&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the [[Belgae]] people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.&lt;ref&gt;Early Peoples of Britain and Ireland: A-G Christopher Allen Snyder&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Ireland: From the Earliest Times to 1922" By Edmund Curtis&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was advanced in part because of lack of archeological evidence for large-scale Celtic [[immigration]], though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Some proponents of this theory hold that it is likely that there was migration of smaller groups of Celts to Ireland, with sufficiently regular traffic to constitute a "migration stream," but that this was not the fundamental cause of Insular Celticisation.{{citation needed |date=December 2015}} Historical linguists are sceptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of the Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=Ireland in the Bronze Age |publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |date=April 1995 |location=Dublin |pages= |url= http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319230912/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=The Question of the Celticization of Ireland |publisher=Emania |date=September 1992 |pages= |url= http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151900/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account a study drew the conclusion that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European "Atlantic Celts" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1182057 |title=The Longue Durée of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe |pmid=15309688 |doi=10.1086/424697 |volume=75 |issue=4 |date=October 2004 |journal=Am.

In 2012, research showed that occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern Irish men for this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the World, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to Spain. A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA.&lt;ref name="Ireland's DNA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Maciamo|title=Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1b_Y-DNA.shtml|website=Eupedia|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], who says: “British and Irish skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 percent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 percent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the Netherlands”. He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reich|first=David|title= Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past |year=2018|url= |publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK|isbn=978 0 19 882125 0|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographers. [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' refers to Ireland as ''Mikra Brettania'' (''Little Britain''), in contrast to the larger island, which he called ''Megale Brettania'' (''Great Britain'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Freeman |first=Philip |title=Ireland and the classical world |publisher=University of Texas Press |date=2001 |location=Austin, Texas |page=65 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA65 |isbn=978-0-292-72518-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iouernia]]'' and to Great Britain as ''Albion''. These "new" names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, [[Exonym and endonym|in contrast]], were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Philip |last=Freeman |title=Ireland and the Classical World |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] would later refer to Ireland by this name too in its [[Latinised]] form, ''[[Hibernia]]'', or [[Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=O'Hart |first=John |title=Irish Pedigrees: or, The Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation |publisher=J.

Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms but, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a [[High King of Ireland]]. [[Medieval Irish literature]] portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years, but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.&lt;ref name="DOC"&gt;[[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]], "Ireland, 400–800", in Dáibhí Ó Cróinín (ed.), ''A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 182–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the Irish kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the High King. The High King was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal [[kingdom of Meath]], with a ceremonial capital at the [[Hill of Tara]]. The concept didn't become a political reality until the [[Viking Age#Ireland|Viking Age]] and even then was not a consistent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Jaski |first=Bart |date=2005 |title=Kings and kingship |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

On 1 May 1169, an expedition of [[Wales|Cambro]]-[[Norman people|Norman]] knights with an army of about six hundred landed at [[Bannow|Bannow Strand]] in present-day [[County Wexford]]. It was led by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], called ''Strongbow'' due to his prowess as an archer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Chrisafis |first=Angelique |title=Scion of traitors and warlords: Why Bush is coy about his Irish links |work=The Guardian |date=25 January 2005 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/27/usa.angeliquechrisafis |access-date=8 November 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Dermot Mac Murrough]], the [[Kings of Leinster|king of Leinster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Previté-Orton |title=The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1975 |page=810 |isbn=978-0-521-09977-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to [[Anjou]], France, following a war involving [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc]], of [[Breifne]], and sought the assistance of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] king, [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]], in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the [[Gaelic Ireland|Irish]] kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]].

The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', issued by [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the [[Celtic Church|Irish Church]] and its integration into the Roman Church system.&lt;ref name="Curtis 2002 49"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Curtis |first=Edmund |title=A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |date=2002 |page=49 |isbn=978-0-415-27949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ruth |last1=Edwards |display-authors=etal |title=An Atlas of Irish History |publisher=Routledge |date=2005 |page=106 |isbn=978-0-415-33952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of ''Laudabiliter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ó Clabaigh |first=Colmán N. |date=2005 |title=Papacy |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

In 1172, the new pope, [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]], further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a [[tithe]] of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called [[Peter's Pence]], is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of [[Lord of Ireland]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the [[Lordship of Ireland]].{{citation needed |date=February 2016}} When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, [[John of England|John]] inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.

Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-Irish]] had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of Ireland]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the ''Irish Church'' for, the English church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was founded in 1297.

From the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |title=The Great Irish Famine: Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish |publisher=New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education |date=1998 |website=Irish Famine Curriculum Committee |format=PDF |access-date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 15th century central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as [[The Pale]], and under the provisions of [[Poynings' Law]] of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the [[English Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pack |first=Mark |title=Charles James Fox, the Repeal of Poynings Law, and the Act of Union: 1782–1801 |journal=Journal of Liberal History |volume=33 |date=2001 |page=6 |url= http://www.markpack.org.uk/1288/charles-james-fox-the-repeal-of-poynings-law-and-the-act-of-union/ |access-date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kingdom of Ireland===

[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate03.jpg|thumb|left|A scene from ''[[The Image of Irelande, with a Discoverie of Woodkarne|The Image of Irelande]]'' (1581) showing a chieftain at a feast]]

The title of ''[[King of Ireland]]'' was re-created in 1542 by [[Henry VIII]], then [[King of England]], of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]. A near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Flight of the Earls]].

This control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the English and Scottish colonisation in the [[Plantations of Ireland]], the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]]. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the [[Irish Confederacy]] and the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war.

If a prewar population of 1.5 million is assumed, this would mean that the population was reduced by almost half. 

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#1672 Act|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School |url= http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |access-date=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

The "[[Irish Famine (1740–1741)#Cause|Great Frost]]" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters.

An estimated 250,000 people (about one in eight of the population) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease.&lt;ref name="cormac_famine"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Cormac |last=Ó Gráda |title=The Great Irish Famine |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1989 |page=12 |isbn=978-0-521-55266-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more.&lt;ref name="cormac_famine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crawford_feast"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Leslie |last1=Clarkson |first2=Margaret |last2=Crawford |title=Feast and Famine: Food and Nutrition in Ireland, 1500–1920 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2001 |page=274 |isbn=978-0-19-822751-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality.&lt;ref name="cormac_famine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crawford_feast"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the [[Georgian architecture|architectural legacy of Georgian]] Ireland was built. In 1782, [[Poynings' Law]] was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.

===Union with Great Britain===
{{Main|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}

In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]], with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Ward 1994 28"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782–1992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=978-0-8132-0784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.&lt;ref name="Ward 1994 28"/&gt; Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united parliament at Westminster]] in [[London]], though resistance remained, as evidenced by [[Robert Emmet]]'s failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1803]].

The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the [[Land War]]. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the [[United Kingdom census, 1841|1841 census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/1841-a-window-on-victorian-britain-475516.html |title=1841: A window on Victorian Britain—This Britain |work=[[The Independent]] |date=25 April 2006 |access-date=16 April 2009 |last=Vallely |first=Paul |location=London |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150617075008/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/1841-a-window-on-victorian-britain-475516.html |archive-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population has never returned to this level since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Quinn |first=Eamon |title=Ireland Learns to Adapt to a Population Growth Spurt |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 August 2007 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/world/europe/19ireland.html?ex=1345176000&amp;en=ab2b49203b6fb511&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |access-date=8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland ([[County Leitrim]]) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so.

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern [[Irish nationalism]], primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

Daniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376–400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the [[Ulster Volunteers]] were formed in 1913 under the leadership of [[Edward Carson]].&lt;ref name="Kee 1972 478–530"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=478–530 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the [[Irish Volunteers]], whose aim was to ensure that the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]] was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers' name, and opposed Ireland's involvement in the war.&lt;ref name="Kee 1972 478–530"/&gt;

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|thumb|Sackville Street (now [[O'Connell Street]]), Dublin, after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia, the [[Irish Citizen Army]]. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for [[Physical force Irish republicanism|Irish republicanism increased]] further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated34"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morough |first=Michael |title=History Review |date=December 2000 |pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-independence republican party, [[Sinn Féin]], received overwhelming endorsement in the [[Irish general election, 1918|general election of 1918]], and in 1919 proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]], setting up its own parliament ([[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]]) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), launched a [[Irish War of Independence|three-year guerrilla war]], which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref name="autogenerated34" /&gt;

===Partition===
{{Main|Partition of Ireland}}

In December 1921, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was concluded between the British government and representatives of the [[Second Dáil]]. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed [[Northern Ireland]] to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, Members of the [[Third Dáil|Free State Parliament]] were required to swear [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State]] and make a statement of faithfulness to the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=719–748 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] between the new government of the [[Irish Free State]] and those opposed to the treaty, led by [[Éamon de Valera]]. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gwynn |first=Stephen |title=Ireland Since the Treaty |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=January 1934 |page=322 |doi=10.2307/20030588|jstor=20030588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Independence====
{{main|History of the Republic of Ireland|Economy of the Republic of Ireland}}
[[File:Anglo-Irish Treaty Griffith annotated2.gif|thumb|Annotated page from the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] that established the [[Irish Free State]] and independence for 26 out of 32 [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]]]]
During its first decade, the newly formed [[Irish Free State]] was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|political circumstances]] to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted.&lt;ref name="autogenerated34"/&gt; This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the [[Republic of Ireland]].

[[Irish neutrality|The state was neutral]] during [[The Emergency (Ireland)|World War II]], but offered [[Irish neutrality during World War II|clandestine assistance to the Allies]], particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland. Despite their country's neutrality, approximately 50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Connolly |first=Kevin |title=Irish who fought on the beaches |work=BBC News Online |date=1 June 2004 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3749629.stm |access-date=8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded [[Victoria Crosses]].

The [[Abwehr]] was also active in Ireland.&lt;ref name="autogenerated695"&gt;Hull, Mark: "The Irish Interlude: German Intelligence in Ireland, 1939–1943", ''Journal of Military History'', Vol. 66, No. 3 (July 2002), pp695–717&lt;/ref&gt; German intelligence operations effectively ended in September 1941 when [[Garda Síochána|police]] made arrests on the basis of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin, including that of the United States. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.&lt;ref name="autogenerated695"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carroll |first=Joseph T. |title=Ireland in the War Years 1939–1945 |publisher=International Scholars Publishers |date=2002 |location=San Francisco |page=190 |isbn=978-1-57309-185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the ''[[Celtic Tiger]]''.&lt;ref name=clancy3&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Clancy |first1=Patrick |first2=Sheelagh |last2=Drudy |first3=Kathleen |last3=Lynch |first4=Liam |last4=O'Dowd |title=Irish Society: Sociological Perspectives |pages=68–70 |publisher=Institute of Public Administration |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-872002-87-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Doris |last=Schmied |title=Winning and Losing: the Changing Geography of Europe's Rural Areas |publisher=Ashgate |location=Chippenham, UK |date=2005 |page=234 |isbn=978-0-7546-4101-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which year the Republic joined the [[euro]].

Social changes also occurred in this time, most markedly with the decline in authority of the Catholic Church. The [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Shawn |last=Pogatchnik |title=Ireland's Economy Suffered Record Slump in 2009 |work=[[Business Week]] |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=6 April 2010 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150208020158/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Measuring Ireland's Progress 2011 |website=CSO.ie |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] |date=October 2012 |page=36 |url= http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/otherreleases/2011/measuringirelandsprogress2011.pdf |issn=1649-6728 |access-date=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
{{Main|History of Northern Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}
Northern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern Ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south.

[[File:Carson signing Solemn League and Covenant.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Carson]] signing the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]] in 1912, declaring opposition to [[Irish Home Rule bills|Home Rule]] "using all means which may be found necessary"]]

Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the Government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|"first-past-the-post"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and [[discrimination]] in housing and employment.&lt;ref name=whyte&gt;{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |title=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968? |access-date=23 October 2008 |last=Whyte |first=John |work=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0 7190 0919 7 |publisher=Manchester University Press |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]|year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0 10 103802 X |date=May 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=[[Northern Ireland Office]] |publisher=Her Magesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass [[civil rights]] protests, which were often confronted by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] counter-protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=1997 |title=Provos: The IRA and Sinn Féin |pages=33–56 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-7475-3392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=1997 |title=Provos: The IRA and Sinn Féin |pages=56–100 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-7475-3392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Ireland government requested the [[British Army]] to aid the police and protect the [[Irish Nationalist]] population. In 1969, the [[paramilitary]] [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]], which favoured the creation of a [[united Ireland]], emerged from a split in the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] and began a campaign against what it called the "British occupation of the six counties".

Other groups, on both the unionist side and the nationalist side, participated in violence and a period known as [[the Troubles]] began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/467904.stm |title=Turning the pages on lost lives |work=BBC News Online |access-date=4 January 2010 |date=8 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the [[British government]] suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the [[Her Majesty's Government|British]] and [[Government of Ireland|Irish]] governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.

The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Tauno |last=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D. Sens |title=Independent International Commission on Decommissioning |format=PDF |access-date=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) and began withdrawing troops.
On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, [[Martin McGuinness]], shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.

==Politics==
[[File:Map of Ireland's capitals.png|thumb|Political map of Ireland, showing the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland]]
{{main|Politics of Ireland}}

Politically, the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent [[Sovereign state|state]], and Northern Ireland (a constituent country of the [[United Kingdom]]). They share an [[Irish border|open border]] and both are part of the [[Common Travel Area]].

Both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the [[European Union]], having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community [EEC], in 1973, and as a consequence there is [[internal market|free movement of people, goods, services and capital]] across the border.

===Republic of Ireland===
{{main|Republic of Ireland}}
[[File:Áras an Uachtaráin 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Áras an Uachtaráin]], the official residence of the [[President of Ireland]]]]

The Republic of Ireland is a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the British model, with a [[Constitution of Ireland|written constitution]] and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The [[Government of Ireland|government]] is headed by a prime minister, the [[Taoiseach]], who is appointed by the [[President of Ireland|President]] on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]]. Members of the government are chosen from both the Dáil and the upper house of parliament, the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]]. Its capital is [[Dublin]].

The Republic today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of [[GDP per capita]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country Comparison: GDP&amp;nbsp;– per capita (PPP) |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Ireland&amp;countryCode=ei&amp;regionCode=eur&amp;rank=27#ei |website=World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 was ranked the sixth most developed nation in the world by the United Nations' [[Human Development Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2015_human_development_report.pdf |page=47 |title=Human Development Report 2015: Table A1.1 |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) |date=2015 |website=Human Development Index and its components |access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A period of rapid economic expansion from 1995 onwards became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, was brought to an end in 2008 with an unprecedented [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] and an economic depression in 2009.

===Northern Ireland===
{{main|Northern Ireland}}
[[File:StormontCarson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]], in [[Stormont Estate]], seat of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]]]

Northern Ireland is a part of the [[United Kingdom]] with a local [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|assembly]] which exercise devolved powers. The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy-first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion with each party's representation in the assembly. Its capital is Belfast.

Ultimately political power is held by the [[UK government]], from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' 650 MPs. The [[Northern Ireland Secretary]] is a cabinet-level post in the British government.

Along with [[England and Wales]] and [[Scotland]], Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] as their court of final appeal.

===All-island institutions===
As part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]], the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The [[North/South Ministerial Council]] is an institution through which ministers from the [[Government of Ireland]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island "implementation bodies" and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: [[Waterways Ireland]], the [[Food Safety Promotion Board]], [[InterTradeIreland]], the [[Special European Union Programmes Body]], [[the North/South Language Body]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights|Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission]].

The [[British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matter of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, "regular and frequent" meetings co-chaired by the ROI Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved [[all-Ireland]] issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.

The [[North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association]] is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.

==Economy==

{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland}}
{{See also|International Financial Services Centre}}
Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the [[euro]] and [[pound sterling]]), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions' shared membership of the [[European Union]], and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an "all-Ireland economy" to take advantage of [[economies of scale]] and boost competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081028204341/http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf |archive-date=28 October 2008 |url= http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf |date=2006 |title=National Competitiveness Council Submission on the National Development Plan 2007–2013 |publisher=National Competitiveness Council |dead-url=yes |access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two multi-city regions on the island of Ireland:
# [[Dublin-Belfast corridor]] - 3.3 m
# [[Cork-Limerick-Galway corridor]] - 1 m

Ireland has an ancient industry based on [[peat]] (known locally as "turf") as a source of energy for home fires. A form of [[biomass]] energy, this source of heat is still widely used in [[rural]] areas. However, due to the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity, the EU is attempting to protect this habitat by fining Ireland if they are dug up. In cities, heat is generally supplied by [[heating oil]], although some urban suppliers distribute "sods of turf" as "smokeless fuel".

An area in which the island operates as a single market is [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sem-o.com/AboutSEMO/Pages/default.aspx |title=About SEMO: The Single Electricity Market |publisher=Single Electricity Market Operator (SEMO) |access-date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of their existence [[electricity network]]s in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-transmission-network-interconnection.aspx |title=Interconnection |publisher=Commission for Energy Regulation |date=28 January 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110128172244/http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-transmission-network-interconnection.aspx |archive-date=28 January 2011 |access-date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying [[Northern Ireland Electricity]] (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the [[ESB Group|ESB]] has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. [[EirGrid]] is building a [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interconnection: East-West Interconnector |publisher=[[EirGrid]] |date= |url= http://www.eirgridgroup.com/customer-and-industry/interconnection/ |access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.

As with electricity, the [[natural gas]] distribution network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking [[Gormanston, County Meath]], and [[Ballyclare]], [[County Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 November 2007 |title=Bord Gáis Marks Completion of South-North Pipeline |publisher=[[Bord Gáis]] |url= http://www.bordgais.ie/corporate/index.jsp?a=1427&amp;n=179&amp;p=180 |access-date=27 May 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052102/http://www.bordgais.ie/corporate/index.jsp?a=1427&amp;n=179&amp;p=180 |archive-date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between [[Twynholm]] in [[Scotland]] and [[Ballylumford power station|Ballylumford]], County Antrim and [[Loughshinny]], [[County Dublin]].

The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over [[Corrib gas controversy|a controversial decision]] to refine the gas onshore.

The Republic has a strong commitment to renewable energy, and ranks as one of the top 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index.&lt;ref name=ggei&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Global Green Economy Index |url= http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-Report2014.pdf |publisher=Dual Citizen LLC |access-date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research and development in [[renewable energy]] such as [[wind power]] has increased since 2004. Large [[wind farm]]s have been constructed in Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom consider the [[wind turbine]]s to be unsightly. The Republic is hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's [[Turlough Hill]] facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Options For Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets And Programmes issued by Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources |publisher=Hibernian Wind Power Ltd |date=27 February 2004 |url= http://www.hibernianwindpower.ie/hiberwindresponse_dcmnr.pdf |access-date=11 November 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120317020157/http://www.hibernianwindpower.ie/hiberwindresponse_dcmnr.pdf |archive-date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland is located in the [[North-West Europe|north-west of Europe]], between latitudes [[51st parallel north|51°]] and [[56th parallel north|56° N]], and longitudes [[11th meridian west|11°]] and [[5th meridian west|5° W]]. It is separated from Great Britain by the [[Irish Sea]] and the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]], which has a width of {{convert|23|km}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Across the waters |last1=Ritchie |first1=Heather |last2=Ellis |first2=Geraint |date=2009 |url= http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/atw_north_channel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to the south is the [[Celtic Sea]], which lies between Ireland and [[Brittany]], in France. Ireland has a total area of {{convert|84421|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="irlgeog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="royle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.osi.ie/Education/Secondary-Schools/Teacher-Resources/Area-and-Land-Mass.aspx |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121110132721/http://osi.ie/Education/Secondary-Schools/Teacher-Resources/Area-and-Land-Mass.aspx |dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 November 2012 |title=Area and Land Mass |website=Ordnance Survey of Ireland |access-date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ireland Facts, Ireland Flag |url= http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/ireland-facts/ |website=NationalGeographic.com |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the [[British Isles]]. As [[British Isles naming dispute|the term British Isles is controversial]] in relation to Ireland, the alternate term ''Britain and Ireland'' is often used as a neutral term for the islands.

A ring of coastal mountains surround low [[plain]]s at the centre of the island. The highest of these is [[Carrauntoohil]] ({{lang-ga|Corrán Tuathail}}) in [[County Kerry]], which rises to {{convert|1038|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="OSI faqs"/&gt; The most arable land lies in the province of [[Leinster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Victor |last=Meally |title=Encyclopaedia of Ireland |publisher=Allen Figgis &amp; Co. |location=Dublin |date=1968 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western areas can be mountainous and rocky with green [[panorama|panoramic vistas]]. The [[River Shannon]], the island's longest river at {{convert|386|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long, rises in [[County Cavan]] in the north west and flows {{convert|113|km|mi}} to [[Limerick]] city in the mid west.&lt;ref name="OSI faqs"&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ: What is the longest river in Ireland? |publisher=[[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] |url= http://www.osi.ie/education/schools-and-third-level/secondary-schools/secondary-schools-teacher-resources/ |access-date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Landscape of the River |publisher=Inland Waterways Association of Ireland |date=2014 |url= http://www.iwai.ie/maps/shannon/guide/17.php3 |access-date=30 May 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319000141/http://www.iwai.ie/maps/shannon/guide/17.php3 |archive-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island consists of varied [[geologic province|geological provinces]]. In the west, around County Galway and [[County Donegal]], is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of [[Caledonides|Caledonide]] affinity, similar to the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to [[Longford]] and south to [[Navan]] is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the [[Southern Uplands]] province of [[Scotland]]. Further south, along the [[County Wexford]] coastline, is an area of granite [[intrusion|intrusives]] into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geology of Ireland |website=Geology for Everyone |publisher=Geological Survey of Ireland |url= http://www.gsi.ie/Education/Geology+for+Everyone/Geology+of+Ireland.htm |access-date=5 November 2008 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327113851/http://www.gsi.ie/Education/Geology%2Bfor%2BEveryone/Geology%2Bof%2BIreland.htm |archive-date=27 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bedrock Geology of Ireland |website=Geology for Everyone |publisher=Geological Survey of Ireland |url= http://www.gsi.ie/NR/rdonlyres/0302F251-C4ED-4938-BCF0-CF228A3E8F6A/0/GSI_GeolIreland_A4.pdf |access-date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Ireland}}

The island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the [[sobriquet]] ''the Emerald Isle''. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.&lt;ref name="MEclimate"&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher=Met Éireann|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north [[County Galway]] and east [[County Mayo]] have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.&lt;ref name="MErainfall"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher=Met Éireann |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.

Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing {{nowrap|0&amp;nbsp;°C}} {{nowrap|(32&amp;nbsp;°F)}} at inland [[weather station]]s, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, [[2003 European heat wave|2003]], [[2006 European heat wave#Ireland|2006]], 2013 and [[2018 British Isles heat wave|2018]]. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during [[Winter of 2010–11 in Great Britain and Ireland|the winter of 2010/11]]. Temperatures fell as low as −17.2&amp;nbsp;°C (1&amp;nbsp;°F) in County Mayo on 20 December&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/subzero-temperatures-make-2010-a-recordbreaking-year-26609480.html |title=Sub-zero temperatures make 2010 a record-breaking year |first=Kevin |last=Keane |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=28 December 2010 |access-date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to a metre (3&amp;nbsp;ft) of snow fell in mountainous areas.

Because Ireland became isolated from [[mainland Europe]] by rising sea levels before the last ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe.

Aquatic wildlife, such as species of [[sea turtle]], [[shark]], [[Earless seal|seal]], [[whale]], and [[dolphin]], are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the [[barn swallow]].

Several different [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]], [[conifer]] plantations, [[peat]] [[bogs]] and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,&lt;ref name="www2000"&gt;{{cite web |title=Land cover and land use |website=Environmental Assessment |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency [Ireland] |location=Wexford |date=2011 |url= http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/ |access-date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large [[apex predator]]s in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual [[culling]].

There are no snakes in Ireland and only one species of reptile (the [[Viviparous lizard|common lizard]]) is native to the island. Extinct species include the [[Irish elk]], the [[great auk]], [[brown bear]] and the [[Wolves in Ireland|wolf]]. Some previously extinct birds, such as the [[golden eagle]], been reintroduced in about the year 2000 after decades of [[Local extinction|extirpation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/indicators/epa_indicators_2002.pdf |title=Environment in Focus 2002: Key Environmental Indicators for Ireland |editor1=M Lehane |editor2=O Le Bolloch |editor3=P Crawley |access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until medieval times Ireland was heavily forested with [[oak]], [[pine]] and [[birch]].

Gorse (''[[Ulex europaeus]]''), a wild [[furze]], is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been "invaded" by some grasses, such as ''[[Spartina anglica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hackney |first=Paul |url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/invasive/species.asp?item=2680 |title=Spartina Anglica |website=Invasive Alien Species in Northern Ireland |access-date=1 January 2009 |publisher=National Museums Northern Ireland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519055358/http://www.habitas.org.uk/invasive/species.asp?item=2680 |archive-date=19 May 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Codium fragile]]'' ssp. ''fragile'' (formerly reported as ssp. ''tomentosum''), now well established.

''Codium fragile'' ssp. ''atlanticum'' has been established to be native, although for many years it was regarded as an alien species.

Because of its mild climate, many species, including [[subtropics|sub-tropical]] species such as [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], are grown in Ireland. [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The island itself can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.

===Impact of agriculture===
[[File:Pasture at the Viewpoint - geograph.org.uk - 15065.jpg|thumb|[[Bantry]], [[County Cork]]]]
The long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems and have placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarecoco.ie/water-waste-environment/biodiversity/ |title=Biodiversity |publisher=Clare County Council |access-date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf |title=Otter Lutra Lutra |website=Northern Ireland Species Action Plan |publisher=Environment and Heritage Service |format=PDF |date=2007 |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/5mXYPjgV5?url=http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf |archive-date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.&lt;ref name="cap_reforms"&gt;{{cite web |title=CAP Reform—A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, most of it designated for commercial production.&lt;ref name="www2000"/&gt; Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the [[Killarney National Park]]. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by [[Deer of Ireland|deer]] and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Dick |last=Roche |author-link=Dick Roche |title=National Parks |publisher=[[Seanad Éireann]] |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0185/S.0185.200611080008.html |volume=185 |date=8 November 2006 |access-date=30 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091047/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0185/S.0185.200611080008.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }} [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] Debate involving Former Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt;

People have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years. The different eras are termed [[mesolithic]], [[neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]].

Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the [[Cruthin]], [[Corcu Loígde]], [[Dál Riata]], [[Dáirine]], [[Deirgtine]], [[Delbhna]], [[Érainn]], [[Laigin]], [[Ulaid]]. Slightly later major groups included the [[Connachta]], [[Ciannachta]], [[Eóganachta]].

Smaller groups included the aithechthúatha (see [[Attacotti]]), [[Cálraighe]], [[Cíarraige]], [[Conmaicne]], [[Dartraighe]], [[Déisi]], [[Éile]], [[Fir Bolg]], [[Fortuatha]], [[Gailenga]], [[Gamanraige]], [[Mairtine]], [[Múscraige]], [[Partraige]], [[Soghain]], [[Uaithni]], [[Uí Maine]], [[Uí Liatháin]]. Many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically unimportant.

Over the past 1200 years, [[Vikings]], [[Normans]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Flemings]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[English people|English]], [[Africans]], [[Eastern Europeans]] and [[South Americans]] have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture.

Ireland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]]. The largest denomination is [[Roman Catholicism]] representing over 73% for the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various [[Protestant]] denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland).&lt;ref name="niprotestants"&gt;{{Cite news |last=McKittrick |first=David |title=Census Reveals Northern Ireland's Protestant Population is at Record Low |work=[[The Independent]] |date=19 December 2002 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html |access-date=30 December 2009 |location=London |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110624101635/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html |archive-date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest is the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]]. The [[Islam in Ireland|Muslim community]] is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Counihan |first=Patrick |title=Divorce rates soar in Ireland as population continues to expand |publisher=Irish Central |date=30 March 2012 |url= http://www.irishcentral.com/news/divorce-rates-soar-in-ireland-as-population-continues-to-expand-145121415-237438531 |access-date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island has a small [[History of the Jews in Ireland|Jewish community]]. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population&lt;ref name="niprotestants" /&gt; describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the [[Irish Times]],&lt;!-- Republic of Ireland only? --&gt; 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week.

The population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the [[Irish Famine (1740–41)|Famine of 1740-41]], which killed roughly two fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but another devastating [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.

===Divisions and settlements===
{{Further|Provinces of Ireland|Counties of Ireland|City status in Ireland}}

Traditionally, Ireland is subdivided into [[Provinces of Ireland|four provinces]]: [[Connacht]] (west), [[Leinster]] (east), [[Munster]] (south), and [[Ulster]] (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Crawford |first=John |title=Anglicizing the Government of Ireland: The Irish Privy Council and the Expansion of Tudor Rule 1556–1578 |publisher=Irish Academic Press |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-7165-2498-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland has [[Counties of Ireland|32 traditional counties]]. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland and [[Counties of Northern Ireland|six are in Northern Ireland]]. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, ''Ulster'' is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.

In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example postal addresses and by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]]. Counties in Northern Ireland are [[Local government in Northern Ireland|no longer used]] for local governmental purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gazetteer.co.uk/section1.htm |title=The Gazetteer of British Place Names: Main features of the Gazetteer |website=Gazetteer of British Place Names |publisher=Association of British Counties |access-date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/destinationNI/ |title=NI by County |website=Discover Northern Ireland |publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board |access-date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City status in Ireland is decided by [[legislation|legislative]] or [[royal charter]]. [[Dublin]], with over 1 million residents in the [[Greater Dublin Area]], is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, [[Armagh]], with 14,590 is the seat of the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Primate of All Ireland]] and was re-granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994 (having lost that status in [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840|local government reforms of 1840]]). In the Republic of Ireland, [[Kilkenny]], seat of the [[Butler dynasty]], while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 [[Local Government Act 2001|Local Government Act]]), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.

===Migration===
[[File:Population of Ireland since 1500.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The population of Ireland since 1603 showing the consequence of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine (1845–52)]] (Note: figures before 1841 are contemporary estimates)]]

The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was due to death from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.

Emigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, where a large [[Irish diaspora]] lives. {{As of|2006}}, 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, are of Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories—20% sample data]".

The Protestants' ancestors arrived primarily in the colonial era, while Catholics are primarily descended from immigrants of the 19th century. Irish leaders have been prominent in the Catholic Church in the United States for over 150 years. The Irish have been leaders in the [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodism#United States|Methodist]] traditions, as well.&lt;ref name=carroll&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael P. |last=Carroll |title=How the Irish Became Protestant in America |journal=Religion and American Culture |year=2006 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=25–54 |doi=10.1525/rac.2006.16.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys in the 1990s show that of Americans who identify themselves as "Irish", 51% said they were Protestant and 36% identified as Catholic. In the South, Protestants account for 73% of those claiming Irish origins, while Catholics account for 19%. In the North, 45% of those claiming Irish origin are Catholic, while 39% are Protestant.&lt;ref name=carroll /&gt; Many [[African American]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s claim Irish Protestant or Scots-Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scotch Irish Foodways in America: Recipes from History|author=M.M.

With growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the [[European Union]] expanded to include [[Poland]] in 2004, [[Polish people]] have made up the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin| author-link=Kevin Sullivan (journalist) |title=Hustling to Find Classrooms For All in a Diverse Ireland |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=24 October 2007 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/23/AR2007102302162_pf.html |access-date=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Central Europe]].

[[File:Irish speakers in 2011.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Proportion of respondents who said they could speak Irish in the Ireland census in 2011 or the Northern Ireland census in 2011]]
The two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Hiberno-English|English]]. Each language has produced a noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for over two thousand years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.

The Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries, and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.

The [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early twentieth century has had a long-term influence. There is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoirí) in both the Republic and [[Northern Ireland]], especially in Dublin and [[Belfast]]. They represent an expanding demographic, with their own schools (called [[Gaelscoil|''Gaelscoileanna'']]) and their own social media. It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, with better employment prospects and higher social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market |journal=The Economic and Social Review |volume=40 |date=2009 |pages=435–460 |url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html |via=Ideas.epec.org |access-date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cso.ie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile9/Profile,9,What,we,know,Press,Statement.pdf |title=Press Statement: Census 2011 Results |website=CSO.ie |publisher=Central Statistics Office |date=22 November 2012 |location=Dublin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328211550/http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile9/Profile,9,What,we,know,Press,Statement.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |access-date=6 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |first==Brian |last=Ó Broin |title=Schism fears for Gaeilgeoirí |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0116/1224262447899.html |work=[[Irish Times]] |access-date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish is also taught in mainstream English-speaking schools as a compulsory subject, but has been criticised for its ineffectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional rural Irish-speaking areas, known collectively as the [[Gaeltacht]], are in linguistic decline. The main Gaeltacht areas are in the west, south-west and north-west. They are to be found in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry with smaller Gaeltacht areas near [[Dungarvan]] in Waterford, [[Navan]], in Meath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where are Ireland's Gaeltacht areas? |website=FAQ |publisher=[[Údarás na Gaeltachta]] |date=2015 |url= http://www.udaras.ie/en/faoin-laithrean-seo/ceisteanna-coitianta |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hiberno-English|English in Ireland]] was first introduced during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]]. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely replaced by Irish before the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Spolsky |first=Bernard |title=Language policy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |page=191 |isbn=9780521011754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 10% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 15: Irish speakers aged 3 years and over in each Province, County and City, classified by frequency of speaking Irish, 2006 |website=Census 2006 |volume=Volume 9—Irish Language |publisher=Central Statistics Office |url=http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639 |access-date=9 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227165829/http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639 |archivedate=27 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as "Irish speakers". In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language, but official recognition is afforded to Irish, including specific protective measures under Part III of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. A lesser status (including recognition under Part II of the Charter) is given to [[Ulster Scots dialects]], which are spoken by roughly 2% of Northern Ireland residents, and also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/USPKULST.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 1999 |publisher=Access Research Knowledge Northern Ireland (Queen's University Belfast / Ulster University) |date=9 May 2003 |access-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.

Ireland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]], [[Anglicisation]], [[Americanisation]] and aspects of broader [[European culture]]). In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the [[Celtic nations]] of Europe, alongside [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Isle of Man]] and [[Brittany]]. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed ''Irish [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlace]]'' or ''[[Celtic knot]]work.'' These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art,&lt;ref name="BBC 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tionchar na gCeilteach |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/irish/articles/view/720/english/ |access-date=23 January 2010 |date=23 May 2009 |work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the distinctive style of [[traditional Irish music]] and dance, and has become indicative of modern "Celtic" culture in general.

[[Religion in Ireland|Religion]] has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century [[Plantations of Ireland|plantations]], has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland's pre-Christian heritage fused with the [[Celtic Church]] following the missions of [[Saint Patrick]] in the 5th century. The [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]s, begun by the Irish monk Saint [[Columba]], spread the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish vision of Christianity]] to [[pagan]] [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and the [[Frankish Empire]]. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] that followed the [[fall of Rome]], earning Ireland the sobriquet, "the island of saints and scholars".

Since the 20th century the [[Irish pub]]s worldwide have become, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings, outposts of Irish culture.

The Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the [[Abbey Theatre]], which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is [[An Taibhdhearc]], which was established in 1928 in [[Galway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stair na Taibhdheirce |publisher=An Taibhdheirce |date=2014 |url= http://antaibhdhearc.com/theatre-info/fuinn/ |access-date= 28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Taibhdhearc |publisher=Fodor's |url= http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands |access-date=4 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141002060446/http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands/ |archive-date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwrights such as [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Conor McPherson]] and [[Billy Roche]] are internationally renowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Houston |first=Eugenie |title=Working and Living in Ireland |publisher=Working and Living Publications |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-9536896-8-2 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literature====
Ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.
Irish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include [[Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh]] (fourteenth century), [[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]] (seventeenth century) and [[Aogán Ó Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). [[Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill]] (c. 1743 – c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of a modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]], [[Máire Mhac an tSaoi]] and others. Irish-language publishers such as [[Coiscéim]] and [[Cló Iar-Chonnacht]] continue to produce scores of titles every year.

In English, [[Jonathan Swift]] (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745), often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable eighteenth century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.

In the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as "[[Bloomsday]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable writer in Irish is Máirtín Ó Cadhain, whose novel [[Cré na Cille]] is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.

Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as [[Máirtín Ó Direáin]] and others from the [[Gaeltacht]].

====Music====
Music has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the [[early Middle Ages]] the church was "quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe",&lt;ref&gt;Brannon, Patrick V.: "Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Ann: "Medieval Ireland, Music in", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.

Irish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26–30 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like [[Seán Ó Riada]] and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.

====Art====
The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as [[John Butler Yeats]], [[William Orpen]], [[Jack Yeats]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]]. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include [[Sean Scully]], [[Kevin Abosch]], and [[Alice Maher]].

===Science===
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] formulated Boyle's Law.]]
The Irish philosopher and theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages. Sir [[Ernest Henry Shackleton]], an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]] and the discovery of the approximate location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[Robert Boyle]] was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early [[gentleman scientist]]. He is largely regarded one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of [[Boyle's law]].&lt;ref name="ucc boyle boi"&gt;{{cite web |last=Reville |first=William |title=Ireland's Scientific Heritage |website=Understanding Science: Famous Irish Scientists |publisher=[[University College Cork]], Faculty of Science |date=14 December 2000 |url= http://undersci.ucc.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2014/11/Robert_Boyle.pdf |access-date=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th century physicist, [[John Tyndall]], discovered the [[Tyndall effect]]. [[Father Nicholas Joseph Callan]], Professor of Natural Philosophy in [[Maynooth College]], is best known for his invention of the [[induction coil]], [[transformer]] and he discovered an early method of [[galvanisation]] in the 19th century.

Other notable Irish [[physicists]] include [[Ernest Walton]], winner of the 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. With [[Sir John Douglas Cockcroft]], he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of [[wave equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1951/press.html?print=1 |title=Nobel Prize in Physics 1951 – Presentation Speech |first=Professor I. |last=Waller |website=NobelPrize.org |publisher=Alfred Nobel Memorial Foundation |date=1951 |access-date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Thomson, or [[Lord Kelvin]], is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the [[kelvin]], is named after. Sir [[Joseph Larmor]], a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.&lt;ref name="physicsworld"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Mark |last=McCartney |title=William Thomson: king of Victorian physics |work=[[Physics World]] |url= http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/16484 |date=1 December 2002 |access-date=22 November 2008}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Johnstone Stoney]] introduced the term ''[[electron]]'' in 1891. [[John Stewart Bell]] was the originator of [[Bell's Theorem]] and a paper concerning the discovery of the [[Chiral anomaly|Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly]] and was nominated for a Nobel prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Bell: Belfast street named after physicist who proved Einstein wrong |work=BBC News Online |date=19 February 2015 |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-31536765 |access-date=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], from [[Lurgan]], [[County Armagh]], discovered pulsars in 1967. Notable mathematicians include Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], famous for work in [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical mechanics]] and the invention of [[quaternions]]. [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]]'s contribution of the [[Edgeworth Box]] remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while [[Richard Cantillon]] inspired [[Adam Smith]], among others. [[John B. Cosgrave]] was a specialist in [[number theory]] and discovered a 2000-digit [[prime number]] in 1999 and a record composite [[Fermat number]] in 2003. [[John Lighton Synge]] made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] as one of his students. [[Kathleen Lonsdale]], born in Ireland and most known for her work with [[X-ray crystallography|crystallography]], became the first female president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.science.ie/features/archived-feature-articles/five-irish-scientists.html |title=Five Irish Scientists Who Put Chemistry on the Map |work=Science.ie |publisher=Science Foundation Ireland |access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and the [[University College Dublin]], as well as numerous third-level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the [[Open University in Ireland]].

The island fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name "Ireland" until the 1950s. The sport is also the most notable exception where the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] field separate international teams. Northern Ireland has produced two World Snooker Champions.

[[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]] are the best-known of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as [[Gaelic games]]. Gaelic games are governed by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA), with the exception of ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crokepark.ie/ |title=Croke Park. Not just a venue. A destination |publisher=Croke Park Stadium / Gaelic Athletic Association |access-date=3 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; capacity [[Croke Park]] in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]. During the redevelopment of the [[Lansdowne Road|Lansdowne Road stadium]] in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501459.html |title=For First Time, Croke Park Is Ireland's Common Ground |date=6 February 2007 |access-date=14 August 2008 |work=The Washington Post |first=Michael |last=Moynihan}}&lt;/ref&gt; All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.

The [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921–1930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=222&amp;Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.

[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]
In 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as "[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]" and that the IFA's team be known as "[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]]. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]] in [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988]], [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]]. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the [[Premier League|English]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] soccer leagues.

Unlike soccer, Ireland continues to field a single [[Ireland national rugby union team|national rugby team]] and a single association, the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU), governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every [[Rugby World Cup]], making the quarter-finals in six of them. Ireland also hosted games during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]]s (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the [[Pro14]] and at least three compete for the [[Heineken Cup]]. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] ([[1998–99 Heineken Cup|1999]]),&lt;ref name="heineken champions archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.ercrugby.com/heinekencup/champions.php |title=Champions of Europe |publisher=European Club Rugby |website=ERCRugby.com |date=2014 |access-date=4 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080223/http://archive.ercrugby.com/heinekencup/champions.php |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] ([[2005–06 Heineken Cup|2006]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/european/4998452.stm |title=Munster 23-19 Biarritz |work=BBC News Online |date=20 May 2006 |access-date=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2007–08 Heineken Cup|2008]])&lt;ref name="heineken champions archive"/&gt; and [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] ([[2008–09 Heineken Cup|2009]], [[2010–11 Heineken Cup|2011]] and [[2011–12 Heineken Cup|2012]])&lt;ref name="heineken champions archive"/&gt; have won the Heineken Cup. In addition to this, the Irish International side has had increased success in the [[Six Nations Championship]] against the other European elite sides. This success, including [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crowns]] in 2004, 2006 and 2007, culminated with a clean sweep of victories, known as a [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]], in 2009 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/17274833 |title=Six Nations roll of honour |work=BBC News Online |date=2014 |access-date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irl-Sligo horse racing.jpg|thumb|[[Horse racing]] in [[Sligo]]]]
[[Horse racing]] and [[greyhound racing]] are both popular in Ireland. There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended. The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=FGS Consulting |title=Review of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund |publisher=Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism |date=May 2009 |page=11 |url= http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/DAST_%20Review_of_H%20_GFund%20_FGS_Final_May%2009.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=29 March 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073729/http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/DAST_%20Review_of_H%20_GFund%20_FGS_Final_May%2009.pdf |archive-date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the [[County Kildare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.curragh.ie/about-us/history-of-the-curragh/ |title=Kildare at the heart of the Irish bloodstock industry |publisher=The Curragh Racecourse |access-date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish athletics has seen a heightened success rate since the year 2000, with [[Sonia O'Sullivan]] winning two medals at 5,000 metres on the track; gold at the 1995 [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] and silver at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]]. [[Gillian O'Sullivan]] won silver in the 20k walk at the 2003 World Championships, while sprint hurdler [[Derval O'Rourke]] won gold at the 2006 World Indoor Championship in [[Moscow]]. Olive Loughnane won a silver medal in the 20k walk in the World Athletics Championships in Berlin in 2009.

Ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other Olympic sport. Boxing is governed by the [[Irish Athletic Boxing Association]]. [[Michael Carruth]] won a [[gold medal]] and [[Wayne McCullough]] won a [[silver medal]] in the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympic Games]]. In 2008 Kenneth Egan won a silver medal in the Beijing Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0824/107262-olympic/ |title=RTÉ News: Irish boxer loses out on Olympic gold |work=RTÉ News |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |date=28 August 2008 |access-date=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paddy Barnes]] secured bronze in those games and gold in the [[2010 European Amateur Boxing Championships]] (where Ireland came 2nd in the overall medal table) and [[2010 Commonwealth Games]].

Three golfers from Northern Ireland have been particularly successful. In 2010, [[Graeme McDowell]] became the first Irish golfer to win the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and the first European to win that tournament since 1970. [[Rory McIlroy]], at the age of 22, won the 2011 U.S. Open, while [[Darren Clarke]]'s latest victory was the [[2011 Open Championship]] at Royal St. George's. In August 2012, McIlroy won his 2nd major championship by winning the USPGA Championship by a record margin of 8 shots.

====Recreation====
The west coast of Ireland, [[Lahinch]] and [[Donegal Bay]] in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best [[wreck dives]] being in [[Malin Head]] and off the [[County Cork]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McDaid |first=Brendan |url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/shipwrecks-ahoy-in-area-28256564.html |title=Shipwrecks ahoy in area |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=9 June 2004 |access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With thousands of lakes, over {{convert|14000|km|mi|-2}} of fish bearing rivers and over {{convert|3700|km|mi|-1}} of coastline, Ireland is a popular [[angling]] destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While [[salmon]] and [[trout]] fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon [[driftnet]] fishery. [[Coarse fishing]] continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info |access-date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the range of sea angling species is around 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sea Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea |access-date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and drink===
{{main|Irish cuisine}}
[[File:Cheese 61 bg 080106.jpg|thumb|[[Gubbeen cheese]], an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making]]
Food and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the [[crops]] grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.&lt;ref name="food_companion" &gt;{{Cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Davidson |first2=Tom |last2=Jaine |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2006 |pages=407–408 |isbn=978-0-19-280681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.&lt;ref name="food_companion" /&gt;

For this reason, pork and [[white meat]] were more common than beef and thick fatty strips of salted [[bacon]] (known as rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="food_companion" /&gt; The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]) was common&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The History and Social Influence of the Potato |first1=Redcliffe Nathan |last1=Salaman |first2=William Glynn |last2=Burton |first3=John Gregory |last3=Hawkes |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1985 |pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[black pudding]], made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the "[[breakfast roll]]".

The introduction of the [[potato]] in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid-19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Garrow |first=John |title=Feast and Famine: a History of Food and Nutrition in Ireland 1500–1920 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=160–161 |date=March 2002 |issn=1758-1095 |pmc=1279494 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.3.160}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat {{convert|18|st|kg}} of potatoes a week.&lt;ref name="food_companion" /&gt; Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking, such as the [[Irish stew]], [[bacon and cabbage]], [[boxty]], a type of potato pancake, or [[colcannon]], a dish of [[mashed potatoes]] and [[kale]] or [[cabbage]].&lt;ref name="food_companion" /&gt;

Since the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a "New Irish Cuisine" based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ireland for Dummies |first=Elizabeth |last=Albertson |publisher=Wiley Publishing |location=Hoboken |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-10572-6 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ireland |first=Fionn |last=Davenport |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=London |date=2008 |isbn=978-1-74104-696-0 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[oyster]]s, [[mussel]]s and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made [[List of Irish cheeses|cheeses]] that are now being produced across the country. An example of this new cuisine is "Dublin Lawyer": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dublin |first1=Fionn |last1=Davenport |last2=Smith |first2=Jonathan |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=London |date=2006 |isbn=978-1-74104-710-3 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita&lt;ref name="food_companion" /&gt; consumers of potatoes in Europe. Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example [[coddle]] in Dublin or [[drisheen]] in Cork, both a type of sausage, or [[blaa]], a doughy white bread particular to [[Waterford]].

Ireland once dominated the world's market for [[whiskey]], producing 90% of the world's whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the [[prohibition in the United States]] (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture |first=W.

Irish whiskey, as researched in 2009 by the CNBC American broadcaster, remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades.&lt;ref name="not_luck"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Irish Whiskey's Growth Not Just About Luck| date=19 March 2009 |first=Christina |last=Berk |url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/29636538 |publisher=CNBC |access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically CNBC states Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a [[Scotch whisky]], but not as sweet as [[American whiskey|American]] or [[Canadian whiskey|Canadian]] whiskies.&lt;ref name="not_luck"/&gt; Whiskey forms the basis of traditional [[Irish Cream|cream liqueurs]], such as [[Baileys Irish Cream|Baileys]], and the "[[Irish coffee]]" (a [[cocktail]] of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at [[Foynes|Foynes flying-boat station]]) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.

[[Porter (beer)|Stout]], a kind of [[porter beer]], particularly [[Guinness]], is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with [[London]]. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to [[lager]]. [[Cider]], particularly ''[[Magners]]'' (marketed in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as ''Bulmers''), is also a popular drink. [[Red lemonade]], a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Davenport |first=Fionn |title=Discover Ireland |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=2010 |location=London |page=348 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hhP4ieoRiuIC&amp;pg=PA348 |isbn=978-1-74179-998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4825">[[Image:ITM example.svg|thumb|right|200px|Israeli Transverse Mercator - ITM]]
{{Geodesy}}
'''Israeli Transverse Mercator''' ({{lang-he|רשת ישראל החדשה}} ''Reshet Yisra'el Ha-Ḥadasha''; '''ITM''') is the new [[geographic coordinate system]] for [[Israel]].  The name is derived from the Transverse Mercator projection it uses and the fact that it is optimized for Israel. ITM has replaced the old coordinate system [[Israeli Cassini Soldner|ICS]]. This coordinate system is sometimes also referred as the "New Israeli Grid". It is in use since January 1, 1994.

==The need for a new grid==
ITM replaced the old grid ICS which was based on the Cassini-Soldner projection. The central meridian in the new projection, as in the old one, crosses through Jerusalem. Replacing the projection eliminates two prominent drawbacks in the old network: assigning negative latitudinal values to the Southern Negev and the possibility of confusing coordinate values on the X and Y axes. The new system relocated the Y axis 50&amp;nbsp;km westward and the X axis 500&amp;nbsp;km southward so that now the entire country is covered by positive coordinate values.

Additional information on the creation of the new grid is available in Hebrew&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235338/http://www.mapi.gov.il/images/ct-tm-1024.jpg "New Grid for Israel", in Hebrew], retrieved September 27, 2007, about the New Israeli Grid, published by the Mapping Center of Israel (MAPI) in the [http://www.mapi.gov.il official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

An ITM coordinate is generally given as a pair of two six digit numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[Easting]] and the second is the [[Northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].

The ITM coordinate for the [[Western Wall]] at [[Jerusalem]] is:

:E 222286 m
:N 631556 m

The first figure is the easting and means that the location is 222,286 meters east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 631,556 meters north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]]). Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an “E” and likewise an “N” for the northing. The fact that the coordinate is in meters is indicated by the lowercase m.

The table below shows the same coordinate in 3 different grids:

'''''Jakarta!''''' is the first novel by writer Christophe Dorigné-Thomson, published by the Indonesian media conglomerate [[Kompas Gramedia Group]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.gramediapustakautama.com/buku-detail/86284/Jakarta! Jakarta!], [[Gramedia Pustaka Utama]], 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jakarta!'' was widely promoted in the media&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5WrwrecY_Y Sarah Sechan show], Net TV&lt;/ref&gt; and endorsed by major Indonesian figures such as businessman and owner of football club [[Inter Milan]] [[Erick Thohir]], businessman [[Sandiaga Uno]], politician Irman Gusman, Minister of Education [[Anies Baswedan]] and actor Rio Dewanto.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;

The novel tells the story of a young European who travels the world on missions paid by governments or multinationals to kill high-level targets. The book is in fact a disguised essay on geopolitical shifts and their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/archive/in-new-novel-jakarta-is-the-end-of-an-unlikely-journey/ In New Novel, Jakarta Is the End of An Unlikely Journey], [[The Jakarta Globe]], 01 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">'''Johannes Justus Rein''' (January 27, 1835 in [[Raunheim]], near [[Giessen]] &amp;ndash; January 23, 1918 in [[Bonn]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]], author and traveler in East Asia. On the title page of 
each of his books, his name is given as either J.J. Rein or Johann J. Rein.

==Biography==
He was educated in mathematics and science at the [[University of Giessen]]. He made various scientific journeys in Europe, Asia, and America, and was appointed professor of geography at the [[University of Marburg]] in 1876, and subsequently at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1883).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Rein Rein] Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon&lt;/ref&gt;

Rein spent the first five months of 1874 in Japan, residing in the German Legation in Tokio [Tokyo] and studying [[lacquer]]. After submitting a detailed report on the subject, he traveled throughout Japan.

==Works==
He wrote ''Japan, nach Reisen und Studien'' (2 volumes, 1881–86), which was translated into English, under the title, [https://archive.org/details/japantravelsand00reingoog ''Japan: travels and researches undertaken at the cost of the Prussian government''] (1884), as was also his book on Japanese industries (1889). Another work was ''[[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] und seine vier Reisen nach Westen'' (“Columbus and his four trips to the West,” 1892).&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Johannes_Justus_Rein Johannes Justus Rein] de.Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch came during the period when the [[DPRK]] was commemorating the first anniversary of the death of former leader [[Kim Jong-il]] and just before the first [[South Korea]]n domestic launch of a satellite and the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|South Korean presidential election]] on 19 December 2012. The successful launch makes the DPRK the tenth [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|space power]] capable of putting satellites in orbit using its own launch vehicles.

North Korea declared the launch successful, and the South Korean military and [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) reported that initial indications suggested that an object had achieved orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50167891/ns/technology_and_science-space/|title=North Korea reports successful launch of controversial rocket|publisher=MSN/NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norad.mil/News/2012/121112b.html |title=NORAD acknowledges missile launch |publisher=North American Aerospace Defense Command |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214134546/http://www.norad.mil/News/2012/121112b.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea had previously claimed the [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1]] and [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2]] launches as successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Encyclopedia Astronautica|title=1998.08.31 - Kwangmyŏngsŏng 1|url=http://www.astronautix.com/details/kwa11163.htm|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N.Korea says it successfully launched satellite|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/04/05/idUKSEO88417|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite American military sources claiming that they failed to achieve orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Northern Command|title=NORAD and USNORTHCOM monitor North Korean launch|url=http://www.northcom.mil/News/2009/040509.html|accessdate=15 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017015121/http://www.northcom.mil/News/2009/040509.html|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korea space launch 'fails'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7984254.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Kwangmyŏngsŏng" is richly symbolic for [[North Korean nationalism]] and the [[Kim family cult]]. While Soviet records recount that the late North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] was born in the village of [[Vyatskoye, Khabarovsk Krai|Vyatskoye]] near [[Khabarovsk]] in the [[Russian Far East]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1907197.stm |title=Profile: Kim Jong-il |publisher=BBC News |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DPRK]] internal sources claim that Kim was born on [[Mount Baekdu]] and that on that day a bright [[Celestial navigation|lodestar]] ("kwangmyŏngsŏng") appeared in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldministries.org/prophecynewsarticles/korea_north/120414_US_stops_food_aid_North_Korea_after_rocket_explodes_nkorea.html|title=US stops food aid to North Korea after rocket explodes|last=Wen|first=Philip|date=14 April 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410082751/http://www.worldministries.org/prophecynewsarticles/korea_north/120414_US_stops_food_aid_North_Korea_after_rocket_explodes_nkorea.html|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2 was the fourth North Korean attempt to orbit a satellite, and North Korea claimed that two of the previous launches had placed their payloads into orbit despite several other countries confirming that the launches had failed, and no independent confirmation that the satellite was in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/details/kwa11163.htm|title=1998.08.31 - Kwangmyŏngsŏng 1|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt occurred in August 1998, with a [[Paektusan (rocket)|Baekdusan]] carrier rocket attempting to launch [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1]]; the second occurred in April 2009 with [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2]], and the third in April 2012 with the original [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3]]. The April 2012 launch was the only one which North Korea acknowledged to have failed. However, the launch of Kwangmyongsong 3 Unit 2 made North Korea the tenth country to place a satellite into orbit using an indigenously developed carrier rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/12/12/277669/north-koreas-successfully-launches-satellite/|title=North Korea successfully launches satellite|date=12 December 2012|publisher=PressTV|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rocket was largely made using domestically produced parts and technology; this ability is seen as cause for greater concern over North Korea's ability to develop ballistic missile technology despite sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21115985|title=North Korea rocket was domestically made|publisher=BBC News|date=21 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-launch announcement==
The launch was announced on 1 December 2012, when the [[Korean Central News Agency]] reported that the Korean Committee of Space Technology informed them that they "[plan] to launch another working satellite, second version of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3, manufactured by its own efforts and with its own technology, true to the behests of leader Kim Jong-il," with a prospective launch window of 10–22 December 2012 given. The launcher splashdown zones were reported to the [[International Maritime Organization]], indicating a [[polar orbit]] was intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allthingsnuclear.org/north-korea-gives-location-of-splashdown-zones-begins-assembling-rocket/ |title=North Korea Gives Location of Splashdown Zones, Begins Assembling Rocket |author=David Wright |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2012, KCNA reported that the [[Korean Committee of Space Technology|KCST]] answered the "question raised by KCNA, as regards the launch of the second version of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 satellite" and also reported that the launch period was extended to 29 December 2012.

==Satellite==
North Korea claims the satellite would estimate crop yields and collect weather data as well as assess the country's forest coverage and natural resources. The country also claims that the satellite weighed about 100&amp;nbsp;kg (220&amp;nbsp;lbs) and that its planned lifetime was about two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AdminGMT |url=http://nknews.org/2012/03/n-korea-reveals-details-of-kwangmyŏngsŏng-3-satellite/ |title="N.

[[File:Kwangymyongsong-3-2 gt.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite [[ground track]] of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2, 14 December 2012]]
On 12 December 2012, Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 was launched from the [[Sohae Satellite Launching Station|Sohae Satellite Launching Ground]] at 00:49:46 UTC (09:49 KST).&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korea-launches-long-range-missile/story?id=17939423|title=US Calls North Korea Rocket Launch a 'Provocative Act'|last=Riviera|first=Gloria|author2=Joohee Cho |author3=Akiko Fujita |date=12 December 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Aerospace Defense Command was able to track the rocket at this time. The first stage impacted the ocean {{convert|200|km}} off the west coast of South Korea at 00:58, with the fairing coming down one minute later {{convert|100|km}} downrange.

The satellite was deployed into a [[sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous polar orbit]] with an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|584|km}}, a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|499|km}}, 97.4 degrees of [[orbital inclination]], and an [[orbital period]] of 95 minutes and 29 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/12/how-did-north-korea-fix-its-rocket-program-so-quickly/|title=How did North Korea fix its rocket program so quickly?|last=Fisher|first=Max|date=12 December 2012|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft separated from the rocket's third stage at 00:59:13; nine minutes and 27 seconds after liftoff.

The [[United States Space Command|U.S. Space Command]] began to track three objects from the launch, giving Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 the [[Satellite Catalog Number]] 39026 and the [[international designator]] 2012-072A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/american-space-expert-says-satellite-launch-a-perfect-success-for-north-korea/2012/12/11/4237283e-4411-11e2-8c8f-fbebf7ccab4e_story.html|title=American space expert says satellite launch a 'perfect success for North Korea'|date=11 December 2012|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 December 2012}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later began tracking a fourth object that was related to the launch.

The following day, U.S. officials tracking the satellite reported that it appeared to be "tumbling out of control" in its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/12/15866530-north-korean-satellite-tumbling-out-of-control-us-officials-say?lite North Korean satellite 'tumbling out of control'] – NBCNews.com, 12 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However South Korean sources said that the satellite was orbiting normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korean satellite 'orbiting normally' after rocket launch|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/13/north-korea-satellite-rocket-launch|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 December 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data collected by Spain, Italy and Britain suggest the brightness of the satellite has been fluctuating, which indicates it is tumbling as it orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/18/astronomers-say-apparently-malfunctioning-north-korea-satellite-could-orbit/|title=Astronomers say apparently malfunctioning North Korea satellite could orbit Earth for years|publisher=AP Tokyo/Fox News|date=18 Dec 2012|accessdate=23 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examination===
South Korean missile experts examined components of the missile from the two stages of the rocket that fell back to Earth.  Initially they reported the components were of poor quality and some foreign made.  Further examination revealed that most of the components were produced domestically in North Korea.  They were effective for the launch, but found mostly to be crude, unreliable, and inefficient.  The rocket design was based on older technologies of the 1960s and 70s.  The design of the rocket engine was almost identical to one built in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htspace/20130131.aspx We Did It Ourselves] – Strategypage.com, 31 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
At noon local time, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] released a news report on the launch:
{{Quotation
|Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The second version of satellite Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 successfully lifted off from the Sohae Space Center in Cholsan County, North Phyongan Province by carrier rocket Unha-3 on Wednesday.

The satellite entered its preset orbit.|KCNA
}}

The report was followed by a more detailed report later in the afternoon stating:
{{Quotation
|Scientists and technicians of the DPRK successfully launched the second version of satellite Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 into its orbit by carrier rocket Unha-3, true to the last instructions of leader Kim Jong Il.

Carrier rocket Unha-3 with the second version of satellite Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 atop blasted off from the Sohae Space Center in Cholsan County, North Phyongan Province at 09:49:46 on December 12, Juche 101(2012). The satellite entered its preset orbit at 09:59:13, 9 minutes and 27 seconds after the lift-off.

The satellite is going round the polar orbit at 499.7 km perigee altitude and 584.18 km apogee altitude at the angle of inclination of 97.4 degrees. Its cycle is 95 minutes and 29 seconds.

The scientific and technological satellite is fitted with survey and communications devices essential for the observation of the earth.

The successful launch of the satellite is a proud fruition of the Workers' Party of Korea's policy of attaching importance to the science and technology. It is also an event of great turn in developing the country's science, technology and economy by fully exercising the independent right to use space for peaceful purposes.

At a time when great yearnings and reverence for Kim Jong Il pervade the whole country, its scientists and technicians brilliantly carried out his behests to launch a scientific and technological satellite in 2012, the year marking the 100th birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung.|KCNA

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="143981">Most '''regions and provinces of Europe''' have '''alternative names''' in different languages. Some regions have also undergone [[Geographical renaming|name changes]] for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all major European regions, provinces, and territories. It also includes some lesser regions that are important because of their location or history.

This article does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "official", "real", or "correct" name of any region is or was. Regions are (mostly) listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English''', which does not necessarily match the title of the corresponding article. The English version is followed by variants in other languages, in alphabetical order by name, and then by any historical variants and former names.

Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents may be listed.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[topographic elevation|highest]] [[summit (topography)|mountain peak]] of [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] summit on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable tables comprise the '''353 most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of [[North America|greater North America]]'''.  Each of these [[Summit|summits]] has at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].  

This article defines greater North America as the portion of the continental landmass of the [[Americas]] extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the islands surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the islands of North America to include the coastal islands of North America, the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[Bermuda Islands]], the [[Islands of Greenland]] ([[Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the islands of [[Northern Canada]], the islands of [[Alaska]], and the islands of the northeastern [[Pacific Ocean]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of [[Oceania]].

[[Elevation|Topographic elevation]] is the vertical distance above the reference [[geoid]], a mathematical model of the Earth's [[sea level]] as an [[equipotential]] [[Gravity|gravitational]] surface.  The [[topographic prominence]] of a [[summit]] is the elevation difference between that summit and the highest or key [[col]] to a higher summit.  The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the minimum [[great-circle distance]] to a point of equal elevation.

This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.

All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].  If a summit elevation or prominence has a range of values, the arithmetic mean is cited.

[[Denali]] is one of only three summits on Earth with more than {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  [[Mount Logan]] exceeds {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of prominence.  Four peaks of greater North America exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, ten exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 17 exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 34 exceed {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 100 exceed {{convert|2000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and the following 353 ultra-prominent summits exceed {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.

Of these 353 ultra-prominent summits of North America, 143 are located in Canada, 122 in the United States, 38 in Greenland, 26 in México, eight in Honduras, six in Guatemala, four in El Salvador, three in Costa Rica, three in the Dominican Republic, two in Haiti, two in Nicaragua, and one each in Jamaica, Cuba, and Panamá.  Six of these peaks lie on the Canada-United States border and one lies on the El Salvador-Honduras border.

==Ultra-prominent summits==

The following sortable table comprises the '''353 [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summits]] of [[North America|greater North America]]'''.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;This article defines [[North America|greater North America]] as the portion of the [[Continent|continental landmass]] of the [[Americas]] extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the [[Island|ocean islands]] surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the ocean islands of greater North America to include the [[Island#Continental islands|coastal islands]] of [[Geography of North America|North America]], the [[Caribbean|islands of the Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of Greenland|islands of Greenland]] ([[Greenland|Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the [[List of islands of Canada|islands of Canada]], and the [[List of islands of Alaska|islands of Alaska]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of [[Oceania]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these peaks has at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denali]] is one of only three summits on Earth with more than {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  [[Mount Logan]] exceeds {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of prominence.  Four peaks of greater North America exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, ten exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 17 exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 34 exceed {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 100 exceed {{convert|2000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and the following 353 ultra-prominent summits exceed {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.

{{geoGroup|section=Ultra-prominent summits}}
{{main|List of the most prominent summits of North America}}
Of the 353 ultra-prominent summits of North America, 143 are located in Canada, 122 in the United States (excluding six in Hawai{{okina}}i), 38 in Greenland, 26 in México, eight in Honduras, six in Guatemala, four in El Salvador, three in Costa Rica, three in the Dominican Republic, two in Haiti, two in Nicaragua, and one each in Jamaica, Cuba, and Panamá.  Six of these peaks lie on the Canada-United States border and one lies on the El Salvador-Honduras border.  Additional references for the 200 most prominent of these summits can be found on the [[List of the most prominent summits of North America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10627">This '''list of [[first ascent]]s in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]''' can be sorted by any listed characteristic. The route taken and its [[Yosemite Decimal System]] rating are given where known. The only criterion for inclusion is the historic notability of the climb when it was completed. Both first ascents of summits by any route, and first ascents of technical non-summit routes, are listed.

[[File:Lucien Gallois.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Lucien Gallois&lt;br /&gt;(before 1929)]]
'''Lucien Louis Joseph Gallois''' (21 February 1857 – 21 March 1941) was a French [[geographer]] born in [[Metz]].

He was a student at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris, where he took classes from [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918). In 1884 he received his [[agrégation]], later becoming a lecturer at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] (1893). From 1898 to 1907 he was a professor of [[geography]] at the École Normale Supérieure, and afterwards a professor at the Sorbonne, where he remained until his retirement in 1927.

Gallois made major contributions to the ''[[Annales de géographie]]'', a geographical journal that he co-founded with his mentor, Paul Vidal de la Blache. Following the death of Vidal de la Blache in 1918, he assumed directorship of ''Géographie universelle'', a major project involving [[regional geography]] of the entire world. 

Gallois had a keen interest in the fields of [[cartography]] and [[history of geography]], as made evident by an influential 1890 study on German geographers of the [[Renaissance]] titled ''Les géographes allemands de la Renaissance''. Another noted publication of his was ''Régions naturelles et noms de pays: Étude sur la région Parisienne'' (Natural regions and country names: A study of the Paris region).

'''The Obô Natural Park of São Tomé''' ({{lang-pt|Parque Natural Obô de São Tomé}}) is a natural park of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], covering {{convert|195|km2|abbr=on}} of the island of [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]].&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arleciosoares13.wordpress.com/areas-protegidas/parque-natural-de-sao-tome/|title=Parque Natural d'Obô em São Tomé|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arleciosoares13.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/lei-06-06-parque-natural-de-sao-tome.pdf Lei 06/2006], 13 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It has not yet been assigned to a [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN protected area category]].&lt;ref name="dopa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dopa-explorer.jrc.ec.europa.eu/wdpa/124355 |title=DOPA: Parque Natural Obô de São Tomé|publisher=[[Joint Research Centre]]|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.protectedplanet.net/124355 |title=Parque Natural Obô de São Tomé|publisher=[[World Database on Protected Areas]]|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers parts of the districts of [[Caué District|Caué]], [[Lemba District|Lemba]], [[Lobata District|Lobata]] and [[Mé-Zóchi District|Mé-Zóchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ine.st/index.php/publicacoes/documentos/file/178-3-caract-fisico-geograficas-5 Map of São Tomé and Príncipe], [[Instituto Nacional de Estatística (São Tomé and Príncipe)|Instituto Nacional de Estatística]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The Natural Park covers three geographically separated zones:&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;
*the largest part is the central massif, including the mountains [[Pico de São Tomé]] and [[Pico Cão Grande]]
*the zone of [[Vila Malanza|Malanza]], in the south of the island
*the zone of [[Praia das Conchas, São Tomé and Príncipe|Praia das Conchas]] and [[Lagoa Azul]], in the north of the island
[[File:Óbo (4238094175).jpg|thumb|right|A typical forest landscape of the park area]]

The park is known internationally amongst conservationists for its biologically rich dense virgin rainforests. It is also characterized by a wide range of [[biotope]]s, from lowland and mountain forests, to [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]] area, which contribute to its unique ecosystem. The park includes virgin Atlantic high altitude rainforest and secondary rainforest (known to locals as ''capoeira'') which contains abandoned plantations.&lt;ref name="Obo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obopark.com/en/saotomeprincipe/nationalparks/conservation.html|title=Conservation history|publisher=Obo Park.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301171342/http://www.obopark.com/en/saotomeprincipe/nationalparks/conservation.html#|archive-date=2012-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, scientists classified the forests of São Tomé and Príncipe as the second most important in terms of biological interest out of 75 forests of Africa; most of the species found in the islands are found in the national park.&lt;ref name="Obo"/&gt; The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] has listed the forests of the national park as among the [[Global 200]], the 200 most important biological areas on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/sao-tome-and-principe Sao Tome and Principe], biodiversitya-z.org&lt;/ref&gt; The forest of Obo is listed as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) of Africa.&lt;ref name="Obo"/&gt;

There are about 700 plant species on the island of São Tomé,&lt;ref name="saotomeislands.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saotomeislands.com/naturalhistory.html|title=Natural History |publisher=Sao Tome and Principe Travel and Tourism|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 95 [[endemism|endemic]].&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;[https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0127 Islands of São Tomé and Príncipe of the coast of Equatorial Guinea], [[World Wildlife Fund]]&lt;/ref&gt; Flora includes the evergreen coniferous ''[[Afrocarpus mannii]]''.  Orchids, ferns and mosses are common in the area.

There are 16 endemic bird species on the island, including [[São Tomé olive pigeon]] (''Columba thomensis''), [[São Tomé ibis]] (''Bostrychia bocagei''), [[São Tomé fiscal]] (''Lanius newtoni''), [[São Tomé shorttail]] (''Amaurocichlia bocagei''),&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt; [[São Tomé grosbeak]] (''Crithagra concolor''), [[Giant sunbird]] (''Dreptes thomensis''), [[São Tomé oriole]] (''Oriolus crassirostris'') and [[São Tomé thrush]] (''Turdus olivaceofuscus'').&lt;ref name="dopa" /&gt; The amphibians ''[[Ptychadena newtoni]]'', ''[[Hyperolius thomensis]]'', ''[[Hyperolius molleri]]'', ''[[Phrynobatrachus leveleve]]'', and ''[[Schistometopum thomense]]'' are found in the park.&lt;ref name="dopa" /&gt; The shrew ''[[Crocidura thomensis]]'' is the only endemic terrestrial mammal. There are three endemic species of bats: [[São Tomé collared fruit bat]] (''Myonycteris brachycephala''), [[São Tomé free-tailed bat]] (''Chaerephon tomensis''),&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt; and [[São Tomé leaf-nosed bat]] (''Hipposideros thomensis'').&lt;ref name="dopa" /&gt; Invertebrates include the moths ''[[Theretra viridis]]'',  ''[[Hyalobathra barnsalis]]'' and ''[[Pseudoclanis tomensis]]'' and the ant ''[[Tetramorium renae]]''.

'''Retjenu''' (''rṯnw; Reṯenu, Retenu''), was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian name for [[Canaan]] and [[History of Syria#Syria in Antiquity|Syria]]. It covered the region from the Negev Desert north to the [[Orontes River]]. The borders of Retjenu shifted with time, but it generally consisted of three regions. The southernmost was [[Djahy]], which had about the same boundaries as [[Canaan]].&lt;ref name="Boundaries"&gt;Steindorff, George. ''When Egypt Ruled the East.'' p. 47.

The earliest attestation of the name occurs in the ''[[Tale of Sinuhe]],'' inscribed on a [[Ostracon|piece of limestone]] in 14th century BC.

'''San Juan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|n|_|ˈ|hw|ɑː|n}}; {{IPA-es|saŋ ˈxwan}}; "Saint [[John the Baptist|John]]") is the [[Capital city|capital]] and most populous [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]], an [[Territories of the United States#Unincorporated organized territories|unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States]]. As of the [[United States Census Bureau|2010 census]], it is the [[List of United States cities by population|46th-largest]] city under the jurisdiction of the United States, with a population of 395,326. San Juan was founded by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonists in 1521, who called it ''Ciudad de Puerto Rico'' ("Rich Port City"). Puerto Rico's capital is the second oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after [[Santo Domingo]], in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="SJCOPRI"&gt;{{cite web|author=Magaly Rivera|title=San Juan Capital City|url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/sanjuan.shtml|publisher=Welcome to Puerto Rico|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historical buildings are located in San Juan; among the most notable are the city's former defensive forts, [[Fort San Felipe del Morro]] and [[Castillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)|Fort San Cristóbal]], and [[La Fortaleza]], the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas.

Today, San Juan is [[San Juan Port|Puerto Rico's most important seaport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apprportal.prpa.gobierno.pr/servlet/page?_pageid=70&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;_type=site&amp;_fsiteid=54&amp;_fid=3640&amp;_fnavbarid=1&amp;_fnavbarsiteid=54&amp;_fedit=0&amp;_fmode=2&amp;_fdisplaymode=1&amp;_fcalledfrom=1&amp;_fdisplayurl= |publisher=Puerto Rico Port Authority |title=the San Juan Port |language=Spanish |year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the island's manufacturing,{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} financial, cultural, and [[Tourism in Puerto Rico|tourism center]].

The city has been the host of events within the sports community, including the 1979 [[Pan American Games]]; 1966 [[Central American and Caribbean Games]]; events of the 2006, 2009 and 2013 [[World Baseball Classic]]s; the [[Caribbean Series]] and the [[Special Olympics]] and [[MLB]] San Juan Series in 2010.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of San Juan, Puerto Rico}}
[[File:Ponce de Leon house.JPG|left|200px|thumb|Ruins of Juan Ponce de León's residence at Caparra]]

In 1508, [[Juan Ponce de León]] founded the original settlement which he called [[Caparra Archaeological Site|Caparra]]. It was named after the Province of [[Caceres (province)|Cáceres]] in Spain, the birthplace of [[Nicolás de Ovando]], then the Governor of Spain's Caribbean territories,&lt;ref&gt;"[[Guaynabo]] -- Encyclopædia Britannica" (with history of Puerto Rico),''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2006, ''Britannica.com'' webpage:[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9038345/Guaynabo EB-Guaynabo-Puerto-Rico]:names: [[Caparra Archaeological Site|Caparra]], the first Spanish settlement of Puerto Rico (1508).&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is part of the Pueblo Viejo sector of [[Guaynabo]], just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. A year later, the settlement was moved to a site then called Puerto Rico, Spanish for "rich port" or "good port", after its similar geographical features to the town of Puerto Rico of [[Gran Canaria]] in the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref name="Caparra"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Park Service|title=Historic places in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nR/travel/prvi/pr27.htm|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1521, the newer settlement was given its formal name: ''Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista''.

The ambiguous use of ''San Juan Bautista'' and ''Puerto Rico'' for both the city and the island in time led to a reversal in practical use by most inhabitants: by 1746 the name for the city (Puerto Rico) had become that of the entire island, leading to the city being identified as ''Puerto Rico de Puerto Rico'' on maps of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/2272|work=New York Public Library|title=Nueva España documents and transcripts, ca. 1700-ca. 1799}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HistoryS.J."&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia de San Juan de Puerto Rico |language=Spanish |publisher=Vive San Juan |year=2006 |url=http://www.vivesanjuan.com/historia.htm |accessdate=2007-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501112503/http://www.vivesanjuan.com/historia.htm |archivedate=May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/puerto-rico/index.html Puerto Rico].

[[File:Staat van Amerika, map of San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1766.jpg|thumb|250px|San Juan and bay, Puerto Rico, 1766]]
San Juan, as a settlement of the [[Spanish Empire]], was used by merchant and military ships traveling from Spain as the first stopover in the [[Americas]]. Because of its prominence in the Caribbean, a network of fortifications was built to protect the transports of gold and silver from the [[New World]] to Europe. Because of the rich cargoes, San Juan became a target of the foreign powers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Juan National Historic Site|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/saju/faq.html#3|publisher=National Park Service|year=2000|accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was witness to attacks from the English led by [[Sir Francis Drake]] in 1595 (in what is known as the [[Battle of Puerto Rico]]) and by [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George Clifford]], [[Earl of Cumberland]], in 1598. Artillery from San Juan's fort, [[Fort San Felipe del Morro|El Morro]], repelled Drake; however, Clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Puerto Rico|publisher=Sol Boricua|year=2000|url=http://www.solboricua.com/history.htm|author=William Figueroa|language=Spanish |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months of English occupation, Clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer from exhaustion and sickness. In 1625 the city was sacked by Dutch forces led by Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin Henrick), but El Morro withstood the assault and was not taken. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain [[Juan de Amézqueta]] and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amézqueta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://efemerides.zoomblog.com/archivo/2006/09/24/don-Juan-De-Haro-Y-Los-Holandeses-24-d.html "DON JUAN DE HARO Y LOS HOLANDESES" (24 de Septiembre de 1625)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202024647/http://efemerides.zoomblog.com/archivo/2006/09/24/don-Juan-De-Haro-Y-Los-Holandeses-24-d.html |date=February 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}} The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amézqueta and Andrés Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.&lt;ref name="PRH"&gt;[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/2/2/7/12272/12272.htm The History of Puerto Rico From the Spanish Discovery to the American Occupation / Middeldyk, R.A.

The British [[Battle of San Juan (1797)|attack]] in 1797, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], led by [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] (who had just conquered [[Trinidad]]). His army laid siege to the city but was forced to withdraw in defeat as the Puerto Rican defenses proved more resilient than those of Trinidad. Various events and circumstances, including liberalized commerce with Spain, the opening of the island to immigrants as a direct result of the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]], and the colonial revolutions, led to an expansion of San Juan and other Puerto Rican settlements in the late 18th and early 19th century.

Around this time, [[Ángel Rivero Méndez|Captain Ángel Rivero Méndez]] was assigned the command of the Spanish forces in the fortress of [[Castillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)|San Cristóbal]] in San Juan. On May 10, the ''Yale'' returned to San Juan Bay, Rivero-Méndez ordered his men to open fire upon the {{USS|Yale|1888|6}} using an Ordoñez 15 centimeter cannon, thus becoming the first attack against the Americans in Puerto Rico during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt; For his actions, Captain Rivero-Mendez was awarded the "Cruz de la Orden de Merito Militar" (The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class.&lt;ref name="GHA"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2006-10-10|url=http://members.tripod.com/~adjuntas1/guerra1.html|title=1898 - Adjuntas en la Guerra Hispanoamericana|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents of San Juan were furious with Rivero and blamed him for the destruction caused to their city by the American bombardments. Nothing came of those accusations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] was signed.&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt; On July 25, General [[Nelson A.

The American troops found some resistance and engaged the Spanish and Puerto Rican troops in battle, the most notable of these the battles of [[Battle of Yauco|Yauco]] and [[Battle of Asomante|Asomante]]. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended August 13, 1898, after President [[William McKinley]] and French Ambassador [[Jules Cambon]], acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an [[armistice]].&lt;ref name="COPRSAW"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-04|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/chronpr.html|title=Chronology of Puerto Rico in the Spanish–American War|work=The World of 1898: The Spanish–American War|publisher=Hispanic Division, Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Karl Stephen Herrman |title=From Yauco to Las Marias a Recent Campaign in Puerto Rico |year=2004 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |page=2|isbn=1-4191-2123-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain ceded the island to the United States later the same year by signing the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]].

[[Camp Las Casas]], located in the district of Santurce, served as the main training camp for the Puerto Rican soldiers prior to World War I and World War II; the majority of the men trained in this facility were assigned to the "Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry" which was renamed the [[65th Infantry Regiment (United States)|65th Infantry Regiment]] of the United States Army by the Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920.

In 1919, [[Félix Rigau Carrera]], "El Aguila de Sabana Grande" (The Eagle from Sabana Grande), the first Puerto Rican pilot, became the first native Puerto Rican to fly an aircraft in the island when he flew his [[Curtiss JN-4]] from Las Casas. At the time, the area was used by the military as an air base and it was also Puerto Rico's first commercial airport, and Rigau Carrera was allowed to perform his historic flight from the air field.&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;"El Mundo"; "Fallece El Aguila - Fue Primer Boricua Manejo Avion en la Isla" (Spanish); by: Malen Rojas Daporte; October 20, 1954; Number 13,448&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Las Casas was eventually closed down, and in 1950 a public housing project by the name of [[Residencial Las Casas|Residencial Fray Bartolome de Las Casas]] was constructed on its former location.

On January 2, 1947, the people of San Juan elected [[Felisa Rincón de Gautier]] (also known as Doña Fela) (1897–1994) as their mayor. Thus, she became the first woman to be elected as the mayor of a capital city in any of The Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zonai.com/promociones/biografias/0101/felisa.asp ''El Nuevo Dia'']&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]] era, she ordered the establishment of the island's first Civil Defense system under the directorship of Colonel [[Gilberto José Marxuach]] (Teófilo's son).&lt;ref&gt;"heroe del 65 Satisfecho de Haber Cumplido su Deber"; ''El Mundo''; May 2, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Rincón de Gautier served as mayor until January 2, 1969.

On October 30, 1950, San Juan was the scene of the [[San Juan Uprising]], one of many uprisings which occurred in various towns and cities in Puerto Rico, by the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] against the governments of Puerto Rico and the United States. Among the uprising's main objective was to attack "[[La Fortaleza]]" (the Governors mansion) and the United States Federal Court House Building in [[Old San Juan]]. In accordance to the planned uprising in San Juan, a group of nationalists were supposed to attack simultaneously the gubernatorial mansion [[La Fortaleza]], where Puerto Rican governor [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] resided, and the United States Federal Court House which is located close to an area called "La Marina" in Old San Juan. The La Fortaleza battle, which ensued between the nationalists and the police lasted 15 minutes, and ended when four of the five attackers were killed.&lt;ref name="Page 2"&gt;''El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza''; by [[Pedro Aponte Vázquez]]; Page 2; Publisher: Publicaciones RENÉ; {{ISBN|978-1-931702-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coat of arms and flag===
{{Main|Diego de Torres Vargas}}
On March 8, 1948 the city government of San Juan officially adopted as the city's first flag an orange field, in the center of which is the Coat of Arms of the City. The orange color was based and taken from Father [[Diego de Torres Vargas]]' text and it reads : "Escudo de armas dado a Puerto Rico por los Reyes Católicos en el año de 1511, siendo Procurador un vecino llamado Pedro Moreno. Son : un cordero blanco con su banderilla colorada, sobre un libro, y todo sobre una isla verde, que es la de Puerto Rico, y por los lados una F y una I, que quiere decir Fernando e Isabel, los Reyes Católicos que se las dieron, y hoy se conservan en el estandarte real, que es de damasco anaranjado, con que se ganó la ciudad" ("Coat of Arms given to Puerto Rico by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in the year 1511 being Procurator a [[vecino]] named Pedro Moreno. They are: a white lamb with a red flag, on top of a book, and everything above a green island, which is Puerto Rico...which is of orange damask, with which the city was won"). It appears that the color was changed from orange to white at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/pr-sj.html|title=San Juan (Puerto Rico)|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:san juan pr.jpg|right|thumb|149px|San Juan from space]]

San Juan is located along the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean; north of [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]] and [[Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico|Trujillo Alto]]; east of  and [[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico|Guaynabo]]; and west of [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]]. The city occupies an area of {{convert|76.93|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|29.11|sqmi|km2}} (37.83%) is water. San Juan's main water bodies are [[San Juan Bay]] and two natural lagoons, the [[Condado Lagoon|Condado]] and San José.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topuertorico.org/geogra.shtml |title=Puerto Rico Geography |accessdate=2007-06-30|publisher=ToPuertoRico.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
San Juan has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] and enjoys an average temperature of {{convert|81.0|F|1}} although {{convert|90|°F|0}} or higher temperatures are seen on an average 79 days annually, more commonly occurring during the wetter months of the northern summer, especially if the winds come from the south. In the winter, temperatures can drop to around {{convert|60|°F}}, though the average winter low is {{convert|71|°F|0}}.

===Architecture===
[[File:Puerto Rico 01.jpg|thumb|Old San Juan]]
The architecture of San Juan is very diverse, due to its size and all the cultural influences received during its existence. The oldest part of the city, known as [[Old San Juan]], mostly features the influence of [[Spanish architecture]]. This part of the city is comprised by a network of [[Sett (paving)|"setted" roads]] usually surrounded by ancient, two-storied houses built on [[masonry]]. Some colonial structures have been restored and serve either as government offices or museums. Some examples are the [[Ballajá Barracks]], which now serve as museum and headquarters of several cultural organizations; [[La Fortaleza]], which has served as the residence of the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] since the 16th Century; and the Ancient Welfare Asylum, which now houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, among others. Old San Juan also features several public squares, like the [[Plaza de Armas, San Juan|Plaza de Armas]], located in front of San Juan City Hall; and cathedrals, like the [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/pr_new/viejo_sanjuan.php |title=Viejo San Juan |work=Enciclopedia Puerto Rico |author=Grupo Editorial EPRL |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723220237/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/pr_new/viejo_sanjuan.php |archivedate=July 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Old San Juan is also notable for being partly enclosed by massive walls and fortifications built by the [[Spanish government]].

The architecture is more varied in other districts of the city. The district of [[Santurce, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] features a lot of influence from [[art deco]], while the districts of [[Hato Rey, Puerto Rico|Hato Rey]] feature more modern structures.

===Districts===

[[File:San Juan and Rio Piedras municipalities (cropped).jpg|thumb|400px|San Juan and Rio Piedras as separate municipalities on map of 1915]]
{{Main|Subdivisions of San Juan, Puerto Rico}}
What is now known as [[Old San Juan]] occupied the western end of a rocky islet, the [[Isleta de San Juan]], at the mouth of San Juan Bay. During the 20th century, the main population centers surged well beyond the walls of the old city and onto Puerto Rico's main island, and merged with the existing settlements east and south of Old San Juan. With the annexation of [[Río Piedras, Puerto Rico|Río Piedras]] in 1951, the municipality of San Juan grew four times its previous size. As a result, the city is now composed of a variety of districts and neighborhoods. San Juan is now subdivided into 18 districts ([[barrio]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/maps/sanjuan.pdf |title=San Juan map: Municipo de San Juan |publisher=Welcome.topuertorico.org |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 of which fall within the former municipality of [[Río Piedras]]. Eight districts are further subdivided into sectors (sub-barrios), including two districts in the area that covered the original municipality of San Juan. The 18 districts are:

====Old San Juan====
{{Main|Old San Juan}}
[[File:San Juan 3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Some streets in Old San Juan are still paved with blue [[cobblestones]] from the Spanish colonial era.]]
During the Spanish colonial times most of the urban population resided in what is now known as [[Old San Juan]]. This sector is located on the western half of a small island called the ''Isleta de San Juan'', which is connected to the mainland by two bridges and a [[causeway]]. The small island, which comprises an area of {{convert|47|sqmi}}, also hosts the working-class neighborhood of [[Puerta de Tierra]] and most of Puerto Rico's [[Executive Departments of the Government of Puerto Rico|central government]] buildings, including the [[Puerto Rico Capitol|Commonwealth's Capitol]].

The main central part of the city is characterized by narrow streets made of blue [[cobblestone]] and picturesque colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 16th and 17th century. Sections of the old city are surrounded by massive walls and several defensive structures and notable forts. These include the 16th-century [[Fort San Felipe del Morro]] and the 17th-century [[Castillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)|Fort San Cristóbal]], both part of [[San Juan National Historic Site]], and the 16th-century [[La Fortaleza|El Palacio de Santa Catalina]], also known as [[La Fortaleza]], which serves as the governor's mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/60sjspanish/60sanjuan.htm|title=Los Castillos del Viejo San Juan|language=Spanish |publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other buildings of interest predating the 20th century are the ''Ayuntamiento or Alcaldía'' (City Hall), the ''Diputación Provincial'' and the ''Real Intendencia'' buildings, which currently house the [[Puerto Rico Department of State]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estado.gobierno.pr/galeria.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010215414/http://www.estado.gobierno.pr/galeria.htm |date=October 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Casa Rosa]], the [[San José Church]] (1523) and the adjacent [[Hotel El Convento]], the former house of the Ponce de León family known as [[Casa Blanca (San Juan)|Casa Blanca]], the [[Teatro Tapia]], the former Spanish barracks (now Museum of Ballajá), ''La Princesa'' (former municipal jail, now headquartering the [[Puerto Rico Tourism Company]]), and the [[Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery]], located just outside the city walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/ballaja.htm|title=History of ''El Cuartel de Ballajá'' |language=Spanish |publisher=Coquí.Net |accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~prsanjua/pazzi.htm|title=Viejo Cementerio de San Juan (graveyard's history)|author=E.

====Other districts====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:San Juan CBD.jpg|thumb|right|193px|San Juan's CBD known as the Golden Mile District]] --&gt;
East of Old San Juan lies the wealthy tourist-oriented neighborhood of [[Condado (Santurce)|Condado]], which occupies land that used to be owned by entrepreneur Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and Count of San José de Santurce under the Spanish colonial period. Beaches such as nearby [[Ocean Park (Santurce)|Ocean Park]], popular with swimmers, [[surfers]] and [[kitesurfers]], are found all along the district's Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertoricocheaphotels.com|title=Puerto Rico Cheap Hotels: Condado, Old San Juan, Isla Verde and Ocean Park budget hotels|publisher=Hola San Juan|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near Condado are two separate business districts, [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] and [[Miramar (Santurce)|Miramar]]. Miramar is mainly a residential area rising south of the Condado Lagoon. It comprises the former ''[[barrio]]'' of Miraflores, as well as drained marshland and landfill over which was built San Juan's first airport, the Isla Grande airport, which was renamed [[Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport]] in honor of Major [[Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci]] (USAF). Miramar now hosts the [[Puerto Rico Convention Center]] as well as some of San Juan Harbor's cruise ship piers. In 2005 Miramar was designated an historical district of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miramarpr.com/ |title=Informese: Miramar designated a historical district|publisher=MiramarPR|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santurce, originally named ''San Mateo de Cangrejos'' (Saint Matthew of the Crabs), was a settlement for freed African slaves during the early days of the city. After Pablo Ubarri sought permission to link San Juan with Río Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of [[Santurtzi]] (''[[Saint George]]'' in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in [[Biscay|Vizcaya]], Spain. The "Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico" ([[Puerto Rico Museum of Art]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapr.org/|title=Official site of the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|language=Spanish|publisher=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce.
[[File:Old San Juan Street.jpg|thumb|left|Looking down an Old San Juan street towards the bay]]
South of Santurce is [[Hato Rey]], part of the former municipality of Río Piedras. Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence its name, the ''King's Herd'' in Spanish) as early as the 16th century,&lt;ref name="mini-wall-street"/&gt; and is now considered the financial center of the island. A section of this district is often referred to as ''[[Milla de Oro]]'' (actually {{convert|0.47|mi|km|2|disp=or|sp=us}} long) due in part to the many banks and businesses located there.&lt;ref name="mini-wall-street"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n47/PRSST0847-en.shtml|title=Eatin' Where The Cows Used To Roam: Hato Rey Dining At Its Best|author=Brenda A. Mari|publisher=The Puerto Rico Herald|date=November 19, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern part of the city is the socially diversified community of [[Río Piedras]]. Founded in the mid-1850s, Río Piedras was a separate town which hosted sugar cane plantations and the estates of some of San Juan's wealthiest inhabitants (as well as their working class staff). The Spanish colonial governors also had their summer home there on land which eventually gave way to the main campus of the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. In 1951 the municipalities of San Juan and Río Piedras were merged to redefine San Juan's current city limits. Today Río Piedras comprises the largest area of the municipality of San Juan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official site of the University of Puerto Rico|url=http://www.uprrp.edu/|language=Spanish|publisher=Universidad de Puerto Rico|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is home to the "Plaza del Mercado" (Río Piedras [[Marketplace]]), the main campus and the Medical Sciences campus of the [[University of Puerto Rico]] and the [[San Juan Botanical Garden]].

San Juan is the largest city in Puerto Rico by population.&lt;ref name="poptotal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFPopulation?_event=ChangeGeoContext&amp;geo_id=05000US72127&amp;_geoContext=&amp;_street=&amp;_county=San+Juan&amp;_cityTown=San+Juan&amp;_state=04000US72&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;_submenuId=population_0&amp;ds_name=null&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=|title=San Juan and its barrios|publisher=United States Census Bureau |year=2008|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899 to 1950 the municipality of San Juan excluded the township of Río Piedras. For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce ''barrios'', or subdivisions, of San Juan. The old municipality of Río Piedras constituted the third most populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry to San Juan, which are factors that prompted Río Piedras's dramatic urban development in the 20th century.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the racial composition of San Juan was as follows:
* [[White American|White]]: 68.0% ([[Non-Hispanic Whites]]: 1.2%)
* Black or African American: 18.3% (Non-Hispanic Blacks: 0.3%)
* [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]: 0.8%
* [[Asian American|Asian]]: 0.4%
* [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]]/[[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]]: 0.0%
* Some other race: 8.2%
* [[Multiracial American|Two or more races]]: 4.0%
* [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] (of any race): 98.2%

Among the Hispanic and Latino population, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] are, unsurprisingly, the largest group; they make up 87.5% of San Juan's Hispanic population. People of [[Dominican American|Dominican]] descent made up 12.2% of the Hispanic population, while those of [[Cuban American|Cuban]] descent formed 1.7% of the Hispanic populace. Other Hispanic and Latino groups collectively formed 3.2% of San Juan's Hispanic population.

There are 13,304 whites of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan; 10,571 blacks of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks form 3.2% and 2.6% of San Juan's population respectively. There are also approximately 562 Asians of non-Hispanic origin in San Juan; they make up only 0.1% of the population. However, Asians of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin together number at 6,342. The vast majority of Asians in San Juan are of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] descent; of the 6,342 Asians, 4,928 are Chinese. Chinese comprise 1.4% of the population. The only other sizable Asian group in San Juan are [[Indian Americans]]; there are 698 people of Indian descent in the city, forming 0.2% of the population. There are very small numbers of people of [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]], and [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]] ancestry; none of these groups number more than 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US7276770&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR5&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103135319/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US7276770&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR5&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on |archivedate=November 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 87.5% of San Juan's population was native and 12.5% were foreign-born. Of the native population, 86.9% were born in Puerto Rico or the United States, of which 75.6% were born in Puerto Rico and 8.9% were born in the United States. The remaining 0.7% were born in a U.S. territory or were born abroad to American parents. The remaining 11.9% of the population were born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. In recent years, an increasing number of Americans not of Hispanic ancestry (both of [[African American]] and of [[White American]] descent) have moved to San Juan. In addition, a large number of [[Stateside Puerto Ricans]] have settled in the city upon their return to Puerto Rico. There is also a growing [[West Indian]] population, both of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin.

In terms of ancestry, 23,875 people claimed American ancestry, which is equivalent to 5.8% of San Juan's population.

==Economy==
&lt;!-- Introduction, main areas --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:San Juan's CBD.jpg|thumb|right|Hato Rey District in San Juan]] --&gt;
San Juan experienced significant economic growth following World War II. During this period the city underwent an [[industrial revolution]], although as of 1984 it had never generated its own economic region.&lt;ref&gt;Cities and the Wealth of Nations, Chapter 3, Jane Jacobs, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;Microsoft Encarta Biblioteca (2006), Microsoft Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; The city's economy relies mostly on companies dedicated to the manufacture of several products, including: [[Chemical substance]]s (bleach and house cleaning products); medicines; rum and other beverages; [[fertilizer]]s; electric tools; [[Electronics|electronic devices]]; plastics, [[textile]]s, and food-based products.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; Tourism is also a key industry, based on San Juan's proximity to Puerto Rico's main airport, the [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport]].&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt;
The tourism focus of the city is located in the district of Condado Beach where there are luxurious hotels.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; Historical locations such as El Morro, Old San Juan and El Cuartel de Ballaja are promoted in tourism campaigns. The district of Hato Rey contains a corporate sector known as "La Milla de Oro", (The Golden Mile) which serves as the headquarters of local and international banks. San Juan's Hato Rey district is often referred to as the "Wall Street of the Caribbean", due to the influence of the area on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean's economy.&lt;ref name="mini-wall-street"/&gt;

[[Seaborne Airlines]] is headquartered on the 9th floor of the World Plaza Building in San Juan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.seaborneairlines.com/about-us/general-info/ General Info]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6XsJhCSV9?url=http://www.seaborneairlines.com/about-us/general-info/ Archive]).

===Tourism===
[[File:Flying into San Juan-Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|right|San Juan beach]]
Technological advances after World War II in the development of the airliner, coupled with the island's climate and natural setting, have transformed San Juan into the springboard for tourism around the island, and has made the rest of the Caribbean known throughout the world during the last fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Puerto Rico, Borinquen Querida - Authors; Roger A. LaBrucherie, Imágenes Press, (1992) {{ISBN|0-939302-26-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the capital features hotels, museums, historical buildings, restaurants, beaches and shopping centers.

==Transportation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tren Urbano.jpg|thumb|right|San Juan's [[Tren Urbano]]]] --&gt;

The [[Port of San Juan]] is the fourth busiest seaport in the Western Hemisphere, ranked among the top 17 in the world in terms of container movement. It is also the largest home-based cruise port in the world with over a dozen cruise ships. It is the second busiest port in cruise volume after Miami.

The Metropolitan Area is served by two airports. The [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport]], San Juan's primary commercial airport, is located eight miles ({{convert|8|mi|abbr=out|1|disp=output only}}) from Old San Juan in the neighboring municipality of [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]]. The airport accommodates more than 30 domestic and international airlines and is the busiest airport in the Caribbean. It is often referred to as "The Gateway to the Caribbean" because it serves as the main connection to the island and the rest of the Caribbean for the United States and vice versa. The area's secondary airport is the [[Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport]], which is located directly across the San Antonio Creek or ''Cano San Antonio'' from Old San Juan in the Isla Grande district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prpa.gobierno.pr/APMain.aspx |title=Autoridad de puertos de Puerto Rico official website |language=Spanish |publisher=Autoridad de Puertos de Puerto Rico |accessdate=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007181239/http://www.prpa.gobierno.pr/apmain.aspx |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominicci Airport is used mainly by general aviation aircraft, charter flights, and some domestic commercial flights. It used to be the city's and also the island of Puerto Rico's main international gateway until the opening of Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport. It is now also widely used by the Isla Grande Flight School and Caribbean Flight Center, the only flight school on the island.

In an attempt to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion, the city built a [[rapid transit|metro]] system dubbed "[[Tren Urbano]]" ("Urban Train"). The {{convert|10.7|mi|adj=on}} line connects to 16&amp;nbsp;stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternativa de Transporte Integrado homepage|publisher=Departamento de Trasportación Publica|year=2006|url=http://www.ati.gobierno.pr/|language=Spanish|accessdate=2007-05-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505011816/http://www.ati.gobierno.pr/|archivedate=May 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which opened in late 2004, cost $2.25&amp;nbsp;billion and was more than $1&amp;nbsp;billion over budget and four years late. The Tren Urbano has received less ridership than was originally projected and has not significantly reduced the city's automobile traffic, despite a reported 7.5% ridership increase in 2006 over 2005. There is a planned project to build a "interurban light rail system" connecting the cities of [[San Juan-Caguas Rail|San Juan and Caguas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n15/CBCaguasSanJuan.html |title=Caguas To San Juan In 15 Minutes |publisher=Puerto Rico Herald |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203704/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n15/CBCaguasSanJuan.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased investment in public transportation, however, has not changed the fact that San Juan is an automobile-reliant city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl. As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more beach-access points. No cars will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also hope to make the city more appealing in order to attract new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/sanjuannews/docs/finalreportsummary_walkablecity_july3-final|title=Walkable City San Juan|publisher=Issuu|year=2010|accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stadsgården.jpg|thumb|right|Stadsgården in 2007.]]
'''Stadsgården''' commonly refers to the [[wharf]] on the shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], located between [[Slussen]] in the west and [[Masthamnen]] in the east. The word ''gård'' in the name comes from ''skeppsgård'', which was a word used in archaic [[Swedish language|Swedish]] for an area used for port and dock operations.

==History==
[[File:Stadsgarden 1896.jpg|thumb|left|Stadsgården in 1896.]]
''Stadsgården'' (''Stadens skeppgård'') originally constituted only the western, broader part of the shore, near to a steep cliff face on [[Fjällgatan]]. The name is credited to have first occurred in 1448, in a text mentioning ''"en tompt vppa sudra malm belegna vidh Stadz garden"''. At least from the early 14th century, so called "[[whale oil|tran]] boats" or "[[pinniped|seal]] boats" lay fastened to poles on the water around the area. In the boats, seal fat from the [[Stockholm archipelago]] and the [[Bothnian Sea]] was cooked, and the resulting whale oil from this smelly contraption was packed in cans and sold further. The boats were left until the start of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="söderlund-hjulhammar"&gt;Kerstin Söderlund &amp; Marcus Hjulhammar&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain building, containing [[stables]], was prominent in the area. In Stockholm's privilege letter from 1594, proposals to tear down this building to give place for ship construction docks were mentioned:

{{quote|''"Så skall och stadzgården på Södre malmen lydhe och liggie under stadhen, såsom af ålder varidt hafwer, och aldelis blifve fri och opbygd, på thet rum måtte vare att brådhe och byggie skipp ther sammestädz. The bygninger, som ther nu opsatte äre emoth stadzens och borgerskapetz vilie, måghe bortrifves."''&lt;ref name="söderlund-hjulhammar"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"So should also the Stadsgården in Södermalm lay under the city, where there previously has been sea, and thoroughly be free and built, and there should be room to build ships there. The buildings that now stand there, against the will of the city and its inhabitants, must be dismantled."}}

[[File:Stadsgårdsleden dec 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Stadsgårdleden Road to the west, with the [[Fotografiska|Greater customs building]] (''Stora Tullhuset'') and [[Gamla stan|Old Town]] in the background, in December 2010.]]
Ship construction on the area was probably started in 1687 when the ''Södra varvet'' in [[Tegelviken]] was founded. In the ''Karta öfver S:ta Catharina församling'' from 1674, a long row of narrow lots towards [[Saltsjön]] is visible, but no road connecting them. On the map, Tegelvik remains a bay, bearing the name ''Skjeps-hwarfwet''. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the name ''Skeppsbron'', or ''Nya Skeppsbron'', is also mentioned, relating to [[Skeppsbron]] in [[Gamla stan]].

In an attempt by city architect [[Johan Eberhard]] to improve the Stadsgården docks in the end of the 1730s, a long wooden wharf was built. From the wharf, [[hay]], [[wheat]], [[wood]] and [[coal]] were distributed to be transported across the sea. In wintertime, the wharf was used by many ''vinterliggarna''.

Work to replace the wooden wharf by a stone construction proceeded very slowly because of the great depth of water. From 1875 to 1882, a new wooden wharf was built instead, resting on three rows of poles, with a length of 528 metres. [[Railway]] tracks were laid down on the wharf and connected with the ''Sammanbildingsbanan'' in Stockholm and the Skeppsbro wharf track. A magazine was built in 1883, and from 1888 to 1889 the ''Lilla Tullhuset'' was built. During the name revision in 1885, the name for the area between Slussen and Tegelviksplan was established as ''Stadsgården'', having previously (1849) been called Stadsgårdhamnen.&lt;ref name="söderlund-hjulhammar"/&gt;

In the late 19th century, a railway track, [[Saltsjöbanan]], was built and completed on 1 July 1893. The Stadsgården railway station was in use from 23 December 1893 to 21 December 1936, when it was moved to Slussen. The station building, dating from 1914, was sold to Stockholm's Christian Seaman Care, and the building became known as ''Sjömansinstitutes hus''.

Work between 1911 and 1915 replaced the old wooden wharf with a [[granite]]-enforced [[concrete]] wharf, which was 12 metres longer than the old wharf. At the same time, the sea bed around the wharf was scooped.&lt;ref name="söderlund-hjulhammar"/&gt;

==Stadsgårdleden and Stadsgårdhamnen==
The traffic way ''Stadsgårdleden'' was named in 1986 and replaced a large part of the older traffic way. The traffic way is about 1.3 [[kilometre|km]] long, and the way from [[Söder Mälarstrand]] passes by Södra Järngraven, Saltsjörampen, [[Franska bukten]], Stadsgårdhamnen, [[Katarinabergen]] and Tegelviksslingan. The major attraction in the west is the [[Katarina Elevator]] and in the east, the cliff with [[Fåfängan]] on its top. [[Stadsgårdhissen]] is located halfway between Slussen and Tegelviksplan, and from there, the 638-metre [[Stadsgårdtunneln]], located on the Saltsjöbanan railway track, begins. Today, ''"Stadsgården"'' refers to the 300-metre road part connection Östra Slussgatan with Stadsgårdleden. Along ''"Stadsgårdhamnen"'', the Stockholm city wharves can be found, with terminals for [[cruise ferry|cruise ferries]] and [[Baltic Sea cruiseferries|ferries to Finland]], including the [[Viking Line]] terminal.

==Stadsgårdhamnen on a summer day in 2007==
[[File:Stadsgarden 2007-07-28.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Stadsgårdhamnen during "[[The Tall Ships' Races]]" on 28 July 2007 can give an impression about how the wharf looked like in the 18th century.]]

'''Tayap''' is a small village of [[Cameroon]] located in the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre Region]], between the country’s capital [[Yaounde]] (86&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Douala]] (164&amp;nbsp;km). The village of Tayap is part of the [[Ngog-Mapubi]] district of the [[Nyong-et-Kéllé]] department.&lt;ref&gt;Main source of the article: Agripo, 2014, ''La monographie du village de Tayap''. Tayap, Éditions Agripo, 36 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated in the north-western zone of the forest of the [[Congo Basin]], the world’s second-largest [[rain forest]] after the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the village of Tayap has suffered from [[deforestation]] in Cameroon caused by different factors like the increase in population growth, the development of [[logging]], the collection of firewood and the practice of [[slash-and-burn]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Forestry Research, [http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/occpapers/op-27.pdf  « Collectif, L’Impact de la Crise Économique sur les Systèmes Agricoles et le Changement du Couvert Forestier dans la Zone Forestière Humide du Cameroun »], 2000 (consulted on 21 November 2014), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Tayap has been the site of a pilot project of [[agroecology]] and [[ecotourism]] aiming to protect its [[biodiversity]] and lands and to develop activities which generate income for its residents.

Tayap borders the villages of Omog and Mamb to the North, Mamb Kelle and Song Mpeck to the West, Lamal Pougue to the East and Nlep be and Ngong to the South.&lt;ref&gt;Clément Yonta Ngoune, [http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/SCD_T_2010_0007_YONTA-NGOUNE.pdf « Le contexte géologique des indices de talc de la région de Boumnyebel »]  Nancy, Université de Henri Poincaré Nancy I et université de Youandé I (thèse de doctorat en Sciences de la Terre), 2010 (consulted on 21 November 2014), p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tayap is situated 86&amp;nbsp;km from Yaounde (12&amp;nbsp;km from Boumnyebel on motorway N3 Douala-Yaounde) and extends along a bush road a dozen kilometers long joining the main Douala-Yaounde road. Tayap is connected to the N3 Douala-Yaounde motorway by a path which is not regularly maintained, which makes travel difficult in the rainy season. The village of Tayap is situated 6 kilometers from Omog.

=== Climate ===
Tayap enjoys a humid climate of the equatorial type in four seasons: two dry seasons and two [[wet season]]s. The main wet season takes place between August and October, and the minor wet season from March to May. The main dry season is from November to February and the minor dry season in June and July. The nearest meteorological station is at [[Eseka]] about 20&amp;nbsp;km to the South-West of Tayap.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Olivry, MESRES ORSTOM, ''Monographies hydrologiques de l’OSTOM'', Paris, 1986 ({{ISBN|2709908042}}), p. 70-88&lt;/ref&gt; The mean annual temperature is 25C. [[Rainfall]] varies between 1,500 and 2,500&amp;nbsp;mm a year.

=== Geology and speleology ===
[[File:Forêts rocheuses de Tayap.jpg|thumb|Rock formation]]
The village of Tayap is characterized by a mean altitude of about 350 meters and by hills with steep slopes. It demonstrates an undersoil rich in silicate rock ([[quartzite]]) and magnetic rocks like [[pyrite]]s and [[Schist|micaschist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/19730069/201209250000/0.453.pdf « Convention sur le commerce international des espèces de faune et de flore sauvages menacées d’extinction conclue à Washington »], 3 mars 1973 (consulted on 14 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tayap is rich in speleological sites. On its hill, which is more than 544 meters high, are to be found grottos or rocks which have been physically deformed to create a series of displaced scales. One of the grottos contains nests of [[Picathartes|bald rockfowl]], a bird threatened with extinction.&lt;ref&gt;De Wasseige C., de Marcken P., Bayol N., Hiol Hiol F., Mayaux Ph., Desclée B., Nasi R., Billand A., Defourny P. et Eba’a R., ''Les forêts du bassin du Congo - État des Forêts 2010'', Luxembourg, Office des publications de l’Union Européenne, 2012, 276 p. ({{ISBN|978-92-79-22717-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; One of the rocks, of triangular shape, forms a genuine shelter at a height of more than 100 meters and acted as a refuge for Cameroonian nationalists during the Cameroon’s struggle for independence.

=== Environment ===
Tayap is situated in the Northern zone of the forest of the Congo Basin. Vegetation is essentially [[woodland]]. Two types of forests coexist: the [[primary forest]] met at the peaks of the hills and the [[secondary forest]] which results from the destruction of primary forests for agriculture or forestry. The forest of the Congo Basin suffers damage from deforestation in very specific areas&lt;ref&gt;[DOI 10.2788/48830], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This deforestation is explained first of all by the important development of forestry, an economic alternative which the Cameroon has found to compensate for falling prices of cocoa and coffee, its main resources in 1990, but also by the practice of cultivation on burned ground which goes on in intertropical forest zones. The annual rate of deforestation in Cameroon varies between 0.5 and 1.2 per cent a year. In absolute terms, estimates of annual deforestation vary between 80,000 and 200,000 hectares&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/grand-angle/2008/09/17/la-guerrecacheede-la-france-cameroun-1958-la-guerrecacheede-la-france_80364 « La guerre cachée de la France au Cameroun »], ''Libération'', 17 Septembre 2008 (consulted on 15 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Tayap still has 1,400 hectares of forest up to 1,200 meters, or about 30% of its area. Essentially, it subsists on the peaks of hills.

== History ==
In the aftermaths of [[World War II]], Cameroon was placed under the protection of France and Britain and obtained, like [[Togo]], the status of associated territory of the [[French Union]]. From the 1940s and 1950s onwards, the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]] (UPC), a national liberation movement led by [[Ruben Um Nyobe]],&lt;ref name="ACH"&gt;[[Achille Mbembe]], 1996, ''La naissance du maquis dans le Sud-Cameroun (1920-1960). Histoire des usages de la raison en colonie'', Paris, Karthala, 438 p., ({{ISBN|9782865376001}})&lt;/ref&gt; played a central role in Cameroon’s progress towards independence. In 1955, following violence which caused the deaths of many Cameroonians, the UPC was dissolved and its leaders began resistance. The area around Tayap was one of the bastions of nationalist resistance in the [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]] led by Ruben Um Nyobe. According to the historian of [[postcolonialism]], [[Achille Mbembe]], the village of Ngog included after 1956 fifteen or so of its inhabitants who were engaged in resistance in the bush.&lt;ref name="ACH"/&gt;

== Administration and politics ==
Tayap is a chieftainate of the third degree In Cameroon, traditional chieftainates are a scale of administrative organization. Chieftainates were micro-states before colonization and can be of first, second or third degree according to their territorial or historic importance. To date, the last chief of the village, Germain Francois Yogo, died on 17 June 2008. Ever since, the village has been without a chief. A transparent election should be organized by the Cameroon government in order to furnish the village with a democratically elected chief. The functioning, management and development of the village are currently led by the Association of inhabitants of the villages of Omog and Tayap (AROTAD).

Two parties coexist in the village: the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]] (UPC) and the [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (RDPC). At the time of the last linked legislative and municipal elections which took place in Cameroon on 30 September 2013, the UPC received 32% of the vote compared with 68% for the RDPC.

== Population and society ==

=== Demography ===
Tayap contained 254 inhabitants (57 households) comprising 132 men (52%) and 122 women (48%) at the last census in 2010.10 The population of Tayap represents 2.5% of the population of the commune of Ngog Mapubi. A majority of the population are young and for the most part comprise [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa people]], plus a minority (8%) made up of other Cameroon tribes (Bamenda, [[Bamileke people|Bamileke]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Beti-Pahuin peoples|Beti]]). It is distributed along the roads and pathways in a multitude of hamlets. The latter are from 0.5 to 2 kilometers from each other. The two main agglomerations are central Tayap and Libolo. The village comprises about sixty houses.

=== Health ===
Tayap does not possess any health establishments. The nearest health centre is at Boumnyebel, 12&amp;nbsp;km from Tayap. The nearest hospital is at Yaounde (86&amp;nbsp;km from Tayap).&lt;ref&gt;Système d'information géographique, Cameroon, consulted on 15 October 2014 [http://www.mng-cameroon.org/SIG/default.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other basic social services ===
The village of Tayap is provided with drinking water by three pits or sink holes worked by a hand pump with a lever. The water is then taken in buckets or jerrycans to wherever it will be used. The village of Tayap is not electrified despite the presence of a high tension line at the village of Omog. The absence of electricity is an important obstacle to the development of Tayap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.237online.com/article-16121-mamb--le-ces-ouvre-ses-portes.html « Mamb : le CES ouvre ses portes »] (consulted on15 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The very light winds do not allow a wind-power solution. On the other hand, there is no river with hydroelectric potential close to the village (except at about 8k, accessible only by a bush path).

== Education ==
[[File:Tayap.JPG|thumb|Primary school classroom]]
In 2003, Tayap was equipped with a primary school constructed by the local population. The school welcomed 34 pupils from the age of six for its first year of operation, and 75 since 2010. The school is mid-way (about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km) between the hamlets of Libolo and Tayap. In April 2006, the Cameroon government provided two extra classrooms, taking the total number of public school classrooms in Tayap to four. Each class includes two levels, in order to offer all six levels of primary education. After primary school, pupils from the village continue their education in secondary schools (CES) at Lamal-Pougoue or Mamb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apvcameroun.cm/rapportbnc/Etat_des_lieux_des_missions_BNC_2013.pdf « Rapport de la brigade nationale de contrôle pour l'exercice 2013 du Ministère des eaux et de la forêt »]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} (consulted on 15 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
The population of Tayap is mainly Catholic or Protestant Christian. Two places of worship exist in the village: a Cameroon Presbyterian church and a catholic church.

== Culture ==
The population of Tayap retains four elements of its culture:

*Food, with the legendary dish ''bongo’o tchobi'', a dish of fish accompanied by macabo, plantain, [[cassava]] or cassava sticks. The local breakfast based on cassava cake is called ''mintoumba'', with traditional [[palm wine]].
*The rhythms of the landscape, with Ngola chants and Assiko [[belly dance]].
*Cultural marriage in three stages (''li bat Ngond'', which means “the proposal of marriage” in [[basaa language]] ; ''li ti pos'', which means “give the bottle” for the engagement; and ''bijeck bi lon'', which means “food for the family” for the customary marriage.
*[[Phytotherapy]], which uses the plants of the countryside.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Economy ==
In 2013, the active population reached 179 persons. Most jobs in the village are based on agriculture.

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Produits forestiers non ligneux récoltés à Tayap.jpg|thumb|[[Non-timber forest product]] : ''[[Cola (plant)|Cola pachycarpa K. Schum.]]'' or ''komngoei'' in [[basaa language]]]]
Agriculture is the main source of income for the village of Tayap. Trade in [[non-timber forest product]]s is also carried out. Economic activity concentrates on agriculture with its cultures of investment ([[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] and [[palm oil]]), food-production (plantains, [[cassava]], cocoyam, [[taro]], peanuts, bananas) fruit ([[Dacryodes edulis|bush pear]], [[mango]], [[lemon]], orange, grapefruit, papaya, [[kola nut]]s) and market gardening (pimento, vegetables). These products are traded at Boumnyebel and Yaounde.

=== Other activities ===
The population of Tayap also practices the raising of small animals, fishing and hunting. Tayap has 6 units for pressing palm oil and mutual microfinance. With the construction of two ecolodges and the recognition of existing guest houses, an offer of eco-tourism is in the process of becoming established as an activity which generates extra income for the village. Illegal exploitation of the forest is also a means of subsistence for certain members of the village.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seed.uno/awards/all/tayap-eco-orchards.html « Tayap Eco-Orchards »], on seedinit.org (consulted on 14 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local development initiatives ===
Since 2011, Tayap has been the site of a pilot project to develop agro-ecology and ecotourism as part of the struggle against deforestation, to protect the biodiversity of the village lands and to develop activities which generate income for the inhabitants. This project, called The Ecological Orchards of Tayap, in 2011 received the SEED prize awarded by the SEED initiative (Supporting Entrepreneurs for Environment and Development), a world partnership for sustainable development created in 2002 by UNEP, the UNDP and the IUCN at the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agripo.net/nos-realisations-en-chiffres/ « AGRIPO, nos réalisationss en chiffres »] (consulted on 6 February 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2014 and 2015, the project allowed th restoration of 110 hectaresof forest, organized into 3 green classes to welcome children from the locality and create a few green jobs for young people. On the ground, two ecogites allow tourists to be welcomed with the aim of developing the eco-tourism offer as an alternative source of income for the locals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sgp.undp.org/index.php?option=com_sgpprojects&amp;view=projectdetail&amp;id=21011&amp;Itemid=205 « Projet pilote de développement agro-écologique et éco-touristique pour la protection de la biodiversité et des terres dans le village de Tayap »] (consulted on 14 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; A renewable fund of 1,000,000 francs has likewise been put in place by the community with the support of the UNDP’s GEF SPG in order to allocate microcredits to women, and also to finance entrepreneurial initiatives.17 A series of strip cartoons which present the adventure of Tayap development and the problems of African villages facing deforestation and cultivation on burned ground has likewise been created within the framework of the project.

In 2015, the AFD (French Development Agency) and the CIRAD (Centre for international cooperation in agronomical research for development) awarded the Ecological Orchards of Tayap “Agriculture and Forests Climate Challenge” prize for Lessening of climatic disruption in agriculture. In 2016, the ISTF Innovation Prize from Yale University was awarded to the project.

== Transport ==
Tayap is located about an hour from Yaounde and two hours from Douala along the motorway which links them. The line of the Douala-Yaounde railwayline does not serve the village of Tayap.

'''Telephone numbers in South Korea''' are organized and assigned using the following scheme.

== Overview ==
* International call out: 00N (where N is the carrier code) followed by the distant country code and telephone number.
* Calling into Korea: +82 XX XXXX YYYY. The leading "0" is dropped when dialling into South Korea from overseas.
* Some 1566/1577/1588 telephone numbers cannot be dialed from overseas.
* Domestic long distance call: 0NN (where NN is the carrier code) followed by the 0XX area code and XXXX YYYY number. See [[#Domestic long-distance|Domestic long-distance service code]] and [[#Area codes|Area code]].
* Call to cellular : 01N XXXX YYYY (see [[#Mobile_prefixes|Mobile phone number]]). When phone call is made between unified 010-number subscribers, leading 010 can be dropped (XXXX YYYY).
* Special service call : 0N0 XXXX YYYY (see [[#Services|Special service]])

For example;
* Call 02-312-3456 within Seoul: 312-3456
* Call 02-312-3456 from elsewhere: 02-312-3456
* Call 051-212-3456 within Busan: 212-3456
* Call 051-212-3456 from elsewhere: 051-212-3456
* Call 02-312-3456 from abroad: +82-2-312-3456

South Korea uses an open dialing plan with a total length (including 0) of 9 to 11 digits and, within city, subscriber numbers 7 to 8 digits long. Dialing from mobile phones to any type of phone except 010 numbers, the area code must be included.

In 1998, telephone numbers in Seoul starting with 2 and 6 added more digit (02-2XX-YYYY to 02-22XX-YYYY, 02-6XX-YYYY to 02-26XX-YYYY). Before area codes were shortened from 4 digit to 2~3 digit in June 2000, there were 1 digit exchange number (usually "2") with some 2 digit exchange numbers so some phone numbers like 0347-61-XXXX, 0443-2-XXXX or 0525-40-XXXX existed. (now 031-761-XXXX, 043-652-XXXX and 055-340-XXXX)

The fifth '''USS ''Enterprise''''', a [[barque]]-rigged [[screw sloop]], was launched 13 June 1874 at [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]], [[Kittery, Maine]], [[United States|US]], by [[John W. Griffiths]], a private contractor; and commissioned 16 March 1877, Commander [[George C. Remey]] in command. She was later commanded by [[Bowman H. McCalla]] around 1890, followed by Commander [[Albert S. Barker]] from 1892-1896.

==Overview==

''Enterprise'''s first duty after fitting out at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], took her to the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] for surveying operations. Returning to Norfolk in April 1878, she remained there only briefly, sailing 27 May for surveying duty up the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Madeira River|Madeira]] Rivers. On 1 October 1878 off the coast of [[Pará]], [[Brazil]], Seaman [[Thomas Smith (Medal of Honor recipient, 1878)|Thomas Smith]] rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which he was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].&lt;ref name="moh"/&gt; This surveying duty completed, she repaired at [[New York City]], then in December 1878 joined the U.S. naval forces in European waters, calling at numerous ports in northern Europe and in the [[Mediterranean]]. She returned to the [[Washington Navy Yard]] on 9 May 1880 and was placed out of commission.

Recommissioned on 12 January 1882, she cruised the east coast until 1 January 1883 when she sailed on a three-year [[hydrographic survey]] that took her completely around the world. During this time, she was commanded by [[Albert S. Barker]]. Her findings on this cruise added materially to the knowledge of the oceans, their currents, and their bottoms. During the journey she was a neutral witness of the [[Battle of Fuzhou]] on 23 August 1884 during the [[Sino-French War]]. ''Enterprise'' was decommissioned at New York on 21 March 1886.

Placed back in commission on 4 October 1887, ''Enterprise'' sailed from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in January 1888 for two years in the waters of Europe, the Mediterranean, and the east coast of [[Africa]], where she showed the flag and looked out for United States' interests. She returned to New York in March 1890 and was decommissioned on 20 May.
[[File:Enterprise by Walter Lofthouse Dean.jpg|thumb|300px|''Enterprise'' working out of Massachusetts by Walter Lofthouse Dean]]
''Enterprise'' was again commissioned 8 July 1890, and for the next year operated principally in the Caribbean. From September 1891 until September 1892, she served as training and practice ship at the [[United States Naval Academy]], [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. On 17 October 1892 at Boston, she was lent to the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] for duty as a school ship at the [[Massachusetts Maritime Academy]]. In that capacity she trained cadets for some 17 years (the current MMA [[training ship]] was named [[USTS Enterprise|USTS ''Enterprise']] in honor of her until the name was changed to USTS ''Kennedy''). Returned to the Navy on 4 May 1909, ''Enterprise'' was sold on 1 October 1909. The hulk was burned for salvage near Boston in 1910&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/09941.htm Navsources]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wakhan, Badakhshan.jpg|thumb|The [[Wakhan Corridor]]|200px|right]]
'''Wakhan''' or "the Wakhan" (also spelt '''Vakhan'''; [[Persian language|Persian]] and {{lang-ps|واخان}}, ''Vâxân'' and ''Wāxān'' respectively; {{lang-tg|Вахон}}, ''Vaxon'') is a very mountainous and rugged part of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]], [[Hindu Kush]] and [[Karakoram]] regions of [[Afghanistan]].  [[Wakhan District]] is a [[Districts of Afghanistan|district]] in [[Badakshan Province]].

==Geography==
[[File:Vakhan (Wakhan) Corridor.jpg|thumb|The Wakhan and surrounding areas along the border of Afghanistan and Tajikistan|300px|right]]
Wakhan people are also located in Pakistan, Gilgit, upper Hunza Gojal Velly, where numerous people speaks wakhi and they have different culture which include dance, food, festival and much more. 
The Wakhan is located in the extreme north-east of Afghanistan.  It contains the headwaters of the [[Amu Darya]] ([[Oxus]]) River, and was an ancient corridor for travellers from the [[Tarim Basin]] to [[Badakshan]].

Until 1883 the Wakhan included the whole valley of the [[Panj River]] and the [[Pamir River]], as well as the upper flow of the Panj River known as the [[Wakhan River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juldu.com/Pamir/2%20-%20Significance%20of%20Geopolitical%20Issues%20(Eng).pdf Hermann Kreutzmann (2005): ''The Significance of Geopolitical Issues for Development of Mountainous Areas of Central Asia] Map at p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  An 1873 agreement between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] and [[Russia]] split the Wakhan by delimiting spheres of influence for the two countries at the Panj and Pamir rivers, and an agreement between Britain and Afghanistan in 1893 confirmed the new border.&lt;ref name="law.fsu.edu"&gt;[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS026.pdf International Boundary Study of the Afghanistan-USSR Boundary (1983)] by the US [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the name Wakhan is now generally used to refer to the Afghan area south of the two rivers.  The northern part of the historic Wakhan is now part of the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]] in Tajikistan.

The only road into the Wakhan is a rough track from [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]] past [[Qila-e Panja]] to [[Sarhad-e Broghil]].  Paths lead from the end of the road to the [[Wakhjir Pass]], a mountain pass leading to China which is closed to travellers.

The western part of the Wakhan, between Ishkashim and Qila-e Panja, is known as ''Lower Wakhan'', which includes the valley of the Panj River.  The valleys of the Wakhan River, the Pamir River and their tributaries, and the terrain between, are known as ''Upper Wakhan''.

The eastern extremity of Upper Wakhan is known as the ''Pamir Knot'', the area where the [[Himalayas]], [[Tian Shan]], [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]], and [[Hindu Kush]] ranges meet. West of the Pamir Knot is the [[Little Pamir]], a broad U-shaped grassy valley 100&amp;nbsp;km long and 10&amp;nbsp;km wide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/publications/2010_akf_wakhan.pdf Aga Khan Development Network (2010):  ''Wakhan and the Afghan Pamir''] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; which contains Chaqmaqtin Lake, the headwaters of the Aksu or [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab River]].  At the eastern end of the Little Pamir is the [[Tegermansu Valley]], from where the closed [[Tegermansu Pass]] (4,827 m) leads to China.  The [[Great Pamir]] or ''Big Pamir'', a 60&amp;nbsp;km long valley south of [[Zorkol]] lake, drained by the Pamir River, lies to the northwest of the Little Pamir.

The mountain range that divides the two Pamirs is known as the [[Nicholas Range (Pamir Mountains)|Nicholas Range]].&lt;ref name=ju&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juldu.com/Pamir/geography.html |title=Pamir and Wakhan Geography |publisher=Juldu.com |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  West of the Nicholas Range, between the Great Pamir and the lower valley of the Wakhan River, is the ''Wakhan Range'', which culminates in the ''Koh-e Pamir'' (6,320 m).

The roads in the region have small [[shrine]]s to [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili Muslim]] [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] and are adorned with "special stones and curled ibex and sheep horns", which are symbols of purity in the [[Zoroastrian]] faiths, once present in the region before the arrival of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/travel/20Pamir.html?pagewanted=all|title=Pamir Mountains, the Crossroads of History|last=Isaacson|first=Andy|date=17 December 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wakhan Corridor ===
{{Main|Wakhan Corridor}}
The Wakhan is connected to [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County|Tashkurgan Tajik County]], China, by a long, narrow strip called the Wakhan Corridor, which separates the [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] region of [[Tajikistan]] from the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] of Pakistan.[[File:Wakhan Corridor.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Wakhan between Afghanistan and Tajikistan]]

The Wakhan River flows through the corridor from the east to Qila-e Panja where it joins the Pamir River to become the Panj River which then forms the border.

In the south the corridor is bordered by the high mountains of the [[Hindu Kush]], crossed by the [[Broghol]] pass, the [[Irshad Pass]] and the disused [[Dilisang Pass]]&lt;ref&gt;The pass was crossed by a couple in 1950 and by a couple in 2004.  See [http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04r2.htm J.Mock and K. O'Neil: Expedition Report]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Pakistan]].

==History==
{{See also|Durand Line}}
Historically the Wakhan has been an important region for thousands of years as it is where the Western and Eastern portions of Central Asia meet.

Western Wakhan (休密 ''Xiumi'') was conquered in the early part of the 1st century CE by [[Kujula Kadphises]], the first "Great Kushan," and was one of the five ''xihou'' or principalities that formed the nucleus of the original [[Kushan]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/hou_han_shu.html Hill, John E. 2004. ''The Western Regions according to the Hou Hanshu.'' Draft annotated English translation.] Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1883 Wakhan was a principality on both sides of the Panj and Pamir Rivers, ruled by a hereditary ruler (''mir'') with his capital at [[Qila-e Panja]].&lt;ref name =kreutzmann2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juldu.com/Pamir/HERMANN%20KREUTZMANN.pdf |title=Hermann Kreutzmann (2003) '&amp;#39;Ethnic minorities and marginality in the Pamirian Knot'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1880s (1880-1895 &lt;ref&gt;O. Mirzo, WAKHAN, Khuroson, Khujand, 2018, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;), under pressure from Britain, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] the Emir of Afghanistan imposed Afghan rule on the Wakhan.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aftoc.html Library of Congress – Country Study of Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreements between Britain and [[Russia]] in 1873 and between Britain and Afghanistan in 1893 effectively split the historic area of Wakhan by making the Panj and Pamir Rivers the border between Afghanistan and the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="law.fsu.edu"/&gt;  On its south side, the [[Durand Line]] agreement of 1893 marked the boundary between [[British India]] and Afghanistan.  This left a narrow strip of land as a buffer between the two empires.

In 1949, when [[Mao Zedong]] completed the Communist takeover of China, the borders were permanently closed, sealing off the 2,000-year-old caravan route and turning the corridor into a [[wikt:cul-de-sac|cul-de-sac]]. When the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviets invaded Afghanistan]] in December 1979, they occupied the Wakhan and built strong military posts at [[Sarhad-e Broghil]] and elsewhere.  To facilitate access they built a bridge across the Pamir River at Prip, near [[Gaz Khan]]. However, the area did not see fighting.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

In 2010 the Wakhan was reported to be peaceful and unaffected by the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in the rest of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=In Icy Tip of Afghanistan, War Seems Remote |first=Edward |last=Wong|newspaper=The New York Times |date= 27 October 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/world/asia/28wakhan.html|accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Wakhi, Kyrgyz and Khowar are the major ethnic groups of Wakhan.
Wakhan is sparsely populated.  The total population is estimated at about 10,600.&lt;ref name=unep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/WCR.pdf |title=Wak.p65 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of its inhabitants speak the Vakhi or [[Wakhi language]] (x̌ik zik), and belong to an ethnic group known as Vakhi or [[Wakhi (ethnic group)|Wakhi]]. Nomadic [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] herders live at the higher altitudes.&lt;ref name=shahrani&gt;Shahrani, M. Nazif. (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2003 report by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the population of Wakhan suffers from lack of education, poverty, ill health, food insecurity and [[opium]] addiction.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

===Wakhi===
{{Main|Wakhi people}}
The Wakhi population of Wakhan was 9,444 in 2003.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;  Almost all of them adhere to the Shia [[Ismaili]] faith and some of them speak [[Ishkashimi language]].&lt;ref name=shahrani /&gt;  Wakhi people also inhabit several areas adjacent to the Wakhan in Tajikistan, Pakistan and China.

The Wakhi practice agriculture in the river valleys, and herd animals in the summer pastures at higher elevations.

The dominant sect of Islam in the region is [[Ismaili]], much milder than the strict form of Islam generally practiced in the country. However, in [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]], the city at the western mouth of the Wakhan, stricter observance is demanded. The area has been long neglected by the central government of Afghanistan and the people are poor, many being traditional [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] living in [[yurt]]s and lacking basic services. However non-governmental organizations such as the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] have taken an interest in the area. The [[Central Asia Institute]], founded by [[Greg Mortenson]], has built 11 schools in the region.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

There is a trickle of tourists who engage in [[trekking]] and [[mountaineering]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Alastair Leithead on [[BBC News 24]] on 26 December 2007, presented a half-hour feature about Wakhan, focusing particularly on the work of [[expatriate]] British Doctor [[Alexander Duncan (doctor)|Alexander Duncan]], which provided a significant piece of extended media reporting from this inaccessible area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leithead |first=Alastair |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6988551.stm |title=Doctor on call in Afghanistan |publisher=BBC News |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also covered the Pamir Festival in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pamirtimes.wordpress.com/2007/11/20/pamir-festival-mehboob-aziz/ |title=Pamir Times |publisher=Pamirtimes.wordpress.com |date=20 November 2007 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kyrgyz===
The [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] population of Wakhan was 1,130 in 2003, all in the eastern part of Wakhan.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;  The Kyrgyz are [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] Muslims.

The suppression of the [[Central Asian Revolt|1916 rebellion]] against [[Russian Empire|Russian]] rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to China and [[Afghanistan]]. Most of [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] refugees settled in Wakhan region of Afghanistan.

Until 1978 the northeastern portion of Wakhan (the Great Pamir and the Little Pamir) was home to about 3–5 thousand ethnic Kyrgyz.&lt;ref name=reu&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/featuredCrisis/idUSSP389507 FACTBOX-Key facts about the Wakhan Corridor]. [[Reuters]]. 12 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04r3.htm |title=Mock and O'Neil, Expedition Report (2004) |publisher=Mockandoneil.com |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 almost all the Kyrgyz inhabitants [[Kyrgyz in Pakistan|fled to Pakistan]] in the aftermath of the [[Saur Revolution]].  They requested 5,000 visas from the United States Consulate in [[Peshawar]] for resettlement in [[Alaska]] (a region that shares a similar climate and temperature with the Wakhan Corridor). Their request was denied.  In the meantime, the heat and the unsanitary conditions of the refugee camp were killing off the Kyrgyz refugees at an alarming rate.  [[Turkey]] which was under the military coup rule of General [[Kenan Evren]], stepped in, and resettled the entire group in the [[Lake Van]] region of Turkey in 1982. The village of [[Ulupamir]] (or “Great Pamir” in Kyrgyz) in [[Erciş]] on Lake Van was given to these, where more than 5,000 of them still reside today. The documentary film "[[37 Uses for a Dead Sheep]] – the story of the Pamir Kirghiz" was based on the life of these Kyrgyz/Kirgiz in their new home.

[[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] from Wakhan region of [[Afghanistan]] moved to [[Pakistan]] in the 1970s. Nearly 1,100 of these were accepted by [[Turkey]] to settle in [[Ulupamir]] (or “Great Pamir” in Kyrgyz), their resettlement village in [[Van Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EurasiaNet |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/20052012-turkey-kyrgyz-nomads-struggle-to-make-peace-with-settled-existence/ |title=Turkey: Kyrgyz Nomads Struggle To Make Peace With Settled Existence |publisher=Eurasiareview.com |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Kyrgyz returned to the Wakhan in October 1979, following the [[Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=kreutzmann2003/&gt;

===Kho===
The [[Kho people|Kho]] (or Khowar) population of Wakhan was 1,230 in 2003, all in the eastern part of Wakhan. The Khos are Sunni and Ismaili Muslims.

==Tourism==
In recent years the Wakhan has become a destination for adventurous trekkers, and several tour companies are offering trips to the area.&lt;ref&gt;Sleight, Christopher [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/8528678.stm Tourism plan for Afghan mountains] 25 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; BBC correspondent [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]] has recommended the area as a place to take a wonderful, and relatively safe, holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Emma [http://www.iknowagreatplace.com/community/tips/view.aspx?id=1224&amp;tid=909 BBC's John Simpson recommends: Trek Afghanistan] 7 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kate Humble]], a BBC television presenter, reports that the area is beautiful and the people friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Humble  | first = Kate  | author-link = Kate Humble  | title = War and peace: Kate Humble treks into Afghanistan  | newspaper = Independent on Sunday  | date = 6 February 2010  | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/asia/war-and-peace-kate-humble-treks-into-afghanistan-1890525.html  | accessdate = 25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The Wakhan plays a large role in [[Greg Mortenson]]'s book, ''Stones into Schools''.  This book tells the story of the building of a school in the Kyrgyz village of [[Bozai Gumbaz]]. However, the factual accuracy of this account is strongly disputed in [[Jon Krakauer]]'s ebook [[Three Cups of Deceit]].
