'''''A Nightmare on Drug Street''''' is a 1989 [[direct-to-video]] [[Substance abuse|anti-drug]] [[short film]] directed by Traci Wald Donat.&lt;ref name=people /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/nightmare_on_drug_street_no_pizza_no_pizza_no_pizza_no_pizza_no_pizza |title=Nightmare on Drug Street: 'No Pizza, No Pizza, No Pizza, No Pizza, No Pizza...'|location=Dangerous Minds|author=Richard Metzger|date=2 January 2013|access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film introduces three young characters, Felipe ([[Raymond Cruz]]), Jill ([[Joleen Lutz]]), and Eddie ([[Adam Jeffries]]), who are now dead. They each died at around the same time, and now exist only as spirits in some sort of dark purgatory. The cause of their respective deaths is that they each made the mistake of getting involved with drugs, a decision they now regret. The three then proceed to narrate each other's stories about how and why they got involved with drugs, and how it ultimately led to their untimely endings.

Jill narrates Felipe's story. Felipe was a 17 year old senior, and a basketball athlete. However, he smoked [[marijuana|dope]] because he heard college kids did it, and he drank [[beer]] because his dad drank. One evening, Felipe, while under the influence of both, decided to borrow the family car without permission, and go on a [[Driving under the influence|joyride]] around town, taking his best friend, who was also under the influence, and his reluctant younger brother along. However, Felipe's increasingly erratic behavior and near misses while driving, caused his younger brother to become fed up, and he demanded to be let out of the car, to which Felipe grudgingly obliged. Felipe's brother's life was thus, spared, however he was not spared the horror of witnessing the gruesome deaths of Felipe and his friend from an inevitable [[car crash|car wreck]] only a moment later.

Eddie narrates Jill's story. Jill was a 14 year old high school student, who was quite shy. One evening, she had a party for all her classmates, where she met an attractive new student. This student took her on a walk outside alone, where he introduced her to [[cocaine]], as a mood enhancer. Jill was reluctant to try it, but the new student claimed it would one day be legalized. After she snorted an initial dose, Jill was enamored with the feeling it gave her, and quickly became addicted, thus beginning a major downward spiral. She began trading off all her money and possessions to [[drug dealers]] to obtain more cocaine, even resorting to stealing from family and friends, becoming increasingly and majorly depressed the whole way. Finally, one day after a bad but desperate trade with a sleazy dealer for another gram of cocaine, Jill finished it off quickly, and died that evening, by [[suicide]] from an [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of cocaine and unidentified pills.

Felipe narrates Eddie's story. Eddie was an 11 year old, elementary school student, and aspiring scientist. One day, while at his friends' house, he was [[peer pressure|pressured by them]] to experiment with some [[crack cocaine]], and Eddie reluctantly tried a dose, and went home, where his mother sensed something about Eddie was off. To deflect any further parental suspicion, Eddie was instructed via telephone to smoke a second dose to undo the [[side effects|effects]] of the first one. That evening, at dinner, Eddie's mother and father both noticed something about him was still off, but they dismissed it as a cold or allergy. Suddenly, without warning, Eddie collapsed and died of [[cardiac arrest]], a result of the crack's effect on a congenital heart defect, that no one realized he had.

After the three tell their stories, they give the viewer tips, on how to make smarter decisions to either avoid drugs altogether, and how to get help if started, so that the same fate doesn't await them.

'''Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''Akademija scenskih umjentosti Sarajevo'') is a faculty within the [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], dedicated to the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detail.de/artikel_archipelagos-academy-of-performing-arts-sarajevo_22467_En.htm/|title=Detail.de: ''Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo''(in Bosnian) &amp;#91;cited February 21, 2012&amp;#93;|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106064826/http://www.detail.de/artikel_archipelagos-academy-of-performing-arts-sarajevo_22467_En.htm#|archive-date=2012-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo was officially opened in 1981 with the inaugural Department of [[Acting]]. This was followed by the opening of the Department of [[Theatre director|Directing]] in 1989, the Department of [[Dramaturgy]] in 1994 and the Department of [[Theatrical producer|Production]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.unsa.ba/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D105%26Itemid%3D160%26lang%3Dhr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723210830/http://www.asu.unsa.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=105&amp;Itemid=160&amp;lang=hr |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important segment of the academy's practice is its cooperation with the Open Stage "Obala", a prominent Sarajevo theater, where students present their works along with professional actors, directors and writers.

The need for the [[Academy for Performing Arts]] arose because, according to data from the year 1981, Bosnia and Herzegovina theaters had around 180 employees of which only 24 had the appropriate academic qualifications. Therefore, it was decided to establish Academy for Performing Arts in Sarajevo which was open to students from Bosnia and Herzegovina and other republics of [[former Yugoslavia]]. Academy of Performing Arts officially started working on December 2, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729112449/http://www.asu.unsa.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=61&amp;lang=hr/ ''Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo''(in Bosnian) &amp;#91;cited February 21, 2012&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it was announced that the [[Sarajevo Canton]] and the Cantonal Development Institute would be funding the construction of a 10 million [[Convertible Mark|KM]] building and center for the Academy of Performing Arts, primarily because working conditions for students and faculty alike have been subpar for the past decade. Construction on the new {{convert|4600|m²|0|abbr=on}} center began in mid-2010 in the [[Centar Municipality, Sarajevo|Centar Municipality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sa-c.net/index.php/projects/projects-archive/item/419-akademija-scenskih-umjetnosti-sarajevo.html |title=Renovacija Akademije scenskih umjetnosti (Renovation of the Academy of Performing Arts) |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sarajevo Construction News |accessdate=15 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529093453/http://sa-c.net/index.php/projects/projects-archive/item/419-akademija-scenskih-umjetnosti-sarajevo.html |archivedate=29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADMS (advanced disaster management simulator) is an emergency and disaster management training [[Simulator|simulation]] system designed to train [[incident commander]]s, first responders, and incident command teams in a real-time, interactive [[virtual reality]](VR) environment.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; ADMS was first introduced by Environmental Tectonics Corporation [http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=ETCC:US (ETCC:US)] in 1992. The development of ADMS was in response to the crash of [[British Airtours Flight 28M]] at the Manchester airport in 1985, in which 55 people died. Following the accident research indicated that first responder training should include realistic scenarios. The first ADMS system was produced for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]], and delivered to [[RAF|Royal Air Force’s (RAF) Manston Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Virtual Preparation for ARFF Emerfgencies | journal = Industrial Fire Journal | date = 2008-10-01| id = | url = http://www.hemmingfire.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/433/Virtual_preparation_for_ARFF_emergencies.html | accessdate = 2010-09-17 | quote = ADMS was initially developed in response to the Manchester airport disaster in 1985 in which 55 people died. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, ADMS has evolved into a modular, expandable disaster simulation platform, with systems in use worldwide.

== History ==

===Virtual reality and emergency management training===
The successful use of virtual reality simulation in disaster management training initiatives is a popular area for research. It has been found that when trainees are able to participate, both verbally and physically in a training exercise, retention is 90%, in great contrast to a 10% retention rate of what they hear, and 50% retention rate of what they see and hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Improving Safety Instruction and Results: Five Principles of Sound Training |journal=American Society of Safety Engineers |date=December 2000 |first=Shawn J. |last=Adams |pages=40–41 |id= |url=http://assevirtualsymposium.pbworks.com/f/adams_1200.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-16 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally classroom lectures, tabletop exercises and live-training drills have been utilized for training. While these teaching methodologies are effective, virtual reality simulation seems to have bridged the gap between them. Virtual reality offers the opportunity to create an emergency situation that could not otherwise be experienced due to safety, cost and environmental factors.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; From a safety standpoint, training in a synthetic environment allows the student to experiment while carrying out dangerous actions, and offers the ability to repeat the exercise until the trainee feels confident and prepared for real-life incidents.

== Technology ==
The ADMS relies on a [[physics engine]] and built in [[artificial intelligence]] to provide realistic, 3D emergency situations. The Disaster scenarios include [[algorithm]]s which take into account: type of threat, time of day, precipitation, wind, visibility, condition of casualties, terrain, and traffic and bystander behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Virtual Threat, Real Sweat | journal = American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) | year = 2007 | first = Jenni | last = Jarventaus| id = | url = http://www.astd.org/LC/2007/0507_jarventaus.htm | accessdate = 2010-09-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100814235126/http://www.astd.org/LC/2007/0507_jarventaus.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADMS training exercises are unscripted and open-ended, requiring interactive decision making&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{Cite conference | first = Michael | last = Louka |author2= Claudio Balducelli | title = Virtual Reality Tools for Emergency Operation Support and Training | booktitle = Proceedings of TIEMS (The International Emergency Management Society) | date = 2001| id = | url =http://www2.hrp.no/vr/publications/tiems2001.pdf | accessdate = 2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participation from the users to affect the outcome of the training exercise. The development, escalation, or resolution of the situation is determined by the trainees' decisions and the use of intelligent resources they command.

ADMS is a networked framework and a family of applications which may be run on a single station or as a multi-user system with several networked stations giving independent access to several viewpoints and control interfaces within the same environment and scenario. ADMS projects its simulations using panoramic [[high-definition multimedia interface]], visual displays and directional sound. The simulation engine includes key models including: artificial intelligence, physics, logic, and messaging and applications comprising a visual engine, sound engine, messaging daemon and [[graphical user interface]].

=== Environments ===
ADMS  environments are developed in either geo-typical or geo-specific environments. Geo-specific environments are created using exact [[3D modeling]] of the specified location, and can include buildings, streets, vehicles, terrain and people, specific airports or schools, or entire cities.

== Products and applications ==
* '''ADMS-COMMAND''' Designed for training incident commanders in a diverse range of emergency scenarios, ranging from car accidents to low-frequency, high casualty situations, either in single or multi-agency operations. Trainees make decisions and give verbal commands, enabling the real-time action of the simulator.&lt;ref name="virtuallyreal"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Virtually Real | journal = EMS Magazine | date = 2009-08-01 | first = John | last = Erich| id = | url = http://www.emsresponder.com/print/EMS-Product-News/Virtually-Real/2$8388 | accessdate = 2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can be expanded to include additional simulation elements, including vehicle controls and cabs, and 180 degree immersive visual displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://medtechiq.ning.com/video/2140535:Video:5427 | title = BioDefense:ADMS:Advanced Disaster Management Simulator | accessdate = 2010-09-17 | last = Clyburn | first = Conrad | date = 2008-10-30 | work = MedTech IQ | publisher = Clymer Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''ADMS-DRIVE''' Designed to train, assess and recertify drivers in safe and effective driving procedures. It is also utilized as a training platform to train emergency responders to drive under stressful situations, and by airport snow removal teams to train in snow removal operations during winter conditions. ADMS-DRIVE immerses the user in a realistic, virtual environment in which dynamic elements such as traffic, signal lights, people and weather create a realistic and challenging representation of the situation.&lt;ref name="virtuallyreal" /&gt;
* '''ADMS-ARFF''' Designed as an [[aircraft rescue and firefighting]] vehicle simulator which focuses on correct [[turret]] operation, driving and communication, vehicle positioning, firefighting with turrets and Command and Control. The trainee uses controls and joysticks to maneuver the vehicle in an airport environment and deals with airplane disaster.&lt;ref name="virtuallyreal" /&gt;
* '''ADMS-HRET''' HRET (High-reach extendable turret) is intended to be a training aid for operators to become familiar with, and enhance the skills necessary for actual hands on operation of the Rosenbauer HRET. HRET is a portable desktop system that comes with a console that includes a real HRET-joystick and relevant switches. Trainees can drive to the scene, train various external and internal fire scenarios, and penetrate the aircraft by using the piercing device.&lt;ref name="lance" /&gt;
* '''ADMS-BART''' The behavioral assessment research tool (BART) was developed initially for the Netherlands Institute for Safety, Research Department. BART focuses on human behavior and the effect it has in a real-life incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Exit choice, (pre-)movement time and (pre-) evacuation behavior in hotel fire evacuation – Behavioral analysis and validation of the use of serious gaming in experimental research | journal = Procedia Engineering | year = 2010 | first = Margrethe | last = Kobes |author2=Ira Helsloot|author3=Burke de Vries|author4=Jos Post | volume = 3 | pages = 37–51| doi = 10.1016/j.proeng.2010.07.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B9869-50TXY0Y-5-1&amp;_cdi=59121&amp;_user=10&amp;_pii=S1877705810004753&amp;_origin=search&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2010&amp;_sk=999969999&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLzVlb-zSkzV&amp;md5=b82de0602302c37c2f3b336ecd2e0bfa&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf | accessdate = 2010-09-15 | quote = The relative-validation analysis revealed that the use of ADMS-BART can be considered valid as a research tool for research on wayfinding performance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADMS-BART creates an environment where virtual human subjects act as they would in a live situation. This system made it possible to use virtual reality for studying virtual behaviors in fires, allowing for changes in the live environment to mitigate the damages in the event of a live incident.
* '''ADMS-US''' Is a standardized simulation system, programmed with ten (10) geo-typical situation environments which resemble Anytown USA.  ADMS-US is a portable, laptop based simulator which is utilized for either individual or multi-agency training who do not require geo-specific capabilities.

== Compliance ==
On January 27, 2009, the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) awarded ETC STOC II eligibility for the ADMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bop.peostri.army.mil/sites/bop/Contract%20Vehicles/STOCII_DOCS/STOCIIAwardeeswPOCandEMAIL-LotI.pdf |title=STOC II List of Awardees |accessdate=2010-09-17 |date=2010-05-07 |format=PDF |publisher=U.S. Army PEO STRI – Business Opportunities Portal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182252/https://bop.peostri.army.mil/sites/bop/Contract%20Vehicles/STOCII_DOCS/STOCIIAwardeeswPOCandEMAIL-LotI.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  STOC II is an ID/IQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contract vehicle with a ceiling of $17.5 billion over a period of 10 years. All branches of the military are eligible to utilize STOC II to quickly obtain simulation and training solutions from a panel of pre-qualified companies. The purpose of this contract vehicle was to provide an efficient method for the U.S. military and its coalition service members to acquire what they need.

Additionally, ADMS was designed to be NIMS compliant. The [[National Incident Management System]] has developed a unified approach to allow governmental agencies to work in unison with the private sector with the common goal of preparing for, preventing, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the effects of incidents of any cause, size, location, or complexity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10766">The '''Architect Registration Examination''' ('''ARE''')  is the professional [[licensure]] examination adopted by the 50 states of the [[United States]], the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). The exam is also accepted by 11 provincial and territorial architectural associations for architectural registration in Canada. The ARE assesses candidates on the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for provided services in the practice of [[architecture]].

The ARE is developed and maintained by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB). NCARB currently offers two versions of the computer-based exam, ARE 4.0, which will retire on June 30, 2018, and ARE 5.0. Both versions are administered in Prometric test centers across the United States and Canada, as well as London, Abu Dhabi, and Hong Kong.

==History==
The earliest examinations were written and scored by each individual state board. Practicing architects, educators, and specialists in other disciplines were organized to prepare and score these tests. Since each state prepared its own test specifications, test questions, and passing standard, there was little uniformity among the boards on examination, no effective reciprocity system, and no equal protection for the public across the nation.

As NCARB grew, it organized delegates from its Member Boards into working groups during its Annual Meetings to address the problem of exam uniformity. Their efforts eventually led to agreement on a syllabus of written examination subjects. Subsequently, the length of each test and the dates of administration were agreed on, and this concurrence served to achieve the goal of greater consistency in examination questions and scoring.

By the late 1950s, [[standardized testing]] had made impressive progress. The NCARB examination committees studied the latest developments and converted sections of the syllabus to a multiple-choice format by the mid-1960s and made them available to all of NCARB Member Boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/Publications/~/media/Files/PDF/Special-Paper/history.pdf History of NCARB]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, NCARB conducted an extensive "task analysis and validation study" that led to the development of the forerunner of today's ARE. At that time, candidates were required to take all nine divisions over a four-day period and the exam was only offered once a year in major cities across the United States.

In the late 1980s, as the practice of architecture moved into the computer age, NCARB began to develop a computer-based exam. After a decade of research and development, the last paper-and-pencil test was issued in 1996, and the computer-based exam rolled out in 1997.

NCARB conducted comprehensive Practice Analysis studies in 2001, 2007, and 2012 that led to improvements of the ARE. These improvements have since been rolled out in ARE 3.0, ARE 3.1, ARE 4.0, and ARE 5.0, which launched November 1, 2016. ARE 4.0 will retire on June 30, 2018. [2]

==Eligibility==
Before an ARE division can be scheduled, candidates must be approved to test and receive eligibilities from their state board. The majority of states participate in the Direct Eligibility Program, which enables NCARB to manage a candidate’s eligibilities. Most states require completion of a professional degree from the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) ([[Bachelor of Architecture|B.Arch]] or [[Master of Architecture|M.Arch]]), and some require candidates to record professional experience before testing. 
[https://www.ncarb.org/get-licensed/licensing-requirements-tool A full list of requirements for each state is available on the NCARB website.]

==Process==
In order to take the ARE, candidates must meet the requirements of the registration board he or she plans to receive an initial license from, establish an NCARB Record, and receive an Authorization to Test (ATT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/ARE/Getting-Started-With-the-ARE.aspx Getting Started With the ARE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each division of the ARE is taken separately at a Prometric test center. Divisions are scored by Prometric as either pass or fail and then sent to the jurisdiction that grants the candidate the authorization to test, which then notifies the candidate. A pass score is valid for five years, sometime less depending on the jurisdiction's rules. Prior to October 2014, a candidate who failed a division would not be eligible to retake that division for six months, NCARB shortened that time to 60 days for all tests taken since August.

Under the requirements of NCARB's Rolling Clock, a candidate must pass all divisions of the ARE within five years. Some jurisdictions require the exam be completed in less time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/ARE/Taking-the-ARE/Rolling-Clock.aspx NCARB Rolling Clock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulty==

The ARE assesses candidates’ knowledge, skills, and ability to practice architecture independently. It focuses on those services that most affect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Because of this, the exams are rigorous and require demonstration of competency in each of the testing areas.

==Test structure==

NCARB currently offers one version of the exam: ARE 5.0.

=== ARE 3.0 ===
The ARE 3.0 was introduced in 1998. Use was discontinued in 2003. Utilized a similar structure to 4.0. Graphic vignettes and multiple choice questions were on separate tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://davidthaddeus.com/are-facts/|title=ARE Facts|website=David Thaddeus|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam confidentiality==

All NCARB tests are held in strict security and confidence and are protected by [[United States copyright law|U.S. copyright laws]]. Before beginning the test, candidates are required to accept NCARB's Confidentiality Agreement, which prohibits any disclosure of exam content.

Candidates found to have violated the Confidentiality Agreement are referred to NCARB's Committee on Professional Conduct. The Committee reviews each case and then recommends a disciplinary action. The cases are then forwarded to the NCARB Board of Directors for review and final disciplinary action. All disciplinary actions taken by the Board of Directors are final and become a part of each individual's permanent NCARB Record. Individual candidates may also be subject to additional disciplinary measures from their state board.

When exam content is disclosed, NCARB works with the test consultant, Prometric, to determine the impact on the exam. If NCARB finds that it is necessary to remove (or turn off) content, the ability to continuously deliver the ARE is seriously jeopardized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/ARE/Taking-the-ARE/Exam-Security.aspx Exam Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bachelor of Accountancy''', also known as '''Bachelor of Accounting''', is the principal [[academic degree]] in [[accountancy]] in several countries, and is often the only (undergraduate) degree recognised for subsequent practice as a [[professional accountant]]; see [[First professional degree]]. It is abbreviated as '''B.Acy.''', '''B.Acc.''', or '''B. Accty.'''. It is also sometimes titled '''Bachelor of Accounting Science''' (B.Acc.Sci.) or "Baccalaureus [[WIKT:computatio#Latin|Computationis]]" (B.Compt.).&lt;!--  or "Baccalaureus [[WIKT:ratio#Latin|Rationum]]" (B.Rat.). --&gt;

The B.Acy. is extremely specialized: the [[curriculum]] requires study sufficient for professional practice (often at the [[academic major|major-level]]) in [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]], ''and'' [[taxation]]. The curriculum also includes  intermediate coursework in [[business law]] and [[economics]], and general coverage of [[management|management theory]], and [[business mathematics]] and [[Business statistics|-statistics]]. The degree is thus not to be confused with a [[Bachelor of Business Administration#Program content|B.B.A. in Accounting]] or [[Bachelor of commerce#Areas of study|B.Com. in Accounting]], which are general business degrees with accounting as an area of concentration; for discussion, see {{section link|Business education|Undergraduate education}}. Some programs allow for specializations in topics such as [[Tax accounting in the United States|Tax Accountancy]], Auditing  or [[Forensic accounting|Forensic Accountancy]].

Due to the specialised nature of the B.Acy., it is a professional degree course that is offered infrequently. In the [[United States]], it is likely to be a four-year undergraduate degree. In other parts of the world, such as [[Singapore]], it will be a three-year [[undergraduate]] degree. In [[Malta]], it is a two-year course that can be taken after qualifying in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] only for students who obtain exceptional grades in their previous course. Most [[List of universities in South Africa#Public universities|public universities in South Africa]] offer the degree or a variant, often as a [[Bachelor of Commerce#Honours Bachelor of Commerce|postgraduate Honours degree]].

After completion of the Bachelor of Accountancy, students typically go on to work as accountants in industry, and/or pursue [[professional accountant]] status. When the degree is recognized for this purpose, graduates will therefore pursue the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] or [[Chartered Accountant|C.A.]] (or other) designations, and thus take up [[Articled clerk|"articles"]] at an [[:Category:Accounting firms|accounting firm]] accredited for training, so as to meet the relevant [[Certified Public Accountant#Work experience requirement|work experience requirements]], and will then also sit the associated [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|Professional Examination]].

Note that in the [[United States]], a bachelor's degree in accountancy is generally not sufficient for practice as a [[professional accountant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasba.org/education/becomingacpa/ Becoming a CPA], [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy|nasba.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://community.thiswaytocpa.com/allgroups/exam-and-licensure/b/articles/archive/2012/12/28/licensure-checklist.aspx The basic things you need before they’ll crown you CPA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215011/https://community.thiswaytocpa.com/allgroups/exam-and-licensure/b/articles/archive/2012/12/28/licensure-checklist.aspx |date=2014-04-08 }}, thiswaytocpa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Also, employers in industry generally prefer to hire applicants with a master's in accountancy (or an [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] with a concentration in accounting) and/or with professional certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become an Accountant or Auditor|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Business-and-Financial/Accountants-and-auditors.htm#tab-4|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accountancy graduates intending to work as accountants will therefore commence with the [[Master of Accountancy]]; an accelerated program, or an advanced program allowing for specialized / additional elective work, is typically available to these students.&lt;ref&gt;eg.

'''''Beautiful Boy''''' is a 2010 drama film starring [[Michael Sheen]] and [[Maria Bello]].

==Plot==
The film opens up with home videos of a husband and wife at the beach with their young son. A young man reads a short story about a boy and girl; saying that they didn't know it, but their lives would one day irrevocably change. Bill ([[Michael Sheen]]) and Kate ([[Maria Bello]]) are a married couple who are tightly wound and devoted to their work. Bill is a businessman, and Kate proofreads books for a living. The only thing keeping them together is their eighteen-year-old son Sam ([[Kyle Gallner]]), who is having trouble adjusting to college.

One morning, it's reported on the news that there has been a [[school shooting|shooting spree]] at Sam's school. They are then visited by the police who inform them that Sam is not only dead, but that he was the gunman. Kate refuses to believe that their son would do something so horrible, and spends the night tidying up Sam's room as if nothing has happened. As the news media descends upon the couple, Bill and Kate decide to stay with Kate's brother Eric ([[Alan Tudyk]]) and his wife Trish ([[Moon Bloodgood]]). The next morning, Eric and Trish's son Dylan (Cody Wai-Ho Lee) turns on the television to see a video made by Sam about the impending massacre. Bill then decides to issue a public statement, saying that they are both deeply sorry over what has happened, and ask for their privacy as they endeavor to get their lives back on track. They have a small funeral with only family present.

Trish soon becomes agitated at Kate's nit-picking, and her attempts to mother Dylan, but Eric says that she has to be sensitive to their situation since Sam was her only child. They eventually leave, saying they are going to visit a friend, but check into a motel instead. The manager ([[Meat Loaf]]) not knowing who they are, makes a comment about Sam and his "monster family". Bill goes back to the house where he finds a teenage boy in Sam's room. They have a short scuffle where Bill cuts his hand, and the boy calls him a "psycho". He returns to the motel with their laptop, and finds a video from Sam. He and Kate view it together; Sam only says "mom and dad , I'm sorry, please don't hate me".

Bill and Kate get into an argument about what could have caused Sam to kill all those innocent people. Bill lashes out at Kate for always critiquing every decision that Sam made, but she says that he was never there for them because he was always so busy working. Bill ends up saying that he wishes that Sam was never born, and Kate leaves.

She goes back to their house for the first time since the shooting, and looks through Sam's room. Bill meets with his boss Harry ([[Bruce French (actor)|Bruce French]]), who agrees that he can return to work next week. While grocery shopping, Kate runs into her young co-worker Cooper ([[Austin Nichols]]). They go back to the house, and she catches him looking through Sam's short stories. He says that he is writing a piece about the shooting, but that he wanted to portray Sam in a more human light by learning more about him. Bill finally returns to work, but feels alienated by the rest of the staff. Harry tells Bill to take more time off to see a therapist, so he quits.

Bill later visits the cemetery to find Sam's gravestone vandalized, with the word ''killer'' written on it. He breaks down both physically and emotionally as he tries to scrub the word off with his bandaged hand. Kate reads all of Sam's stories, and goes to Sam's gravestone as well. She gets a call from the motel manager about Bill, and finds him curled up in their old room. Kate embraces the emotionally distraught Bill, and takes him home.

Sam's voice is heard again as he ends his short story about the boy and girl. He says that no matter what they do, their lives will never be the same.

She is best known, however, for creating the role of Nettie Fowler in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''.

==Life and career==
Johnson was born in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]] and moved to [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] after her freshman year of high school, graduating from [[Owensboro High School]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owensboro.kyschools.us/pressreleases/OHS%20Hall%20of%20Achievement%202001%20Inductees.htm Owensboro High School 2002 Hall of Achievement]&lt;/ref&gt;  She showed early promise, starring in school plays and singing in churches.&lt;ref name=nomination&gt;1998 Kentucky Governor's Awards in the Arts nomination, on file in the Kentucky governor's office.&lt;/ref&gt;  After high school, she studied voice at the Nashville Conservatory of Music and sang for radio station [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

Johnson moved to [[New York City]] in 1937 and began to work with NBC's [[Radio City Music Hall]] and [[Lyn Murray]] and the [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra]] at CBS, sometimes touring in concerts in North America.  She studied voice and operatic repertoire in New York with Ernst Knoth and Sidney Dietch.  In 1941, she sang Dorabella in ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', opening the [[Tanglewood]] opera house at [[Lenox, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1938 Broadway role listed in the IBDB is erroneous.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, she received good notices for the role of Mrs. Page in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor (opera)|The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.  Other roles followed for her, with the New Opera Company of New York under [[Emil Cooper]], at [[San Francisco Opera]] and elsewhere, in ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', ''[[The Fair at Sorochyntsi]]'', ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'', ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', ''[[Carmen]]'', ''[[La forza del destino]]'', ''[[The Girl of the Golden West]]'', the title role in ''[[Roberta]]'',  Azucena in ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and Maddalena in ''[[Rigoletto]]''.&lt;ref name=KS&gt;[http://www.downtownlex.com/kentucky_stars_05.asp Kentucky Stars profile of Christine Johnson Smith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820132948/http://www.downtownlex.com/kentucky_stars_05.asp |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, she also sang at New York's [[The Town Hall|Town Hall]].&lt;ref name=nomination/&gt;

In 1943, Johnson won the [[Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air]] which led to her becoming the youngest person ever to sing the role of Erda in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' at that opera house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.187.153.86/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BibSpeed/gisrch2k.r?Term=Johnson,%20Christine%20%5BMezzo%20Soprano%5D&amp;limit=2500&amp;vsrchtype=no&amp;xBranch=ALL&amp;xmtype=&amp;Start=&amp;End=&amp;theterm=Johnson,%20Ch%72is%74in%65%20%5BM%65zzo%20Sop%72ano%5D&amp;srt=&amp;x=0&amp;xHome=&amp;xHomePath= List of performances by Johnson at the Metropolitan Opera]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She appeared on CBS radio's ''The Squibb Show'' twice in 1944.  There she sang "It's A Lovely Day" and "My Heart's in the Highlands" with Lyn Murray and His Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p3.cgi?ArtistName=Johnson,+Christine&amp;ArtistNumber=06667 Johnson's appearances on ''The Squibb Show'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Johnson created the role of Nettie Fowler in ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''.  [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] wrote "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]", which has become a standard, and "June is Busting Out All Over" especially for her.&lt;ref name=KS/&gt; {{Dead link|date=January 2011}}  She also sang the role on the show's [[Cast recording|original cast album]].  Johnson stayed with the show for hundreds of performances and then toured and studied in Italy for a time.&lt;ref name=nomination/&gt;  She rejoined ''Carousel'' during the national tour and continued as Nettie through its Broadway revival in 1949.&lt;ref name=KS/&gt;

After ''Carousel'' closed, Johnson moved back to Owensboro, where she married surgeon Robert Smith in 1950 and raised two daughters, Robin and Nancy.  She taught voice for many years,&lt;ref name=KS/&gt; and one of her pupils was [[Florence Henderson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/columns/a-considerable-town/mrs-brady-sings-the-blues/13512/ Johnson and Florence Henderson]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also served on local arts committees and participated in some local productions.  Johnson's husband died in 1959, and she later worked for Texas Gas Transmission Corporation until her retirement.&lt;ref name=nomination/&gt;

Johnson died on June 9, 2010 at the age of 98, and was buried at [[Rosehill Elmwood Cemetery]].

Concho was developed to provide a means of integrating and assimilating American Indian children into mainstream society. It, like other federal boarding schools, was run on a strict military model.&lt;ref name="Anthes (2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anthes|first1=Bill|title=Native moderns: American Indian painting, 1940-1960|date=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0822338666|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WI7gA-DNYegC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were wakened at 5 a.m., performed military drills and formations, ate breakfast and were in class by 6:00 each morning.&lt;ref name="Fowler (2010)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Loretta|title=Wives and husbands : gender and age in Southern Arapaho history|date=2010|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=978-0-8061-4116-9|pages=202–204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iyjp09G3fp4C&amp;lpg|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics, including reading, writing, and arithmetic,&lt;ref name="Lyman (2013)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyman|first1=Rebecka|title=Life’s Journeys Simple woman, simple life|journal=Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Tribune|date=January 1, 2013|volume=8|issue=5|page=1|url=http://www.c-a-tribes.org/Websites/michaelwood/images/Newspapers/2013/Jan_1_2013.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213091507/http://www.c-a-tribes.org/Websites/michaelwood/images/Newspapers/2013/Jan_1_2013.pdf|archivedate=13 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were studied for half the day and the remainder of the day consisted of labor.&lt;ref name="Fowler (2010)" /&gt;

Trades and farming were taught to boys&lt;ref name="Anthes (2006)" /&gt; and girls were taught domestic labor&lt;ref name="Lyman (2013)" /&gt; and nursing. A large experimental farm was maintained, where the children were instructed in conservation&lt;ref name="WPA 1941"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Federal Writers Project of the WPA|title=Oklahoma: A Guide to the Sooner State|date=1941|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=372–373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvlFlr7fS0QC&amp;lpg|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planting techniques. Boys milked cows and girls helped prepare all of the meals and sewed clothing.&lt;ref name="Fowler (2010)" /&gt; Discipline was strict and infractions, like speaking in their native language rather than English, were punished by things like breaking large rocks into smaller rocks&lt;ref name="Anthes (2006)" /&gt; or sawing wood.&lt;ref name="Fowler (2010)" /&gt; Each infraction required punishment of one hour of labor.&lt;ref name="Anthes (2006)" /&gt;

Initially, the school offered education to the 6th grade and students would have to transfer to [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle]], [[Chilocco Indian Agricultural School|Chilocco]] or [[Haskell Institute]] for secondary education. By around the 1920s, the school curriculum mirrored public education being offered throughout the country and included sports, music, art, and a full course of educational subjects.&lt;ref name="Fowler (2010)" /&gt; By the time the school closed in the early 1980s, it offered instruction for grades one - eight and was predominantly attended by orphans and students who had difficult home environments.&lt;ref name="Senate (1982)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing of Off-Reservation Boarding Schools.

==History==
The first school was opened at the [[Darlington Agency]] on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation in 1871 by the Hicksite (Liberal) Friends and Orthodox [[Quakers]] and was called the Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School.&lt;ref name="McKellips (1992)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKellips|first1=Karen K|title=Educational Practices in Two Nineteenth Century American Indian Mission Schools|journal=Journal of American Indian Education|date=October 1992|volume= 32| issue = 1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the facility was built with federal funds,&lt;ref name=Everett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everett |first1=Dianna |title=SEGER, JOHN HOMER (1846-1928) |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SE005.html |website=Oklahoma State University |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119165141/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SE005.html |archivedate=19 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but run by the [[Quakers]]. Few Cheyenne children attended the school and as a means to entice them, a partition was erected to divide the classroom into separate areas for the Arapaho and Cheyenne students.&lt;ref name="McKellips (1992)" /&gt; In 1879 the facility was renamed the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and a new facility was built for the Cheyenne students located at Caddo Springs, which was called the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School.&lt;ref name=Everett /&gt; Within 5 years, it was reported that the children at the agency schools were responsible for raising 211 cattle and hogs and cultivating 130 acres of land.&lt;ref name="Steere (2009)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steere|first1=Bobby F.|title=The trace of the Southern Arapaho|date=2009|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-1-4401-0402-2|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxVQaUYBlKcC&amp;lpg|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, a new school, called the Darlington Mission School was built and run by the General Conference [[Mennonite]]s but a fire which occurred on 19 February 1882 destroyed the building, taking the life of the missionary's infant son and three Indian children. Federal funds and donations from the Mennonite Mission Board were secured to rebuild the mission school by December, 1882.&lt;ref name="Thiesen (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thiesen|first1=Barbara A|title=Every Beginning Is Hard: Darlington Mennonite Mission, 1880-1902|journal=Mennonite Life|date=June 2006|volume= 61| issue =  2|url=http://ml.bethelks.edu/issue/vol-61-no-2/article/every-beginning-is-hard-darlington-mennonite-missi/ |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mennonites had the same problems as the [[Quakers]] had had in trying educating the two tribes together, and opened a fourth school in 1882&lt;ref name="McKellips (1992)" /&gt; called Cantonment. By 1884, the agent reported that attendance in the four schools represented 66 students at the Arapaho boarding school, 22 students at Cantonment, 71 students at the Cheyenne boarding school and 28 students at Darlington.&lt;ref name="Thiesen (2006)" /&gt;

After 1891 federal policy shifted and began to require more standardization, attendance quotas and less use of federal funds for church "contracted" institutions.&lt;ref name="Thiesen (2006)" /&gt; By the mid 1890s only about half of the school-age children on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation were attending school. An experiment with enrolling Indian children in the public school system and offsetting the costs to the schools was attempted in 1896-1897, but was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Berthrong (1992)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berthrong|first1=Donald J.|title=The Cheyenne and Arapaho ordeal : reservation and agency life in the Indian territory, 1875-1907|date=1992|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=0-8061-2416-4|edition=New|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AZR7KdHhtIC&amp;lpg|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Declining attendance at Darlington forced its permanent closure in June, 1898&lt;ref name="Thiesen (2006)" /&gt; and Cantonment closed in 1901.&lt;ref name="Dalke (1955)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalke|first1=Herbert M|title=Seventy-five Years of Missions in Oklahoma|journal=Mennonite Life|date=July 1955|volume= X|issue= 3|page=102|url=http://ml.bethelks.edu/store/ml/files/1955jul.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2015|location=North Newton, Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 both the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School were closed and the facilities sold by the government.&lt;ref name="P.

The era of the federal [[Indian termination policy|Indian Termination Policy]] from the 1940s through the 1960s saw threats to close tribal schools and Concho was not immune.

Earl C Intolubbe, a [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw]] who was working as an Education Guidance Specialist for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] set up a model school at Concho. The idea was to keep classrooms small so that children received individual attention. Students who had dropped out of other schools were placed in the special program. Some returned within weeks or months to their prior boarding schools or public schools, and some stayed for years. After 6 years of operation, with a 60% success rate, Intolubbe retired in 1968 when it was suggested that the Demonstration School be combined with the Boarding School.&lt;ref name=Intolubbe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Intolubbe|first1=Velma|title=Earl C Intolubbe (Intolabbee)|url=http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/original-enrollees/intolubbe-earl-c/|website=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|publisher=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|accessdate=3 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128052749/http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/original-enrollees/intolubbe-earl-c/|archivedate=28 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2423">The '''Council for Scientific Policy''', 1965-1972, was a council set up in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[secretary of state]]. The council advised the secretary of state on all aspects of his responsibilities with reference to science policy.

== History ==
The main purpose of the Council for Scientific Policy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C829 |title= Council for Scientific Policy |work= The National Archives, United Kingdom|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to advise the government on the resources for science. Before 1965 this advice was given by the [[Advisory Council on Scientific Policy]]. The council was instructed to build a constructive relationship with other research councils, and the [[Ministry of Technology]] and the [[Royal Society]]. The secretariat was run by the [[Department of Education and Science]] (DES).

Chair persons:
* 1965 - 1970: Sir [[Harrie Massey]]
* 1970 - 1972: Sir [[Frederick Dainton]]

Most members were eminent scientists drawn from universities and industry. A prominent member was [[Derek Barton]] [[Royal Society|FRS]], [[FRSE]] an [[organic chemist]] and [[Nobel Prize laureate]]. Also included were assessors from the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] and [[Agricultural Research Council]], representatives from Department of Education and Science, [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]], and the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]], the [[Cabinet Office]] and the [[Ministry of Technology]]. The council's primary interest was research, carried out in universities and by the other research councils. The council had a number of committees, sub-committees and working parties. In 1972 the Council for Scientific Policy was wound up and most of its functions passed to the [[Advisory Board for the Research Councils]]. In 1992, responsibility for scientific matters was transferred to the new [[Office of Science and Technology]].

'''''Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon''''' (2000) is a [[polemical]] book by author Patrick Tierney, in which the author accuses geneticist [[James Neel]] and anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] of conducting human research without regard for their subjects' well-being while conducting long-term [[ethnographic]] [[field work]] among the indigenous [[Yanomami|Yanomamö]], in the Amazon Basin between [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]]. He also wrote that the researchers had exacerbated a measles epidemic among the Native Americans.&lt;ref name='Nexus 1988-January'&gt;{{Cite news| first=Stacey | last=Silva | title=Meeting The Fierce People | date=1988-01-20 | publisher= | url =http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0601.pdf| work =The Daily Nexus | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tierney also claims that [[Jacques Lizot]] and [[Kenneth Good (anthropologist)|Kenneth Good]] committed acts of sexual impropriety with [[Yanomami|Yanomamö]].

While the book was positively reviewed and well received at first, later investigations by multiple independent organizations found Tierney's main allegations to be false and libelous.&lt;ref name='Slate Magazine'&gt;{{Cite news| first=Laden | last=Greg | title=Are Anthropologists a Dangerous Tribe? | date=2013-05-02 | publisher= | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/05/napoleon_chagnon_controversy_anthropologists_battle_over_the_nature_of_fierceness.html| work = Slate Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2014-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major claims and evaluations of these claims==
Claims made in ''Darkness in El Dorado'' included the following:

==Assessments==
In 2000, Tierney published ''Darkness in El Dorado'', which accused geneticist [[James Neel]] and anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] of exacerbating a [[measles]] epidemic among the [[Yanomamo]] people, among other damning allegations.  This work initially received good reviews and was nominated for a [[National Book Award]]. Many of Tierney's accusations against Chagnon were accepted as fact in a ''[[New York Times]]'' book review by science journalist [[John Horgan (journalist)|John Horgan]];&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Horgan|first=John |title=Hearts of Darkness |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/reviews/001112.12horgant.html|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chagnon2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chagnon |first=Napolean |title=Noble Savages: My Life Among Two Dangerous Tribes – The Yanomamö and the Anthropologists |year=2013 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn= 9780684855110}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting political controversy resulted in Chagnon's early retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fight Clubs: On Napoleon Chagnon|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/fight-clubs-napoleon-chagnon/|website=The Nation|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[John Tooby]] of ''Slate'', thought the book was internally inconsistent and suggested that it should have been identified as fiction.&lt;ref name="Tooby"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/91946/ John Tooby, "Jungle Fever: Did two US scientists start a genocidal epidemic in the Amazon or was ''The New Yorker'' duped?"], ''Slate'', 24 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Several inquiries related to Tierney's allegations against the researchers were conducted by the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) and outside evaluators. Tierney's book was condemned by a number of academic researchers and professional associations, including the [[National Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref name="alberts"&gt;{{cite web |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |date=9 November 2000|title=Setting the Record Straight Regarding Darkness in El Dorado - A Statement from Bruce Alberts, President of the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0538.htm|publisher=Anthropological Niche of Douglas W. Hume|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Society of Human Genetics]].&lt;ref name="ajhg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=American Society of Human Genetics|title=Response to Allegations against James V. Neel in Darkness in El Dorado, by Patrick Tierney|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |date=January 2002|volume=70| issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1086/338147 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707612762|accessdate=17 March 2013 |pmid=11715114 |pmc=384880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion was that Tierney had fraudulently presented his allegations.

Tierney's charges against Neel and Chagnon were initially investigated by the Peacock Commission, later known as the El Dorado Task Force, formed by the AAA. It supported Tierney and questioned the conduct of Neel and Chagnon; its findings were accepted by the AAA board in May 2002.&lt;ref name="Dreger 225–246"/&gt;

Because of dissension within the organization, the AAA subsequently requested an outside investigative team. It said in its preliminary report that the "book appears to be deliberately fraudulent", and that "Patrick Tierney has misconstrued or misrepresented his primary sources to a considerable degree in an effort to support his allegations."&lt;ref name=prelimreport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/ucsbpreliminaryreport.pdf |title=Preliminary report: The major allegations against Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel presented in ''Darkness in El Dorado'' by Patrick Tierney appear to be deliberately fraudulent. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921134914/http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/ucsbpreliminaryreport.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators concluded it was not Chagnon who committed any wrongdoing, but Tierney, who fraudulently altered evidence to support a story he either at best imagined or at worst manufactured.&lt;ref name=prelimreport /&gt;

In 2004  Thomas A. Gregor and Daniel R. Gross published their investigation of the AAA's reviews.&lt;ref name=ameranthro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregor|first=Thomas A.|author2=Daniel R. Gross|title=Guilt by Association: The Culture of Accusation and the American Anthropological Association's Investigation of Darkness in El Dorado|journal=American Anthropologist|date=1 December 2004|volume=106|issue=4|pages=687–698|doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.4.687|url=http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0588.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 they called for the membership of the AAA to rescind the organization's support of the book. This resolution passed overwhelmingly, 846 to 338.&lt;ref name=apa-rescinds/&gt;

A detailed investigation of Tierney's charges by a panel set up by the [[University of Michigan]] found the most serious charges to have no foundation and others to have been exaggerated. The [[Provost (education)|Provost]]'s office of the University of Michigan in November 2000 refuted almost all of Tierney's claims.&lt;ref name=umichprovost&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/Releases/2000/Nov00/r111300a.html | title=Statement from University of Michigan Provost Nancy Cantor on the book ''Darkness in El Dorado''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsel and Turner, the two scientists who originally touted the book's claims, admitted that their charge against Neel "remains an inference in the present state of our knowledge: there is no 'smoking gun' in the form of a written text or recorded speech by Neel."&lt;ref name="Dreger 225–246"/&gt;

Alice Dreger, an historian of medicine and science, and an outsider to the debate, concluded after a year of research that Tierney's claims about Chagnon and Neel were false. She wrote that the AAA was complicit and irresponsible in helping spread these falsehoods and not protecting "scholars from baseless and sensationalistic charges".&lt;ref name="Dreger 225–246"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice|title=Darkness's Descent on the American Anthropological Association|journal=Human Nature|date=16 February 2011|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–246|doi=10.1007/s12110-011-9103-y|pmc=3178026|pmid=21966181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAA rescinded its support of the book and acknowledged fraudulent, improper and unethical conduct by Tierney. The association admitted that "in the course of its investigation, in its publications, in the venues of its national meetings and its web site, [the AAA] condoned a culture of accusation and allowed serious but unevaluated charges to be posted on its website and expressed in its newsletter and annual meetings" and that its "report has damaged the reputations of its targets, distracted public attention from the real sources of the Yanomami tragedy and misleadingly suggested that anthropologists are responsible for Yanomami suffering".&lt;ref name=apa-rescinds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/05ref_eldorado.htm |title=AAA Rescinds Acceptance of the El Dorado Report |work= |publisher=American Anthropological Association |year=2005 |accessdate=30 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704095927/http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/05ref_eldorado.htm |archivedate=4 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accusations of medical improprieties{{Vague|date=November 2013}} contained in Tierney's book were investigated by the Medical Team of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] and found to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~idpah/SEP/sepmdrpt.html Report of the Medical Team] of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] on Accusations Contained in Patrick Tierney's ''Darkness in El Dorado'', University of Michigan website&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the controversy  over ''Darkness in El Dorado'', Tierney has kept a low profile. He has  rarely appeared in public to defend his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebuttal of Decade-Old Accusations Against Researchers Roils Anthropology Meeting Anew|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Rebuttal-of-Decade-Old/49320/|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=December 3, 2009|author=David Glenn|author2=Thomas Bartlett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Dreger and Chagnon state that the "dossier" of accusations made against Chagnon by Tierney were attributed to Leda Martins, a Venezuelan anthropologist, Martins had informed Dreger that she had not actually written the dossier, but merely translated it into Portuguese, at which point it was attributed to her as if she were the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chagnon |first=Napoleon |title=Noble Savages: My Life Among Two Dangerous Tribes – The Yanomamö and the Anthropologists |date=2013 |publisher=Simon and Schuster | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;num=16&amp;id=zubUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA496#v=onepage&amp;q=martins&amp;f=false 496] |location=New York |isbn= 978-0684855110| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and One Scholar's Search for Justice | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qArTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 160] | publisher = Penguin Publishing Group | year = 2016 | isbn = 0143108115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doreen Bird.png|thumb|right|'''Doreen Bird''' Hon MA, FISTD, ARAD, founder of [[Bird College]]]]

'''Doreen Bird''' MA FISTD ARAD (27 January 1928 – 4 March 2004) was a British dance teacher and founder of the [[Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts]] in [[Sidcup, Kent]] (now Southeast London).  She was a fellow, examiner, lecturer, committee and council member of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]], life member of the [[Royal Academy of Dance|RAD]], and Honorary MA.  Prior to her death from [[Leukaemia]] in 2004, she had been studying towards a [[Ph.D]].  As well as being a respected dance figure in the United Kingdom, Bird also travelled the World as a lecturer and [[adjudicator]] specialising in dance and musical theatre.  The college which Bird founded is now recognised Internationally as a centre of excellence for dance and performing arts, with its students working worldwide in high-profile areas of the performing industry including [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway theatre]].

==Professional accomplishments==

===Dance College===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:First Full Time Students - Vicarage House.gif|frame|right|Doreen Bird pictured with her first 6 full-time students, outside Vicarage House, the first permanent premises of her college.]] --&gt;

In 1945, Bird founded the Doreen Bird School of Dance, the predecessor of today's [[Bird College|Bird College of Dance, Music &amp; Theatre Performance]].  Bird initially taught her students in her parents' living room then a local church hall, before opening a full-time performing arts course at permanent premises in Sidcup.  This became the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts and Bird remained Principal of the College until her retirement in 1998, when the name Bird College was adopted under its new Principal.  The college is one of the [[United Kingdom]]'s leading institutions for specialist [[dance]] and [[musical theatre]] training, with many ex-students of the college appearing in dance and theatre Worldwide including [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway theatre]].  The college now operates a range of courses including the National Diploma in Musical Theatre and the BA (Hons) Degree in Dance &amp; Theatre Performances, both courses being established during Bird's tenure as Principal.  The College has continued to expand since Bird died, becoming the first college of its kind in the UK to offer an MA Degree (by research), as subject specialist provider for the University of Greenwich.  Since October 2007, the college has also been the official provider of Music and Dance services for the London Borough of Bexley.

===Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing===
[[File:Doreen Bird - ISTD.gif|frame|right|Doreen Bird pictured presenting awards at the 2002 Janet Cram Awards of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.]]

Doreen Bird was a member of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]], an international dance examination board based in [[London]], [[England]].  As a life member of the organisation, she served as a [[teacher]], [[Examiner (academia)|examiner]], [[lecturer]], committee and council member.  She was appointed an examiner of the Modern Theatre Branch in 1957, National Dance Branch in 1958 and Imperial Ballet Branch in 1964, travelling the world as a representative of the society.  Bird served as a member of the ISTD Grand Council from 1970 to 1975, and became a committee member of the Modern Theatre Branch in 1970, a post which she held for sixteen years until 1986. During her time as a committee member of the ISTD, Bird was influential in the examination of dance and the modernisation of the organisations syllabus and approach to teaching young dancers.  As a member of the Modern Theatre Branch, Bird helped to compile all the society's new Major examination syllabi for [[Modern Dance]] and [[Tap Dance]].  Much of this work is still used today, although the syllabi are often revised to keep up to date with current trends in dance.

==Awards and honours==
*In recognition of her work in the field of dance, Bird was awarded an Honorary [[Master of Arts]] from the [[University of Greenwich]] in 1999
*Bird received the Imperial Faculty Award in 1996, in recognition of her long service as a member of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]]
*In 2007 the ISTD launched the "Creation" choreographic competition as a memorial to Bird.  The first competition was held at the Harlequin Theatre in Redhill, Surrey

[[File:980310-N-7355H-003 Simulator Training.jpg|thumb|[[F/A-18 Hornet]] flight simulator aboard the [[USS Independence (CV 62)|USS Independence]] aircraft carrier]]

A '''flight simulator''' is a device that artificially re-creates aircraft [[flight]] and the environment in which it flies, for pilot training, design, or other purposes.  It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as [[air density]], [[turbulence]], wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc.  Flight simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including [[flight training]] (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities.&lt;ref name="FAR121"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=82314bf0c6463a9229f3836c8f6b435f&amp;rgn=div6&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:3.0.1.1.7.14&amp;idno=14|title = FAR 121 Subpart N—Training Program|accessdate = 28 April 2013|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date = 25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of flight simulation==

===World War I (1914–18)===
An area of training was for air gunnery handled by the pilot or a specialist air gunner.  Firing at a moving target requires aiming ahead of the target (which involves the so-called lead angle) to allow for the time the bullets require to reach the vicinity of the target.  This is sometimes also called "deflection shooting" and requires skill and practice.  During [[World War I]], some ground-based simulators were developed to teach this skill to new pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HykDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 "Dry Shooting for Airplane Gunners."] ''[[Popular Science Monthly]]'', January 1919, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1920s and 1930s===
[[File:Edlink pt1930.jpg|thumb|right|[[Link Trainer]] patent drawing, 1930]]

The best-known early flight simulation device was the [[Link Trainer]], produced by [[Edwin Albert Link|Edwin Link]] in [[Binghamton, New York]], USA, which he started building in 1927. He later patented his design, which was first available for sale in 1929.  The Link Trainer was a basic metal frame flight simulator usually painted in its well-known blue color.  Some of these early war era flight simulators still exist, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find working examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://flyawaysimulation.com/news/4045/flight-simulator-technology-through-years/|title = Flight Simulator Technology Through the Years|accessdate = 20 April 2011|last = Fly Away Simulation|date = 12 July 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012134549/http://flyawaysimulation.com/news/4045/flight-simulator-technology-through-years/ |archivedate = 12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Link family firm in Binghamton manufactured player pianos and organs, and Ed Link was therefore familiar with such components as leather bellows and reed switches.  He was also a pilot, but dissatisfied with the amount of real flight training that was available, he decided to build a ground-based device to provide such training without the restrictions of weather and the availability of aircraft and flight instructors.  His design had a pneumatic motion platform driven by inflatable bellows which provided pitch and roll cues. A vacuum motor similar to those used in player pianos rotated the platform, providing yaw cues.  A generic replica cockpit with working instruments was mounted on the motion platform.  When the cockpit was covered, pilots could practice flying by instruments in a safe environment.  The motion platform gave the pilot cues as to real angular motion in pitch (nose up and down), roll (wing up or down) and yaw (nose left and right).&lt;ref name=ASME&gt;[http://files.asme.org/asmeorg/Communities/History/Landmarks/5585.pdf "ASME Landmarks: The Link Flight Trainer."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217165813/http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5585.pdf |date=17 December 2011 }} ''American Society of Mechanical Engineers.'' Retrieved: 18 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, aviation flight schools showed little interest in the "Link Trainer". Link also demonstrated his trainer to the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF), but with no result. However, the situation changed in 1934 when the Army Air Force was given a government contract to fly the postal mail.  This included having to fly in bad weather as well as good, for which the USAAF had not previously carried out much training. During the first weeks of the mail service, nearly a dozen Army pilots were killed. The Army Air Force hierarchy remembered Ed Link and his trainer.  Link flew in to meet them at Newark Field in New Jersey, and they were impressed by his ability to arrive on a day with poor visibility, due to practice on his training device. The result was that the USAAF purchased six Link Trainers, and this can be said to mark the start of the world flight simulation industry.&lt;ref name="ASME" /&gt;

===World War II (1939–1945)===
[[File:Military Personnel Using Link Trainer, Pepperell Manufacturing Company (11327128056).jpg|thumb|Military Personnel Using Link Trainer, [[Pepperell Manufacturing Co.]], 1943]]

The principal pilot trainer used during World War II was the Link Trainer.  Some 10,000 were produced to train 500,000 new pilots from allied nations, many in the USA and Canada because many pilots were trained in those countries before returning to Europe or the Pacific to fly combat missions.&lt;ref name="ASME" /&gt;  Almost all US Army Air Force pilots were trained in a Link Trainer.&lt;ref name="USAF"&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/MuseumExhibits/FactSheets/Display/tabid/509/Article/196852/link-trainer.aspx "U.S. Air Force Fact Sheet: Link Trainer."] ''National Museum of the United States Air Force.'' Retrieved: 12 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different type of World War II trainer was used for navigating at night by the stars.  The [[Celestial Navigation]] Trainer of 1941 was 13.7&amp;nbsp;m (45&amp;nbsp;ft) high and capable of accommodating the navigation team of a [[bomber]] crew.  It enabled sextants to be used for taking "star shots" from a projected display of the night sky.&lt;ref name="ASME" /&gt;

===1945 to the 1960s===
In 1954 [[United Airlines]] bought four flight simulators at a cost of $3 million from Curtiss-Wright that were similar to the earlier models, with the addition of visuals, sound and movement.  This was the first of today's modern flight simulators for commercial aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AeADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CFMiT_23OIGvgwf68vjqCA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Airline Pilots Fly Anywhere in the world - Without Leaving the Ground."] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1954, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===

The simulator manufacturers are [[consolidation (business)|consolidating]] and [[vertical integration|integrate vertically]] as [[Flight training|training]] offers double-digit growth: CAE forecast 255,000 new [[airline pilot]]s from 2017 to 2027 (70 a day), and 180,000 [[First officer (aeronautics)|first officer]]s evolving to [[Airline Captain|captains]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight25jun2018/&gt;--&gt;
The largest is Canadian [[CAE Inc.]] with a 70% [[market share]] and $2.8 billion annual revenues, manufacturing training devices since 70 years but moved into training in 2000 with multiple acquisitions, making more than from producing the simulators.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight25jun2018/&gt;--&gt;
Crawley-based [[L3 Commercial Training Solutions|L3 CTS]] entered the market in 2012 by acquiring [[Thales Training &amp; Simulation]]'s manufacturing plant near [[Gatwick Airport]] where it assembles up to 30 devices a year, then UK [[CTC training school]] in 2015, [[Aerosim Flight Academy|Aerosim]] in Sanford, Florida in 2016, and Portuguese academy [[G Air]] in October 2017.&lt;ref name=Flight25jun2018/&gt;

With a 20% market share, equipment still accounts for more than half of L3 CTS [[Revenue|turnover]] but that could soon be reversed as it educates 1,600 [[commercial pilot]]s each year, 7% of the 22,000 entering the profession annually, and aims for 10% in a [[Fragmentation (economics)|fragmented]] market.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight25jun2018/&gt;--&gt;
The third largest is [[TRU Simulation + Training]], created in 2014 when parent [[Textron Aviation]] merged its simulators with [[Mechtronix]], [[OPINICUS]] and [[ProFlight]], focusing on simulators and developing the first full-flight simulators for the [[737 MAX]] and the [[777X]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight25jun2018/&gt;--&gt;
The fourth is [[FlightSafety International]], focused on [[general aviation|general]], [[business aircraft|business]] and [[regional aircraft]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight25jun2018/&gt;--&gt;
[[Airbus and Boeing]] have invested in their own training centres, aiming for higher margins than [[aircraft manufacturing]] like [[maintenance, repair and overhaul|MRO]], competing with their suppliers CAE and L3.&lt;ref name=Flight25jun2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-civil-simulator-manufacturer-strategies-co-449555/ |title= Civil simulator manufacturer strategies compared |date= 25 June 2018 |author= Murdo Morrison |work= FlightGlobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 there were 1,270 commercial airline simulators in service, up by 50 over a year: 85% [[Full flight simulator|FFS]]s and 15% {{abbr|FTD|flight training device}}s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight26jun2018&gt;--&gt;
CAE supplied 56% of this installed base, L3 CTS 20% and FlightSafety International 10%, while CAE’s training centres are the largest operator with a 13% share.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight26jun2018&gt;--&gt;
North America has 38% of the world’s training devices, Asia-Pacific 25% and Europe 24%.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight26jun2018&gt;--&gt;
[[Boeing]] types represent 45% of all simulated aircraft, followed by [[Airbus]] with 35%, then [[Embraer]] at 7%, [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] at 6% and [[ATR Aircraft|ATR]] at 3%.&lt;ref name=Flight26jun2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-civil-simulator-fleet-nears-1300-mark-449266/ |title= Analysis: Civil simulator fleet nears 1,300 mark |date= 26 June 2018 |author= Antoine Fafard |work= FlightGlobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of flight training devices in service==

===Training for pilots===
[[File:AC97-0295-13 a.jpeg|thumb|right|Cockpit of a [[twinjet]] flight simulator.]]

Several different devices are utilized in modern flight training.  Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT) are used to practice basic cockpit procedures, such as processing emergency checklists, and for cockpit familiarization.  Certain aircraft systems may or may not be simulated.  The aerodynamic model is usually extremely generic if present at all.&lt;ref name="Navy CPT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy CPT|url=http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.NAVAIRNewsStory&amp;id=4866|website=www.navair.navy.mil|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Motion===
Statistically significant assessments of skill transfer based on training on a simulator and leading to handling an actual aircraft are difficult to make, particularly where motion cues are concerned.  Large samples of pilot opinion are required and many subjective opinions tend to be aired, particularly by pilots not used to making objective assessments and responding to a structured test schedule.  For many years, it was believed that 6 DOF motion-based simulation gave the pilot closer fidelity to flight control operations and aircraft responses to control inputs and external forces and gave a better training outcome for students than non-motion-based simulation.  This is described as "handling fidelity", which can be assessed by test flight standards such as the numerical Cooper-Harper rating scale for handling qualities. Recent scientific studies have shown that the use of technology such as vibration or dynamic seats within flight simulators can be equally effective in the delivery of training as large and expensive 6-DOF FFS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/8949 | title=Transfer of Training from a Full-Flight Simulator vs. a High Level Flight Training Device with a Dynamic Seat | accessdate=September 18, 2016 | author=Andrea L.

==Qualification and approval==
[[File:Baltic Aviation Academy Airbus B737 Full Flight Simulator (FFS).jpg|thumb|[[Full flight simulator]] of a [[Boeing 737]]]]

===Procedure===
When a manufacturer wishes to have an ATD model approved, a document that contains the specifications for the model line and that proves compliance with the appropriate regulations is submitted to the FAA.  Once this document, called a Qualification Approval Guide (QAG), has been approved, all future devices conforming to the QAG are automatically approved and individual evaluation is neither required nor available.&lt;ref&gt;FAA AC 61-136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight simulator "levels" and other categories===
The following levels of qualification are currently being granted for both airplane and helicopter FSTD:

====US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)====
;Aviation Training Device (ATD) &lt;ref&gt;AC-61-136A Appendix 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''FAA Basic ATD (BATD)''' - Provides an adequate training platform and design for both procedural and operational performance tasks specific to the ground and flight training requirements for Private Pilot Certificate and instrument rating per Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
*'''FAA Advanced ATD (AATD)''' - Provides an adequate training platform for both procedural and operational performance tasks specific to the ground and flight training requirements for Private Pilot Certificate, instrument rating, Commercial Pilot Certificate, and Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) Certificate, and Flight Instructor Certificate.

;Flight Training Devices (FTD)&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR Part 60, Appendices B and D&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''FAA FTD Level 4''' - Similar to a Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT).  This level does not require an aerodynamic model, but accurate systems modeling is required.
*'''FAA FTD Level 5''' - Aerodynamic programming and systems modeling is required, but it may represent a family of aircraft rather than only one specific model.
*'''FAA FTD Level 6''' - Aircraft-model-specific aerodynamic programming, control feel, and physical cockpit are required.
*'''FAA FTD Level 7''' - Model specific, helicopter only.  All applicable aerodynamics, flight controls, and systems must be modeled.  A vibration system must be supplied. This is the first level to require a visual system.

;Full Flight Simulators (FFS)&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR Part 60, Appendices A and C&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''FAA FFS Level A''' - A motion system is required with at least three degrees of freedom.  Airplanes only.
*'''FAA FFS Level B''' - Requires three axis motion and a higher-fidelity aerodynamic model than does Level A.  The lowest level of helicopter flight simulator.
*'''FAA FFS Level C''' - Requires a motion platform with all six degrees of freedom.  Also lower transport delay (latency) over levels A &amp; B.  The visual system must have an outside-world horizontal field of view of at least 75 degrees for each pilot.
*'''FAA FFS Level D''' - The highest level of FFS qualification currently available.  Requirements are for Level C with additions.  The motion platform must have all six degrees of freedom, and the visual system must have an outside-world horizontal field of view of at least 150 degrees, with a [[Collimated]] (distant focus) display.  Realistic sounds in  the cockpit are required, as well as a number of special motion and visual effects.

====European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA, ex JAA)====

;Flight Navigation and Procedures Trainer (FNPT)&lt;ref name="JARFSTD"&gt;JAR-FSTD A and JAR-FSTD H&lt;/ref&gt;
*EASA FNPT Level I
*EASA FNPT Level II
*EASA FNPT Level III
*MCC - Not a true "level" of qualification, but an add-on that allows any level of FNPT to be used for [[Multi Crew Coordination]] training.

;Flight Training Devices (FTD)&lt;ref name="JARFSTD" /&gt;
*EASA FTD Level 1
*EASA FTD Level 2
*EASA FTD Level 3 - Helicopter only.

;Full Flight Simulators (FFS)&lt;ref name="JARFSTD" /&gt;
*EASA FFS Level A
*EASA FFS Level B
*EASA FFS Level C
*EASA FFS Level D

== Modern high-end flight simulators ==
[[File:Hexapod general Anim.gif|thumb|272px|[[Stewart platform]]]]

===Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA/Ames===
The largest flight simulator in the world is the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at [[NASA Ames Research Center]], south of San Francisco. This has a very large-throw motion system with 60 feet (+/- 30&amp;nbsp;ft) of vertical movement (heave).  The heave system supports a horizontal beam on which are mounted 40&amp;nbsp;ft rails, allowing lateral movement of a simulator cab of +/- 20 feet.  A conventional 6-degree of freedom hexapod platform is mounted on the 40&amp;nbsp;ft beam, and an interchangeable cabin is mounted on the platform.  This design permits quick switching of different aircraft cabins. Simulations have ranged from blimps, commercial and military aircraft to the Space Shuttle.  In the case of the Space Shuttle, the large Vertical Motion Simulator was used to investigate a longitudinal [[pilot-induced oscillation]] (PIO) that occurred on an early Shuttle flight just before landing.  After identification of the problem on the VMS, it was used to try different longitudinal control algorithms and recommend the best for use in the Shuttle program.&lt;ref name=vms_pio&gt;{{cite web|last=Beard|first=Steven|title=Space Shuttle Landing and Rollout Training at the Vertical Motion Simulator|url=http://www.aviationsystemsdivision.arc.nasa.gov/publications/2008/AF2008096.pdf|publisher=AIAA|accessdate=5 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorientation training===

AMST Systemtechnik GmbH (AMST) of Austria and Environmental Tectonics Corporation (ETC) of Philadelphia, US, manufacture a range of simulators for disorientation training, that have full freedom in yaw.  The most complex of these devices is the Desdemona simulator at the TNO Research Institute in The Netherlands, manufactured by AMST. This large simulator has a gimballed cockpit mounted on a framework which adds vertical motion. The framework is mounted on rails attached to a rotating platform. The rails allow the simulator cab to be positioned at different radii from the centre of rotation and this gives a sustained G capability up to about 3.5.&lt;ref name="TNO"&gt;[http://www.tno.nl/content.cfm?context=thema&amp;content=markt_product&amp;laag1=894&amp;laag2=196&amp;laag3=167&amp;item_id=1381&amp;Taal=2 "DESDEMONA: The next generation in movement simulation"] ''Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek'' Retrieved: 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roza, M., M.

The '''Hong Kong University of Science and Technology''' ('''HKUST'''; {{zh|c=香港科技大學}}) is a public [[research university]] in [[Clear Water Bay]], [[Hong Kong]].

Founded in 1991, the university consists of four main academic schools, offering programs in science, engineering, business and management, humanities and social science, along with the Interdisciplinary Programs Office, Fok Ying Tung Graduate School and Institute for Public Policy.&lt;ref name="About Fok Ying Tung Graduate School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ust.hk/academics/schools-programs-office/|title=Schools &amp; Programs Offices|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1980s the [[Hong Kong Government]] anticipated a strong demand for university graduates to fuel an economy increasingly based on services.  [[Sir Sze-Yuen Chung]] and [[Sir Edward Youde]], the then [[Governor of Hong Kong]], conceived the idea of another university in addition to the pre-existing two universities, [[The University of Hong Kong]] and [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

Planning for the "Third University", named The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology later, began in 1986. Construction began at the [[Kohima Camp]] site in [[Tai Po Tsai]] on the [[Clear Water Bay Peninsula]]. The site was earmarked for the construction of a new British Army garrison, but plans for the construction of the garrison were shelved after the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] was signed in 1984.

Originally scheduled to finish in 1994, the death of Sir Edward in 1986 led to increased effort and allowed UST to open its doors early – in 1991. Several leading scientists and researchers took up positions at the new university in its early years, including physicist [[Leroy Chang]] who arrived in 1993 as Dean of Science and went on to become Vice-President for Academic Affairs.&lt;ref name="ACAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leroy Chang|work=Array of Contemporary American Physicists|publisher=American Institute of Physics|url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?changl|accessdate=5 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516024713/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?changl|archivedate=16 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas E. Stelson]] was also a founding member of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssb.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?SessionID=_3wqWJgQLs8utBB&amp;ID=1068090 |title=Schedule 14A |publisher=MTS Systems Corporation |date=2 December 1994 |accessdate=14 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170559/http://ssb.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1%3FSessionID=_3wqWJgQLs8utBB&amp;ID=1068090 |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was criticised for surpassing the budget set forth by the Hong Kong Government and the [[Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club]]. However, under the fund-raising efforts of its President, [[Woo Chia-wei]], the first students enrolled in October 1991. By 1992, accommodation and athletic facilities were expanded to support about 7,000 students.

Several more expansion projects such as the construction of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Enterprise Center have since been completed. The library extension building, Lee Shau Kee Business Building (LSK), Lo Ka Chung Building, South Bus Station, Undergraduate Halls VIII and IX, Cheng Yu Tung Building (CYT) and the Conference Lodge, are the latest additions to the campus.

==Governance==
Established in 1991 under Chapter 1141 of the [[Laws of Hong Kong]] (''The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Ordinance''),&lt;ref name="CAP 1141 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Ordinance"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAP 1141 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Ordinance|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/F9C9899CBE3E9BB4482575EF00268229?OpenDocument&amp;bt=0|work=CAP 1141 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Ordinance|publisher=Department of Justice, HKSAR|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HKUST is one of the [[Universities and colleges in Hong Kong|eight statutory universities in Hong Kong]]. It is an institution funded by the [[University Grants Committee (Hong Kong)|University Grants Committee]] (UGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UGC-funded Institutions|url=http://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/site/fund_inst.htm|publisher=[[University Grants Committee (Hong Kong)|University Grants Committee]]|accessdate=30 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316000841/http://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/site/fund_inst.htm|archive-date=16 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all other statutory universities in Hong Kong, the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive of HKSAR]] acts as the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of HKUST. Prior to the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]], this was a ceremonial title bestowed upon the [[Governor of Hong Kong]].

===Council===
The supreme governing body of the university is its Council, formed by a total of 27 members. Council members include university administrators, the chairperson of the alumni Convocation, an elected staff member, an elected full-time student representative, as well as 17 "lay members" not being employees or students at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ab.ust.hk/ccss/Council.htm|title=Council of the HKUST|publisher=The Court, Council and Senate Secretariat of HKUST|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''HKUST Ordinance'', The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive of HKSAR]] possesses the power of directly appointing the chairman and vice-chairman of the Council, the Treasurer of the University, and not more than 9 of the lay members.

===Senate===
The Senate acts as the university's supreme academic body, responsible for making and reviewing the academic policies of the university. It is composed mostly of academic staff members but also includes the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Students' Union|Students' Union]] president, an elected representative of the undergraduates as well as an elected representative of the postgraduates.&lt;ref name="Senate of the HKUST"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ab.ust.hk/ccss/Senate.htm|title=Senate of the HKUST|publisher=The Court, Council and Senate Secretariat of HKUST|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court===
Being the supreme advisory body of the university, the Court is responsible for promoting the university's interests and to raise funds.&lt;ref name="Senate of the HKUST"/&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:HKUST campus view looking from above.jpg|left|thumb||[[Bird's-eye view]] of the HKUST campus]]
The university is largely a [[campus university]], occupying a 60-hectare site at the northern part of [[Clear Water Bay Peninsula]] in [[Sai Kung District]], [[New Territories]], Hong Kong, overlooking [[Port Shelter]] in [[Tai Po Tsai]]. The campus layout and architecture is based on a master plan submitted jointly by Simon Kwan &amp; Associates and [[Percy Thomas Partnership]], the winning entry to an architectural competition held before the university was founded.

As the campus has a sloped terrain, buildings and facilities are built on separate terraces carved out of the hillside, with the academic facilities occupying the top-level terraces, and undergraduate halls of residence and sporting facilities at the seafront. The terrace are connected by motor roads as well as a network of footbridges and elevators known as Bridge Link.

The countryside setting of the university contributed to the fact that HKUST was once the only public university in Hong Kong not being directly served by an [[MTR]] station, prior to the re-titling of the [[Education University of Hong Kong]]. The university is connected to the metro network through [[Bus services in Hong Kong|public bus]] routes including 91, [[KMB Route 91M|91M]] and [[NWFB Route 792M|792M]], complemented by a handful of [[public light bus|minibus]] services, with [[Choi Hung Station|Choi Hung]] and [[Hang Hau Station|Hang Hau]] stations being the major feeder points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ab.ust.hk/cso/transport_guide.htm|title=HKUST Transport Guide|publisher=Campus Services Office, HKUST|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=libraryaccess&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ust.hk/about-us/contact-us/transportation/|title=Transportation to HKUST Campus and the Library|publisher=The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Library|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic complexes===
Academic activities are mainly conducted in the Academic Building, which contains 10 lecture theatres (A-H, J-K), a multitude of classrooms, laboratories and administrative offices. The lecture theatres can accommodate classes of up to 450 students and offer audiovisual equipment. In addition, an information center and a souvenir shop can be found at the Piazza.

Prior to 2013, offices and classrooms of all of the four schools were grouped under the same roof in the Academic Building. With the completion of the [[Lee Shau Kee]] Business Building (LSK) in 2013, most facilities for the School of Business and Management have relocated from the Academic Building. Opened in 2015, the [[Cheng Yu Tung]] Building (CYT) afforded the other schools with additional classrooms and laboratories.

Located at the southern tip of the campus, the Lo Ka Chung Building houses the HKUST Jockey Club Institute of Advanced Study (IAS). The adjacent Conference Lodge, managed by the hotel-operating arm of [[Chinachem Group]] offers on-campus accommodations for conference attendees and official guests of the university.

===Student and staff housing===
{{Main|#Students' residence}}
A total of nine undergraduate halls are located at the seafront and mid-rise terraces of the university campus. Also, the university provides 404 Senior Staff Quarters flats and 40 University Apartments flats to its eligible senior staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ab.ust.hk/hro/PubDoc/new_staff_guide/resources/housing.html#a|title=New Staff Orientation Guide - Housing in Hong Kong|publisher=Human Resources Office, HKUST|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Library===
{{main article|Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Library}}
[[File:HKUSTlibraryfront.JPG|thumb|HKUST Library Building]]
The HKUST [[Lee Shau Kee]] Library, part of the Hong Kong Academic Library Link (HKALL), occupies a central location of the campus.  Connected to the Academic Building, it is accessible directly from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Atrium.  It spans five floors with over 12,350 sq m&lt;ref name="library.ust.hk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ust.hk/info/library.html|title=About the HKUST Library|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of floor space, providing more than 3,674 seats as well as computing facilities.  It offers a wide array of information resources, both local and remote.  In addition to over 720,000 print and electronic volumes and a large collection of media resources, it provides access to more than 47,000 periodical titles, a large number of e-books, databases, and other digital information resources.&lt;ref name="library.ust.hk"/&gt; The library also includes a 24-hour-capable Learning Commons which provides a technology-rich environment for active learning and education.

The library owns a collection of old maps of China and the rest of Asia, produced by Chinese and Western cartographers over the last 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ust.hk/info/exhibit/maps-2002/|title=China in Maps - A Library Special Collection|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121163228/http://library.ust.hk/info/exhibit/maps-2002/|archivedate=21 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A selection of these maps, providing an insight into the history of international geographic knowledge, was published by the library in a limited-edition (1000 copies) volume in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Library |title=China in European Maps|location=Hong Kong|year=2003|isbn=962-86403-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Unlike other university libraries in Hong Kong where access is limited to persons affiliated to the institutions, HKUST Library is open to the public except during examinations. (No longer the case)--&gt;

===Ancillary services===
The campus boasts 19 catering outlets including fast food restaurants, a Chinese restaurant as well as a [[bar]]; other ancillary facilities in the academic complexes include three banks, a bookstore, a [[PARKnSHOP|supermarket]], clinics (consisting of a medical clinic providing free outpatient service to all full-time students and staff, a student dental clinic, and a staff dental clinic) and Students' Union offices.
&lt;!--
=== Safety and environment===
The Health, Safety and Environment Office (HSEO) was established to develop and help implement safety and environmental policies and procedures, and to provide necessary services to facilitate the realisation of this commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Health, Safety &amp; Environment Office|url=http://www.ab.ust.hk/hseo/aboutus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''HowStuffWorks'''&lt;!-- Please don't add the abbreviation "HSW" here as it isn't used throughout the article and therefore isn't needed --&gt; is an American commercial [[educational website]] founded by [[Marshall Brain]] to provide its target audience an insight into the way many things work. The site uses various media to explain complex concepts, terminology, and mechanisms—including photographs, diagrams, videos, animations, and articles.

The website was acquired by [[Discovery Communications]] in 2007, but sold it to different owners in 2014. The site has since expanded out into [[podcasting]], focusing on factual topics. In 2018, the company, which had since been spun-off by System1 under the name Stuff Media, was acquired by [[iHeartMedia]] for $55 million.

== History ==

In 1998, [[North Carolina State University]] professor [[Marshall Brain]] started the site as a hobby. In 1999, Brain raised [[venture capital]] and formed HowStuffWorks, Inc. In March 2002, HowStuffWorks was sold to the Convex Group, an Atlanta-based investment and media company founded by Jeff Arnold, founder and former [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[WebMD]].&lt;ref name ="BizJournals"&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2002/09/02/story4.html HowStuffWorks sold to vulture fund] BizJournals 2002-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters moved from [[Cary, North Carolina]], to [[Atlanta]]. HowStuffWorks originally focused on science and machines, ranging from submarines to common household gadgets and appliances. After adding a staff of writers, artists, and editors, content expanded to a larger array of topics.

In November 2004, HowStuffWorks moved its entertainment section to Stuffo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/ |title=HowStuffWorks - Stuffo |accessdate=2004-11-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114084142/http://www.howstuffworks.com/ |archivedate=2004-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006, the team disbanded and the site now redirects visitors to the site's entertainment channel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The [[Domain name|domain]] HowStuffWorks.com attracted at least 58 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a [[Compete.com]] survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteanalytics.compete.com/howstuffworks.com?metric=uv HowStuffWorks] at [[Compete.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been four HowStuffWorks books – two illustrated hardcover [[coffee table book]]s called ''HowStuffWorks'' and ''More HowStuffWorks'', and two un-illustrated paperbacks called ''How Much Does the Earth Weigh?'' and ''What If?''. HowStuffWorks puts out an educational magazine called "HowStuffWorks Express" for middle school students. The company has also released a series of '''HowStuffWorks''' trivia "LidRock" discs – [[CD-ROM]]s sold on [[fountain drink]] lids at [[Regal Theaters]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Howstuffworks recently acquired [[Mobil Travel Guide]] and Consumer Guide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Howstuffworks.com spun off its international division when they went public ([http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/hswi Nasdaq:HSWI]) via an acquisition of INTAC, a China-based company. In March 2007, [[Remark Media|HSW International]] launched its [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] website with headquarters in [[São Paulo, Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsw.com.br |title=HowStuffWorks - como tudo funciona |publisher=Hsw.com.br |date=2000-04-01 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese term for the site is Como Tudo Funciona, which means "how everything works." In June 2008, the Chinese site was launched with new headquarters placed in [[Beijing, China]]. The URL roughly translates to "Knowledge Information Web."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowenwang.com.cn |title=博闻网 知道就好! |publisher=Bowenwang.com.cn |date=2000-04-01 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2007, [[Discovery Communications]] announced it had bought HowStuffWorks for US$250 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119240620469258721?mod=rss_whats_news_technology "Discovery Buys HowStuffWorks.com"] by the [[Wall Street Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company later chose to use the name HowStuffWorks as the title of a [[television series]] on its [[The Discovery Channel|Discovery Channel]]. The series, which focuses on [[Commodity|commodities]],&lt;ref name="howstuffworks series page"&gt;- [http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/how-stuff-works/series.html "Precious Commodities"] . - ''[[Discovery Channel]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325003355/http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/how-stuff-works/series.html |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; premiered in November 2008 and is similar in style and content to other "how it works" programs like [[Modern Marvels]].&lt;ref name=WaskoJ-flowtv-2008-05-07&gt;Wasko, Janet and Calderon, Carlos. - [http://flowtv.org/?p=1299 "Modern Marvels: Celebrating How It Works"]. - ''[[University of Oregon]]''. - May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2009, [[Remark Media|HSW International]] co-founded [[Sharecare]], developing a social QA platform through which users ask health and wellness-related questions, receiving answers from industry experts. Other co-founders in Sharecare include Jeff Arnold, [[Dr. Mehmet Oz]], [[Harpo Productions]], Discovery Communications and [[Sony Pictures Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=HSWI:US&amp;sid=ac9dCGVDwxLU|title=Dr. Mehmet Oz and Internet Entrepreneur, Jeff Arnold, Announce Sharecare Inc.,a Web 3.0 Platform, Organizing and Answering the Questions of Health|date=November 2, 2009|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2014, Discovery Communications announced that they had sold HowStuffWorks to [[Blucora]] for $45 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-21/discovery-sells-howstuffworks-at-82-loss-after-seven-years.html | title=Discovery Sells HowStuffWorks at 82% Loss After Seven Years | work=Bloomberg | date=April 21, 2014 | accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Blucora announced the sale of its Infospace business, including HowStuffWorks, to OpenMail for $45 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/blucora-to-sell-infospace-business-for-45-million/ |title=Blucora to sell InfoSpace business for $45 million | work=Seattle Times | date=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenMail was later renamed System1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = System1 raises $270 million for ‘consumer intent’ advertising| work = L.A.

In 2014, HowStuffWorks moved its headquarters from [[Buckhead]] to [[Ponce City Market]], a new [[mixed-use development]] in the [[Old Fourth Ward]] neighborhood of Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/real_talk/2014/10/howstuffworks-moves-headquarters-to-ponce-city.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, they announced the hiring of [[Cracked.com]] founder and former editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien for their new comedy podcasting division.&lt;ref name="variety1"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2017|url = https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/cracked-founder-exits-to-create-comedy-division-at-howstuffworks-1202473006/ |title = Cracked Founder Exits to Create Comedy Division at HowStuffWorks |publisher = Variety.com| accessdate = July 19, 2017| last=| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, System1 was spun-off as '''Stuff Media'''. In September 2018, Stuff Media announced its sale to radio broadcaster [[iHeartMedia]] for $55 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/iheartmedia-stuff-media-howstuffworks-podcast-acquisition-1202939938/|title=iHeartMedia to Buy HowStuffWorks Podcasting Parent for $55 Million|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2018-09-13|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21287">'''Interindividual differences in perception''' describes the effect that differences in brain structure or factors such as culture, upbringing and environment have on the [[perception]] of humans.
Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. However, in recent years, it has become an interesting source to study sensory mechanisms and understand [[human behavior]]. With the help of modern [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], individual differences in perception could be related to the underlying brain mechanisms. This has helped to explain differences in  behavior and [[cognition]] across the population. Common methods include studying the perception of [[illusion]]s, as they can effectively demonstrate how different aspects such as [[culture]], [[Human genetics|genetics]] and the [[Human ecology|environment]] can influence human behavior.

==Optical Illusions==

===Bistable Motion===

A motion quartet is a [[Bistability|bistable]] stimulus - it consists of two dots that change their position from frame to frame. This position change can either be interpreted as horizontal or vertical movement by viewers, and this experience can switch during viewing between interpretations. Depending on the [[aspect ratio]] of the two dots' positions, one or the other state is perceived longer or more often. At an aspect ratio of one, the illusion is biased towards the vertical perception. The reason for this might be the way the human brain processes the signals from both eyes in the [[visual system]]. The right half of an eye's field of view is processed by the left hemisphere, and the left half by the right hemisphere. A stimulus moving vertically only involves one field of view and so one hemisphere, while a stimulus moving vertically from one field of view to the other involves both hemispheres, and requires communication between them. The delay caused by this additional signalling might be the cause for the bias.&lt;ref name="metastable anisotropy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Metastable motion anisotropy. | author=Chaudhuri, Avi | journal=Visual Neuroscience | year=1991 | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=397–407 | pmid=1764411 | doi=10.1017/s0952523800009706}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also individual differences in the way the motion quartet is perceived: Some people require a different aspect ratio to perceive both axes of movement than others.
A study using diffusion tensor imaging further showed differences in the structure of the corpus callosum, the primary connection between the two hemispheres, might be the origin of these differences.&lt;ref name="Genç bistable"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008773 | title=Interhemispheric Connections Shape Subjective Experience of Bistable Motion | author= Genç, Erhan | journal=Current Biology | year=2011 |  volume=21 | issue=17 | pages=1494–1499 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.003| pmid=21885284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object size estimation===
There exist a variety of illusions that make objects appear bigger or smaller compared to their real size. Two such illusions are the [[Ebbinghaus illusion|Ebbinghaus]] and the [[Ponzo illusion|Ponzo]] illusions. The Ebbinghaus illusion makes a dot seem bigger because it is surrounded by smaller dots, while the Ponzo illusion exploits human [[Perspective (visual)#Linear perspective|perspective]] processing by making a dot appear bigger because it seems farther away. Schwarzkopf et al.&lt;ref name="surface_V1" /&gt; found that the size of the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|primary visual cortex (V1)]] has an effect on the magnitude of these illusions. The larger the subject's V1 surface area was, the less the subjects fell for the illusion. This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that a larger V1 dedicated to the same portion of the visual field means a lesser effect of later, fixed-size visual areas (which are the ones that are responsible for the illusion effect).&lt;ref name="surface_V1"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n1/full/nn.2706.html | title=The surface area of human V1 predicts the subjective experience of object size | author=Schwarzkopf, D Samuel | journal=Nature Neuroscience | volume=14 | year=2011 | issue=1 | pages=28–30 | doi=10.1038/nn.2706 | pmid=21131954 | pmc=3012031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory Illusions==

===McGurk Effect===
The [[McGurk effect]] is an auditory illusion in which people perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable "ba" is presented while the mouth movement is "ga". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable "da". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion.&lt;ref name="McGurk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentilucci | first1 = M. | last2 = Cattaneo | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Automatic audiovisual integration in speech perception" ''Experimental Brain Research'' 167(1), 66-75. McGurk, H., &amp; MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 746–748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the [[fuzzy logic]] model of speech perception&lt;ref name="fuzzy speech"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oden | first1 = G. C. | last2 = Massaro | first2 = D. W. | year = 1978 | title = Integration of featural information in speech perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 172–191 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.85.3.172 | pmid=663005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, the features of the acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous audiovisual information and thus the sound is classified as "da".

Many studies have concluded that the area responsible for the perception of this phenomenon is the left [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus(STS)]].&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = M. S. | year = 2012 | title = A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 781–787 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 | pmid=21787869 | pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is critical for the [[multisensory integration]] of visual and auditory information during speech perception. Moreover,  there is a correlation between the activation of the STS and the perception of the McGurk effect. In that sense, if the left STS  correctly integrates the mismatched audiovisual information, a McGurk effect is perceived; if the left STS is not active, the visual and auditory information are not integrated and thus a McGurk effect is not perceived.

In one study&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath" /&gt; [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure the brain activity in perceivers and non-perceivers of the McGurk effect while presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables (auditory "ba" + visual "ga" producing perception of "da"),  and non-McGurk incongruent syllables( auditory "ga" + visual "ba" producing auditory perception of "ga"). The researchers found that there was a positive correlation between the amplitude of response in the left STS and the probability of perceiving the McGurk effect. In other words, the subject with the weakest STS activation to incongruent speech had the smallest probability of experiencing a McGurk percept; whereas the subject with the strongest STS response had the highest probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3T7LWIkP8|title=McGurk effect: Auditory "ba" + Visual "ga"|first=|last=anathfMRI|date=18 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp et al. (2010) highlight the critical role of the left STS in audiovisual integration.&lt;ref name="TMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Nath | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Pasalar | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals that the superior temporal sulcus is a cortical locus of the McGurk effect | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 7| pages = 2414–2417 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4865-09.2010 | pmid=20164324 | pmc=2844713}}&lt;/ref&gt; They applied single pulses of [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) to the STS of McGurk perceivers during presentation of McGurk stimuli. The perception of the McGurk effect decreased from 94% to 43% and the subjects reported perceiving only the auditory syllable. Following from that, Beauchamp et al. conclude that the left STS is crucial for the audiovisual integration and thus for the perception of the McGurk effect.

Moreover, another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurler | first1 = D. | last2 = Doyle | first2 = N. | last3 = Walker | first3 = E. | last4 = Magnotti | first4 = J. | last5 = Beauchamp | first5 = M. | year = 2015 | title = A link between individual differences in multisensory speech perception and eye movements | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1333–1341 | doi=10.3758/s13414-014-0821-1| pmc = 4437244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the basis of the interindividual differences in the perception of McGurk effect lies in the eye movements of the subject when viewing the talker’s face. The experimenters carried out an [[eye tracking]] study and measured the eye movements of the participants while viewing audiovisual speech. They found that people who spent more time fixating the mouth of the talker were the more likely to perceive the McGurk effect than those who rarely fixated on the mouth of the speaker.

===Other auditory illusions===
[[File:Pitch class space.svg|thumb|right|Representation of the [[pitch class]] circle with respect to tone height]]
Interindividual differences have also been researched for the '''[[Tritone paradox]] illusion'''. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half [[octave]]. Each tone is made of a set of [[harmonics]] which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to [[Diana Deutsch]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"&gt;Deutsch, D. (1991). The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 8(4), 335-347.&lt;/ref&gt; the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the [[pitch class]] with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"/&gt; found that for people from [[California]], the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern [[England]] it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.

Other illusions found by Deutsch whose interpretation depends on interindividual differences is the '''phantom words illusion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=211|title=Diana Deutsch - Phantom Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illusion consists of the continuous presentation of two meaningless syllables. In order to experience the illusion, it is necessary that the listener sits between two loudspeakers, one to the left and the other to the right. The syllables are presented offset in time, in such a way that while one syllable is coming from the left, the other syllable is coming from the right loudspeaker. It was shown that after a period of time, people start hearing words. According to Deutsch, the perceived words depend on the language spoken by the listener, their knowledge and their expectations. According to Shinn-Cunningham (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinn-Cunningham | first1 = B.G. | year = 2008 | title = Object-based auditory and visual attention | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 182–186 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.02.003| pmc = 2699558}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the information is incomplete or contradictory, the perceptual system often fills this gaps with plausible interpretations and in that way allows new information to be efficiently processed.

==Effect of Culture on Perception==
[[File:Frame_and_Line_Test.svg|thumb|height=width|right|The framed line test]]
Several studies have shown that differences between individuals play a significant role in determining how a stimulus is perceived. These differences among people, in turn, are greatly influenced by one's own socio-cultural contexts. The research indicates that cultural factors influence the process of perception not just on lower-level (such as [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object perception]] and [[attention]] deployment), but also on the higher-order functions (such as [[theory of mind]] and [[emotion recognition]]).&lt;ref name= "Culture_and_self"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "holistic vs nalytical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masuda|first1=Takahiko|last2=Nisbett|first2=Richard E|title=Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=Nov 2001|volume= 81|issue=5|pages=922–934|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922|pmid=11708567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "New Look"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Duffy|first2=S.|last3=Kawamura|first3=T.|last4=Larsen|first4=J. T.|title=Perceiving an Object and Its Context in Different Cultures: A Cultural Look at New Look|journal=Psychological Science|date=1 May 2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=201–206|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02432|pmid=12741741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major cultures analyzed in these studies were mostly [[Western World|Western]] and [[East Asia]]n cultures because of the considerable differences in the social structure and practices. Western culture was referred to as an ''analytical'' culture whereas Eastern culture was referred more as a ''holistic'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=JB|last2=Rule|first2=NO|last3=Ambady|first3=N|title=The cultural neuroscience of person perception|journal=Progress in Brain Research|date=2009|volume=178|pages=191–201|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17813-5|pmid=19874970|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444533616}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[individualism]] and [[freedom]] are the predominant values in Western societies, which in turn demand interpretation of an object in its absolute terms independent of its context. In contrast, Eastern culture is known for its emphasis on [[collectivism]] and [[interdependence]] on each other, where interpretation of an object is often in relation with its context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=RE|last2=Peng|first2=K|last3=Choi|first3=I|last4=Norenzayan|first4=A|title=Culture and systems of thought: holistic versus analytic cognition.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 2001|volume=108|issue=2|pages=291–310|pmid=11381831|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer study examining these cultural differences in visual perception was conducted by Kitmaya et al. (2003).&lt;ref name="New Look"/&gt; The findings of that study provide behavioural evidence on how cultural factors affect visual perception and attention deployment. For the study, [[United States|Americans]] and [[Japan]]ese were taken as subjects. The visual stimulus shown to the subjects consisted of a square figure with a line hanging from the centre (the framed line test). First was the absolute condition, where the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in its absolute length, to a new square box independent of its size. Second was the relative condition, in which the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in proportionally similar to context of the new square box. The results show that Americans perform better in the absolute task which requires analytical processing of stimulus independent of it context, whereas the Japanese performed better at the relative task which demands the holistic processing of the stimulus in relation to its context.

In line with these findings, Hedden and colleagues (2009)&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedden|first1=T.|last2=Mormino|first2=E. C.|last3=Amariglio|first3=R. E.|last4=Younger|first4=A. P.|last5=Schultz|first5=A. P.|last6=Becker|first6=J. A.|last7=Buckner|first7=R. L.|last8=Johnson|first8=K. A.|last9=Sperling|first9=R. A.|last10=Rentz|first10=D. M.|title=Cognitive Profile of Amyloid Burden and White Matter Hyperintensities in Cognitively Normal Older Adults|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=14 November 2012|volume=32|issue=46|pages=16233–16242|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2462-12.2012|pmid=23152607|pmc=3523110}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the same visual stimuli to investigate the neural activity with the help of fMRI. Participants of the study were asked to judge the length of a vertical line, either including the contextual information or ignoring it. The results revealed that separate brain regions were employed while performing  the task, either incorporating the contextual information or avoiding it, based on one's own culture. The areas associated with [[attentional control]] in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] region of the brain were highly activated when the subjects performed the task which was incongruent to their cultural pattern. That is, the activity in the fronto-parietal region enhanced when East Asians had to ignore the contextual information, while similar enhancement happened for Americans when they had to incorporate the contextual information. These findings illustrate that the function of the neural mechanisms are also modulated to some extent by one's own culture.&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"/&gt;

A follow-up fMRI study by Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutchess|first1=AH|last2=Welsh|first2=RC|last3=Boduroglu|first3=A|last4=Park|first4=DC|title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing.|journal=Cognitive, affective &amp; behavioral neuroscience|date=June 2006|volume=6|issue=2|pages=102–9|pmid=17007231|doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the previous findings by using a rather complex stimulus, which consists of ''only the object'' pictures, ''object with background'' pictures and ''only the background'' pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, the activity of the involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the object processing areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.

The '''Program in Creative Writing''', more commonly known as the '''Iowa Writers' Workshop''', at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], is a celebrated&lt;ref name="Where Great Writers are Made"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200708/edward-delaney-mfa| title=Where Great Writers are Made |author=Edward J. Delaney | date=August 2007| work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduate-level [[creative writing]] program in the [[United States]]. Writer [[Lan Samantha Chang]] is its director. Graduates earn a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degree in Creative Writing. It has been cited as the best graduate writing program in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebestschools.org/features/top-creative-writing-programs/|title=The 10 Best Creative Writing Programs {{!}} The Best Schools|work=The Best Schools|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program began in 1936 with the gathering of poets and fiction writers under the direction of [[Wilbur Schramm]].

The workshop's second director from 1941–1965 was [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], native [[Paul Engle]]. Under his tenure, the Writers' Workshop became a national landmark. He successfully secured donations for the workshop from the business community for about 20 years, including locals such as [[Maytag]] and [[Quaker Oats]], as well as [[U.S. Steel]] and ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref name= Bennett&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Eric|title=How Iowa Flattened Literature|url=http://chronicle.com/article/How-Iowa-Flattened-Literature/144531/|work=MFA vs. NYC: The Two Cultures of American Fiction|publisher=Faber  and Faber and n+1|accessdate=2 April 2014|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1953 and 1956, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] donated $40,000. [[Henry Luce]], the publisher of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines, and [[Gardner Cowles, Jr.]] (1903–1985), who published ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, provided publicity for the workshop's events.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

From 1965–1969, the workshop had several different directors.{{who|date=January 2015}}
[[John Leggett]] was the director from 1969–86 and attracted writers such as [[T.C. Boyle]], [[Ethan Canin]], [[Michael Cunningham]], [[Gail Godwin]], [[Denis Johnson]], and [[Jane Smiley]].&lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{cite news|author1=John McMurtrie|title=John Leggett, former director of Iowa Writers' Workshop, dies at 97|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/bookmarks/2015/01/26/john-leggett-former-director-of-iowa-writers-workshop-dies-at-97/|accessdate=31 January 2015|work=SF Chronicle|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 until his death in 2005, [[Frank Conroy]] directed the workshop and was Engle's longest-lasting successor. [[Lan Samantha Chang]] became the director in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writersworkshop.uiowa.edu/about/about-workshop/history|title=Iowa Writer's Workshop History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The '''Program in Creative Writing''', at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], is more commonly known as the '''Iowa Writers' Workshop'''&lt;ref name="Where Great Writers are Made" /&gt; graduate-level [[creative writing]] program in the [[United States]].

Graduates earn a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degree in English. Iowa has the oldest creative writing program in the country offering an MFA credential.&lt;ref name=nyt86&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/magazine/can-writing-be-taught-in-iowa.html | title=Can Writing Be Taught in Iowa? |author=Maureen Howard | date=May 25, 1986| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faculty and alumni ===
{{Main|List of Iowa Writers' Workshop people}}
The workshop is staffed by three permanent{{Who|date=February 2016}} and several visiting faculty.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Curriculum and courses ===
The program's curriculum requires students to take a small number of classes each semester, including the Graduate Fiction Workshop or Graduate Poetry Workshop itself, and one or two additional literature seminars. The modest requirements are intended to prepare the student for the realities of professional writing, where self-discipline is paramount. The graduate workshop courses meet weekly.  Before each three-hour class, a small number of students submit material for critical reading by their peers.  The class itself consists of a round-table discussion during which the students and the instructor discuss each piece. The specifics of how the class is conducted vary somewhat from teacher to teacher, and between poetry and fiction workshops. The ideal result is not only that authors come away with insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their own work, but that the class as a whole derives some insight, whether general or specific, about the process of writing.&lt;ref name=nyt86 /&gt;

=== Podcast ===
"Conversations from the Iowa Writer's Workshop" is an event put on by the program that is recorded and put online in podcast form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.writinguniversity.org/podcast|title=Writing University Podcast - The Writing University|author=|date=|website=www.writinguniversity.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pulitzer Prizes won by graduates and faculty ==
{{as of|2018}}, Iowa Writers' Workshop alumni won 17 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, as well as numerous [[National Book Award]]s and other literary honors. Six [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|U.S. Poets Laureate]] have been graduates of the workshop.{{when|date=May 2015}}
Faculty and graduates affiliated with the Iowa Writers' Workshop have won 29 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, including 16 won by graduates since 1947, and graduates and faculty of the [[The University of Iowa|University of Iowa]] have won over 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/admissions/undergrad/after-grad/pulitzers.html |title=Pulitzer Prizes Awarded to UI Faculty Members or Alumni |website=University of Iowa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727081143/http://www.uiowa.edu/admissions/undergrad/after-grad/pulitzers.html |archivedate=2005-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Istituto tecnico per attività sociali''' (literally ''Technical institute for social activities'') has been a type of [[secondary education in Italy|secondary school in Italy]].

This specialized institute has contributed, in Italy and in [[Italian Switzerland|Switzerland]], to the professional and technical training of executive and senior staff in the economic sector of services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.ti.ch/fileadmin/DECS/DS/UOSP/download/2014_1015_Scuola_media_e_poi.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivio.pubblica.istruzione.it/scuola_e_famiglia/comunita.shtml Ministero della pubblica istruzione]&lt;/ref&gt; with particular regard to the link between [[management]], [[law]], [[economy]] and [[social sciences]].

==History==
It was founded in 1931, reformed in the fifties, sixties, and in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://159.213.63.12/cdm_webif/media/giuri/prop/L_15_giu_31_n_889.htm Legge 15 giugno 1931, n. 889]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legge 8 luglio 1956, n. 782 - Trasformazione delle scuole di magistero professionale per la donna in istituti tecnici femminili&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gazzette.comune.jesi.an.it/258/2.htm Gazzetta Ufficiale]&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2010 [[Gelmini reform]], because of its area of interest, it was merged with the ''[[Istituto tecnico economico|Technical-Economic Institute with specialisation in Administration, Finance and Marketing]]'',&lt;ref name="confl"&gt;[http://archivio.pubblica.istruzione.it/riforma_superiori/nuovesuperiori/doc/ALL_D_tecnici_4_2_2010.pdf Ministero Pubblica Istruzione, Tabella di confluenza]&lt;/ref&gt; while some of its higher specialisations were directly moved to the [[higher education in Italy|university education]].&lt;ref&gt;Risoluzione n. 134333 del 14/7/2011, MISE&lt;/ref&gt; Students could attend the ''istituto tecnico per le attività sociali'' after successfully completing [[middle school]] (''scuola media''), and were enabled to progress to any [[Higher education|university institution]].

In 2012, according to a study conducted in four [[regions of Italy]] by the business newspaper [[Il Sole 24 Ore]] and the [[Giovanni Agnelli|Agnelli Foundation]], a number of Istituti tecnici per le attività sociali were between the best secondary schools in terms of quality in [[Lombardia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/pdf2010/SoleOnLine5/_Oggetti_Correlati/Documenti/Notizie/2012/04/classifica-scuole-lombardia-200-300.pdf Il Sole 24 Ore, Classica Lombardia 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/pdf2010/SoleOnLine5/_Oggetti_Correlati/Documenti/Notizie/2012/04/classifica-scuole-lombardia-300-400.pdf Il Sole 24 Ore, Classica Lombardia 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/pdf2010/SoleOnLine5/_Oggetti_Correlati/Documenti/Notizie/2012/04/classifica-scuole-lombardia-400-450.pdf Il Sole 24 Ore, Classica Lombardia 3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emilia Romagna]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/pdf2010/SoleOnLine5/_Oggetti_Correlati/Documenti/Notizie/2012/04/classifica-scuole-emilia-100-160.pdf Il Sole 24 Ore, Classica Emilia Romagna]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calabria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/pdf2010/SoleOnLine5/_Oggetti_Correlati/Documenti/Notizie/2012/04/classifica-scuole-calabria-100-160.pdf Il Sole 24 Ore, Classica Calabria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The curriculum is devised by the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of Education]], and emphasises the link between [[management]], [[law]] [[economy]] and [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name="confl" /&gt;

After a common biennium, the course was divided into three specializing paths:&lt;ref name="rousseau"&gt;[http://www.istitutorousseau.net/istituto/pdf-pof/05-istituto-tecnico-per-le-attivit%C3%A0-sociali.pdf Istituto Rousseau, Profili professionali]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dirigenti di comunità''' (Community management), had as its goal the training of students able to direct, organize, coordinate and manage facilities both public and private&lt;ref name=mindir&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229212530/http://www.pubblica.istruzione.it/scuola_e_famiglia/comord.shtml Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione, Indirizzo Dirigenti di Comunità]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Istituto Visconti, Istituti tecnici per le attività sociali, dirigenti di comunità [http://istitutovisconti.com/corsi/istituti-tecnici-per-le-attivita-sociali/itas-dirigente-di-comunita.html]&lt;/ref&gt; providing a multi-purpose training focused on [[sociology]] as well as a theoretical and practical competence of [[law]] and [[Executive director|executive management]].&lt;ref name=mindir /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polo Scolastico Il Nazareno, Istituto Tecnico Attività Sociali - Dirigenti di comunità [http://www.ilnazareno.it/frontend/section.php?current_section=10051]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the path has been renamed "Technical-Economic Institute with specialisation in Administration, Finance and Marketing".&lt;ref name="confl" /&gt;
*'''Economodietista''' (eco-dietitian), aimed to train technicians for organizations and cooperatives, providing a basic knowledge in [[nutrition|science of nutrition]], [[hygiene]], [[accounting]] and [[statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229212530/http://www.pubblica.istruzione.it/scuola_e_famiglia/ecoord.shtml Ministry of Education, E-treasurer dietitian]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Generale''' (General), through the study of [[humanities|human sciences]], its goal was to train teachers and assistants to disabled people and the management of related technical activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229212530/http://www.pubblica.istruzione.it/scuola_e_famiglia/comgen.shtml Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione, Indirizzo generale]&lt;/ref&gt;
The education given offers both a wide theoretical education and an accurate specialization in a field of studies (management, administration, law, humanities), often integrated with a six months [[internship]] in a company, association or university, during the fifth and last year of study.

Students are required to study for five years, and attend the school from the age of 14 to 19. At the end of the fifth year all students sit for the ''[[maturità]]'', a wide final examination which gave access to every university course. The degree given at the end of the main path is a high school diploma with a specialization in social science and management (it. "Diploma di istruzione secondaria superiore ad indirizzo tecnico attività sociali, specializzazione dirigenti di comunità", translated as "High School Diploma in Social Sciences and Management").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manzonisiena.it/corsi/itas.html Istituto Manzoni Siena, Istituto tecnico attività sociali]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7325">'''Jacques Armand Gauthier''' (born June 7, 1948 in [[New York City]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate paleontologist]], [[comparative anatomy|comparative morphologist]], and [[Systematics|systematist]], and one of the founders of the use of [[cladistics]] in biology.

== Life and career ==
Gauthier is the son of Edward Paul Gauthier and Patricia Marie Grogan.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He received a B.S. degree in Zoology at [[San Diego State University]] in 1973, a Master of Biological Science at the same institute in 1980, and a PhD in  Paleontology from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently he is a Professor of Geology and Geophysics and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology and Vertebrate Zoology at [[Yale University]]. His master's thesis, the content of which was published in 1982, is a classic work on the paleontology and phylogeny of the lizard clade [[Anguimorpha]] that remains a core reference for morphological research on [[Xenosauridae]] and [[Anguidae]] in particular. His PhD thesis constituted the first major [[cladistic]] analysis of [[Diapsida]], as well as arguing for the [[monophyly]] of the [[dinosaur]]s. He followed this with an important paper on the origin of [[bird]]s from [[theropod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first detailed cladistic analysis of the theropod dinosaurs, and initiated a revolution in dinosaur [[phylogeny|phylogenetics]], in which cladistics replaced the Linnaean system in the [[scientific classification|classification]] and phylogenetic understanding of the dinosaurs.

Gauthier's corpus is remarkable in that he contributed the foundational phylogenetic studies of [[Archosauria]] and [[Lepidosauria]], two major amniote clades; and he was the primary author of the foundational and still widely cited phylogenetic study of [[Amniota]]&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier, Kluge &amp; Rowe (1988); Gauthier (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; as a whole. The phylogenetic character sets from his 1984 and 1986 works, the 1988 amniote paper, and the 1988 lepidosaur and [[squamate]] papers still form the core of essentially all gross-anatomy-based phylogenetic analyses of these groups, and as such are among the most highly cited papers in amniote morphology and paleobiology. The 1988 amniote paper is also frequently cited to demonstrate the importance of taxon sampling in phylogenetic analysis, in particular the importance of sampling rare or fossil taxa that can break 'long branches' along which convergence can occur.

More recently, he has argued together with [[Kevin de Queiroz]] for replacing [[Linnaean taxonomy]] with the [[PhyloCode]].&lt;ref&gt;Foer, Joshua. "Pushing Phylocode." ''Discover'' 26.4 (2005): 46-51. ''Academic Search Premier.'' Web. 11 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donoghue, Michael J., and Jacques A. Gauthier. "Implementing The Phylocode." ''Trends In Ecology &amp; Evolution'' 19.6 (2004): 281-282. ''Academic Search Premier.'' Web. 11 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his theoretical work on systematics and taxonomy, Gauthier continues to study the anatomy and relationships of diapsids, particularly lepidosaurs. His lizard work currently focuses on [[Scincomorpha]], following on a career-long interest in the unusual clade [[Xantusiidae]]. He is a principal investigator on the [[National Science Foundation]]-funded effort to reconstruct the phylogeny of lizards and snakes ([[Squamata]]) using gross anatomy and molecular structure, building on his earlier work in collaboration with Richard Estes and Kevin de Queiroz, which established the most widely accepted phylogeny of the group.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''James Alan McPherson''' (September 16, 1943 – July 27, 2016) was an American essayist and short-story writer. He was the first [[African-American]]  writer to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], and was included among the first group of artists who received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. At the time of his death, McPherson was a [[professor emeritus]] of fiction at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/books/james-alan-mcpherson-pulitzer-prize-winning-writer-dies-at-72.html|title=James Alan McPherson, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Writer, Dies at 72|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=July 27, 2016|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=July 31, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

===Early life and education===
McPherson was born in [[Savannah, Georgia]], on September 16, 1943, the second of four children.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-alan-mcpherson-38864 | title=James Alan McPherson Biography | publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks | work=The Biography.com website | date= | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | author=Biography.com Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[master electrician]] (the first African-American so recognized in Georgia),&lt;ref name="pshares.org"&gt;Henry, DeWitt (Fall 2008) {{cite web|url=https://www.pshares.org/issues/fall-2008/about-james-alan-mcpherson|title=About James Alan McPherson |journal=Ploughshares|issue= 106|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother (born Mabel Small) was a maid.&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"/&gt; While growing up, McPherson's father struggled with alcohol and time in jail. In his essay "Going Up To Atlanta," McPherson describes the many odd jobs he took on during this time to help support his mother, brother, and sisters.&lt;ref name="pshares.org"/&gt; But it was his discovery of the "colored branch" of the public library that changed his life. When he started reading books, McPherson learned that words, even without pictures, "gave up their secret meanings, spoke of other worlds, made me know that pain was a part of other people's lives."&lt;ref name="pshares.org"/&gt;

He attended [[Morgan State University]] from 1963 to 1964 before receiving his undergraduate degree in history and English from [[Morris Brown College]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="UI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iowalum.com/pulitzerPrize/mcphersontest.cfm|title=James Alan McPherson, 71MFA, Prize Work: Elbow Room; 1980 Pulitzer Prize: Fiction |publisher=University of Iowa Alumni Association|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, McPherson received a [[LL.B.]] from [[Harvard Law School]], where he partially financed his studies by working as a janitor.&lt;ref name="biography.com"/&gt;

While at Harvard, McPherson studied fiction writing with Alan Lebowitz in 1967 and worked on his stories when he found some spare time. It was the publication of his short story "Gold Coast" in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', following an "open reading" competition they had sponsored, that first brought him public recognition. During this period, McPherson established a close working relationship with Edward Weeks, an editor at ''The Atlantic Monthly,'' which led to McPherson becoming a contributing editor at that magazine in 1969.&lt;ref name="pshares.org"/&gt; His fiction would go on to appear in numerous journals and magazines throughout the following decade. Many of his stories were anthologized, beginning with "Gold Coast" when it appeared in ''[[Best American series|The Best American Stories]]'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="biography.com"/&gt; His first collection of short stories, ''Hue and Cry'', was published by Atlantic Monthly Press that year.

In 1971, he received an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] in fiction from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where he studied briefly with the short-story writer and novelist [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]].&lt;ref name="pshares.org"/&gt; While studying creative writing, McPherson decided not to practice law; however, he would continue to utilize his legal training in various projects.&lt;ref name="UI"/&gt; In a 1972 ''Atlantic Monthly'' essay, he exposed exploitative business practices against black homeowners, presaging the later work of [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]].&lt;ref name="post-obit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/james-alan-mcpherson-first-black-writer-to-win-pulitzer-prize-in-fiction-dies-at-72/2016/07/28/b07edb6c-54c9-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html | title=James Alan McPherson, first black writer to win Pulitzer Prize in fiction, dies at 72 | publisher=WP Company. Llc | work=The Washington Post | date=July 28, 2016 | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | author=Langer, Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period in his life, he gained the attention of [[Ralph Ellison]] (1913–1994), who became both a friend and mentor to the young McPherson. In December 1970, McPherson interviewed Ellison&lt;ref name="pshares.org"/&gt; for an ''Atlantic Monthly'' cover story and collaborated with him on the essay "Indivisible Man."&lt;ref name="UI"/&gt; This relationship with Ellison would have a lasting influence on his own life and work, as McPherson acknowledges in his essay "Gravitas," which he published in 1999 as both a tribute to the (then) recently deceased writer, and to observe the posthumous publication of Ellison's novel ''[[Juneteenth (novel)|Juneteenth]]'' that same year.&lt;ref name="post-obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newgeorgia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/james-alan-mcpherson-b-1943 | title=James Alan McPherson (b. 1943) | publisher=Georgia Humanities Council &amp; University of Georgia Press | work=New Georgia Encyclopedia | date=January 21, 2005 | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | author=Cooksey, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson also initiated a friendship with [[Albert Murray (writer)|Albert Murray]] shortly after the publication of Murray's ''The Omni-Americans: Black Experience &amp; American Culture'' (1970).&lt;ref name="pshares.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/portfolio/books/book167.html|title=Portfolio at NYU: Albert Murray, The Omni-Americans|publisher=NYU: Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===

McPherson taught English and creative writing at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (assistant professor; 1969–1971), the [[Harvard University]] summer school (1972), Morgan State University (assistant professor; 1975–1976) and the [[University of Virginia]] (associate professor; 1976–1981) before joining the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCIVCgAAQBAJ|title=Blacks at Harvard: A Documentary History of African-American Experience at Harvard and Radcliffe|first1=Werner|last1=Sollors|first2=Caldwell|last2=Titcomb|first3=Thomas A.|last3=Underwood|date=March 1, 1993|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=August 1, 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he was associated for the remainder of his life. He served as acting director of the program for two years following the death of [[Frank Conroy]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="pshares.org"/&gt; Following the publication of ''[[Elbow Room (short story collection)|Elbow Room]]'' (his final collection of fiction) in 1977, McPherson primarily focused on his teaching career, with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' characterizing him as being "only slightly more gregarious than [[J.D. Salinger]]."&lt;ref name="post-obit"/&gt;

He was also a visiting scholar at [[Yale Law School]] (1978–1979) and a fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] (1997–1998; 2002–2003). Significantly, McPherson lectured in [[Japan]] (at [[Meiji University]] and [[Chiba University]]), a country whose society and culture profoundly affected him.&lt;ref name="atlantic-monthly"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/mcpherso/jambio.htm | title=James Alan McPherson: Contributor Profile | publisher=''The Atlantic Monthly'' Company | work=The Atlantic-''online''| date=1976 | accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Japan, he once wrote, where he went to lay down "the burden carried by all black Americans, especially the males."&lt;ref name="post-obit"/&gt;

''Crabcakes: A Memoir'', his first original work since ''Elbow Room'', was published in 1998. His final book (''A Region Not Home: Reflections on Exile'', an essay collection) was published in 2000.

==Recognition==
In 1972, McPherson was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/james-a-mcpherson/|title=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation –   James A. McPherson|publisher=|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1978 for his short story collection ''Elbow Room'', becoming the first black writer to receive the program's Fiction Prize.&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pulitzer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1978|title=The Pulitzer Prizes &amp;#124; Awards|publisher=pulitzer.org|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the recipient of a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1981,&lt;ref name="MacArthur"/&gt; a member of the first group (21 recipients in all) ever selected for one of the MacArthur Foundation's so-called "genius grants."&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"/&gt; In 1995, McPherson was inducted into the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/content/system/search.aspx?s=James%20Alan%20McPherson|title=Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences Website Search|publisher=|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, [[John Updike]] selected McPherson's short story "Gold Coast" for his collection ''Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin).&lt;ref name="BAS"/&gt;

In October 2011, McPherson was honored as the inaugural recipient of the [[Paul Engle]] Award from the Iowa City UNESCO City of Literature. According to the citation:

{{quote|The ''Engle Award'' honors an individual who, like Engle, longtime director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and co-founder of the [[International Writing Program]] at the [[University of Iowa]], represents a pioneering spirit in the world of literature through writing, editing, publishing, or teaching, and whose active participation in the larger issues of the day has contributed to the betterment of the world through the literary arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowacityofliterature.org/paul-engle-prize/|title=City of Literature Paul Engle Prize – Iowa City UNESCO City of Literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Death ==
McPherson died in [[hospice]] on July 27, 2016, in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], due to complications of [[pneumonia]]. He was 72.&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/27/487686023/writer-james-alan-mcpherson-winner-of-pulitzer-macarthur-and-guggenheim-dies-at|title=Writer James Alan McPherson, Winner Of Pulitzer, MacArthur And Guggenheim, Dies At 72|last=|first=|date=July 27, 2016|website=www.npr.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by a daughter, Rachel McPherson (a child from his first marriage to the former Sarah Charlton, which had ended in divorce); a son from another relationship, Benjamin Miyamoto; a sister; and a brother.&lt;ref name="post-obit"/&gt;

'''Jean McGlothlin Doerge''' (born June 4, 1937) is a retired school [[teacher]] and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] former member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] from [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], who represented District 10 ([[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]]) from the death in 1998 of her husband, [[Everett Doerge]], until January 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf |title=Membership of the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-2020 |publisher=house.louisiana.gov |accessdate=November 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105414/http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf |archivedate=October  6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, her colleagues named her to the House [[Appropriation (law)|Appropriations]] Committee, a key panel that approves state spending. While in the legislature Doerge (pronounced DURR GHEE) was a member of the [[Hurricane Katrina]] Memorial Commission and the Democratic Caucus.

==Background==

She was born to Thomas McGlothlin (1903–1966) and the former Cora Vercher (1904–1975) in tiny Galbraith in [[Natchitoches Parish]] in [[Central Louisiana]]. She was the middle child in a family of seven daughters. She graduated from Cloutierville High School in Natchitoches Parish. Thereafter, she attended [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], where she met Everett Doerge, a native of Minden. They married in August 1957, and both graduated in 1958. Later, she received her [[master's degree]] from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] and thirty additional hours of credits in professional education from [[Louisiana Tech University]] in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]].

Doerge first taught at [[Minden High School (Minden, Louisiana)|Minden High School]] when it was ranked among the ten best schools in the state. For several years, the Doerges moved around, having been teachers for two years in [[Arp, Texas|Arp]] in [[Smith County, Texas|Smith County. Texas]]. When Everett went to Northwestern as an assistant coach, Jean worked in an office in Natchitoches. Later, she resumed teaching in the town of [[Cotton Valley, Louisiana|Cotton Valley]] in Webster Parish.

In March 1965, the Doerges adopted their daughter, Sherie, now a Minden High School educator who was married until his death to Kevin Lester (1963-2016), the purchasing manager at [[Calumet Specialty Products Partners]] in Cotton Valley. There are two Doerge grandsons, Justin and Jacob Lester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://press-herald.com/kevin-lester/|title=Kevin Lester obituary|publisher=''[[Minden Press-Herald]]''|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Mrs. Doerge returned to Minden High School and worked in the business education department there until 1992, when both she and her husband retired. In 1985, she was named "Louisiana Business Educator of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press-Herald'', November 28, 1985, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns and elections==

Everett Doerge ran for the Louisiana House, winning by only seventy-one votes over the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[incumbent]] [[Eugene S. Eason]] of [[Springhill, Louisiana|Springhill]] in northern Webster Parish.

Doerge was a big reelection winner in 1995, when he defeated two Republican women. He died near the end of his second term. Jean, widowed at the age of sixty-one, ran in the [[special election]] to succeed him and was an easy winner. She polled 3,048 votes (67 percent) to defeat the Democrat-turned-Republican Garland Mack Garrett, an oil company owner from [[Springhill, Louisiana|Springhill]] born in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;"Garrett is Senate challenger", ''Minden Press-Herald'', September 16, 1987, p. 4A&lt;/ref&gt; who obtained 1,481 ballots (33 percent). She was subsequently elected without opposition to full terms in 1999 and 2003. Doerge is the third woman to succeed her husband in the Webster Parish state House seat. [[Lizzie P. Thompson]] and [[Mary Smith Gleason]] were both named to the seat by [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Earl Kemp Long]] in 1951 and 1959, respectively, when their husbands, [[C.W. Thompson]] and [[E.D. Gleason]], died in office. Unlike Doerge, neither Thompson nor Gleason sought to hold the seat for a term of her own.

==Legislative accomplishments==

In 2001, Mrs. Doerge worked to establish a special district to authorize the creation of a fire and emergency training service district, only the second  created in Louisiana. She helped various residents in the [[Dubberly, Louisiana|Dubberly]] community in south Webster Parish obtain [[water]] service when their wells went dry. She also helped to secure a grant for the Cotton Valley water system.

She has worked to obtain services for Springhill. In 2002, she helped the Springhill Medical Center obtain placement in the Rural Hospital Coalition, a move which enabled the facility to obtain additional funds. She pushed for the designation of a tourism center in Springhill, with appropriate directional signs to the new facility. She also worked for a jogging trail in Frank Anthony Park and for the funding to renovate the Spring Theater.

She pushed successfully for funding to relocate the [[Northwest Louisiana Technical College]] (formerly the Northwest Louisiana Vocational-Technical School) in Minden to a new campus off the [[Interstate 20]] service road, which opened in 2013.

Doerge pulled strings to obtain special surgery in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], for a [[cerebral palsy]] patient, 5-year-old Jeremy Logan Curtis. Had she not acted, the child would have been a permanent invalid. The surgery was successful, and the child was thereafter able to walk and play and faces a bright future.

Doerge's ''alma mater'', NSU, inducted her into the College of Business Hall of Distinction. Her name is engraved on a plaque located in the foyer of Russell Hall. The Louisiana Police Jury [equivalent of county commission in other states] Association presented her with its "Friends of the Parishes" award.

==A cancer survivor==

Doerge is a [[breast cancer]] survivor. In an interview with the late Juanita Agan of the ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', the [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]] Doerge attributed her recovery to the will and love of [[God]] and His answer to her prayers for strength and endurance, the care of her physicians, the love of her family, and the concern of friends. Late in 2004, she was declared cancer-free.

==Reelection in 2007==

Doerge easily retained her seat in the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on October 20, 2007. She received 6,681 votes (57 percent) to 4,133 (35 percent) for [[Ronnie Broughton]] of Minden, the then president of the Webster Parish School Board and a Republican who later left that party to become the state chairman of the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/07/26/constitution-party-meets-possible-presidential-nominee/30705579/|title=Constitution Party meets possible presidential nominee|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|The Alexandria Town Talk]]''|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[African American]] candidate, Terrell Mendenhall of [[Cullen, Louisiana|Cullen]], polled 915 ballots (8 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10202007/10202007_Legislative.html|title=Election Results|date=October 20, 2007|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Broughton had committed to the victorious Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Bobby Jindal]], but Doerge had proclaimed her neutrality in the governor's race in which her former legislative colleague, [[Foster Campbell]], was also a candidate. Broughton questioned why Louisiana Highway 371 remains a two-lane road. He had promised if elected to "bring transportation dollars home to our area." Broughton also proclaimed himself a pro-life candidate: "Life starts at conception, marriage is between a man and woman, and the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] should be protected and held sacred."

==Term-limited in 2011==

Doerge was term-limited in 2011. In the primary election held on October 22, three Republicans, Ronnie Broughton making a second bid for the seat, businessman and former banker Gerald Holland of Springhill, and educator and businesswoman Jeri de Pingre of Minden, and a Democrat, [[Gene Reynolds (Louisiana politician)|Harlie Eugene "Gene" Reynolds]] of Dubberly, sought to succeed Doerge.&lt;ref name=returns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10222011/10222011_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 22, 2011|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Senator]] [[David Vitter]]'s campaign organization, the Louisiana Committee for a Republican Majority, has urged primary voters to support either Broughton or Holland but omitted de Pingre from the recommended choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/newsflash/index.ssf/story/a-look-at-the-la-races-targeted-by-vitter-group/040a85707eb64de5a2df981301da0733|title=A look at the La. races targeted by the Vitter group, August 4, 2011|publisher=nola.com|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Area Democrats, including Doerge, endorsed Reynolds, who like Doerge is a former educator.

Reynolds led the four-candidate field with 3,725 votes (39 percent), and de Pingre trailed with 2,498 votes (26.1 percent). Both candidates backed by Senator Vitter finished out of the running. Gerald Holland received 2,131 votes (22.3 percent), and Ronnie Broughton, Doerge's opponent from 2007, trailed with 1,205 votes (12.6 percent).&lt;ref name=returns/&gt;

In the general election held on November 19, 2011, Reynolds defeated Republican de Pingre, 4,232 votes (54.7 percent) to 3,508 votes (45.3 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He hence succeeded Doerge on January 9, 2012.

==Museum director==

Doerge is now the director of the [[Germantown Colony and Museum]] in Webster Parish. A $512,000 visitor center, for which she worked as a lawmaker to obtain the appropriation, opened in November 2014. The [[Dogtrot house|dogtrot]]-style building showcases [[Germany|German]] settlers who established a [[commune]] in North Louisiana beginning in the mid-1800s in a quest to avoid religious persecution. This is the last museum to have been added to the state system: "We are telling a part of history that's almost been lost. We're opening that up to not only adults but children as well," Doerge said.&lt;ref name=kakent&gt;Kate Archer Kent, "Germantown Colony Museum reopens in Minden, 1800s artifacts preserved", mediad.publicbroadcasting.net, November 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justin Fritz Leiber''' (July 8, 1938 – March 22, 2016) was an American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[science fiction]] writer. He was the son of [[fantasy]], [[horror fiction|horror]] and science fiction author [[Fritz Leiber]] and the grandson of stage and film actor [[Fritz Leiber, Sr.]]&lt;ref name=Lischka/&gt; Previously a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Houston]], Leiber was most recently a professor emeritus of philosophy at [[Florida State University]]. He was a visiting [[fellow]] at [[Linacre College, Oxford]] during the [[Trinity term]] on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Csomay (1982), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Leiber was born in 1938 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]&lt;ref name=Lischka&gt;Lischka (2009), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UH&gt;University of Houston (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; to writers Fritz Leiber and Jonquil Stephens Leiber.&lt;ref name=UH/&gt; After completing his primary and secondary schooling at the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], he went on to receive [[A.B.]] (1958), [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] (1960) and [[Ph.D.]] (1967) degrees in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and a [[Bachelor of Philosophy#University of Oxford|B.Phil]] (1972) from [[St. Catherine's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Soble (1997), 628.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Leiber had numerous academic appointments, including an instructorship at [[Memphis State University]] (1962–1963) and assistant professorships at [[Utica College of Syracuse University]] (1963–1965), the [[State University of New York at Buffalo]] (1966–1968) and [[Lehman College]] (1968–1977). While at the latter institution, he held visiting appointments at [[King's College London]] (honorary visitor; 1970–1971), St. Catherine's College, Oxford (philosophy tutor; 1971–1972) and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (visiting scientist; 1976–1978).&lt;ref&gt;Curriculum vitae.&lt;/ref&gt; A full professor at the [[University of Houston]] from 1978 onward,&lt;ref&gt;Eakin (2001), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Leiber ended his career at [[Florida State University]].

==Death==
Leiber died on March 22, 2016 in [[Tallahassee, Florida]] from [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tallahassee/obituary.aspx?n=justin-leiber&amp;pid=178146761&amp;fhid=5827#sthash.bcpALHbm.dpuf|title=Tallahassee Democrat|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailynous.com/2016/03/25/justin-leiber-1938-2016/|title=Daily Nous|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Leiber's publications encompass a number of subjects, including philosophy, [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name=UH/&gt; He published several papers on  [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing Test]] and Turing's mathematical [[Turing Machines]] and biological achievements, arguing that Turing Test passage requires actual, real time, reliable passage, thus excluding challenges to the Test by [[John Searle]] and others (Leiber 2006a, 1995, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Moor (2003), 496.&lt;/ref&gt; He also defends Turing's demand for a biology that excludes selectionist and functional explanations (Leiber 2006a, 2001) and he has offered a related critique of [[evolutionary psychology]] (Leiber 2008, 2006b). In several works (Leiber 1991,1988, 1975) he articulates the nativist and rationalist linguistics of [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Campos and Martínez-Gil (1992), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In a critical notice of Leiber's ''Invitation to Cognitive Science'', Diane Proudfoot and Jack Copeland comment that "He provides a rationale for the Turing test which knits together the motivational remarks of Turing's 1950 article more satisfyingly than any previously proposed and he draws attention to Turing's anticipation of connectionism in 1948."&lt;ref&gt;Proudfoot and Copeland (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging that Leiber's interpretation of Turing's 1936 paper is widely shared, they argue that this consensus "distorts both Turing's achievement and the epistemic status of the computational theory of mind." Proudfoot and Copeland also comment that "Leiber upsets the common view of Wittgenstein by arguing that theses in the ''Philosophical Investigations'' commit Wittgenstein to a scientific approach the mind and encourage a specifically computational theory of mind...[stressing] central elements of Wittgenstein's constructive accounts of mind and language." However, they are critical of Leiber's audacious interpretation.
   
Some of both his fiction and non-fiction books and papers have dealt with [[intelligence]] and [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Clute (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Hauser credits Leiber's dialogue, ''Can Animals and Machines Be Persons?'' for articulating the claim that "the solipsistic predicament pertains to individuals not species," so that if one can reliably tell that other humans have minds it would be sheer chauvinism to maintain one could never know whether something non-human had a mind.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser (1993), 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesley McLean comments that "Justin Leiber, who Dennett cites as a source for exposing certain hidden agendas distorting objective research into animal consciousness, himself offers a subjective account for why indeed we might doubt the link between moral standing and having of a mind [Leiber 1988]...What is interesting is that neither [[Descartes]] nor Leiber thinks animals to be conscious, yet they nevertheless think them worthy of moral consideration."&lt;ref name="McLean 2007"&gt;McLean (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Singer, Mary Midgley, and others cite L. C. Rosenfield's ''From Beast-Machine to Man-Machine: Animal Soul in French Letters from Descartes to LaMettrie'' (New York, Oxford University Press, 1941) for a ghastly account of animal cruelty by unnamed Cartesians, but Singer and the rest fail to mention that Rosenfield dismisses the account as a pious anti-Cartesian fabrication, and further, that Rosenfield maintains that Descartes himself was never accused of cruelty to animals, nor did Descartes  maintain that animals could not feel pain&lt;ref name="McLean 2007"/&gt;(Leiber 1988).

Begun while he was a Visiting Scientist at MIT, Justin Leiber’s first novel, ''Beyond Rejection'', starts with a lengthy description of a “mind implant” operation in which the software mind of one individual is inserted into the hardware brain and body of another. Provocative and detailed, the description has been anthologized in several text books, most notably in Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett’s [[The Mind's I]]. The novel’s protagonist, with memories of a male body, awakens to a female one and must find a way beyond rejection. In ''Beyond Humanity'', the protagonist deals with the claims to personhood of both apes and computers – themes that Hackett Publishing suggested might also be incorporated into a dialogue, ''Can Animals and Machines Be Persons?'' In ''Beyond Gravity'', Leiber’s protagonist discovers that earth has long been studied by alien “anthropologists,” who write articles about humans which appear in a journal whose title might be translated into humanese as “Primitivity Review.” As this description suggests, Leiber’s Beyond trilogy is largely taken up with issues in philosophy and cognitive science. The same might not be said of Leiber’s sword and sorcery novels ''The Sword and the Eye'' and ''The Sword and the Tower''.

'''Kianda School''' is a [[Private school|private]], all-girls [[day school]] with a Catholic ethos located in the [[Westlands]] area of [[Nairobi]], Kenya. The school was opened in 1977 by The Kianda Foundation, a non-profit organisation that aims to better Kenyan women's lives through education and Christian values. The school began with 40 students but has now grown to a student body of about 830 in both its [[Primary school|primary]] and secondary school sections.

== Logo and motto ==
The school logo consists of a palm tree to symbolise tropical Africa, a deep valley, which is the meaning of the word "Kianda" in several [[Bantu languages]], and a glowing fire to symbolise a hearth, a symbol of the warmth a woman brings to the home and to society.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://kianda-foundation.org/kiandaschool/about_logo.html Kianda School website – The Logo].&lt;/ref&gt;

The school motto is '''In Opere et Veritate''', Latin for "In deed and in truth". The motto was inspired by the Bible verse 1 John 3:18, which says: " My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://bible.cc/1_john/3-18.htm The Bible].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
Kianda School is consistently ranked as one of the best performing schools in the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education|Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E)]] exam. Subjects offered at Kianda School are: Mathematics, English, Kiswahili, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Home Science, Computer Studies, French, Business Studies, Geography, and History and Government.

In the KCSE exam of 2010, Kianda School was ranked 13th nationally and 4th in the private schools category with an average grade of B+. It was ranked 4th place nationally in English (Av. 11.09, A-), 5th nationally in Mathematics  (Av. 10.49, B+), 8th nationally in Biology (Av. 10.43, B+) and 8th nationally in Physics (Av. 10.48, B+).&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[http://kianda-foundation.org/kiandaschool/Academics%20news.html Kianda School website – Academics].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissions and school fees ==

===Primary School admissions===
For admission to the primary school, the parents of the prospective pupil write a letter of application to the school, enclosing the child's birth certificate and a letter of recommendation from the head teacher of the child's nursery school.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://kianda-foundation.org/kiandaschool/admissions.html Kianda School – Admissions].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary School admissions===
For admission to the secondary school, the parents of the prospective student write a letter of application to the school, with the results of the student's mock [[KCPE|Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (K.C.P.E)]] exam as well as a letter of recommendation from the head teacher of the primary school. The prospective student must then sit the Kianda Entrance Test (K.E.T) and be interviewed before the decision of admittance is made.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

===School fees===
The basic school fees ranges from Ksh.73,000 to Ksh. 95,000 per term. There are three terms in the school year. The fees caters for tuition, books and school uniform.  Additional costs include lunch, transport and music lessons.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://www.kiandaschool.ac.ke/?page=38c16970e154528531ae4e62f6c6fc82].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bursaries===
About 10% of the students at Kianda School receive full or partial scholarships. This ensures that no qualified student is barred from attending the school due to financial constraints. The school's Scholarship Fund has increased its endowment to better assist students who require financial aid.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;[http://kianda-foundation.org/kiandaschool/Scholarship.html Kianda Scholarship Fund].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000035601&amp;cid=620&amp; The Standard Newspaper Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==
Emphasis is placed not only on academics but also on spiritual life, fitness and character building. Kianda School offers daily [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], weekly meditations and annual spiritual retreats for its students. Inspired by the spirit of [[Opus Dei]], the offering up of various aspects of daily life to God is encouraged. The annual spiritual retreats and daily mass are optional.

The tutorial system: the school considers the parents to be the primary educators. For this reason, staff and parents work together through the tutorial system, a key feature of the school. Through this system, every student has a tutor -a mentor-who gives personal guidance in all areas of her formation. The tutor maintains close contact with the parents.
The tutorial system allows for greater parental involvement. Parents can contribute actively in their daughter’s education, and by so doing, help to forge her character. Together with the tutor they try to bring out the best in every girl.

There are clubs and sports in which the students can take part. The clubs include Journalism, Wildlife, Home-makers, Law, Choir, Public Speaking, First-Aid, French, Kiswahili and Math &amp; Tax. The school offers sports such as basketball, hockey, squash, swimming, taekwondo and tennis. [[Community service]] is a part of student life, and is usually done during the school holidays.

== Traditions ==
Kianda School has a school song and a school hymn, both of which were written by students.

Discipline is maintained by a merit-demerit system. Good deeds earn merits, while wrong ones earn demerits. An accumulation of more than five demerits a week results in detention.

In the primary school, failure to do assignments earns the student a demerit. Accumulation of 3 demerits earns a detention. However, a teacher can choose to give a student more that one demerit for a single assignment and students who appear to be rude earn a direct detention. Three detentions in a term earn a suspension. Any form of violence earns a suspension.

The Kianda School [[student council]] is called the Class Council. There is a Class Council for each class composed of four students. Students vote for the Class Council but it is ultimately the teachers and the Section Committee that decide who the Class Council members will be.

There are four school houses: Green, Yellow House, Red and Blue. Each house has a house mistress and a captain, usually a Form Four student, and an assistant captain, usually a Form Three student. The captain and her assistant are voted in annually by the teachers. The houses compete in sports, merits and demerits, and other aspects of school life. The winning house is announced at the end of the year and gets to go on a special trip while the other houses remain in school.

There are four major events in the school each year: the Family Sports Day in the second term, the Creative Arts Variety Show and Kianda Awards Days in the third term, and the annual Christmas Concert.

A '''law school''' (also known as a '''law centre''' or '''college of law''') is an institution specializing in [[legal education]], usually involved as part of a process for becoming a [[lawyer]] within a given jurisdiction.
{{TOC limit|limit=4}}

== Law degrees ==

=== Australia ===
To practice in Australia, one needs to graduate with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Juris Doctor (JD), or Diploma-in-Law issued by the Legal Profession Admission Board, followed by an internship for 12 months or an extra course in practical legal training (PLT) depending on the jurisdiction and university, and be admitted as a lawyer of one of a state's Supreme Court.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil the legal education begins between 1827/28 in Olinda/PE and São Paulo/SP where the first Schools of Law were established by the new Empire using as educational model the Coimbra Faculty of Law.

Nowadays the legal education consists in a 5-year-long course in which, afterwards, the scholar is granted a bachelor´s degree.&lt;ref&gt;portal.mec.gov.br/cne/arquivos/pdf/rces09_04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is considered part of the higher education, hence the educational system is regulated as: i) basic education - primary, middle and high school; and ii) higher education: licentiate, bachelor and vocational ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/educacao/2014/05/saiba-como-e-a-divisao-do-sistema-de-educacao-brasileiro/view|title=Saiba como é a divisão do sistema de educação brasileiro|first=Portal|last=Brasil|website=Governo do Brasil|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173640/http://www.brasil.gov.br/educacao/2014/05/saiba-como-e-a-divisao-do-sistema-de-educacao-brasileiro/view|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of law is conditioned upon admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - OAB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oab.org.br/|title=OAB - Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - Conselho Federal|author=|date=|website=oab.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Public attorneys, public prossecutors and magistrates (judges) admission is made, mainly, through an entrance examination and a constitutional mandatory three years of legal experience. Starting from the second degree courts it is mandatory a 1/5 of its composition to be fulfilled with members of the lawyers/attorneys/barristers association and also from federal/state/labour processcutors (ministério público) regarding the court jurisdiction (it is not applied for electoral and military courts).

After achieving the bachelor´s degree of laws it is possible to follow an i) specialization or follow ii) academically (or both), in either case it is called postgraduation: i) lato sensu; or ii) stricto sensu; respectively.

The postgraduation, stricto sensu, consists in a: a) master´s degree, which is usually a two-year degree; and a b) doctorate´s degree, which can take up another four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capes.gov.br/avaliacao/sobre-a-avaliacao/legislacao-especifica|title=Legislação específica|first=Coordenação de Comunicação Social da|last=Capes|website=www.capes.gov.br|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504090933/http://www.capes.gov.br/avaliacao/sobre-a-avaliacao/legislacao-especifica|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the Canadian legal system includes both the French civil law and the Anglo-American common law, some law schools offer both an LL.B. or J.D. (common law) and a B.C.L., LL.L. or LL.B. (civil law) degree, such as [[McGill University]], [[University of Ottawa]] and the [[Université de Montréal]]. In particular, [[McGill University Faculty of Law]] offers a combined civil law and common law program, which has been called "transsystemic."&lt;ref&gt;Where Law and Pedagogy Meet in the Transsystemic Contracts Classroom {{cite web |url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/global/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723233130/http://www.law.nyu.edu/global/index.htm |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}.

This is also true for civil law graduates who wish to complete a common law degree.

Despite changes in designation, schools opting for the J.D. have not altered their curricula. Neither the J.D. or LL.B. alone is sufficient to qualify for a Canadian license, as each Province's law society requires an apprenticeship and successful completion of provincial skills and responsibilities training course, such as the British Columbia Law Society's Professional Legal Training Course,&lt;ref&gt;Law Society of British Columbia PLTC {{cite web |url=http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/licensing_membership/pltc/intro.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118195103/http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/licensing_membership/pltc/intro.html |archivedate=2009-01-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Law Society of Upper Canada's Skills and Responsibilities Training Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocesslawyer/sitemap.jsp|title=Law Society of Upper Canada Law Licensing Process|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110054838/http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocesslawyer/sitemap.jsp|archivedate=2009-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bar of Quebec|École du Barreau du Québec]].

=== Finland ===
Law school is usually entered to at the undergraduate level in a university. There is an intermediate bachelor's degree (''oikeusnotaari''), but the target is the master's degree in law (''oikeustieteen maisteri''; until 2005 ''oikeustieteen kandidaatti''). Once university education is complete, the title of ''[[varatuomari]]'' (VT) is obtained with an one-year [[externship]] in a district court. This is the basic qualification to practice law. With further experience, the candidate may be admitted to the Finnish Bar Association and licensed with the legally protected title ''[[Advokat|asianajaja]]'', similar to [[barrister]].

===France===
In France, the legal education is a three tier system. The student may study for a LLB (''licence de droit''), then a LLM (''master de droit'') and, for those interested in Law theory, a PhD in Law (''doctorat de droit'').

Many [[universities in France|French universities]] offers Law courses in department labelled as Research and Education Units (''unité de formation et de recherche'') and/or Faculties of Law or Law Schools.

A LLM-level is a prerequisite for some legal professions, but is combined with vocational education, such as the [[école nationale de la magistrature]] for judges and the ''Certificat d'aptitude aux fonctions d'avocat'' for [[advocate]]s.

===Indonesia===
Law Degree in Indonesia consists of three tier systems. The first tier is the Degree of which carries the title of Sarjana Hukum/S.H. (Bachelor of Law). This can be obtained in 4–7 years after they enter Law School straight from Senior High School.

The second tier varies depending on the legal specialties taken after the first tier. The general title for this tier is Magister Hukum / M.H. (Master in Law). Although it is also common to see other title for secondary tier such as Magister Kenotariatan / M.Kn. (Master in Notary) for Notarial professionals line of work. The second tier can be obtained normally in 1-2 year.

The third tier in Indonesian Law Degree is Doctor / DR. (Doctor in Law).

To work in legal professions of choice in Indonesia, a Bachelor Law Degree (S.H.) is obligatory. Graduates can pursue their career as Legal in-house counsel, Judge profession (requires admission and further training at Supreme Court Educational Center), Public Prosecutor (requires admission and further training at Public Prosecutor Educational and Training Center), other legal-related work and Advocate.

In India, legal education has been traditionally offered as a three-year graduate degree. However, the structure has been changed since 1987. [[Law degree]]s in India are granted and conferred in terms of the Advocates Act, 1961, which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |title=Advocates Act, 1961 |publisher=Bar Council of India |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the act, the [[Bar Council of India]] is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country.

To this regard, the Bar Council of India prescribes the minimum curriculum required to be taught in order for an institution to be eligible for the grant of a law degree. The Bar Council also carries on a periodic supervision of the institutions conferring the degree and evaluates their teaching methodology and curriculum and having determined that the institution meets the required standards, recognizes the institution and the degree conferred by it.

Traditionally the degrees that were conferred carried the title of LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law). The eligibility requirement for these degrees was that the applicant already have a [[Bachelor's degree]] in any subject from a recognized institution. Thereafter the LL.B. / B.L. course was for three years, upon the successful completion of which the applicant was granted either degree.

However, upon the suggestion by the [[Law Commission of India]] and also given the prevailing cry for reform, the Bar Council of India instituted upon an [[National Law School of India University#Experiment in legal education|experiment]] in terms of establishing specialized law universities solely devoted to legal education and thus to raise the academic standards of legal profession in India. This decision was taken somewhere in 1985 and thereafter the first law University in India was set up in [[Bangalore]] which was named as the [[National Law School of India University]] (popularly 'NLS'). These law universities were meant to offer a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach to legal education.  It was therefore for the first time that a law degree other than LL.B. or B.L. was granted in India. [[National Law School of India University|NLS]] offered a five-year law course, upon the successful completion of which an integrated degree with the title of "B.A.,LL.B. (Honours)" would be granted.

Thereafter, [[Autonomous Law Schools in India|other law universities]] were set up, all offering five-year integrated law degrees with different nomenclature. The next in line was [[National Law Institute University]] set up in [[Bhopal]] in 1997. It was followed by NALSAR university of law in 1998. The [[Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University]] in [[Delhi]] offered a five-year integrated law degree course of LL.B (Honours) from 1998 and subsequently from 2007 started to award the B.A.,LL.B / B.B.A.LL.B (Honours). The Mysore University School of Justice set up by the [[University of Mysore]] in [[Mysore]] offered a five-year integrated law degree course of B.A.,LL.B (Honours) from 2007. The course for three years LL.B. is also regularized in [[University of Delhi]] as an option for post graduation after the completion of graduation degree. The [[National Law University, Jodhpur]] offered for the first time in 2001 the integrated law degree of "B.B.A, LL.B. (Honours)" which was preceded by the [[West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences]] offering the "B.Sc., LL.B. (Honours)" degree. [[Gujarat National Law University]] established in [[Gandhinagar]] also offers LL.B.

However, despite these [[Autonomous Law Schools in India|specialized law universities]], the traditional three-year degree continues to be offered in India by other institutions and are equally recognized as eligible qualifications for practicing law in India. Another essential difference that remains is that while the eligibility qualification for the three year law degree is that the applicant must already be a holder of a bachelor's degree, for being eligible for the five years integrated law degree, the applicant must have successfully completed Class XII from a recognized [[Boards of Education in India]].

Both the holders of the three-year degree and of the five-year integrated degree are eligible for enrollment with the Bar Council of India upon the fulfillment of eligibility conditions and upon enrollment, may appear before any court in India.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;''Major Legal Systems in the World Today: An Introduction to the Comparative Study of Law'', by René David, John E.

=== Iran ===
In Iran, the legal education has been influenced both by civil law and Islamic Shari'ah law. Like many countries, after high school, one can enter the law school. The first law degree is LL.B. It takes about four years to get LL.B. The first graduate program in law is LL.M. It takes about two to three years to earn an LL.M. The LL.M. is a mix of course work in a specific field of law and a dissertation. The Ph.D. in law is the highest law degree offered by some law schools. It takes about 5–7 years depending on the school as well as the students.

Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the [[Philippines]]. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the [[Philippine Bar Examination]], the national licensure examination for practicing lawyers in the country. The bar examination is administered by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] during the month of September every year.

As of 2011 the bar examinations were held during November.

The '''[[University of Santo Tomas]] '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]]''' was the first secular faculty, and hence the oldest law school in the Philippines.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, the primary route for obtaining a legal education to qualify as a practicing lawyer is via a 4-year Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from either the [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]], or the [[Singapore Management University School of Law]]. A third law school affiliated to the [[Singapore University of Social Sciences]] will commence its first intake in 2017, aimed primarily at producing law graduates focused on family, criminal and community justice law, as there is a pressing need for lawyers practicing in these areas.

Additionally, the SMU School of Law offers the 3-year [[Juris Doctor]] degree for aspiring candidates who have already completed a prior undergraduate course of study and who have been award a bachelor's degree in another field. The SMU J.D. is recognised for qualification to the Singapore Bar.

There are several private law schools in Singapore that are run by private education providers and which also award the Bachelor of Laws degree. These private law schools are neither recognised nor supported by the government and their graduates are, in the vast majority of cases, ineligible for qualification to the [[Admission to practice law#Singapore|Singapore Bar]].

A degree in law (bachelor, master or doctor) is a pre-requisite for Taiwan's bar examination. According to Ministry of Examination figures, the pass rate for the 2011 exam was 10.6%.  Since the bar exam is conducted in Chinese, a native level of language fluency is expected.

Non-citizens are not allowed to sit in the prosecutor or judge examinations unless they are naturalized citizens of Taiwan.

An unpublished table produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that unemployment rates among experienced lawyers are lower than those for most high-income occupations.&lt;ref name="Tableau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-biggest-salary|title=Who's Got the Biggest Salary?|date=30 July 2012|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095404/http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-biggest-salary|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BLS data also suggests that lawyer employment has grown slightly faster than other occupations, with lawyers comprising a growing share of the work force over the last decade.
 
However, not all recent law graduates work as lawyers.  According to Simkovic and McIntyre's study of U.S. Census Bureau data, around 40 percent of U.S. residents with law degrees do not practice law.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt;   Law graduates are disproportionately represented in leadership positions in business and government.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt; The National Association for Legal Career Professionals produces an annual report summarizing the employment of recent graduates of U.S. law schools at a single point in time, 9 months of graduation.  Employment at that point is typically around 90 percent, although from 2009 to 2011, the numbers have been lower, at around 86 to 88 percent.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nalp.org/0712research|title=NALP - National Association for Law Placement - Class of 2011 Has Lowest Employment Rate Since Class of 1994|website=www.nalp.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413114301/http://www.nalp.org/0712research|archivedate=2015-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 2 percent of graduates were employed in non-professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt;  Approximately 75 to 85 percent work in jobs classified by NALP as "JD required" or "JD preferred", and another 5 percent work in other professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt;  However, a law degree increases earnings, even including those who do not practice law.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt;

==Postgraduate and professional study==
Some schools offer a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) program as a way of specializing in a particular area of law. A further possible degree is the academic [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]] in law of [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Juridical Science]] (S.J.D.) (in the U.S or Canada)., or the Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) in Canada or the UK, or the Ph.D. in Law from European or Australasian universities.

In addition to attending law school, many jurisdictions require law school graduates to pass a state or provincial [[bar examination]] before they may practice law. The [[Multistate Bar Examination]] is part of the bar examination in almost all United States jurisdictions. Generally, the standardized, [[common law]] subject matter of the MBE is combined with state-specific [[Essay#Academic essays|essay questions]] to produce a comprehensive bar examination.

In other common law countries the bar exam is often replaced by a period of work with a law firm known as articles of clerkship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== Alternative legal education systems ==

===UK and Europe===
While law schools in the U.S. and Canada are typically [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] institutions with considerable autonomy, legal education in other countries is provided within the mainstream educational system from university level and/or in non-degree conferring vocational training institutions.

In countries such as the United Kingdom and most of continental Europe, academic legal education is provided within the mainstream university system starting at the [[undergraduate]] level, and the legal departments of universities are simply departments like any other rather than separate "law schools". In these countries, the term "law school" may be used, but it does not have the same definition as it does in North America. The same is true for private Law Schools, e.g. in Germany two private law schools have been established, [[Bucerius Law School]] in Hamburg and EBS Law School in Wiesbaden which are termed law schools but follow the usual German path of legal education.

There are also sometimes legal colleges that provide vocational training as a post-academic stage of legal education. One example is the [[The University of Law|University of Law]] in the United Kingdom, which provides certain professional qualifications  lawyers in England and Wales must obtain before they may practice as solicitors or barristers.

===Australia===
In Australia, law schools such as the [[Melbourne Law School]], the [[Adelaide Law School]], and the [[Sydney Law School]] have emphasised a combination of the British and American systems. However, other universities such as the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and Monash University are known for their practical work.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the practical training in Australian law schools see Margaret Castles and Anne Hewitt 'Can a law school help develop skilled legal professionals' (2011) ALTERNATIVE LAW JOURNAL; 36 (2) 2011: 90–95. {{cite web |url=http://www.altlj.org/publications/current-issue/product/17-can-a-law-school-help-develop-skilled-legal-professionals-situational-learning-to-the-rescue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082656/http://www.altlj.org/publications/current-issue/product/17-can-a-law-school-help-develop-skilled-legal-professionals-situational-learning-to-the-rescue |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maritime College of Forest Technology''' (French: '''Collège de Technologie forestière des Maritimes''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] post-secondary college with campuses located in [[Fredericton]], [[New Brunswick]] (English instruction) and [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], [[New Brunswick]] (French instruction).

==History==

The Maritime College of Forest Technology (MCFT), formerly the Maritime Forest Ranger School (MFRS), in Fredericton, New Brunswick was established in April 1946, as a co-operative effort of the provincial governments of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], and the wood-using industries of the two provinces. The MCFT fulfils a regional mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Supporting the contribution of Higher Education Institutions to Regional Development within Atlantic Canada by Dr. Wade Locke. The Harris Centre. Memorial University of Newfoundland. December, 2006. Accessed 11 May 2015 at https://www.mun.ca/harriscentre/reports/arf/2006/FinalReportEduRegDevelLocke.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The original location for MFRS was on the grounds owned by the [[University of New Brunswick]] which housed Alexander College and is known today as the Fredericton Exhibition Grounds. In 1949 MFRS moved to its new location overlooking the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River Valley]]; at that time MFRS was the sole occupant of the land until the new campus was constructed in 1986. The current campus is part of the Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre and is shared with the [[Canadian Forest Service]] and [[Natural Resources Canada|Department of Natural Resources]]. Present facilities at the Fredericton Campus were completed in 1986. The francophone campus in [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]] was established in 1980 and the campus is shared with the [[Collège communautaire du Nouveau-Brunswick]].

From 1946 to 2003 the college was known as the Maritime Forest Ranger School and its curriculum was one year in length. In 2003 the college began its new two-year program and with that came the change in name to the Maritime College of Forest Technology.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Amend An Act to Incorporate the Maritime Forest Ranger School. Accessed 11 May 2015 at http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/pdf/54/5/Bill-38.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 MCFT began offering, in addition to the Forest Technology Program, an Advanced Diploma in Forest and Fish &amp; Wildlife Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcft.ca/en/explore/history/ Maritime College of Forest Technology: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael W. Allen''' (born 1946) is an [[United States|American]] software developer, educator, and author.
He is known for his work on [[e-learning]], and led the development of the [[Authorware]] software.

==Biography==
Allen received a BA in psychology from [[Cornell College]], and MA and Ph.D. from the [[Ohio State University]] in educational psychology.&lt;ref name="oldsite"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alleni.com/about/team.asp | title = Leadership Team | work = Allen Interactions | accessdate = July 4, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170354/http://www.alleni.com/about/team.asp |archivedate = January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1971 to 1984 Allen worked for [[Control Data Corporation]] on its [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] computer-based education system . He rose to be director of advanced educational systems R&amp;D.
Allen founded [[Authorware]] in 1984, incorporating it in 1985. Authorware merged with [[MacroMind]]-[[Paracomp]] in 1992 to form [[Macromedia]], which was later bought by [[Adobe Systems]].&lt;ref name="newsite"&gt;{{cite web |title= Our e-Learning Team |publisher= Allen Interactions Inc. |url= http://www.alleninteractions.com/our-e-learning-team |accessdate= July 4, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110904010534/http://www.alleninteractions.com/our-e-learning-team |archivedate= September 4, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen formed a spinoff of the professional services division of Authorware called MediaPros, which was acquired by Lifetouch, Inc. a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Learning Executive, Michael Allen, is Recognized by the American Society for Training &amp; Development |work= News release |date= June 3, 2011  |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/06/03/prweb8525049.DTL |accessdate= July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathan Englander''' (born 1970) is an American [[short story]] writer and novelist. His debut [[short story collection]], ''[[For the Relief of Unbearable Urges]],'' was published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], in 1999. His second collection, ''What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank'', won the 2012 [[Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award]] and was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]].

==Biography==
Nathan Englander was born in [[West Hempstead, New York|West Hempstead]] on [[Long Island]], New York, and grew up there as part of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E6DB103DF936A35754C0A96F958260 "Captured in Stories, The World He Left; For Author's Debut, Tales of Orthodox Jews"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 5, 1999. "Mr. Englander, who grew up in West Hempstead on Long Island, now lives in Jerusalem, and in that is one of the many paradoxes of his life."&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Hebrew Academy of Nassau County]] for high school and graduated from the [[Binghamton University|State University of New York at Binghamton]]  and the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. In the mid-1990s, he moved to [[Israel]], where he lived for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bupipedream.com/release/20390/binghamton-graduate-writes-with-dark-humor-jewish-wit/ Pipe Dream]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breuerpress.com/2013/01/20/kisufim-the-international-festival-of-jewish-writers-and-poets/ “Kisufim” – The International Festival of Jewish Writers and Poets]&lt;/ref&gt;

Englander lives in [[Brooklyn]], New York and [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. He taught fiction as a part of [[CUNY]] [[Hunter College]]'s Master of Fine Arts Program in Creative Writing and currently teaches fiction in the MFA program at [[New York University]].

==Literary career==
Since the publication of ''[[For the Relief of Unbearable Urges]]'', Englander has received  a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the Bard Fiction Prize, and a fellowship at the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/scholars/pastfellows.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of his short stories have appeared in editions of ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'': "The Gilgul of Park Avenue" appeared in the 2000 edition, with guest editor [[E.L. Doctorow]], "How We Avenged the Blums" appeared in the 2006 edition, guest edited by [[Ann Patchett]], "Free Fruit for Young Widows" appeared in the 2011 edition, guest edited by [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]], and "What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank" appeared in the 2012 edition, guest edited by [[Tom Perrotta]]. Another story in the collection, "The Twenty-Seventh Man," debuted as a play in November, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theandygram.com/Broadway-Press-Release-Retweet/2010-11-Theatre-Press-Releases/The-Public-Theater-Announces-2011-12-Season.html?print=1&amp;tmpl=component The Public Theater 2011-12 Season]&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of a radio program featuring audio of a reading by actor [[Michael Stuhlbarg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blubrry.com/selectedshorts/1584859/the-twenty-seventh-man/ | publisher = Public Radio International | work = Selected Shorts | title = 'The 27th Man' | date = 2012-11-04 | accessdate = 2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ministry of Special Cases,'' Englander's follow-up to his debut collection, was released on April 24, 2007. The novel is set in 1976 in [[Buenos Aires]] during Argentina's "[[Dirty War]]" and has been described as "an impeccably paced, historically accurate novel which is alternatively side-splitting and frighteningly macabre."&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Val. [http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/08/26/story26013.asp "Darkly comic tale of family in Argentina"], ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]'', August 26, 2007. Accessed August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Englander has said of his novel: "...&amp;nbsp;I resisted calling it a political book, in that it wasn’t my intent—that is, I had no corrupting (as I’d see it) preconceived position that I was pushing. There’s a lot of politics in my novel, because it’s central to the world of that novel."&lt;ref&gt;Galchen, Rivka. [http://bombmagazine.org/article/3210/nathan-englander-rivka-galchen "Nathan Englander&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Rivka Galchen"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', September, 2007. Retrieved August&amp;nbsp;28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Englander's third book, ''[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank]]'', a short story collection, was released on February 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/book/217135/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-anne-frank-by-nathan-englander Random House]&lt;/ref&gt; The title story was featured in the December 12, 2011 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/12/12/111212fi_fiction_englander The New Yorker Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the book won the 2012 [[Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award]] and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

In 2017, Englander was announced as juror for the 2017 [[Scotiabank Giller Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;"Introducing the 2017 Scotiabank Giller Prize Jury". ''[[Scotiabank Giller Prize]]'', http://www.scotiabankgillerprize.ca/introducing-the-2017-scotiabank-giller-prize-jury/ January 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interns typically participated in six-month programs, leaving between August and November for host organizations in the placement countries. Positions were limited to 19–30-year-old Canadian citizens or landed immigrants who had "appropriate information and communication technologies skills".&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; Typical duties included creating webpages, developing databases, computer networking, setting up hardware, preparing manuals and other documentation, and general-to-advanced computer instruction.

==Program ==

===Objectives===

* To strengthen the ICT capacity of civil society and public-sector organizations to contribute to development goals in governance, education, health, gender equality and environmental sustainability
* Increase the professional skills and capacities of young Canadians aged 19 to 30 to contribute positively to Canadian international development efforts and secure meaningful employment
* To increase the awareness and promote greater engagement of young Canadians with respect to international development issues&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

===Budget===
During the 2007-2008 season, the program placed 240 interns and was funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and Human Resources and [[Social Development Canada]] (HRSDC) at a cost of C$4.6 million. The program covered all travel and accommodation expenses for the interns, provided a modest living allowance and a completion bonus.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

==History==

===NetCorps creation===

NetCorps Canada International was conceived in 1996 by Dr. David Johnston (Governor General of Canada as of 2011 and former President of the [[University of Waterloo]]), a prominent lawyer and adviser to the federal government on information-highway issues.

===Phase I===

In 1997 [[Industry Canada]], in partnership with the Special Initiatives Division of Canada's [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC), funded a NetCorps-style test project that sent two residents of Cape Breton to Angola for Internet and [[Geographic Information System]]s projects. This NetCorps conceptualization and placement was done through the Centre for Community and Enterprise Networking (C/CEN) and Dr.[[Michael Gurstein]], Director of the Centre and (at the time) Chair in the Management of Technology Change at the [[University College of Cape Breton]]. An initial NetCorps training program and manual were produced as a result of this program. Notably, the two placements in Angola were of previously unemployed young adults from Cape Breton; they were provided with training in [[Linux]] through C/CEN as part of a demonstration program in the economic benefits that could be achieved through local investment in Information and Communications Technologies in economically marginal regions.

===Phase II===

In 1998 the efforts of Industry Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and a consortium of Canada’s largest international development volunteer-sending agencies secured 14 internships in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

===Phase III===

Further collaboration with Industry Canada and the consortium of international development agencies in 1998 saw the Canadian International Development Agency offer 30 internships in the Americas. This phase was announced by the Prime Minister at the [[2nd Summit of the Americas]] in Santiago, Chile in April 1998.

===Phase IV - NetCorps Canada International===

From 1999 to 2006, the NetCorps consortium sent more than 1700 NetCorps volunteers overseas, due to the collaboration of Industry Canada and the Youth Employment Strategy financed by [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC).

===2006–2007 – Transition Year===

In 2006–2007, the consortium successfully organized the placement of 236 volunteers in collaboration with Industry Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). 2006-2007 was the last year that Industry Canada would be involved in the NetCorps program.

===Phase VI – 2007–2008===

For 2007–2008, (CIDA) replaced Industry Canada as funders of the NetCorps program. The 240 placements offered that year were once again part of the Government of Canada’s youth-employment strategy.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/history.php?tpl=red "A history of NetCorps Canada International"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was discontinued indefinitely as of the 2008–2009 season.&lt;ref name="mainpage"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/home.php? "NetCorps News"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6488">{{Technical|date=July 2014}}'''Peer instruction''' is an evidence-based, interactive teaching method popularized by Harvard Professor [[Eric Mazur]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;[http://mazur.harvard.edu/publications.php?function=display&amp;rowid=0 Eric Mazur (1997). Peer Instruction: A User's Manual Series in Educational Innovation. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009061520/http://mazur.harvard.edu/publications.php?function=display&amp;rowid=0 |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally used in many schools, including introductory undergraduate physics classes at [[Harvard University]], peer instruction is used in various disciplines and institutions around the globe. It is a student-centered approach that involves flipping the traditional classroom by moving information transfer out and moving information assimilation, or application of learning, into the classroom. There is some research that supports the effectiveness of peer instruction over more traditional teaching methods, such as pure [[lecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/jbelcher/www/TEALref/Crouch_Mazur.pdf C. Crouch &amp; E. Mazur (2001). Peer Instruction: Ten Years of Experience and Results, Am. J. Phys., v69, 970-977]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer instruction as a learning system involves students preparing to learn outside of class by doing pre-class readings and answering questions about those readings using another method, called [[Just in Time Teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Novak et al., (1999). Just-in-Time teaching: Blending Active Learning with Web Technology. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in class, the instructor engages students by posing prepared conceptual questions or ConcepTests that are based on student difficulties. The questioning procedure outlined by [[Eric Mazur]] is as follows:
# Instructor poses question based on students' responses to their pre-class reading
# Students reflect on the question
# Students commit to an individual answer
# Instructor reviews student responses
# Students discuss their thinking and answers with their peers
# Students then commit again to an individual answer
# The instructor again reviews responses and decides whether more explanation is needed before moving on to the next concept.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.colorado.edu/physics/EducationIssues/papers/Turpen_etal/Turpen%20&amp;%20Finkelstein_The%20construction%20of%20different%20classroom%20norms%20duringPI_Students%20perceive%20differences.pdf C.

It is essentially a list of several mildly difficult problems or exercises based on material already taught, which the student is expected to solve with a full written solution.

The '''Quality Assurance Authority for Education and Training''' ('''QAAET''') is the governmental education [[quality assurance]] authority in [[Bahrain]]. 
As a part of the National Education and Training Reform Project, which is an initiative of HRH Crown Prince, a decision was taken to ensure that there is quality of education at all levels within the Kingdom of Bahrain. The Quality Assurance Authority for Education &amp; Training was established by the Royal Decree No. 32 of 2008 amended by the Royal Decree No. 6 of 2009. In terms of Article (4) of the decree, its mandate is to ‘review the quality of the performance of education and training institutions in light of the guiding indicators developed by the Authority’. The Authority is also required to publish review reports as well as to report annually on the status of education within the Kingdom; this includes findings as well as improvements that have occurred as a result of the Authority’s activities.
QAAET is an independent authority that carries out its mandated under the directions of His Excellency Shaikh Khalid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa, Deputy Prime Minister, Chairman of the Quality Assurance Authority for Education and Training. The Authority is regulated by the Council of Ministers and reports to it. 
To meet this mandate, four units were established within the QAAET: the Schools Review Unit, the Vocational Review Unit, the Higher Education Review Unit, and the National Examinations Unit.
QAAET is a member of the [[Arab Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education]] (ANQAHE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.anqahe.org/cms.php?id=member_details&amp;member_id=9 Quality Assurance Authority for Education and Training (QAAET)]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Arab Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schools Review Unit ==

The Schools Review Unit is responsible for evaluating and reporting on the quality of provision in schools, establishing success measures, spreading best practice and making recommendations for school improvement. 
The Unit requires each school to provide a post- Review Action Plan which is signed off by the Ministry. The Action Plan should be received 6 weeks after the school receives the draft review report. After signing off the Action Plan, the Ministry should support and monitor improvement.

== Vocational Review Unit ==

The Vocational Review Unit identifies strengths and areas for improvement in vocational education and training providers, focuses on the achievement and experience of learners, recommends how weaknesses might be addressed, promotes improvement and a culture of self-evaluation and accountability among providers, spreads best practices and offers policy advice to key stakeholders.

== Higher Education Review Unit ==

The Higher Education Review Unit conducts reviews into the quality assurance arrangements of higher education institutions and identifies areas in need of improvement and areas of strength, conducts programme reviews within higher education institutions, and ensures that higher education providers are publicly accountable.
Providers are required to submit Improvement Plans to the Unit 3 months after publication of reports, which address the findings of the review reports irrespective of whether the review was about the institution’s quality assurance arrangements as a whole or regarding a particular programme.

== National Examinations Unit ==

The National Examinations Unit is responsible for independently and nationwide examine the four core subjects of Mathematics, Science, Arabic and English in Grades 3, 6 and 9 to evaluate learning progress against the national curriculum, publish information on student, class and school performance, establish and implement examination requirements for Grade 12, and work with different stakeholders to improve education in Bahrain.

She was born as '''Kathleen Agnes Niccol''' in [[Auckland]] and educated by the [[Sisters of Mercy]]. She had a talent for music and eventually adopted the vocation of a teacher of music. She took private classes in dancing, elocution, and singing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4n8/niccol-mary-leo|title=Niccol, Mary Leo|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became joined the Sisters of Mercy at the age of 28, taking the religious name Sister Mary Leo. She occupied herself in the work of her [[religious institute]] in tending to the sick and needy. Sister Mary Leo initially began her teaching career as a [[violin]] teacher. She never received formal training in vocal technique. It was in the late 1930s, after she heard a recording of [[Deanna Durbin]] and was so taken with Durbin's natural tone, flexible technique, vocal range, and repertoire that included both opera and light music, that she decided to devote her time to teaching singing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She developed the already strong musical tradition of [[St Mary's College, Auckland|St Mary's College]] in Auckland, with its orchestra, choirs, and individual tuition, and also conducted the Sisters' Choir. From 1934, the college offered private tuition, and her reputation as a vocal coach flourished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1950 on, honours and plaudits followed the success of such students as [[Malvina Major|Dame Malvina Major]], [[Kiri Te Kanawa|Dame Kiri Te Kanawa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/search?commit=Search&amp;search_term=sister+mary+leo&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93|title=NZ On Screen|last=Screen|first=NZ On|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heather Begg|Dame Heather Begg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11575563|title=Mixed response to Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's 'beaten by nuns' claim|last=@cath_gaff|first=Catherine Gaffaney Reporter, NZ Herald catherine gaffaney@nzherald co nz|date=2016-01-17|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mina Foley]], [[Judith Edwards]], [[Elisabeth Hellawell]], [[Patricia Price]], Mona Ross, Elaine Dow and Leo's influence extended into the [[rock music]] world with student [[Jan Hellriegel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Stephen Howard Naegle''', American watercolor artist, was born in [[Toquerville, Utah]] in 1938.  He attended first, Southern Utah University and later graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree and Master of Fine Arts Degree in 1968 and 1969, respectively, from Utah State University.  
He taught art, drawing, ceramics and sculpture at [[Arkansas Polytechnic College]], [[Russellville, Arkansas]] and [[Casper College]], Casper Wyoming. Mr. Naegle created possibly thousands of watercolors in his short 42 years, as well as a number of major oil paintings.

[[Image:SLStephensmilemods.jpg|thumb|right]]

A former student of Mr. Naegle decided to create a website documenting his life's work beginning in 2004. Three hundred seventeen art works are now documented on this website, [http://www.naeglefriends.org].  The site contains biographical information, a catalogue of works, photographs of many of his paintings, and a few short stories of his life.  This is an educational, not-for-profit website.  A work in progress, additional works are sought to broaden the depth of the artist's work.

Publications containing information regarding Mr. Naegle are:
1.)  Masters of Western Art, Mary Carroll Nelson, Watson/Guptill Publications, New York, 1981.  2.)  Stephen Naegle, a booklet, Nicolaysen Art Museum, Casper, Wyoming, 1988.  3.)  Plant Forms and Weathered Buildings in Watercolor, Master's Thesis on Microfilm, Stephen H. Naegle, Utah State University, Merril-Cazier Library, 1969.

4.)  Southwest Art Magazine, Annual Collectors Edition, October 1980.  Stephen Naegle exhibit announced by C. G. Rein Galleries of Scottsdale, Arizona, page 22, exhibit opening October 23, 1980.  Naegle oil painting, Navajo Sandstone - Sunrise, 50 by 60&amp;nbsp;inches displayed in the ad copy.  Rein calls Mr. Naegle a contemporary "luminist".  5.)  Online at Naeglefriends.org, 317 documented works, many with images, most in color.  Also biographical information, short stories about the painter, and information about submissions for adding Naegle paintings to the Naegle Catalogue of Works, 2004 - 2007.

==History==

===Foundation===
[[File:Colegio Civil Mty.jpg|left|thumb|The Civil Academy, one of the five institutions that joined efforts to create the University of Nuevo León in 1933.]]

The immediate forerunner of this public university dates back to 1859, when the Civil Academy (''Colegio Civil'') started its courses. This [[institution]] had been envisioned by [[Governor of Nuevo León|Governor]] [[Santiago Vidaurri]] but was erected by his successor, [[José Silvestre Aramberri]], after the former was removed from office. The academy began to sponsor the Pharmacy and Medicine courses [[José Eleuterio González]] had been teaching at the local Hospital of the Rosary for several decades. The academic offerings included courses in Law and Medicine, as well as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]. Its first director was [[José de Jesús Dávila y Prieto]].

On 29 October 1932, the delegations of the state schools of Law, Medicine and Pharmacy; the Civil Academy and the [[normal school]], submitted a project to the [[Congress of Nuevo León]] to organize a state university for the [[Monterrey Metropolitan area]]. On 7 November 1932, the state congress ordered to proceed with the request and on 25 September 1933 the University of Nuevo León was born.&lt;ref name="uanl-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uanl.mx/acerca/antecedentes|title=Antecedentes: la historia de la UANL|date=2006-07-05|publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-10-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904134520/http://www.uanl.mx/acerca/antecedentes|archivedate=2009-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first year, 1,864 students were schooled by 218 professors from the [[faculty (division)|faculties]] of Medicine, Law, Engineering, and Chemistry, the Normal School, a preparatory school, the School of Nurses and Obstetricians and the Álvaro Obregón and Pablo Livas Industrial Schools. The institution became plagued with political disputes and almost two years later, on 25 September 1935, it was closed by state decree, only to reopen almost eight years later, on 13 September 1943.&lt;ref name="uanl-history"/&gt;

===Expansion===

The number of faculty and personnel began to grow and this prompted the construction of its own campus in 1958, the University City (''Ciudad Universitaria''), an academic complex located in [[San Nicolás de los Garza]], a suburb to the state capital. In 1967, its open-air [[Estadio Universitario (UANL)|stadium]] was finished. From 1968 to 1972, the University was hit once again by student protests and political disputes, and by 1971 the protests had forced the government to stop from interfering in its internal affairs and recognize a [[autonomous university|statute of autonomy]] that became part of its current name: Autonomous University of Nuevo León (''Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León'').&lt;ref name="uanl-chron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uanl.mx/acerca/cronologia|title=Cronología|date=2006-07-05|publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-10-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830064639/http://www.uanl.mx/acerca/cronologia|archivedate=2009-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|UANL High school system}}
The university also runs 36 high schools of which 7 are Technical High Schools, one is a Bilingual International High School, and the rest are 2-year high schools.&lt;ref name="uanl-prepa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uanl.mx/universidad/escuelas-y-facultades.html|title=Preparatoria UANL|date=2014-07-05|publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León|language=Spanish|accessdate=2014-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 other schools around the state that are not property of the UANL are incorporated to the university, which means that these schools meet the norms established by the institution (a minimum infrastructure of libraries, laboratories, class rooms, school programs accepted by the UANL, and certified academic staff).&lt;ref name="uanl-incorp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uanl.mx/noticias/academico/registra-40-programas-incorporados-la-uanl%E2%80%8F.html|title=Incorporados UANL|date=2014-02-26|publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León|language=Spanish|accessdate=2014-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[Image:Panoramica Ciudad Universitaria.jpg|thumb|[[Ciudad Universitaria|University city]]]]
The current rector is [[Rogelio Garza Rivera]],
The university also has a symphony orchestra, a chamber orchestra, and a band of regional music, ''El Tigre''.

==Athletics==
The UANL's teams are called the [[Tiger|"Tigres"]]. 

The American football team, named the '''Auténticos Tigres''', is very successful in the [[ONEFA]]. The program has won five national championships (1974, 1977, 2009, 2011, and 2012), and four times has been runner-up. They play in the [[Estadio Gaspar Mass]].

UANL teams have also won the national [[universiade]] in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universiada2007.uanl.mx/content/view/123/1/|title=UANL logra bicampeonato|publisher=UANL|date=May 7, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UANL installations include the Raymundo "Chico" Rivera Stadium (a football and athletic field), the Luis Eugenio Todd Gym, a baseball park, an indoor soccer pitch, and a [[tennis]] center with four courts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uanl.mx/deporte/|title=Programa de Equipos Representativos|publisher=UANL|date=August 18, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030131053/http://www.uanl.mx/deporte/|archivedate=October 30, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soccer team [[Tigres de la UANL]] was managed for the UANL before 1996, when the team's control passed to [[Cemex]]. The [[Estadio Universitario (UANL)|Estadio Universitario]] is located in the principal campus of the UANL, and occasionally is host of Auténticos Tigres games, and others activities of the university.

The University Olympic Aquatic Center [[Centro Acuático Olímpico Universitario]] is one of the best aquatic centers of the country. It's also located in the main campus and there are swimming, water polo, diving and synchronized swimming teams.

'''Université Laval''' ({{lang-en|'''Laval University'''}}) is a [[French-language]], public [[research university]] in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The University was founded by [[royal charter]] issued by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1852, with roots in the founding of the [[Séminaire de Québec]] in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], making it the oldest centre of higher education in Canada and the first North American institution to offer higher education in French. The university, whose campus was erected from the 1950s onward in the suburban borough of [[Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge]], is ranked among the top ten Canadian universities in terms of research funding&lt;ref&gt;Université Laval. [http://www.scom.ulaval.ca/Presentation/anglais/background.html "Université Laval at a Glance"]. (accessed 17 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and holds four Canada Excellence Research Chairs.

==History==
[[File:François de Laval - Project Gutenberg eText 17174.jpg|thumb|left|200px|François de Laval]] 
[[File:Grand-Séminaire-Québec.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Old Séminaire de Québec today]]
The university began as the [[Séminaire de Québec]], which was founded in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], a member of the [[House of Laval]] and the first [[Bishop of New France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, Edited by Lawrence Johnstone Burpee and Arthur G. Doughty.|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Regime the institution mainly trained priests to serve in [[New France]]. After the [[Conquest of 1760]], the British expanded education in Canada to include the liberal arts. French Canadians had at the time no opportunity to pursue higher education, and [[Ignace Bourget|Bishop Bourget]] of Montreal suggested expanding the Séminaire de Québec into Université Laval. [[Louis-Jacques Casault|Louis Casault]], a priest who taught physics at the Séminaire de Québec, went to Europe to seek a royal charter and study the best university systems there.

The Séminaire de Québec was granted a royal charter on December 8, 1852, by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], at the request of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] (Governor-General of the Province of Canada), creating Université Laval with "the rights and privileges of a university".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 Laval University/Université Laval&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816195903/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 |date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter was signed in 1852. [[Pope Benedict XV]] approved the plan and authorized the institution to establish chairs of theology and confer degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6466.mobile The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the university opened a second campus in [[Montreal]], which became the [[Université de Montréal]] on May 8, 1919, by a writ of [[Pope Benedict XV]]. In 1971, a second charter transferred all authority to the Université Laval council.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

By 1925, the university had outgrown its location. The Old City was very crowded, making it difficult to add new buildings to the campus. The university moved to [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] in the 1950s, which at the time was a semi-rural community west of the Quebec city centre. The School of Architecture returned to the old building (now affectionately referred to as ''Le Vieux Séminaire'') in 1989.

Université Laval is governed by a board of governors and a faculty senate. This structure was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to serve as a link between the two bodies and lead the institution.&lt;ref name=langton1906&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA306|title=The University of Toronto and its colleges, 1827-1906|last=Langton|first=Hugh Hornby|last2=Macallum|first2=Archibald Byron|publisher=The University Library, pub. by the librarian|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}

In the early part of the 20th century, the need for higher education expanded beyond the classical fields of theology, law and medicine, and the university introduced science and social-science departments such as forestry and household science.&lt;ref name=langton1906 /&gt;{{rp|1904}} In addition, graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

"Laval", a waltz by French-Canadian ragtime composer, [[Wilfrid Beaudry]], was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal. The music for piano was published in Québec by J. Beaudry, circa 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2016-07-01T18%3A38%3A44Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=16182129&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Aamicus&amp;lang=eng |title= Laval |newspaper=Amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1906  |author=Wilfrid Beaudry |accessdate= July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university opened its department of social, political, and economic sciences in 1938, signalling a change of approach that continued into the 1960s, based on an idea of higher education as the key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and society.&lt;ref&gt;Behiels, Michael, "Le père Georges-Henri Lévesque et l'établissement des sciences sociales à Laval: 1938–1955", Revue de l'Université d'Ottawa 52, no. 3 (juil.-sept. 1982). Appears in English translation in "Youth, University, and Canadian Society", edited by Paul Axelrod and John G. Reid. Kingston and Montreal: McGill-Queen's University of Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal charter that founded Université Laval in 1852 was designated a National Historic Event in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=1378&amp;oqeName=Laval+University&amp;oqfName=Universit%E9+Laval National Historic Event] {{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and features==
After it was granted a university charter, several buildings were built in Old Quebec, including the School of Chemistry (1923), the addition on Ste. Famille Street (1931), the Mining School (1938), and the cafeteria building (1945), all by architect Joseph Simeon Bergeron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1103|title=Bergeron, Joseph Simeon|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the neighborhood was already crowded and activities later moved in nearby Sainte-Foy, which was more spacious. 

===Campus building===
Today's campus covers {{cvt|1.2|km2}} and has over 30 buildings (also called ''pavillons''), including many iconic exemplars of [[modern architecture]]. Its earliest buildings and landscapes were designed by [[Edouard Fiset]] ([[:fr:Édouard Fiset|fr]]) from the 1950s, and of its lands, 56 percent are wooded areas, grasslands, and sports fields{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} .

===Other infrastructures===
Pratically all buildings are linked by {{cvt|10|km}} of underground walkways, which are particularly useful in the winter and whose walls are mostly covered by murals painted by student associations and student visitors over the years, as well as graffiti. The campus is also home to the ''Roger-Van den Hende'' botanical garden ([[:fr:Jardin universitaire Roger-Van den Hende|fr]]) which contains some 67 species of deciduous and coniferous trees and 60 different species of birds. The Louis-Jacques-Casault building also hosts the regional branch of the [[Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec|National Archives of Quebec]]. The sport building is called [[PEPS]] and is said to be the largest sport complex in eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.quebecoriginal.com/en-ca/listing/things-to-do/sports-and-nature/skating-rinks/pavillon-de-leducation-physique-et-des-sports-peps-universite-laval-230331533 |title=Pavillon de l'Éducation physique et des sports (PEPS) (Université Laval) |website=Québec Original |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is adjacent to the covered TELUS stadium ([[:fr:Stade TELUS-Université Laval|fr]]).
