The '''Academia Chilena de la Lengua''' (Spanish for ''Chilean Language Academy'') is an association of academics and experts on the use of the [[Spanish language]] in [[Chile]]. It is a member of the [[Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española]].

It was founded in [[Santiago de Chile]] on June 5, 1885.  It started out with 18 members designated by the [[Real Academia Española]] (Royal Spanish Academy).  Today, it has 36 academics, plus members in several Chilean regions and abroad. The honoris causa members are the permanent member  ([[Gabriela Mistral]]), the honorary member ([[John Paul II]]), and, since 1999, an illustrious member [[Víctor García de la Concha]]).

'''Arnold Doren''' (1935&amp;ndash;2003) was an American photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in American Art, 1989-90, R. R. Bowker, New York, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Arnold T. Dorenfeld, known as Doren, was born in [[Chicago]], July 29, 1935, to Hy and Rose Dorenfeld.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;DeCwikiel-Kane, Dawn, "A Legacy on Film, Arnold Doren 1935-2003", News and Record, Greensboro, NC, September 26, 2003 page D1&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on the west side of Chicago, attending Howland Elementary School and [[Farragut High School]] (now [[Farragut Career Academy]]) (per classmate and friend Howard N. Allen, M.D.). An encounter with a [[Graflex|Graflex camera]] while working on the high school newspaper (''The Scroll'') led to a dedicated life in photography.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; After joining the Navy in 1953, he was stationed at [[San Diego]], CA and worked as a submariner running missions to Acapulco. ''News with Views'' was the name of the Navy newsletter which published his photographs.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

==Education==
A turning point occurred when he enrolled at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in 1957 where his philosophy and purpose in life were clarified by [[Minor White]], one of the legendary professors.&lt;ref name=pet&gt;Pettit, Robert F., "His Photos Images of Peace", News and Record, Greensboro, NC March 18, 1979, page G 7&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deeply spiritual nature of Minor White along with his knowledge of poetry and [[Eastern philosophy]] that affected Doren.&lt;ref name=pet/&gt; Minor put an emphasis on ''feeling'' as a way of knowing and realizing a multitude of meanings.&lt;ref name=min&gt;"Minor White, A Living Remembrance", by the editors of Aperture, Silver Mountain Foundation, Millerton, NY, 1984, {{ISBN|0-89381-138-6}}, see page 71&lt;/ref&gt; A quote by Peter Layton describes Minor's teaching. " He created an atmosphere for constantly questioning ideas or responses."&lt;ref name=min/&gt; With discipline, practice and sincerity, the students of Minor White often achieved a visual, sensual and personal awareness.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} It was under Minor's influence that Doren began to photograph ''Americana Faces'' which was a documentation of the land and its people from 1960-2003.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, Robert F., "His Photos Images of Peace", News and Record, Greensboro, NC, March 18, 1979, page G7&lt;/ref&gt; He photographed throughout the USA and returned frequently to the southwest. While working on the ''Americana Faces'', he produced series on Italy, Greece, Scotland and China.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Doren Archive, Special Collections, Walter Jackson Library,  University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC&lt;/ref&gt; Related to Doren's traditional photographs were the experimental works inspired by Minor White and by another influential teacher, [[Ralph Hattersley]].&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley, Ralph, "Discover Yourself Through Photography", Morgan and Morgan Inc., October 1979. {{ISBN|978-0-87100-099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York City 1960-1978==
During Doren's NYC years, he worked as a commercial photographer for Alan Vogel, [[Arnold T. Rosenberg]], [[Irving Penn]] and Erwin Blumenthal&lt;ref&gt;Biographical Files (Vertical files) on faculty, University Archives, Walter Jackson Library, University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC&lt;/ref&gt; while living in a one-room apartment and frequenting jazz clubs, poetry readings and art openings.&lt;ref name=arn&gt;Arnold Doren Archive, Special Collections, Walter Jackson Library, University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC&lt;/ref&gt; Doren wrote extensively about his years in NYC with and without his first wife, Elizabeth Knox, a painter.&lt;ref name=arn/&gt; He committed to several personal projects such as photographing the same NYC street for one hour per day for several years.&lt;ref name=arn/&gt; The NYC street project was partly inspired by his neighbor, [[Berenice Abbott]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Doren Archive - in the letters there is mention of correspondence with Berenice Abbott and record of a purchase made of a Eugene Atget print from Abbott&lt;/ref&gt; Doren's series on the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] resulted in his well-known photograph of [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref&gt;DeCwikiel-Kane, Dawn, "A Legacy on Film Arnold Doren 1935-2003, News and Record, Greensboro, NC, September 26, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==1978-2003==

After accepting a teaching position in 1978 at the [[University of North Carolina]] at Greensboro, Doren helped to shape the growing respect for photography as art.&lt;ref&gt;Coraddi, UNCG's magazine for the arts, inaugural issue of 1978, Article on Arnold Doren, archived in University Archives, UNCG, Greensboro, NC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Harrison, Cherl T | author2=Doren, Arnold, 1935-2003 | title=Doren and photography | publication-date=2015 | publisher=High Point, North Carolina Barsina Publishing | edition= First | isbn=978-0-9906948-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He educated thousands of students, participated in numerous exhibitions, operated a photography gallery and gained national and international recognition for his work.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical files on faculty, University Archives, Walter Jackson Library, UNCG, Greensboro, NC&lt;/ref&gt; Often he introduced himself on the first day of class with ''My name is Doren and photography is my life''.&lt;ref&gt;DeCwikiel-Kane, Dawn, "A Legacy on Film, Arnold Doren 1935-2003" news and Record, Greensboro, NC, September 26, 2003, page D 1&lt;/ref&gt; Doren's second wife, Caroline Cornish, 1924–2008,&lt;ref&gt;"Caroline Laws Cornish", News and Record, Greensboro, NC, April 17, 2008, page B 4&lt;/ref&gt; was a noted photographer&lt;ref&gt;"Blue Pitcher" Southern issue, summer 1987, Editors Steven Lautermilch, Sarah Lindsay, Jeffrey Miles, Greensboro, NC, ISSN 0886-4187, "Caroline Cornish" feature artist, pages 32-40&lt;/ref&gt; who possessed organizational skills that provided stability for both of them while allowing Doren extra freedom to pursue a fine arts career.

The '''Bologna Process''' is a series of ministerial meetings and agreements between European countries to ensure comparability in the standards and quality of higher-education qualifications. The process has created the [[European Higher Education Area]] under the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]]. It is named after the [[University of Bologna]], where the [[Bologna declaration]] was signed by education ministers from 29 European countries in 1999. The process was opened to other countries in the [[European Cultural Convention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Council of Europe|title=European Cultural Convention|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/018|work=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]], and governmental meetings have been held in [[Prague]] (2001), [[Berlin]] (2003), [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (2005), [[London]] (2007) and [[Leuven]] (2009).

Before the signing of the Bologna declaration, the [[Magna Charta Universitatum]] was issued at a meeting of university rectors celebrating the 900th anniversary of the [[University of Bologna]] (and European universities) in 1988. One year before the declaration, education ministers [[Claude Allegre]] (France), [[Jürgen Rüttgers]] (Germany), [[Luigi Berlinguer]] (Italy) and [[Tessa Blackstone|Baroness Blackstone]] (UK) signed the Sorbonne declaration in Paris in 1998, committing themselves to "harmonising the architecture of the European Higher Education system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.bologna-berlin2003.de/pdf/Sorbonne_declaration.pdf|title=Sorbonne Joint Declaration: Joint declaration on harmonisation of the architecture of the European higher education system|publisher=[[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]]|date=25 May 1998|accessdate=28 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5g23ZrDg1?url=http://www.bologna-berlin2003.de/pdf/Sorbonne_declaration.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2009|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bologna Process has 48 participating countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehea.info/members.aspx|title=Members|publisher=European Higher Education Area|year=2016|accessdate=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018142934/http://www.ehea.info/members.aspx|archive-date=18 October 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All member states of the EU are participating in the process, with the European Commission also a signatory. [[Monaco]] and [[San Marino]] are the only members of the [[Council of Europe]] which did not adopt the process.

The [[European Students' Union|ESU]], [[European University Association|EUA]], [[EURASHE]], EI, [[European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education|ENQA]], UNICE, the [[Council of Europe]] and [[UNESCO]] are part of the process' follow-up. Other groups at this level are [[European Network of Information Centres|ENIC]], [[National Academic Recognition Information Centre|NARIC]] and [[EURODOC]].

==Rejected countries==
Four countries are not members of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bologna Follow-Up Group|title=Applications for Accession to the Bologna Process|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/129528954/APPLICATIONS-FOR-ACCESSION-TO-THE-BOLOGNA-PROCESS|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515004235/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/129528954/APPLICATIONS-FOR-ACCESSION-TO-THE-BOLOGNA-PROCESS|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 May 2016|accessdate=8 December 2012|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Kyrgyzstan]] ratified the Lisbon Recognition Convention in 2004, it is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe and there are no known plans to expand the convention's geographical scope.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, although it has observer status. Although Israel is not geographically part of Europe, it is part of the [[UNESCO European Region]]. Israel is also a signatory of the Lisbon Recognition Convention but, under the criteria of the Berlin Communiqué, ineligible for the Bologna Process.

===Kosovo===
[[Kosovo]] is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe. Although Serbia is a party, Kosovo declared independence from it and is theoretically a part of the Bologna Process since the 1999 war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/londonbologna/uploads/documents/BFUG11_7a_applicationstojoinBolognaProcess.doc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030215326/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/londonbologna/uploads/documents/BFUG11_7a_applicationstojoinBolognaProcess.doc|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 October 2008|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that Kosovo could be associated with the process in a category appropriate to its situation, such as guest or special-observer status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=DOC|url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/londonbologna/uploads/documents/BFUG11_7a_applicationstojoinBolognaProcess.doc|title=Applications to join the Bologna Process|publisher=Dcsf.gov.uk|date=23 February 2007|accessdate=28 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030215326/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/londonbologna/uploads/documents/BFUG11_7a_applicationstojoinBolognaProcess.doc|archivedate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area}}Qualifications framework==
The basic framework is three cycles of higher-education [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]s. The framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/Documents/QF-EHEA-May2005.pdf|title=The framework of qualifications for the European Higher Education Area|work=EHEA|date=May 2005|accessdate=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923234414/http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/Documents/QF-EHEA-May2005.pdf|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the ministers at their meeting in Bergen in 2005 defines the qualifications in terms of learning outcomes: statements of what students know and can do on completing their degrees. In describing the cycles, the framework uses the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS):

* First cycle: typically 180–240 ECTS credits (a minimum of 60 credits per [[academic year]]), usually awarding a [[bachelor's degree]]. The European Higher Education Area did not introduce the bachelor-with-honours programme, which allows graduates to receive a "BA hons. " degree (for example, in the UK, Australia and Canada) which (in the UK and Australia) may enable graduates to begin doctoral studies without first obtaining a master's degree.
* Second cycle: typically 90–120 ECTS credits (a minimum of 60 ECTS per academic year), usually awarding a [[master's degree]]
* Third cycle ([[doctorate|doctoral]] degree): There is no concrete ECTS range, since the disciplines vary in length and comprehensiveness.

In most cases, it would take three to four years to earn a [[bachelor's degree]] and another one or two years for a [[master's degree]]. Doctoral degrees usually require another two to four years of specialization, primarily individual research under a mentor. Degree names may vary by country. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS credits, equivalent to 1,500–1,800 hours of study.

==Criticism==
According to Chris Lorenz of the [[VU University Amsterdam]],

{{Quote|The basic idea behind all educational EU-plans is economic: the basic idea is the enlargement of scale of the European systems of higher education ... in order to enhance its 'competitiveness' by cutting down costs. Therefore a Europe-wide standardization of the 'values' produced in each of the national higher educational systems is called for.&lt;ref name="lor"/&gt;}} 
Lorenz argues that just as the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[General Agreement on Trade in Services|GATS]] propose educational reforms that would, in his view, erode all effective forms of democratic political control over higher education, so "it is obvious that the economic view on higher education recently developed and formulated by the EU Declarations is similar to and compatible with the view developed by the WTO and by GATS."&lt;ref name="lor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lorenz|first=Chris|format=PDF|url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/ces/Home/Resources/Michigan%20Paper%20Series/Lorenz_Will_Universities_Survive.pdf|title=Will the universities survive the European Integration? Higher Education Policies in the EU and in the Netherlands before and after the Bologna Declaration|publisher=University of Amsterdam|date=2006|accessdate=18 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327102818/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/ces/Home/Resources/Michigan%20Paper%20Series/Lorenz_Will_Universities_Survive.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Slavoj Žižek]] called the process "an attack on [[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?#Private and public use of reasoning|the public use of reason]]" and "the end of intellectual life as we know it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|date=2 July 2011|title=Julian Assange in conversation with Slavoj Zizek moderated by Democracy Now's Amy Goodman|medium=Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Xm08uTSDQ&amp;t=4336|accessdate=10 October 2015|publisher=Frontline Club|id=j1Xm08uTSDQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects by state==
The process, an intergovernmental agreement between EU and non-EU countries, does not have the status of EU legislation. Since the Bologna Declaration is not a treaty or convention, there are no legal obligations for the signatory states; participation and cooperation are voluntary.

Although the declaration was created without a formal affiliation with EU institutions, the European Commission (which has supported European projects such as the Tuning and TEEP projects) plays an important role in implementing the process. Most countries do not fit the framework, using their traditional systems. The process, which will result in bilateral agreements between countries and institutions which recognise each other's degrees, is moving from strict convergence in time spent on qualifications towards a competency-based system which will have an undergraduate and postgraduate division (with a bachelor's degree in the former and a master's and doctorate in the latter).

In mainland Europe, five-year-plus first degrees are common. Many do not complete their studies, and many countries are introducing bachelor-level qualifications. The situation is evolving as the Bologna Process is implemented.

Some countries introduced the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS) and discussed their degree structures, qualifications, financing and management of higher education and mobility programmes. At the institutional level, the reform involved higher-education institutions, their faculties or departments, student and staff representatives and other factors. Priorities varied by country and institution.

===Andorra===
In Andorra, degrees are awarded by the state in all three cycles (bachelor's, master's and doctoral). The University of Andorra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uda.ad/index.php/en/university/outstanding-features.html|title=Outstanding features|work=University of Andorra|date=2012|accessdate=5 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115103653/http://www.uda.ad/index.php/en/university/outstanding-features.html|archivedate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has adapted its classroom studies to the European Higher Education Area in accordance with the Bologna Agreement. The degree workload is counted in European credits, with a European equivalent of 180 credits (three years) for bachelor's degrees and 120 credits (two years) for master's degrees.

===Austria===
{{See also|Education in Austria}}

[[Austria]]'s situation is similar to Germany's, with the lowest undergraduate degrees the Magister (FH) and Diplom (FH) (designed to take three or four years). The lowest graduate degrees are [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] and [[Diplom]], which typically fulfill a [[thesis]] requirement (including final examination and thesis defence) and can be obtained after four to six years of study. In 2000 many curricula began to be converted into bachelor's degrees (''Bakkalaureat''; the term was replaced by "bachelor's" in most curricula by 2007) and master's (''Magisterstudium'') programmes, with nominal durations of six semesters (three years) and three to four semesters (18 months to two years) respectively.

Enrollment in a doctoral programme generally requires a master's degree in a related field. Although the nominal duration of doctoral programmes is two or three years, the time to graduate varies considerably and is generally longer.

===Belarus===
{{See also|Education in Belarus}}

Belarus became a member of the European Higher Education Area at a conference in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarus.by/en/press-center/news/belarus-accession-to-bologna-process-approved-by-european-education-ministers_i_0000023071.html|title=Belarus’ accession to Bologna Process approved by European education ministers|publisher=Belarus By|date=14 May 2015|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
{{See also|Education in Croatia}}

In [[Croatia]], implementation of the Bologna Process began during the 2005–2006 academic year. 
A diploma degree became a baccalaureate ({{lang-hr|prvostupnik}}), and the programmes were shortened from four to about three years. ''Magisterij'' became a master's degree, achieved after two additional years of study. The ''doktorat'' degree (PhD, dr.sc.) may be received after three more years (eight years total).

The typical length of study is three years for a bachelor's degree (''Baccalaureus''), two years for a master's (''magistar'') and three years for a doctor of science (''doktor znanosti''). A local distinction is made between vocational and academic degrees at the baccalareate level, and between engineering and other programs at levels below the doctoral.

There are several exceptions. The first degree in economics still takes four years, and the master's degree is obtained after an additional year at the [[University of Zagreb|University of Zagreb's]] Faculty of Economics and [[Zagreb School of Economics and Management]]. The four-plus-one-year system also applies to fine arts and music. Medical and related studies replace the bachelor's degree with six-year [[first professional degree]]s and graduate [[Doctor of Medicine]] (''doktor medicine'') degrees.

The old degrees are translated as follows:
* ''Diploma'' holders hold master's degrees (''magistar inženjer'' for engineers and ''magistar'' for others).
* The old master's degree is grandfathered into ''magistar znanosti'' (Master of Science), an intermediate title between the new master's degree and a doctorate for local use.
* Doctoral degrees remain the same.

In May 2008, about 5,000 students protested weak funding, imprecisely defined new rules and the poor results of the Bologna reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Šimičević, Hrvoje|url=http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/45221/|title=Više od 3 tisuće studenata prosvjeduje u Zagrebu – Studenti: Mi smo prva bolonjska degeneracija|trans-title=More than 3,000 students protested in Zagreb – Students: We are the first Bologna degeneration|language=hr|publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]]|date=7 May 2008|accessdate=28 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609223715/http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/45221/|archivedate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
{{See also|Education in Denmark}}

Denmark introduced the 3+2+3 system in 1971 with an education-management working group of the Society of Danish Engineers and a 1984–85 group of the Federation of Danish Industries, both headed by Hans Bruno Lund. Before the adoption of international standards, the lowest degree normally awarded at universities in [[Denmark]] was equivalent to a master's degree (Kandidat/cand.mag). Although bachelor's degrees have been obtained after three years of study, most students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistikbanken.dk|url=http://statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1280|work=Danish Statistics Bank|accessdate=15 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; continue the additional two years required for a master's degree. Mid-length (two-to four-year) professional degrees have been adapted as professional bachelor's degrees (3½ years).

===Finland===
{{See also|Education in Finland}}

In the Finnish pre-Bologna system, higher education was divided between universities and [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]]. In universities, degrees were divided in most fields into a three-year bachelor's degree (''kandidaatti'') and a two-year master's degree (''maisteri''). In these fields, the Bologna Process resulted in no change.

In engineering, universities only offered a 5½-year master's program (''[[diplomi-insinööri]]''). This has been replaced by a three-year bachelor's degree (''tekniikan kandidaatti'') and a two-year master's degree (''diplomi-insinööri''), for which the English names are Bachelor of Science (Technology) and Master of Science (Technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tkk.fi/fi/opinnot/opintohallinto/kieliversiot/index.html|title=Tutkintojen ja tutkinto-ohjelmien vieraskieliset nimet|trans-title=Diplomas and degree programmes in foreign languages|language=fi|work=Helsinki University of Technology|date=5 September 2008|accessdate=9 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116093218/http://www.tkk.fi/fi/opinnot/opintohallinto/kieliversiot/index.html|archivedate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A corresponding change has been made in military higher education, where the officer's degree was divided between bachelor's and master's programmes. Finnish [[Universities of Applied Sciences]], which have offered bachelor's-equivalent engineering programmes, began offering master's-degree programs in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2005/20050423 Finnish governmental decree 423/2005 on degrees at Universities of Applied Sciences] Accessed: 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some Master of Engineering (''insinööri (ylempi AMK)'') programmes are taught in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolia.fi/en/apply/studies/master-degree/ Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences – Master's Degrees] Accessed: 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Only medicine and dentistry retain their non-standard degree structure, where the [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] (higher than a master's degree, but less extensive than Doctor of Medicine or Dentistry degrees) is the basic degree. A six-year program of at least 360 ECTS credits leads to the Licentiate of Medicine (''lääketieteen lisensiaatti'') degree. There is an intermediate title (but not an academic degree) of ''lääketieteen kandidaatti'', and no master's degree.

Polytechnic degrees are considered bachelor's degrees in international use. In domestic use, bachelors transferring from polytechnics to universities may be required to amass a maximum of 60 ECTS credits of additional studies before beginning master's-level studies. In conjunction with the Bologna Process, polytechnics have the right to award master's degrees.

===France===
{{See also|Education in France}}

In France the ''baccalauréat'', awarded at the end of secondary education, allows students to enter university. Before the LMD reform which implemented the Bologna Process, it was followed by a two-year ''[[Diplôme d'études universitaires générales]]'' (DEUG) and a third-year Licence (the equivalent of a UK bachelor's degree).

Students could then pursue a Maîtrise, a one-year research degree which could be followed by a one-year vocational degree (the ''Diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées'' or DESS) or research degree (the ''Diplôme d'études approfondies'', or [[Master of Advanced Studies|DEA]]).
The DEA, preparation for a doctorate, was equivalent to the [[Master of Philosophy|M. Phil]]. Students could then pursue a ''doctorat'' (PhD), which took at least three years.

The DESS was created in 1975 for students who completed four-year degrees. Intended as a doctorate with a more practical approach than research, it included the production of a 120-page paper which was defended to a jury of three international specialists in the field. The mini-thesis was kept in the libraries of the university issuing the DESS, unlike a PhD dissertation (distributed by its author to every French university library).

Higher education in France is also provided by non-university institutions dedicated to specific subjects. The ''Diplôme d'ingénieur'' (engineering diploma) is awarded to students after five years of study in state-recognized ''Écoles d'ingénieurs'', particularly the [[Grandes Écoles]] such as [[École des mines|Mines]], [[École Centrale Paris|Centrale]] and [[École nationale de l'aviation civile|ENAC]].

Although the ''baccalauréat'' and ''doctorat'' are unchanged in the Bologna system (known in France as LMD reform), the [[DEUG]] and ''licence'' have been merged into a three-year Licence. The Maîtrise, DESS and DEA have been combined into a two-year master's degree, which can be work- (''master professionnel'') or research-oriented (''master recherche''). The ''[[Diplôme d'ingénieur]]'' degree is still separate from a university degree, but holders may legally claim a master's degree as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wes.org/ewenr/04March/France.htm |title=WENR, March/April 2004: France |publisher=Wes.org |date=29 August 2003 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616004014/http://www.wes.org/ewenr/04March/France.htm |archive-date=16 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Germany}}Georgia===
{{See also|Education in Georgia (country)}}

Although [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] joined the Bologna Process in 2005 at the Bergen summit, steps towards the establishment of the European Higher Education Area were completed earlier. Since the end of the 1990s, many [[List of universities in Georgia (country)|Georgian universities]] (mostly private) have introduced limited educational programs allowing students to graduate with a [[bachelor's degree]] (four years) and earn a master's degree (one to two years) while preserving the old five-to-six-year scheme. During the Soviet era, the only degree was the discontinued Specialist.

Cycles of higher education are divided into first (bachelor's degree with 240 [[Course credit|credits]]), second (master's degree, 120 credits) and third (doctorate, 180 credits). Human and veterinary medicine and dentistry (300–360 credits) are integrated programs with a qualification equal to a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mes.gov.ge/content.php?id=131&amp;lang=eng |title=Higher Education system of Georgia |publisher=Mes.gov.ge |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece joined the Bologna Process in 1999. Since 2007, more-intensive steps towards the establishment of the European Higher Education Area were completed.

===Hungary===
{{See also|Education in Hungary}}

In [[Hungary]], the Bologna system applies to those who began their university education in or after September 2006. One hundred eight majors were available for selection (compared with  over 400 in 2005), of which six are exempt from the bachelor's-master's division: law, human and veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and architecture.

According to an online poll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.felvi.hu/szavazas/eredmeny.ofi?mfa_id=1|title=Országos Felsőoktatási Információs Központ|work=felvi.hu|date=24 February 2006}}{{Dead link|date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the National Tertiary Education Information Centre, 65 percent of respondents thought it unnecessary to adopt the system. The new system provides less of a guarantee that students will obtain a master's degree, because many will complete their education after the three-year bachelor's degree. Students are expected to study more unrelated subjects during the first three years, due to the smaller number of majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/felvi545/?token=5b818e4e923e1b0d2a575b0a0c713c27 |title=Index – Belföld – Szabad bölcsész leszel vagy romanisztika szakos? |publisher=Index.hu |date= |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
{{See also|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], bachelor's degrees are commonly three to four years in duration; master's and doctoral degrees are basically similar to those in the UK. Bachelor's degrees are first-cycle qualifications. Except for the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] at the [[University of Dublin]], a master's degree is always a postgraduate degree (teaching or research). The generic outcomes for Irish degrees are laid out in the 2003 National Framework of Qualifications. In 2006, Ireland was the first country to verify the compatibility of its national framework with that of the EHEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|last=National Qualifications Authority of Ireland|title=Verification of Compatibility of Irish National Framework of Qualifications with the Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area|year=2006|publisher=NQAI|location=Dublin|url=http://www.nqai.ie/documents/VerificationofCompatibility220609.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124223559/http://www.nqai.ie/documents/VerificationofCompatibility220609.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
{{See also|Education in Italy}}

[[Italy]] fits the framework since its 1999 adoption of the 3+2 system. The first degree is the ''[[Laurea]] triennale'', which may be obtained after three years of study. Selected students may then complete their studies with two additional years of specialization leading to the ''Laurea Magistrale''.

The Laurea corresponds to a bachelor's degree; the Laurea magistrale, corresponding to a master's degree, grants access to third-cycle programmes (post-MA degrees, doctorates or specialized schools) lasting two to five years (completing a PhD usually takes three years). A five-year degree, Laurea Magistrale Quinquennale (Five-Year Master of Arts) is awarded in law (Facoltà di Giurisprudenza), the arts ([[Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna|Accademia di Belle Arti]]) and music (Conservatorio di Musica). The title for BA and BS undergraduate students is ''Dottore'' and for MA, MFA, MD and MEd graduate students ''Dottore magistrale'' (abbreviated ''Dott.'', ''Dott.ssa'' or ''Dr.''). This should not be confused with PhD and post-MA graduates, whose title is ''Dottore di Ricerca'' (Research Doctor).

The Italian system has two types of master's degree. ''Laurea Magistrale'' (120 ECTS) allows  access to third-cycle programmes, and ''Master universitario'' (at least 60 ECTS) may be divided into first- (second cycle) and second-level master's degrees (third cycle).
A first-level master's degree is accessible by a first-cycle degree and "does not allow access to PhD and to 3rd cycle programmes, since this type of course does not belong to the general requirements established at national level, but it is offered under the autonomous responsibility of each university".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quadrodeititoli.it/altrititoli.aspx?IDL=2|title=Italian Qualifications Framework (QTI): other qualifications|publisher=quadrodeititoli.it|date=|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{See also|Education in the Netherlands|Academic degree#Netherlands}}

The [[Netherlands]] differentiates between HBO (higher professional or polytechnic education) and WO (scientific education or research universities). HBO has become the bachelor's-master's system. It generally requires four years of education to obtain a bachelor's degree; graduates may then apply for a master's program at a university, which generally require one to two years to complete. An HBO bachelor graduate may have to pass one year of pre-master's education to bridge the gap between their HBO study and (research-oriented) WO study to be admitted to a WO Master's programme, which may grant degrees such as MA, MSc and LLM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aanstaande-studenten.leidenuniv.nl/masteropleidingen/masteropleidingen/mphil-graad-niet-meer-verleend.html|title=De MPhil graad wordt niet meer verleend|trans-title=The MPhil degree is no longer granted|language=nl|publisher=|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726114420/http://www.aanstaande-studenten.leidenuniv.nl/masteropleidingen/masteropleidingen/mphil-graad-niet-meer-verleend.html|archivedate=26 July 2009}} Although it is not recognised by the Dutch state, Dutch universities may still grant the degree MPhil, next to granting a degree as MA or MSc next to the MPhil degree, so that the graduate may still get a recognised degree.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also HBO master's studies, granting the title "Master of" rather than MA, MSc and LLM.

===Portugal===
{{See also|Higher education in Portugal}}

Due to the Bologna Process, in 2005 new ''licenciatura'' ([[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]]) degrees were organized at [[list of colleges and universities in Portugal|university and polytechnic institutions of Portugal]]. Previously a four- to six-year programme, equivalent to 300 ECTS, it is now a three-year first cycle and the only requirement for the two-year second cycle which awards a master's degree. Some Bologna courses are integrated five- or six-year programmes awarding a joint master's degree, a common practice in medicine. In engineering, despite the use of two cycles, an engineer may be licensed only after obtaining a master's degree. Master's degrees attained after five or six years of study correspond to the old undergraduate degrees known as ''licenciatura''. The new ''licenciatura'', obtained after three years of study, corresponds to the discontinued ''bacharelato'' awarded by polytechnics from the 1970s to the early 2000s (roughly equivalent to an extended [[associate degree]]). Old and new master's degrees are the first graduate degree before a doctorate, and the old and new ''licenciatura'' are undergraduate degrees.

The ''licenciatura'' degree (a four- to six-year course) was required for applicants who wished to undertake the old master's and doctoral programmes, but admission was reserved for those with a ''licenciatura'' degree with a grade above 14 (out of 20). After the changes introduced by the Bologna Process, the master's degree is conferred at the end of a programme roughly equivalent in time to many old ''licenciatura'' programmes. The process was developed to improve the education system to one based on the development of competency rather than the transmission of knowledge. Its goal was the development of a system of easily comparable degrees to simplify the comparison of qualifications across Europe. Its flexibility and transparency is intended to enable wider recognition of student qualifications, facilitating movement around a European Higher Education Area based on two main cycles (undergraduate and graduate) and providing third-cycle degrees for doctoral candidates.

===Russia===
{{See also|Education in Russia}}

The [[Russia]]n higher education framework was basically incompatible with the process. The generic, lowest degree in all universities since the Soviet era is the ''Specialist'', which can be obtained after five to six years of study. Since the mid-1990s, many universities have introduced limited programmes allowing students to graduate with a bachelor's degree in four years and a master's degree in an additional one to two years while preserving the old system. In October 2007, Russia moved to two-tier education in line with the Bologna Process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sputniknews.com/russia/20071025/85407429.html|title=Putin signs law on two-tier higher education system-1|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=25 October 2007|accessdate=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities inserted a BSc diploma in the middle of their standard specialist programmes, but the transition to MS qualification has not been completed.

Although Specialists and masters are eligible for doctoral programmes (''Aspirantura''), bachelors are not; the Specialist degree is being discontinued. In most universities bachelor's- and master's-degree education is free of charge, although some state and private universities charge for one or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchsib.ru/news/86|script-title=ru:Платная магистратура|trans-title=Payment for Masters|language=ru|work=uchsib.ru|date=20 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425054404/http://www.uchsib.ru/news/86|archivedate=25 April 2012|quote=(translated) Many tertiary institutions such as the Moscow State University, State University of Management, and RANEPA (Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration) provide an opportunity to take a Masters Degree only on a fee-for basis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sostav.ru/articles/2011/07/22/ko3/|author=Yana Miliukova|script-title=ru:Магистратуру сделали платной в 50 вузах|trans-title=Masters has been made a fee course by 50 tertiary institutions|language=ru|publisher=sostav.ru|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The labour market does not yet understand BSc diplomas, but some universities made the program similar to classical education and the MS stage remains mandatory for most graduates.&lt;ref name=GUR&gt;{{cite news|author=Guriev, Sergey|author-link=Sergei Guriev|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2007/10/08/133923|script-title=ru:Болонский процесс: Катастрофа или панацея|trans-title=The Bologna Process: Catastrophe or panacea|language=ru|publisher=Vedomosti|date=8 October 2007|accessdate=20 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905222405/http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2007%2F10%2F08%2F133923|archivedate=5 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{See also|Education in Sweden|Academic grading in Sweden}}

A bill proposing new regulations in the field of Higher Education was presented to Parliament in 2005, and the new system came into force in July 2007. The new system of degrees will have two degrees, of different lengths, in each cycle.

{| class="wikitable"

!Length (undergraduate)

|-
|3||''Doktorsexamen''||Doctorate||n/a||''Kandidatexamen'' or higher + 4 years
|}

Students may not always be offered all the combinations above to obtain a degree. The ''högskoleexamen'' is usually not offered, and many schools require students to obtain the ''kandidatexamen'' before obtaining a ''magisterexamen'' or ''masterexamen''. Most third-cycle programmes require at least a ''magisterexamen'', although the legal requirement is only the ''kandidatexamen''.

In July 2007 a new system of credits, compatible with the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, was introduced in which one credit (''högskolepoäng'') in the new system corresponds to one ECTS credit and two-thirds of a credit in the old system (''poäng'').

Some Swedish universities have introduced the ECTS standard grading scale for all students, and others will use it only for international students. Since [[criterion-referenced grading]] is used instead of [[norm-referenced test|relative grading]] in the Swedish educational system, the 10-, 25-, 30-, 25- and 10-percent distribution of students among A, B, C, D and E will not be done. Some universities only give Fail or Pass grades (F or P) for certain courses (such as internship and thesis projects) or assignments, such as laboratory exercises.

=={{anchor|Bologna Process seminars}}Seminars==
Several Bologna Process seminars have been held. The first devoted to a single [[academic discipline]], Chemistry Studies in the European Higher Education Area (which approved [[Eurobachelor]]), was held in June 2004 in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="eudoc"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://ectn-assoc.cpe.fr/eurobachelor/doc/officials/Off_EDL061017_Eurodoctorate200611V1.pdf|title=Tuning Chemistry Subject Area Group and European Chemistry Thematic Network: Recommendations for the Third Cycle|publisher=ECTN Association|date=November 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030215326/http://ectn-assoc.cpe.fr/eurobachelor/doc/officials/Off_EDL061017_Eurodoctorate200611V1.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl E. Thoresen''' (born {{Birth date|1933|07|22}}&lt;ref name=locinfo/&gt;) is a [[psychologist]] on the faculty of [[Stanford University]]. Since 2005, he has also been a Senior Fellow at [[Santa Clara University]].

== Education and academic career ==
Many events and achievements in Thoresen's career as a psychologist were described in a profile published in 2009 in the ''[[Counseling Psychologist]]'' (''CP''), as part of its "Legacies and Traditions" series.&lt;ref name=ahint&gt;
Alex H. S. Harris (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0011000008316673 Carl Thoresen: The evolving pioneer]. ''The Counseling Psychologist'', v37, n2, 275-295. {{doi|10.1177/0011000008316673}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thoresen graduated with a B.A. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a bachelor's degree in [[history]] (1955), later receiving his MA (Counseling, 1960) and PhD (Psychological Studies, Counseling Psychology, 1964) from [[Stanford University]].
After a brief period as an Assistant Professor of Counseling at Michigan State (1965–1967), he returned to Stanford as Assistant Professor of Education (1967). From 1975 until 2000 he served as Professor of Education, and by Courtesy, Psychology, and Psychiatry. Since 2000, he has held the same title with emeritus status. Since 2005, he has also been a Senior Fellow at the [[Spirituality and Health Institute]] at [[Santa Clara University]].

According to his ''CP'' profile,&lt;ref name=ahint /&gt; he was also:
*President, Counseling &amp; Human Development, [[American Educational Research Association]] (1974–1976).
*President of the Division of Counseling Psychology, [[American Psychological Association]] (1978–1979).
*Founder and Elected Chair, [[American Psychological Association]], Counseling Health Psychology Section, Division 17 (1997–1999).
*Founder and Chair, [[Society of Behavioral Medicine]], Spirituality and Health Special Interest Group (2000-).
Thoresen has been awarded honorary doctorates by the Faculty of Social Sciences at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]] (1986),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[National University of Ireland]] (Literature, 2004).
&lt;ref name=oleary&gt;Text of the Introductory Address Delivered by Professor Eleanor O'Leary.[http://www.ucc.ie/opa/honconfer/ThoresenCitation.htm] Accessed 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1973|1973]]. 
He is an elected Fellow of several major organisations, including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1982-), the [[American Psychological Association]] (1972-) and the [[Society of Behavioural Medicine]] (1986-). His professional publications number more than 200.

== Research and influence ==
According to the ''CP'' interview, Thoresen's "scholarly work, professional service, teaching, and mentorship have motivated many counseling psychologists to radically expand their areas of inquiry. He was among the first to focus counseling on observable behaviors and to apply psychological science and interventions to physical problems in medical settings. More recently, he has pioneered the study of the interface between spirituality and health" (p.&amp;nbsp;275).&lt;ref name=ahint /&gt;

Beginning in 1973, Thoresen collaborated with well-known [[cardiologist]] [[Meyer Friedman]]. They worked together on the [[Recurrent Coronary Prevention Project]], which followed 1013 [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] survivors for 4.5 years to determine effects from altering their coronary-prone ([[type A personality|type A]]) behavior patterns. Thoresen was responsible "to help design and direct the psychological treatment program based on a behavioral self-control perspective" (p.&amp;nbsp;282).&lt;ref name=ahint /&gt; Results indicated that behavioral counseling reduced rates of recurrence to 13% (from 21% or higher). After the first year, those receiving behavioral counseling also experienced significantly lower rates of death. The study showed, "for the first time, within a controlled experimental design, that altering [[type A personality|type A]] behavior reduces cardiac morbidity and mortality in post infarction patients" (p.&amp;nbsp;653).&lt;ref name=pmid3766365&gt;Meyer Friedman, Carl E. Thoresen, James J. Gill, Diane Ulmer, Lynda H. Powell, Virginia A. Price, Byron Brown, Leonti Thompson, David D. Rabin, William S. Breall, Edward Bourg, Richard Levy, Theodore Dixon (1986).  [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0002-8703(86)90458-8 Alteration of type a behavior and its effect on cardiac recurrences in post myocardial infarction patients: Summary results of the recurrent coronary prevention project].

The '''Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in Information Technology (CMD-IT)''' is an American 501(c)(3), non-profit organization of public and private agencies, corporations, and institutions that focuses on supporting the development of an information technology workforce strong in under-represented groups including [[African Americans]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Hispanics]], and [[People with disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmd-it.org/ CMD-IT web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and Initiatives==
CMD-IT ("command it") supports the following programs and initiatives:

* Tapia Conference. The [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)]] [[Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing]] is a leading conference for celebrating diversity in computing.  Tapia 2015 conference demographics included 35% African American, 22% Hispanic, 53% Women, and 1% people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://d10k7k7mywg42z.cloudfront.net/assets/560c6229d4c9614ef5000bb9/TAPIA_academic_benefits_Final.pdf ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tapia Conference is sponsored by [[Association for Computing Machinery]], organized by the [[Coalition to Diversify Computing]], and presented by CMD-IT.
* Academic Career Workshops for Underrepresented Participants.   In these workshops, under-represented assistant- and associate-level faculty, senior doctoral students, and post-docs are mentored in areas related to the academic career ladder.  The workshops include panels of diverse senior faculty focused on areas such as the tenure and promotion process, launching a research program, effective teaching, and proposal writing.  The workshops have been funded by NSF since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1301783 NSF Academic Careers Workshops for Underrepresented Participants Program Page]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Newsletter.  The organization newsletter is distributed several times a year to over 3500 students, faculty, and professionals. It includes a calendar of events from different organizations and groups focused on the target groups and two to three important articles about current news or initiatives related to minorities and people with disabilities in IT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmd-it.org/news/ CMD-IT news]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Graduation Statistics of Underrepresented Groups in Computing.  This project utilizes multiple databases, including WebCASPAR and CRA Taulbee Survey, to gather statistics about the graduation rates for the different computer science degree levels (associate, bachelor, masters, doctorate) for ethnic minorities and where possible, people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey/ CRA Taulbee Survey site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''China Open Resources for Education''', or  '''CORE''', was a [[non-profit organization]] that promoted closer interaction and [[open educational resources|open sharing of educational resources]] between Chinese and international universities. Its website is offline since 2013. 

==Overview==
CORE was established in November 2003 following an [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] Conference in [[Beijing]].

CORE was a consortium of universities that began with 26 IET Educational Foundation member universities and 44 [[China Central Radio and TV University|China Radio and TV Universities]], with a total enrollment of 5 million students. It aimed to provide Chinese universities with free and easy access to global open educational resources and provides the framework for Chinese-speaking universities to participate in the shared, global network of advanced courseware with MIT and other leading universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6371">At educational institutions above [[primary education]], each grade level or year of study is a [[Class (education)|class]], referenced by the year of graduation, i.e., "Class of 2011". The official activities of these groups are generally organized and led by '''class officers''', who are elected&lt;ref name=FCPS /&gt; in the late spring of each year for the term beginning in the fall,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhs.mps.k12.mi.us/Documents/hhdow_handbook_2009_2010.pdf "Student Union"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714160401/http://www.dhs.mps.k12.mi.us/Documents/hhdow_handbook_2009_2010.pdf |date=2010-07-14 }} H. H. Dow High School, Student Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; or early in the fall term. After graduation, the class officers are typically responsible for organizing their [[class reunion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alum.mit.edu/volunteering/VolunteerTools/ClassVolunteerToolkit/ClassOrganizations/Class_Officer_Job_Descriptions#a1 "Wanted: Talent, Bullying classmates "] MIT Alumni Association, Class Officer Job Descriptions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Like a [[student council]], their leadership model is loosely based on either the [[parliamentary system]] or the [[executive branch]] of the [[United States]]. Unlike a student council, which represents the students of an entire school, class officers typically represent only a single class.&lt;ref name=FCPS&gt;[http://www.fcps.edu/EdisonHS/updates/Letter%20and%20petition.pdf "Student Government Association Officers' Petition"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} DUVAL COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS website&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the purpose of student council is to learn about democracy and leadership, and to work in partnership with school management for the benefit of the school, the goal of class officers is to organize and facilitate activities for the enjoyment of their classmates.
The following positions are common to nearly all groups of class officers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/volunteer/documents/CACO_class%20officer%20position%20descriptions.pdf "Class Officer Position Descriptions"] Cornell University, Office of Alumni Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Class president]] - ultimately responsible for all class activities; creates agenda and presides over meetings; delegates duties and acts as the representative for the class
* [[Vice-president]] - fulfills the duties of the president when the president is absent; performs duties assigned by the president
* [[Secretary]] - takes meeting minutes; maintains correspondence &amp; attendance records; keeps class activity calendar/webpage; responsible for all sign-up sheets   
* [[Treasurer#In other organizations|Treasurer]] - establishes budget; records all financial transactions; gives status report at class meetings; authorizes expenditures; inventories fundraising items; and collects/deposits fundraising money earned

Before he was Dean for Medical Education, he had served as Dean for Students and Alumni.  He later became Senior Dean for Alumni Relations and Clinical Teaching.

He was also an [[endocrinologist]] specializing in [[diabetes]] and [[hormones]] and practicing [[clinical medicine]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].

== Professional career ==
Dr. Federman was born in New York City in 1928, the son of European immigrants who settled in the [[Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/09/07/daniel-federman-harvard-medical-school-stalwart-dies/aAPUYeyeUUoOHYbTBmDnsM/story.html Boston Globe obituary for Daniel David Federman.  September 8, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; He was graduated summa cum laude from [[Harvard College]] in 1949 and magna cum laude from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1953. Following an internship and residency at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH), he became a clinical associate at the [[National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Disease]] ([[NIAMS]]) where, under the guidance of [[Ed Rall]], he studied the effects of [[androgens]] on [[thyroid function]], [[thyroxine metabolism]], and [[thyroxine-binding proteins|thyroxine-binding protein]]. In 1957, he began a two-year clinical research fellowship with Sir Edward Pochin at the [[University College Hospital]] Medical School, London, pioneering in the use of [[radioactive iodine]] for the treatment of [[thyroid cancer]]. Following his time in London, he returned to [[Harvard Medical School|HMS]] and the [[Massachusetts General Hospital|MGH]] and worked his way up the ranks, becoming chief of the endocrine unit at the MGH in 1964, assistant chief of medical services at the MGH in 1967, associate professor of medicine at HMS and physician at the MGH in 1970, and associate chairman of medicine in 1971. During this period, Dr. Federman produced his classic text, [https://www.amazon.com/Abnormal-Sexual-Development-Daniel-Federman/dp/0721635881 Abnormal Sexual Development: a genetic and endocrine approach to differential diagnosis], which has been credited as bringing order to a hitherto disorganized field.

In 1973, Dr. Federman was recruited to become physician-in-chief and chair of the Department of Medicine at [[Stanford University]].

He authored at least 379 biomedical research articles published in refereed publications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/51062/Network/ResearchAreas/details Harvard Catalyst index of refereed biomedical publications by Daniel David Federman, MD]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2007, Federman was senior dean for alumni relations and clinical teaching at HMS, mentoring medical education developments through innovative{{Peacock-term|date=June 2018}} initiatives.

After his retirement from Harvard Medical School at the end of 2007, when he was succeeded by [[Edward Hundert|Edward M. Hundert]], he taught in [[Miami, Florida]] for over six years at the [[University of Miami]]'s [[Miller School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edo.med.miami.edu/grand-rounds/subsect-archive/dr.-daniel-federman Grand Rounds : Archive, 2003-2013. Dr. Daniel Federman], [[Miller School of Medicine]], [[University of Miami]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent topics reflectively expressed his broad and humane interests: “Protecting Research Participants”, “The physician’s responsibility toward hopelessly ill patients”, “The endocrine patient”, and “The education of medical students: sounds, alarms, and excursions”.

== Personal life ==
While Federman was a medical student doing a three-month clerkship in medicine, he met his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Buckley, who was head nurse - the youngest head nurse ever - at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].  MGH Trustees needed to vote to allow Betty to work in that role, since she was only 22 at the time.  He later commented that he could not learn everything she had to teach him in her role there.  

As Dean for Medical Education of [[Harvard Medical School]], he handed his daughter her diploma at her HMS graduation.

He was an avid sailor who also enjoyed a wide array of musical styles - he loved opera and was an accomplished square dance caller.  He was proud of narrating ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' for The [[Longwood Symphony Orchestra]], the volunteer non-profit orchestra based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and composed of medical professionals.

He often taught (a) think out loud, (b) stick to the basics, and (c) be kind as key 'fundamentals' in [[medical education]].

His wife Betty passed on November 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=120369716 Legacy.com obituary for Elizabeth (Betty) Federman, nee Buckley, published in The New York Times on November 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  She had been born in Nashua, NH, the daughter of Charles and Mary Buckley and had a brother Charles Buckley.

They had two daughters: Lise Ann Federman Mann of Belmont, who had studied health policy and management at [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and later studied patient advocacy at [[University of Miami]] while her father taught there in a post-retirement career, and Carolyn Federman-Zaucha, MD, and son-in-law Albert of Chicago; three grandchildren: Daniel, Julia and Michael; and cousins, nieces, and nephews.

}}'''Denise Scott Brown''' (née '''Lakofski'''; born October 3, 1931) is an American [[architect]], planner, writer, educator, and principal of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lumiere.lib.vt.edu/iawa_db/view_all.php3?person_pk=343&amp;table=bio&amp;|title=View all information for Denise Scott Brown|work=vt.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Brown and her husband and partner, [[Robert Venturi]], are regarded as among the most influential architects of the twentieth century, both through their architecture and planning, and theoretical writing and teaching.

==Education and teaching==

Born to Jewish parents Simon and Phyllis (Hepker) Lakofski, Denise Lakofski had the vision from the time she was five years old that she would be an architect. Pursuing this goal, she spent her summers working with architects, and from 1948 to 1952, studied in [[South Africa]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. She briefly entered [[liberal politics]], but was frustrated by the lack of acceptance of women in the field. Lakofski traveled to [[London]] in 1952, working for the [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] architect [[Frederick Gibberd]]. She continued her education there, winning admission to the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] to learn “useful skills in the building of a just South Africa,” within an intellectually rich environment which embraced women. She was joined there by Robert Scott Brown, whom she had met at Witwatersrand in 1954, and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Whitaker|first3=Kathryn|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denise Lakofski and Robert Scott Brown were married on July 21, 1955. The couple spent the next three years working and traveling throughout Europe, and in 1958, they moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s planning department. In 1959, Robert died in a car accident. Denise Scott Brown completed her master's degree in city planning in 1960 and, upon graduation, became a faculty member at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|title=Harvard Gazette: Architect to receive Radcliffe Medal|author=Harvard News Office|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215447/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching, she completed a master's degree in architecture.  At a 1960 faculty meeting, she argued against demolishing the university's library (now the [[Furness Library|Fisher Fine Arts Library]]), designed by [[Philadelphia]] architect [[Frank Furness]]. At the meeting, she met [[Robert Venturi]], a young architect and fellow professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lessons-from-las-vegas/|title=Lessons from Las Vegas - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became collaborators and taught courses together from 1962 to 1964. Scott Brown left the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Becoming known as a scholar in [[urban planning]], she taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at [[UCLA]], and in 1966 asked him to visit [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with her. The two were married in [[Santa Monica, California]], on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to [[Philadelphia]] in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969.  Denise Scott Brown later taught at [[Yale University]], and in 2003 was a visiting lecturer with Venturi at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]].

==Architecture and planning==
[[File:Denise Scott Brown 1978 © Lynn Gilbert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denise Scott Brown in 1978, photographed by [[Lynn Gilbert]]]]
In 1972, with Venturi and [[Steven Izenour]], Scott Brown wrote ''[[Learning from Las Vegas|Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form]]''. The book published studies of the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at [[Yale]]'s School of Architecture and Planning. The book joined Venturi's previous ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and vernacular architecture.  The book coined the terms "Duck" and "Decorated Shed" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning.

Scott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the [[Bryn Mawr College]] plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Moos|first1=Stanislaus|title=Venturi Scott Brown &amp; Associates Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998|date=1999|publisher=The Monacelli Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as “FFF studios.” In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Hiesinger|first3=Kathryn B.|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Department of Publishing|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the [[Nikko Hotels|Nikko hotel chain]] are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical [[kimono]] patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior “street” complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

With the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"/&gt; She has also served as principal-in-charge with [[Robert Venturi]] on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the [[Sainsbury Wing]] of [[London National Gallery|London's National Gallery]], the capitol building in [[Toulouse]] and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|title=VSBA Homepage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Women In Design, a student organization spearheaded by Caroline Amory James and Arielle Assouline-Lichten&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/news/caroline-james-and-arielle-assouline-lichten-honored-by-bwaf.html|title=Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] started a petition for Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner [[Robert Venturi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html?ref=design| work= The New York Times |title = Partner Without the Prize| accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When awarded the [[Jane Drew Prize]] in 2017 Scott Brown referred to the Pritzer controversy and subsequent petition saying "I was very touched by the Pritzker petition – and that is my prize in the end. 20,000 people wrote from all over the world and every one of them called me Denise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/denise-scott-brown-recognised-with-2017-jane-drew-prize/10017080.article|title = Denise Scott Brown recognised with 2017 Jane Drew Prize| accessdate= February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Room at the top ===
In 1989, Scott Brown published her famous essay, "Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/14_Outsiders%20in%20the%20Profession/Brown_Sexism.pdf |format=PDf|title=Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture|website=www.isites.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Scott Brown wrote the essay in 1975, she decided not to publish it at the time, out of fear for damaging her career. The essay describes her struggle to be recognized as an equal partner of the firm, in an architecture world that was predominantly male. She has since been an advocate for Women in Architecture and has spoken out about discrimination within the profession on several accounts.

The '''Economic Scholars Program''' (ESP) is an annual conference  in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that highlights undergraduate research in economics and business.  It is co-hosted by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] and [[Austin College]]. The conference is typically held on the last Friday in March or first Friday in April&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasfed.org/educate/events/esp.cfm | title=ESP About | publisher=Dallas Federal Reserve | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is modeled after professional economics conferences. Undergraduate students participate in the conference as presenters of original or faculty-coauthored research, discussants, session chairs or audience member participants. Each level of participation in the program is designed to reflect the growing interests and skills of undergraduate students. Additionally, the ESP added a poster session in 2011 to accommodate more student research.

The 6th annual conference, held in 2012, hosted undergraduate students and faculty mentors representing 35 different undergraduate institutions from 19 states. In terms of the number of attendees, papers, and posters presented it is the largest conference focusing on undergraduate research in economics.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Eli Review''' is a web-based service which provides instructors with tools to facilitate [[peer learning]] through the three primary activities in the [[writing process]]: writing, review, and revision. Its main theoretical basis is a concept associated with [[Lev Vygotsky]] known as the [[zone of proximal development]], or [[instructional scaffolding]], where learners build confidence and skill through working with a more capable peer and with the guidance of an experienced teacher or mentor. It was originally developed at [[Michigan State University]], and functioned for several years in the MSU community before commercialisation in 2011.

Eli Review positions instructors as “review coordinators” where they design survey-like reviews that guide students in giving criteria-based feedback. This allows assignment and review of writing and revision tasks to be performed piecemeal, which enables students to develop work iteratively and focus more on higher-order concerns such as organization and pairing claims with suitable evidence, than surface-level issues such as grammar or spelling.  Engagement data is tracked for individual activities and automatically compiled into individual student and aggregate class reports.

'''Ella Graham Agnew''' (March 18, 1871 – February 5, 1958) was a [[Virginia]] educator and social worker.  She was the first woman named a field demonstration agent by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], and later occupied high-level positions supporting the [[New Deal]].

==Life and career==
Agnew was born at the family home, Roseland, in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia]], ninth of ten children born to Dr. James Anderson Agnew and Martha Chaffin Scott Agnew.&lt;ref name="vt.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vtpp.ext.vt.edu/about/ella-graham-agnew-1871-1958|title=Ella Graham Agnew (1871–1958)|work=vt.edu|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house soon burned, and the family moved to [[Burkeville, Virginia|Burkeville]], in neighboring [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]].

For two of those years she was principal of the Amajuba Seminary in [[Wakkerstroom]].&lt;ref name="encyclopediavirginia.org"/&gt; After this was closed by the war, she spent time providing assistance to the Boers and doing clerical and administrative work at the American consulate.&lt;ref name="vt.edu"/&gt; During her time in South Africa Agnew also became involved in the student Christian movement.&lt;ref name="encyclopediavirginia.org"/&gt;

Agnew continued her professional life upon her return from Africa; she worked as a teacher in Virginia, an office manager in New York, and general secretary of a number of [[Young Women's Christian Association]] chapters.&lt;ref name="vt.edu"/&gt; She also continued her education via [[correspondence course]]s during this time.&lt;ref name="encyclopediavirginia.org"/&gt; She returned to Virginia to begin a system of professional training for rural girls; supported by the state superintendent of education, [[Joseph D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">The '''Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development''' (FWL) was established in 1966, as one of the 20 original Regional Educational Laboratories funded by [[the United States Congress]] and charged with "bridging the gap between research and practice." 

Between 1966 and 1976, FWL developed teacher "minicourses" on a variety of subjects. Each minicourse provided a model of specific classroom strategies or behaviors, gave teachers a chance to practice the strategies, and then provided feedback. Minicourses were distributed throughout the country, and the approach was adapted for use in other professions beyond K-12 education. 

Between 1976 and 1986, FWL's landmark [[Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study]] funded by the [[U.S. National Institute of Education]] identified teacher characteristics and skills that contribute positively to student performance. The study focused national attention on "Academic Learning Time," a concept soon picked up and extended by countless other researchers and educators. 

Between 1986 and 1995, FWL developed teacher cases to improve teacher education and effectiveness in the classroom. The lab's work in this area was on the cutting edge of what has been called a "quiet revolution in teacher education." In 1995 FWL merged with the Southwest Regional Educational Laboratory (SWRL) to form [[WestEd]].&lt;ref&gt;WestEd WWW site, Aug. 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Archives Archival Research Catalog (ARC)organization authority file (search ARC).[https://research.archives.gov/search]&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of the National Centre of Manuscripts comprises [[manuscript|manuscripts]], historical documents, early printed books, rare publications and heirlooms. The Centre carries out various projects related to scientific research, exhibitions and [[Conservation_and_restoration_of_books,_manuscripts,_documents_and_ephemera|restoration]]. Specialists working at and with the Centre engage in the description, systematization, study and publication of the material housed at the Centre, as well as in the production of data bases dealing with this material. The Centre also has rich academic library and includes rooms dedicated in memory of [[Korneli Kekelidze]], [[Ivane Javakhishvili]], [[Ilia Abuladze]], [[Niko Berdzenishvili]], [[Elene Metreveli]] and [[Shalva Amiranashvili]].

== History ==

The National Centre of Manuscripts was founded in 1958 under the name "The Institute of Manuscripts of the Georgian Academy of Sciences". It was created on the basis of the collection in the Department of Manuscripts at the [[State Museum of Georgia]] and on the initiative of [[Ilia Abuladze]], who became the first director of the Institute. In 1962, the name of the Institute was supplemented with "Kekelidze" to honour the Georgian [[philology|philologist]] and [[History_of_literature|literary historian]] [[Korneli Kekelidze]].

In [[higher education]], '''health promotion''' programs work to support student success by creating healthy learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American College Health Association|title=Standards of Practice for Health Promotion in Higher Education|url=http://www.acha.org/Publications/docs/Standards_of_Practice_for_Health_Promotion_in_Higher_Education_May2012.pdf|website=www.acha.org|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health promotion professionals practice [[Prevention Science|prevention]] to expand protective factors and reduce personal and community health risk factors, utilizing a [[public health]]/[[population health]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American College Health Association|title=Guidelines for Hiring Health Promotion Professionals in Higher Education|url=http://www.acha.org/Publications/docs/Hiring_Health_Promotion_Professionals_in_Higher_Ed_May2014.pdf|website=www.acha.org|accessdate=25 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320202829/http://www.acha.org/Publications/docs/Hiring_Health_Promotion_Professionals_in_Higher_Ed_May2014.pdf|archivedate=20 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health promotion]] services often coordinate [[primary prevention]] and [[secondary prevention]] on campus, operating as a functional area of [[College Health]] or [[Student Affairs]].  Sub-specialties include education on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and other [[drugs]], [[sexual health]], [[nutrition]], [[stress management]], healthy lifestyles, chronic disease prevention and [[Peer education|peer health education]].

==In the United States==
The [http://www.acha.org American College Health Association] [http://www.acha.org/Publications/docs/Standards_of_Practice_for_Health_Promotion_in_Higher_Education_May2012.pdf Standards of Practice for Health Promotion in Higher Education] provides measurable guidelines for enhancing the quality of prevention, health promotion, and wellness services at colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American College Health Association|title=Standards of Practice for Health Promotion in Higher Education|url=http://www.acha.org/Publications/docs/Standards_of_Practice_for_Health_Promotion_in_Higher_Education_May2012.pdf|website=www.acha.org|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education]] creates and delivers a dynamic and credible Book of Professional Standards and Guidelines and Self-Assessment Guides that are designed to lead to a host of quality-controlled programs and services and promotes standards in student affairs, student services, and student development programs for the ultimate purpose of fostering and enhancing student learning, development, and achievement and in general to promote good citizenship.  CAS updated all functional area standards, including CAS for Health Promotion in Higher Education in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education|title=Professional Standards for Higher Education|url=http://www.cas.edu/standards|website=www.cas.edu|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Commission for Health Education Credentialing]] (NCHEC) works to improve the practice of health education and to serve the public and profession of health education by certifying health education specialists (also known as the CHES credential), which promotes professional and career development of health care education, preparation, and practice, all ideals thought to promote the delivery of health care. [[National Commission for Health Education Credentialing|NCHEC]] develops and administers the CHES exam in the United States, a competency-based test for health education specialists. The [[CHES]] credential is renewable every five years, requiring a baseline of continuing education credits for recertification. This is akin to the requirements and practices of many other health professions, including physicians ([[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|ACCME]]), pharmacists (ACPE), and nurses (ANCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Commission for Health Education Credentialing|title=Health Education Profession|url=http://www.nchec.org/credentialing/profession/|website=nchec.org|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ImpactStory''' is an [[open source]], web-based tool that provides [[altmetrics]] to help researchers measure the impacts of their research outputs including journal articles, [[Blog|blog posts]], datasets, and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Priem|first=Jason|title=The launch of ImpactStory: using altmetrics to tell data-driven stories|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/09/25/the-launch-of-impactstor/|work=Impact of Social Sciences|publisher=LSE|accessdate=1 January 2014|author2=Heather Piwowar|date=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to change the focus of the scholarly reward system to value and encourage web-native scholarship. ImpactStory is a nonprofit organisation funded by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://impactstory.org/about|work=ImpactStory|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImpactStory awarded $300k NSF grant!|url=http://blog.impactstory.org/2013/09/27/impactstory-awarded-300k-nsf-grant/|work=ImpactStory|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Concept==
ImpactStory follows open practices with its data (to the extent allowed by providers' terms of service), code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImpactStory total-impact|url=https://github.com/total-impact|work=GitHub|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloan Foundation grant submitted|url=http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/03/01/18535014681/|work=ImpactStory blog|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It provides context to its metrics so that they are meaningful without knowledge of the specific dataset: for example, instead of letting the reader guess whether having five [[Fork (software development)|forks]] on [[GitHub]] is common, ImpactStory would tell that the repository is in the 95th percentile of all GitHub repositories created that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImpactStory adds figshare integration|url=http://www.researchinformation.info/news/news_story.php?news_id=1443|work=Research Information|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metrics provided by ImpactStory can be used by researchers who want to know how many times their work has been downloaded and shared,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisen|first=Jonathan|title=Playing with Impact Story to look at Alt Metrics for my papers, data, etc |url=http://phylogenomics.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/playing-with-impact-story-to-look-at.html|work=The Tree of Life|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also research funders who are interested in the impact of research beyond only considering citations to journal articles.

==Unpaywall==
Unpaywall is a [[browser extension]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coldewey |first1=Devin |title=Unpaywall scours the web for free versions of scientific papers |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/unpaywall-scours-the-web-for-free-versions-of-scientific-papers/ |website=TechCrunch |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which find free versions of (paywalled) articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chawla |first1=Dalmeet Singh |title=Unpaywall finds free versions of paywalled papers |journal=Nature |date=4 April 2017 |doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018 it was reported to provide free access to 20 million articles,&lt;ref name="Else2018"/&gt; and about 47% of the articles that people search with Unpaywall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Doctorow |first1=Cory |title=Unpaywall: a search-engine for authorized, freely accessible versions of scholarly journal articles / Boing Boing |url=https://boingboing.net/2018/02/06/search-engine-arbitrage.html |website=boingboing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 it was integrated into [[Web of Science]] and in July 2018 [[Elsevier]] announced plans the same month to integrate the service into the [[Scopus]] search engine.&lt;ref name="Else2018"/&gt;

'''Lars Mehrling Brownworth''' (born c. 1975) is an author and former United States [[history]] and [[political science]] teacher at [[The Stony Brook School]] in [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], who created the top 50 [[podcast]], [https://12byzantinerulers.com/ 12 Byzantine Rulers: The History of the Byzantine Empire]. This podcast was created on a whim by Lars and his brother, [[Anders Brownworth]]. Often mistaken for a [[college professor]], Lars was, in fact, a [[high school]] history instructor at the time the podcast was produced.

On August 15, 2007, Brownworth announced that he had resigned from teaching to work on a book with [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishing]] titled ''Lost to the West: The Forgotten Byzantine Empire that Rescued Western Civilization,'' which was published on September 15, 2009. On January 3, 2014, Brownworth released his second book, ''The Normans: From Raiders to Kings.'' His third book, titled ''The Sea Wolves: A History of the Vikings'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.amazon.com/Lars-Brownworth/e/B002SPQ5SQ/|title = Lars Brownworth page on Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 2014. Both the Normans and the Sea Wolves reached the New York Times Best Seller Lists.  He maintains a blog called [http://www.larsbrownworth.com/blog/ Finding History] where he responds to reader and listener submitted questions.

He has been interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[NPR]]'s "Here and Now", has written for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and resides in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]], [[Maryland]], with his wife, the former Catherine Tipmore.

'''''Last Call!''''' is a video game for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] released in 2000 by publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Last Call Review|url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/last-call|website = www.gamerevolution.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29|last = Silverman|first = Ben|date = 2000-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those playing the game take on the role of a bartender attempting to maximize tips from customers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Last Call! - Overview - allgame |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852 |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |last=Hernandez |first=Tara |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211112443/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852 |archivedate=December 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The game was developed by Cutler Creative and supported [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98]]. The game's creator, John Cutler, first got the idea for the game in 1995. He wanted to have a game that could teach people to mix drinks. Under the original title Bartender USA, the player would start at a [[Howard Johnson's]] and gradually work their way up to a trendy bar in New York City. At the time, Cutler had no video game experience, and didn't own a computer until he started development. He attended [[E3]] and also worked as a bartender to better understand what he needed to do. He hired programmers and artists to put together a mockup of the game. The original concept included some live action animation, which was dropped from the final game. Simon &amp; Schuster had recently published the comedy game [[Deer Avenger]], and agreed to publish the game since it matched up with their business model at the time. This agreement gave Cutler's team funding to develop and complete the game. Due to Cutler's inexperience, many aspects of the game needed to be rethought during the development process. Cutler credited his choice to use [[Macromedia Director]] as making a mammoth task much easier. He struggled with [[feature creep]] and his relationship with the testing company.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Postmortem: Cutler Creative's  Last Call|url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131490/postmortem_cutler_creatives_last_.php|website = www.gamasutra.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29|last = Cutler|first = John|date = 2001-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The setting of the game is a fictional bar in New York City. The player, as bartender, must learn to mix over one hundred drinks. They also have to ID all customers (serving an underage customer will get the player fired), charm customers, keep music playing, and keep customers from being too drunk. The game offers a recipe book for players, but players will score better if they don't use it. Also, without memorizing the recipes, the player will run out of time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Last Call|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/05/last-call|website = IGN|date = 2000-04-04|accessdate = 2015-07-29|first = I. G. N.|last = Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the game is to get the most tips. There are around 20 characters that the player needs to serve in the game. One of these characters is Vincent the Hedgehog, who is an actual hedgehog.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reviews and sales ==
Review of the game were mixed. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution describes it as a casual game, and not one that a player would expect to play for hours. Silverman described it as a replacement for Solitaire that wouldn't hook players, but also stated that with its low price, it may be worth buying.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lisa Savignano of All Game praised the creative characters, but noted that some of the graphics were poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Last Call! - Review - allgame |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852&amp;tab=review |date=2014-11-17 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117050219/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852&amp;tab=review |archivedate=November 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN appreciated the large library of drinks, but noted that the animation was often clunky.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The game sold poorly and was a flop. Despite this, for the French and UK market under the name Happy Hour, and in Germany under the name On the Rocks. Cutler was surprised at the nearly even ratio of male to female purchasers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The video game is rated mature and is not recommended for those younger than 21.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">'''Learning Leaders''' (previously the '''New York City School Volunteer Program''') is a [[New York City]] (NYC) [[nonprofit]] organization dedicated to engaging families and communities to support student success. Founded in 1956, it works to help NYC’s [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] students by running [[Community engagement|family and community engagement]] programs, which empower parents to foster their children’s educational development and training volunteers to provide individualized tutoring and support.

Learning Leaders works closely with the [[New York City Department of Education]] in its efforts to create and support partnerships between schools, families and the community to enhance student achievement.

As of school year 2013-2014, the organization has over 4,000 volunteers working with 180,000 students through partnerships with 250 elementary and middle schools across every district in NYC’s five boroughs. Seventy per cent of all Learning Leaders volunteers, including family and community members, are African American or Latino and half speak a language other than English at home. Some 4,000 parents participated in its family education workshops to increase knowledge and skills on how to support their children’s education.

== History ==
Learning Leaders was founded in 1956 as the New York City School Volunteer Program (SVP), the brainchild of Clara Blitzer, a member of the Board of the Public Education Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyparenting.com/stories/2011/4/fp_learningleaders_2011_04.html "A History of Learning Leaders"], New York Parenting, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was adopted by the New York City Board of Education in 1962 but became an independent non-profit organization in 1970.

In 1999, SVP changed its name to Learning Leaders and created its website, learningleaders.org, to reflect its evolving role in student education and the increased involvement of parents and family members as school volunteers and supporters of their own children’s learning at home and at school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyparenting.com/stories/2011/4/fp_learningleaders_2011_04.html "A History of Learning Leaders"], New York Parenting, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

When the City’s new ‘Children First’ initiative was launched in 2002, it brought far-reaching structural and curriculum changes to the public school system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/nyvoices/yearofchange/timeline.html "A Year of Change: Leadership in the Principal's Office"], THIRTEEN, WNET New York Public Media&lt;/ref&gt; Growing parent involvement became a major goal of the New York City Department of Education and Parent Coordinators were recruited for every school. Learning Leaders was, and continues to be, a key partner in this effort.

In 2007, the nonprofit was among over 530 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which was made possible through a donation by New York City [[mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&amp;en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss| title=New York Times: City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Roberts | date=July 6, 2005 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}} Retrieved on August 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity ==
'''Empowering Family Members to Support Children’s Education'''

Learning Leaders is committed to effective family engagement, which research has shown to boost student learning and positive child and youth development. It offers a wide range of interactive parent workshops in multiple languages. The workshops cover topics including supporting literacy and math skills at home, understanding child and adolescent development and navigating the middle and high school applications process.  The program aims to help increase parent knowledge about the public school system and learning standards and to develop strategies for effectively supporting their children’s education.

'''Bringing Community and Family Resources to Schools'''

Learning Leaders divides its volunteer programs into two main models: the Core Program and the Enrichment Programs. The Core Program recruits and trains community and family volunteers to provide students with one-on-one tutoring in reading, writing, ESL, math and other academic subjects at the elementary and middle school levels, as well as non-instructional support such as general office and library assistance.

Through Learning Leaders’ Enrichment Programs, volunteers supplement students’ education beyond core academic support. These programs, which include BookTalk and Book Buddies, promote a life-long love of reading and literature, encourage students to discuss and think critically and develop confidence and communication skills.

'''Maya Rao''' (2 May 1928 – 1 September 2014) was an Indian [[Indian classical dance|classical dancer]], choreographer and educator, in [[Kathak]] dance. She is known for her pioneering work in Kathak choreography, especially in dance ballets,&lt;ref name=hindusep14/&gt; and is credited for bringing Kathak, a [[North Indian]]-dance style to [[South India]], when she opened her dance school, Natya Institute of Kathak and Choreography (NIKC) in [[Malleswaram]], [[Bangalore]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=mint&gt;{{cite web | title = How Kathak breached the north-south divide|author=Shoba Narayan |publisher= [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]| url = http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/hPoqKRykCDhyxQHaXCT19N/How-Kathak-breached-the-northsouth-divide.html |date=26 July 2014|accessdate = 26 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Taking it a step higher, again|publisher= The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/taking-it-a-step-higher-again/article2835397.ece |date=27 January 2012|accessdate = 26 July 2014 | first = Madhu | last = Nataraj  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the founder director of her dance company, "Natya and Stem Dance Kampni", an amalgam of NIKC and the STEM Dance Kampni ( founded by her daughter [[Madhu Nataraj]]) based in Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Kampni | url = http://www.stemdancekampni.in/Kampni.html |publisher=stemdancekampni.in| accessdate = 26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hinducom&gt;{{cite web | title = Where contemporary keeps step with classical |publisher=The Hindu| url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/where-contemporary-keeps-step-with-classical/article4858879.ece |date=28 June 2013| accessdate = 26 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After her early training under Guru Sohanlal of [[Jaipur]] [[Gharana]], followed by Guru Sunder Prasad also of the Jaipur Gharana, and went to train under Guru [[Shambhu Maharaj]] of Lucknow Gharana at [[National Institute of Kathak Dance]] in Delhi.

She was awarded the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]], given by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], the National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama in 1989. In 2011, the Akademi awarded her the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Tagore Ratna]], given to 100 artists from across India to mark the 150th birth anniversary of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], for their contribution in the field of performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sangeet Natak Akademi Ratna and Akademi Puraskar |url=http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/tagoreawards.htm |quote=".. a one-time honour of Tagore Samman to be awarded to 100 persons of the age of 75 years and above who have made significant contribution in the field of performing arts." |publisher=Sangeet Natak Akademi |date=2011 |accessdate=2 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707094419/http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/tagoreawards.htm |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=List of recipients of Tagore Akademi Puraskar|url = http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2012/apr/d2012042301.pdf |publisher= [[Press Information Bureau]], Government of India|accessdate = 2 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was born in [[Malleswaram]], Bangalore to orthodox [[Konkani Brahmins|Konkani]] [[Saraswat Brahmin]] family of Hattangadi Sanjeev Rao, a renowned architect in the city, and Subhadra Bai. She had three brothers and three sisters. At an early age she learnt [[Hindustani classical music]] – vocal and instrumental [[dilruba]] from Rama Rao, being from an orthodox family where girls didn't learn dance, considered a taboo. However this changed when at age 12, after she and her architect father watched dancer [[Uday Shankar]]'s troupe perform at BRV Talkies auditorium in Bangalore. Moved by the performance, his father wanted his daughters to learn dance.&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web | title =Profiles: Kathak Guru Dr. Maya Rao turns 86 today! |publisher=narthaki|url =http://www.narthaki.com/info/profiles/profl161.html | accessdate = 27 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toijuly&gt;{{cite web |title = Maya Rao took forbidden dance to a new level |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/music/Maya-Rao-took-forbidden-dance-to-a-new-level/articleshow/40863459.cms |author= GS Kumar |date= 25 August 2014 |accessdate= 1 September 2014 |publisher= The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her guru Pandit Ramarao Naik, was a disciple of Ustad [[Faiyaz Khan]], and vocalist of the [[Agra gharana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Namaskara to the Agra master|work= The Music Magazine|author=S R Ramakrishna| url = http://www.themusicmagazine.com/ramaraonaik.html | accessdate = 2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran music and dance school at Benson Town, Bangalore, where various dance and music styles were taught. Here Sohan Lal from [[Jaipur]] [[Gharana]] was in charge of the Kathak section.&lt;ref name=whirl/&gt; Soon, her younger sisters, Uma and Chitra, six years and four years old respectively, started learning Kathak from under Guru Sohanlal, while she at age twelve was considered too old for Kathak. Finally, her father allowed her to start her Kathak training in 1942, with a promise to never dance professionally or on stage, which she was soon break. She learnt from him for next two years. However, when she gave a first performance in 1944, at the [[Bangalore Town Hall|Town Hall]] for a Saraswat Samaj community programme, her father didn't object.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=toijuly/&gt;&lt;ref name=whirl/&gt;

Meanwhile, her father died in 1946, after being cheated in business and incurring heavy losses. Their family home was auctioned within a year and the family moved to a one-room house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20381">'''Need-blind admission''' is a term used in the [[United States]] denoting a [[college admission]] policy in which the admitting institution does not consider an applicant's financial situation when deciding admission.  Generally, an increase in students admitted under a need-blind policy and needing [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] requires the institution to back the policy with an ample [[Financial endowment|endowment]] or source of funding. Being need-blind is a statutory requirement for institutions to participate in an anti-trust exemption granted by Congress which remains in effect until September 30, 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s1482/summary|title=Summary of S. 1482: Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015 - GovTrack.us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An institution may be need-blind in any given year by policy ([[de jure]]) or by circumstances ([[de facto]]).

Most colleges and universities cannot afford to offer financial aid to all admitted students and many will admit all students on a need-blind basis but cannot offer them sufficient aid to meet need.  Many schools who admit all U.S. citizens or resident aliens without regard to need do not extend this policy to international students or to transfer students. Therefore, schools, especially private ones, which are need-blind and full-need for all applicants, including internationals, tend to be much more selective as they have relatively more applicants than other similar schools.

Need-blind admission does not necessarily mean a "full-need" financial aid policy—where the school agrees to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all its admitted students.  Indeed, the two policies can be in tension because need-blind admissions and full-need financial aid together commit the school to spend an undetermined amount of money regardless of other budgetary constraints.  Thus, some need-blind schools will admit students who will nonetheless not be able to attend because of deficient financial aid awards.

Institutions self-define their definition of meeting full demonstrated need. There is no U.S. standard that an institution must abide by to claim that they meet fully demonstrated need. Therefore, an applicant's financial aid package can vary significantly at various schools, even if all of these institutions claim to meet fully demonstrated need.

==U.S. institutions that are need-blind and meet full demonstrated need for both U.S. and international students==
There are currently only seven U.S. [[higher education|higher learning]] institutions that are need-blind and meet full demonstrated need for all applicants, including international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalstudent.com/schools_awarding_aid/|title=Schools Awarding International Financial Aid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:

==U.S. institutions that are need-blind for U.S. applicants and meet full demonstrated need==
A number of U.S. institutions of higher learning offer both need-blind admissions and meet the full demonstrated need for all domestic students. However, these institutions are need-aware when it comes to international student admissions. However, all admitted students will have their demonstrated need met. The following schools fall into this category:

==U.S. institutions that are not need-blind for U.S. applicants and meet full demonstrated need==
Many reputable US institutions that once championed "need-blind" policies in the past have modified their policies due to rising tuition and financial aid costs, as well as less-than-ideal returns on endowments. This largely affects prestigious institutions with vulnerable resources that do not offer merit-based aid but base their financial aid entirely on need and promise to deliver 100% of financial need (composed mostly of grants). These stated institutions refer to themselves as "need-aware" or "need-sensitive," policies that somewhat contradict their call to admit and provide education for all qualified candidates regardless of economic status but allow them to fully fund the needs of all accepted students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DXK/is_n13_v13/ai_18880702 | work=Black Issues in Higher Education | title=The shift away from need-blind: colleges have started their version of "wallet biopsies." - higher education institutions admit students on economic status criteria | first=Anita M. | last=Seline | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, at [[Macalester College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]] and [[Smith College]], at least 95% of students are admitted without their financial aid need being a factor (i.e., "need-blind"), but a slim percentage (1%&amp;ndash;5%), generally students wait-listed or with borderline qualifications, are reviewed in modest consideration of the college's projected financial resources. All of these aforementioned colleges grant all admitted students full financial aid packages meeting 100% need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://misc.vassar.edu/archives/2005/04/financial_aid_a.html The Miscellany News | Since 1866: Financial Aid at Vassar | Crunching the numbers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615163334/http://misc.vassar.edu/archives/2005/04/financial_aid_a.html |date=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Wesleyan University]], attempted shifts to a "need-aware" admission policy have resulted in protests by the school's student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1992 Need-Blind Occupation: A Look Back with Ben Foss ’95|url=http://wesleying.org/2012/05/11/the-1992-need-blind-occupation-a-look-back-with-ben-foss-95/|publisher=Wesleying|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Papua New Guinea University of Natural Resources and Environment''' (formerly known as the '''University of Vudal''') is a [[university]] located in [[East New Britain]] Province, [[Papua New Guinea]].

Research at the University addresses some of the problems faced by the agricultural, fisheries, forestry and tourism industries of Papua New Guinea.

==Brief History==

The University established in 1965 as Vudal Agricultural College (VAC), a male only college of the then Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries. The first female students were enrolled ten years later, in 1975. As such it can claim to be the oldest institution of tertiary education in PNG.

The college offered a two-year certificate and three year diploma training in Tropical Agriculture and made significant contributions to agricultural education and rural development in Papua New Guinea and neighbouring South Pacific countries.
In 1992, VAC was merged with [[Papua New Guinea University of Technology]]. Five years later, the college became University of Vudal, an autonomous higher education institution through an Act of Parliament that was passed in January 1997.

In 1999, under inaugural Vice Chancellor Professor Walter Wong, a four-year Bachelor of Tropical Agriculture degree programme was introduced and the certificate program was phased out.

In 2005, the University Council, under the chancellorship of former Prime Minister and present Governor of New Ireland, Sir [[Julius Chan]], unanimously directed that the University change its name and begin the process of internationalising from a one discipline University to a multi-disciplined one.

The name '''Papua New Guinea University of Natural Resources and Environment''' and logo was chosen from a public name and logo competition to promote a new training focus - ''training in the sound management and harvesting of natural renewable resources''. While council endorsed these changes then, the Name Change Bill was passed in Parliament four years later, on May 13, 2009.

Following the resignation of Sir Julius as chancellor in 2007, another former prime minister, Sir [[Rabbie Namaliu]], was endorsed by council as the university's third chancellor. Sir Rabbie, a distinguished statesman, served as chancellor until he resigned in January 2011. The university's first female chancellor, Margaret L. Elias, was appointed by council at the 50th Council meeting on September 30, 2011. The university's inaugural chancellor was the late Sir Alan Tololo. The current chancellor of UNRE is Professor Kenneth Sumbuk, who was appointed in October 2017.

The '''Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina''', whose full name in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is ''Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina "Santa María de los Buenos Aires"'', also known as ''Universidad Católica Argentina'' (UCA), is a university in [[Argentina]] with campuses in the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], [[Rosario]], [[Paraná, Entre Ríos|Paraná]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and [[Pergamino]]. The main campus is located in [[Puerto Madero]], one of the most modern neighborhoods of Buenos Aires.

It is considered, according to a 2011 study by the Spanish Ministry of Education, as one of the best private universities in [[Latin America]]. It is the second university preferred by Argentine employers and the sixth in all Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2011|title=QS University Rankings: Latin America|website=Topuniversities.com|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its predecessor, the Catholic University of Buenos Aires (1910–1922), was founded by the Argentine episcopate in 1910, but its degrees, in law, were not recognized by the Argentine government, and the institution was closed in 1922.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/universidad/la-universidad/nuestra-universidad/historia/ |title=Reseña Historica |publisher=UCA |accessdate=2011-02-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiRf46ds?url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/universidad/la-universidad/nuestra-universidad/historia/ |archivedate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Decree 6403 concerning the freedom of education enabled the creation of private universities with the authority to deliver academic qualifications. In 1956, the bishops decided to create the Catholic University of Argentina, formally founded on March 7, 1958.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;

Cardinal [[Jorge Mario Bergoglio]] was UCA's Grand Chancellor, by virtue of his office as Primate of Argentina and Metropolitan Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires]], the capital of Argentina, until his election in 2013 as Pope Francis to succeed Pope Emeritus [[Benedict XVI]]. When [[Mario Aurelio Poli]] was named Archbishop of Buenos Aires by Pope Francis later in 2013, he became Grand Chancellor of the University. In May 2013 Pope Francis named [[Victor Manuel Fernández]], the University's President (the second-highest administrative rank, after the Grand Chancellor), as titular archbishop of [[Tiburnia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130610121028/http://attualita.vatican.va/sala-stampa/bollettino/2013/05/13/news/30985.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
The part-time [[MBA]] program taught by the university has been accredited by the London-based [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA) since 1998.

==History==

===First foundation: the Catholic University of Buenos Aires===
[[File:UCBA.jpg|right|thumb|Foundational act, 1910|322x161px]]
Like Buenos Aires itself, the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina was founded twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/uca/la-universidad/historia/|title=La primera universidad católica - Santa María de los Buenos Aires - UCA Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina|website=Uca.edu.ar|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The foundation of a catholic university was first discussed in the Eucharistic Congress of 1884. At the time, the [[Argentine Law 1420]] of Common Education had dictated public compulsory, free and secular education in order to guarantee the separation of Church and State and prevent discrimination on the basis of religious adherence.

Eventually the idea lost its momentum, but in 1908 the first Congress of Catholic Youths underlined the importance of a well-rounded, integral education and promoted the foundation of a catholic university "in which students are trained to excel in liberal professions and are taught the core of catholic doctine". The Argentine Episcopate finally decided in favour of this initiative by founding the Catholic University of Buenos Aires in 1910. The bishops proceeded with the conception of this first university regardless of the poor legislation on private institutions of higher education that the country had at the time.

The Faculty of Law was its first and only one, and the curriculum was largely based on those of public universities plus compulsory courses on philosophy and history. The aforementioned lack of legislation conspired against the procurement of official accreditation and the Catholic University of Buenos Aires was forced to close its doors in 1922, little over a decade after being founded.

===Second foundation: the Catholic University of Argentina===
The Argentine Episcopate decided to found the university once again in its plenum in 1956 and two years later, the Catholic University of Argentina was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo3/files/revista-mundo-argentino-1959.pdf |format=PDF |title=Esta es la universidad catolica |website=Uca.edu.ar |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text="It was decided to proceed with the foundation of the UCA, adopting the necessary measures to precisely determine its character and structure [...] Therefore, our educational mission incorporates those academic fields that, being the heritage of mankind, intersect in the formation of man."|sign=UCA |source=''La Fundación de la UCA (1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/uca/la-universidad/historia/fundacion-de-la-uca/|title=La Fundación de la UCA (1958) - Santa María de los Buenos Aires - UCA Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina|website=Uca.edu.ar|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

Once the statutes of the institution were promulgated and approved, the university started receiving students to the original faculties:
* Faculty of Philosophy
* Faculty of Law and Political Science
* Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences

==Rankings and reputation==

UCA is widely considered to be one of the best institutions of higher education in Argentina. [[QS World University Rankings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2013#sorting=rank%20region=%20country=%20faculty=%20stars=false%20search=|title=QS Latin American University Rankings 2013|date=21 May 2013|website=Topuniversities.com|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; has ranked UCA 2nd overall and 1st among private institutions in Argentina in 2013.&lt;ref name="uca.edu.ar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/uca/la-universidad/cartelera/la-uca-mejor-universidad-privada-argentina-en-qs-latin-america|title=La UCA en el ranking QS Latinoamérica 2013 - Santa María de los Buenos Aires - UCA Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina|website=Uca.edu.ar|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is also ranked 2nd in terms of employer preference.&lt;ref name="uca.edu.ar"/&gt;

UCA is also labeld as a "Top Business School" with 4 out of 5 Palmes by EdUniversal. The French consulting company also ranked UCA's Business School 3rd in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121030080942/http://eduniversal-ranking.com/business-school-university-ranking-in-argentina/pontificia-universidad-catolica-argentina-uca-escuela-de-negocios.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

UCA's main campus is located in [[Puerto Madero]], the financial center of downtown Buenos Aires. It is just 500 meters (546 yards) away from [[Casa Rosada]] and 3 lines of the [[Buenos Aires Underground]] intersect less than 600 meters away.

'''Professional development''' is learning to earn or maintain professional [[credentials]] such as [[academic degrees]] to formal coursework, attending conferences, and [[informal learning]] opportunities situated in practice. It has been described as intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage.&lt;ref&gt;Speck, M. &amp; Knipe, C. (2005) ''Why can't we get it right? Designing high-quality professional development for standards-based schools''(2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press{{qn|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of approaches to professional development, including consultation, coaching, [[communities of practice]], lesson study, mentoring, reflective supervision and technical assistance.&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"&gt;National Professional Development Center on Inclusion. (2008). [http://fpg.unc.edu/node/4611 "What do we mean by professional development in the early childhood field?"]. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina, FPG Child Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[University of Management and Technology (United States)|University of Management and Technology]] notes the use of the phrase "professional development" from 1857 onwards.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the training of school staff in the United States, "[t]he need for professional development [...] came to the forefront in the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
A wide variety of people, such as teachers, military officers and non-commissioned officers, health care professionals, lawyers, accountants and engineers engage in professional development. Individuals may participate in professional development because of an interest in lifelong learning, a sense of moral obligation, to maintain and improve professional competence, to enhance career progression, to keep abreast of new technology and practices, or to comply with professional regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, L. &amp; Gray, I. (2006).''Continuing professional development for clinical psychologists:A practical handbook''. The British Psychological Society. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, M. (2006).''Professional development, reflection, and decision-making''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American states have professional development requirements for school teachers. For example, Arkansas teachers must complete 60 hours of documented professional development activities annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Development and Renewal of Standard Teaching License|url=http://www.arkansased.org/teachers/prof_dev_renewal.html|website=ArkansasEd.org|publisher=Arkansas Department of Education|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430155048/http://arkansased.org/teachers/prof_dev_renewal.html|archivedate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional development credits are named differently from state to state. For example, teachers: in Indiana are required to earn 90 Continuing Renewal Units (CRUs) per year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teacher-world.com/certification/indiana-renewal.html |title=Indiana Certification Renewal &amp;#124; Find Out How to Renew Indiana Teaching Certificates on |publisher=Teacher-world.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Massachusetts, teachers need 150 Professional Development Points (PDPs);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.mass.edu/recert/qa.html |title=Recertification Q and A - Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education |publisher=Doe.mass.edu |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Georgia, must earn 10 Professional Learning Units (PLUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachersprofessionallearningunits.com/ga-certification-resources.php |title=Georgia Teacher Certification Information - Georgia PLU's Resources Online - GA Teaching License Resources |publisher=Teachersprofessionallearningunits.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216171116/http://teachersprofessionallearningunits.com/ga-certification-resources.php |archivedate=2013-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American and Canadian nurses, as well as those in the United Kingdom, have to participate in formal and informal professional development (earning credit based on attendance of education that has been accredited by a regulatory agency) in order to maintain professional registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Competence|url=http://www.crnm.mb.ca/competence.php|website=College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531032351/http://www.crnm.mb.ca/competence.php|archivedate=31 May 2008|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Education|url=http://www.ndbon.org/education/continuing%20education/continuing%20education.shtml|website=North Dakota Board of Nursing|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190359/http://www.ndbon.org/education/continuing%20education/continuing%20education.shtml|archivedate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/ |title=The Nursing and Midwifery Council &amp;#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council |publisher=Nmc-uk.org |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional school==
A professional school is a graduate school level institution that prepares students for careers in specific fields. Some of the schools also offer undergraduate degrees in specific professions. Examples of this type of school include:
[[List of international architecture schools|Architecture school]], [[Business school]], [[Divinity school]], [[Engineering school]], [[Journalism school]], [[Law school]], [[Library school]], [[School of education|Education school]] ([[Normal school]]), [[Public policy school]] and [[Council on Social Work Education|Social work school]]. The field of healthcare has many professional schools including [[Medical school]], [[Chiropractic school]], [[Dental school]], [[Pharmacy school]], [[Physician Assistant|Physician Assistant school]], [[Physiotherapy|Physiotherapy school]], [[Podiatric medical school]], [[Public health#Schools of public health|Public health school]], [[Speech-Language Pathology]] School, [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapy school]], [[Nursing school]], [[Veterinary school]] and [[List of optometry schools|Optometry school]].

==Approaches==
In a broad sense, professional development may include ''formal'' types of vocational education, typically post-secondary or poly-technical training leading to qualification or credential required to obtain or retain employment. Professional development may also come in the form of pre-service or in-service professional development programs. These programs may be formal, or informal, group or individualized. Individuals may pursue professional development independently, or programs may be offered by human resource departments. Professional development on the job may develop or enhance process skills, sometimes referred to as leadership skills, as well as task skills. Some examples for process skills are 'effectiveness skills', 'team functioning skills', and 'systems thinking skills'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garet|first1=M. S.|last2=Porter|first2=A. C|last3=Desimone|first3=L.|last4=Birman|first4=B. F|last5=Yoon|first5=K. S.|title=What Makes Professional Development Effective? Results From a National Sample of Teachers|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1 January 2001|volume=38|issue=4|pages=915–945|doi=10.3102/00028312038004915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting Coaches to Corporates|url=https://twofold.asia/|website=twofold.asia|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional development opportunities can range from a single workshop to a semester-long academic course, to services offered by a medley of different professional development providers and varying widely with respect to the philosophy, content, and format of the learning experiences.  Some examples of approaches to professional development include:&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"/&gt;

*'''Case Study Method''' – The case method is a teaching approach that consists in presenting the students with a case, putting them in the role of a decision maker facing a problem {{Harv|Hammond|1976}} – See [[Case method]].
*'''Consultation''' – to assist an individual or group of individuals to clarify and address immediate concerns by following a systematic problem-solving process.
*'''Coaching''' – to enhance a person’s competencies in a specific skill area by providing a process of observation, reflection, and action.
*'''Communities of Practice''' – to improve professional practice by engaging in shared inquiry and learning with people who have a common goal
*'''Lesson Study''' – to solve practical dilemmas related to intervention or instruction through participation with other professionals in systematically examining practice
*'''Mentoring''' – to promote an individual's  awareness and refinement of his or her own professional development by providing and recommending structured opportunities for reflection and observation
*'''Reflective Supervision''' – to support, develop, and ultimately evaluate the performance of employees through a process of inquiry that encourages their understanding and articulation of the rationale for their own practices
*'''Technical Assistance''' – to assist individuals and their organization to improve by offering resources and information, supporting networking and change efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that professional development opportunities for those both in and out of work, such as flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs, enable labor markets to adjust to the future of work.

==Initial==
Initial professional development (IPD) is defined as "a period of development during which an individual acquires a level of [[Skill|competence]] necessary in order to operate as an autonomous professional".&lt;ref&gt;The UK Initial Professional Development (IPD) Forum http://www.littlerichley.eclipse.co.uk/ukipdforum/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professional associations]] may recognise the successful completion of IPD by the award of [[chartered (professional)|chartered]] or similar status. Examples of professional bodies that require IPD prior to the award of professional status are the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ima.org.uk/activities/professional/initial_professional_development_ipd.cfm.html |title=Initial Professional Development (IPD) |publisher=The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istructe.org/careers-and-development/professional-development/initial-professional-development |title=Initial Professional Development |publisher=The Institution of Structural Engineers |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-IPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About IPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing==
Continuing professional development (CPD) or continuing professional education (CPE) is [[continuing education]] to maintain knowledge and skills. Most [[profession]]s have CPD obligations. Examples are the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/uk/about-rics/what-we-do/continuing-professional-development/ |title=About RCIS: What we do: Continuing professional development (CPD) |publisher=[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Academy of Financial Management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialanalyst.org/ce.html|title=GAFM ®  Certified Financial Analyst Certification  Risk Certified Financial Planner Books GAFM ® -  AFA Accredited Financial Analyst ® Certification - AMA Accredited Management Accountant  ® - MMC Master Management Consultant ® Chartered Economist - Continuing Ed|website=www.financialanalyst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; safety professionals with the [[International Institute of Risk &amp; Safety Management]] (IIRSM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927010130/http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]] (IOSH),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-CPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About CPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and medical and legal professionals, who are subject to [[continuing medical education]] or [[continuing legal education]] requirements, which vary by jurisdiction.

'''''Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] designed by [[Sid Meier]]. The [[DOS]] version of the game was released as [[freeware]] for download in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2kgames.com/railroads/downloads.html Sid Meier's Railroads - Downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; The game is the first in the [[Railroad Tycoon (series)|Railroad Tycoon series]].

A port of the game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was planned for a 1994 release, and screenshots were shown in the March 1993 issue of [[Nintendo Power]]; however the port was never released.  Though no reason was officially given,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0830&lt;/ref&gt; it may have been due to the DOS release of ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'', and its planned release on the upcoming [[Playstation]] console.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/573902-transport-tycoon/data&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The objective of the game is to build and manage a railroad company by laying track, building stations, and buying and scheduling trains. The player acts a railway entrepreneur and may start companies in any of four geographic locales: the [[Western United States]], [[Northeast United States]], [[Great Britain]], or [[Europe|Continental Europe]]. The company starts with one million dollars in [[Capital (economics)|capital]], half [[Equity (finance)|equity]], half a [[loan]]. The company may raise additional capital through the sale of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].

The player acts as a railway entrepreneur who owns and manages the business as described above and may also handle individual train movement and build additional industries. The game models [[supply and demand]] of goods and passengers as well as a miniature [[stock market]] on which players can buy and sell stock of their own or competing companies. The game also has other railroad companies attempting to put the player out of business with stock dealings and "Rate Wars".

There are four types of stations:  Signal Tower, Depot, Station, and Terminal.  The Signal Tower acts as a passing loop and may control movements.  The rest service surrounding areas:  the Depot serves its own square and the adjoining eight squares, the Station takes another ring, and the Terminal handles up to three squares away.  The player can build at most 32 stations.  When the player builds the first station they also build their first engine shop. Each engine shop is the manufacturing area for the player's different trains. The player can upgrade and downgrade Depots, Stations, and Terminals. Other facilities such as stores and hotels may be added.

Once the player builds a station they can build their first train (of the 32 permitted) at any engine shop. The player then can add cars to the train and send it on its way. The player can at any time change the "consist", which is the list of cars the train is to pick up at the various stations along the way. These include pure mail and passenger cars and specialized freight cars for each of the other nine types of commodity produced in the game.

The player can continue to build the track network and build stations until the player runs out of funds. The game runs for a century (1830 - 1930 and 1866 - 1966 in America and 1900 - 2000 in Europe), with accounting periods two years long. Stations built or rebuilt in a particular accounting period pay the player double freight rates for everything they purchase in that period.

Not every station buys everything offered to it. Some good producers buy nothing. There are two alternatives the player can choose between: Simple Economy (where, for example, a station serving two or more cities will buy anything) and Complex Economy (where "two cities" will buy mail, passengers, and a couple of other products; "four villages" will buy passengers and different freight products; only a station with a steel mill will buy coal; and other products have other buyer types). There are product variations over the four geographical scenarios.

By 2015, Japanese robotics maker Yaskawa Electric Co. has been distributing ReWalk in Asia, i.e. China, under a deal signed in 2014 with ReWalk Robotics.

==Criticisms==
The weight and bulk of the ReWalk exoskeleton is considered to be too much for some users by its creator, Amit Goffer.&lt;ref name=TransformEur&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/design-engineering-features/technology/bionic-exoskeleton-could-transform-lives-of-paraplegics/45464/|title=Bionic exoskeleton could transform the lives of paraplegics|work=Eureka Magazine|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with a price of between US$69,500&lt;ref name=mashable /&gt; to US$85,000,&lt;ref name=Technabob /&gt; the system is beyond the reach of many poorer patients, especially because, as of July 2014, [[health insurance]] in the United States does not yet cover the ReWalk.&lt;ref name=mashable /&gt; Larry Jasinki, the CEO of ReWalk, stated in 2014 that the company is "working with insurers and other health-care coverage providers to ensure individuals eligible to use the ReWalk are able to purchase a system".&lt;ref name=mashable /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3437">The '''Republic of Korea public service examinations''' are examinations held to screen applicants to the [[South Korea]]n Civil Service, South Korean Foreign Service and South Korean Legal Service. The examinations were open to all Republic of Korea citizens, and the applicant need not be the holder of a degree or have any other experience; passing the exams were in themselves sufficient for recruitment; however the exams were notoriously hard.

== Background ==
Korea has a long history of selecting by public examination, in pre Republic times by the [[Gwageo]] examinations, to choose those most able to fill the ranks of public office. 

The Korean civil service exams are used to select applicants for the Korean Civil Service at the ninth (new entry) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202299.html |title=Jobseekers drawn to civil servant exams |last1=Kim |first1=Bo-eun |date=10 April 2016 |website=The Korea Times |access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following recruitment, promotion is based primarily on seniority, except for a number of direct entry recruitments at the seventh and fifth level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/gov/other.html|title=The Korean Civil Service System|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt;|date= |website=AsianInfo.org |publisher= |access-date=14 May 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the passing of the seventh and fifth level examinations ([[:ko:고등고시|고등고시]]). For those passing the exam and entering the service at the fifth level, this is equivalent to 25 years of seniority working from the bottom up.&lt;ref name="Global Voices"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/23/south-korea-civil-service-exams-removed-years-of-studies-wasted/ |title=South Korea: Civil Service Exams Removed, Years of studies Wasted|last1=Lee |first1=Yoo Eun |last2= |first2= |date=23 August 2010|website=[[Global Voices Online]]|publisher= |access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar exams existed for the legal profession, called the [[bar examination]] (the [[Law schools in South Korea|Korean system]] differed significantly from those in other jurisdictions in that passing the exam was in itself was sufficient to enter the profession and one need not have attended a law school and received a law degree) and for the Korean [[Diplomatic service|foreign service]].

Because of the rewards possible to those passing the exams, specialist cramming schools and lodgings have developed to help applicants prepare for the exams. In 2013, there were 204,698 applicants, up from 137,649 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2983750 |title=Civil service sees rise in applicants |date=20 January 2014 |website=Korea JoongAng Daily |access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exams act as a final hope for those who had not gained entry to a top university, or whose background has not allowed them to pursue the extracurricular activities now demanded by employers in South Korea. The exams are seen as promoting social mobility as recruitment depended on success in the examinations regardless of educational and family background.

Established in 1959, the '''Sacramento Waldorf School''' is an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] offering programs from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. It is fully accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] and the [[Waldorf schools|Association of Waldorf Schools of North America]].  

Sacramento Waldorf School is the largest Waldorf school in North America.  The campus, which includes a stream and small working farm, is located on {{convert|22|acre|m2}} in [[Fair Oaks, California]], overlooking the [[American River]].

==History==
The founding school started in 1959 with just a few kindergarten classrooms in a [[Carmichael, California|Carmichael]] home.  With enrollment growing, the school moved to a rented church hall, and on to its present site in Fair Oaks a few years later. By the mid-1980s the campus had had grown to accommodate approximately 350 students in grades kindergarten through 12, and included a working farm, library and several rustic buildings, including a former bunkhouse, now the Meristem building, which was lifted from its original foundations in [[Citrus Heights, California|Citrus Heights]] and moved to the Fair Oaks campus.

In 1985 the school completed construction on a geodesic dome building to house administrative offices and new, larger library.  Just two days before the start of the new school year, the dome and most of the school's recently installed library collection were destroyed in an arson fire.  With classes scheduled to resume in just a few days, the school received an outpouring of support from the neighboring community and other schools, including offers from the local [[San Juan Unified School District]] to help the school resupply books lost in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;"Suspicious fire ravages school's library, offices", ''Sacramento Bee'', Sep 1, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Arson suspected at Waldorf School", ''The Sacramento Union'', Sep 1 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  Within eight months of the loss, then estimated to value $350,000, construction was underway on a new $1.4 million administration building and library.&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Starkey, "School rebounds from August blaze", ''The Sacramento Union'', Apr 5 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Building a Future", ''The Sacramento Union'', Nov 21, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1997 the school finished construction on Linden Hall, providing its first gymnasium, music and performing arts center, and movement room as well as several additional classrooms.  The school also added new classes for preschool aged children.  In 2006 the enrollment was 440, and new construction began on special purpose designed buildings with modern science and computer laboratories for the teaching of high school biology, chemistry, physics, computers and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Chelsea Phua, ''[http://www.sacbee.com/citrus/story/148800.html Waldorf school builds on science]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', '''Sacramento Bee'''- April 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
The curriculum for the school follows a fairly typical [[Waldorf education]] academic program as well as including music, handwork, drama, and visual arts from kindergarten up through high school.

==Extra curricular activities==
The high school plays various sports as part of the [[California Interscholastic Federation|CIF]] Division V Central Valley California League.  These include boys and girls soccer and basketball,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/02/10/3391353/waldorf-basketball-phenom-schwartz.html Waldorf Basketball Phenom Schwartz-Edmisten Pumps out Points] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213050405/http://www.sacbee.com/2011/02/10/3391353/waldorf-basketball-phenom-schwartz.html|date=2011-02-13|title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; boys baseball, and girls volleyball.

The '''Mobile Ad hoc Networking Interoperability And Cooperation (MANIAC) Challenge'''  is a multi-institution team competition with participants forming a real-world mobile ad hoc network. The objective of the competition is to observe the trade-offs experienced by teams in focusing towards delivery of their own packets versus cooperating in forwarding other teams' packets, essential in a [[mobile ad hoc network]] (MANET) to permit delivery across the network, at the expense of consuming their limited resources (battery life, bandwidth).

The competition was held on two days, 25–26 November 2007 along with [[IEEE]] [[GLOBECOM]] in Washington,DC.

==Winners==

===Strategy Award===

*Ivan Klimek and Vladimir Sidimak

'''WASSAIL''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] software platform for [[educational assessment]], designed primarily for academic libraries. It is used to “systematically track, store and analyze assessment data to measure and improve student learning.”&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. “Goebel and Anderson win 2010 ACRL IS Innovation Award.” ALA: 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 2003 the software has been adopted by dozens of academic libraries, including those at the Miami University, the University of Kansas, Red Deer College, and Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. The name is an acronym for “Web-based Augustana Student Survey Assessment of Information Literacy,” reflecting its origins and ongoing development at the [[Augustana University College|Augustana Faculty]] of the [[University of Alberta]]. 

WASSAIL 3.0 is a database-driven, web-based application employing [[PHP]], [[MySQL]], [[JavaScript]] and [[AJAX]]. WASSAIL facilitates the development and storage of question banks; the generation of online (or paper) surveys and tests from those question banks; and the accumulation and storage of question responses. Its most powerful feature is the ability to create and generate reports. These reports typically measure the impact of [[information literacy]] instruction on student learning and on specific [[demographics]] (discipline, year, gender, etc.). 

==Recognition==
WASSAIL’s developers were awarded the 2010 Instruction Section Innovation Award from the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]].

The '''Waikato Institute of Technology''', also known as '''Wintec''', is one of New Zealand's leading institute of technology based in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]. Approximately 20,000 students from 52 countries study at Wintec each year, and the organisation employs around 840 staff. The institute currently provides 10 degree programmes, 35 diplomas and 12 postgraduate qualifications.

The institute has three main campuses in Hamilton itself: the main city site,  Rotokauri (formerly Avalon) in north Hamilton, and the [[Hamilton Gardens]] horticultural campus. The institute also uses three additional campuses in the [[Waikato region]].

Wintec offers training in engineering, trades, science, technology, agriculture, sport, health and social services, education, business and manufacturing, tourism, hospitality, events, English language, media and the creative industries. The qualifications range from certificates and diplomas to degrees and post-graduate degrees. Wintec works closely with employers, industry and community organisations to develop programmes that reflect real-world standards and produce work-ready graduates.

The current institution stems from ''The Waikato Polytechnic'', previously the ''Waikato Technical Institute'', and further back to the ''Hamilton Technical College'' founded in 1924 to provide technical and trades training. The "Wintec" branding was adopted in 2003.

Wintec offers student accommodation on both the City and Rotokauri campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wintec.ac.nz/student-resources/accommodation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.wintec.ac.nz/about/index.aspx|website=wintec.ac.nz|publisher=Waikato Institute of Technology|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.wintec.ac.nz/about/who/Pages/history.aspx|website=wintec.ac.nz|publisher=Waikato Institute of Technology|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apartments|url=http://www.wintec.ac.nz/newsevents/Pages/Spaces-up-for-grabs-in-Wintec-student-accommodation.aspx|website=wintec.ac.nz|publisher=Waikato Institute of Technology|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As detailed from Wintec's website, some context of the growth of the campus from the previous technical college, Polytech, to the rebranded technical institute it is today.

'''Timeline'''
*'''1924''' Hamilton Technical College is founded to provide technical and trades training in the Waikato region. First building is erected on the corner of Anglesea and Nisbet Streets (this now historic building, well known as the face of Wintec, is currently being renovated).
*'''1950s''' The demand for skilled tradespeople after the Second World War leads to a surge in growth in the 1950s.
*'''1968''' Becomes known as the Waikato Technical Institute - a provider of vocational training for farming, industry and commerce. The institute offers a wide range of programmes in engineering, science, accountancy, business management, secretarial, carpentry and building trades, including Māori pre-trade apprentices.
*'''1983''' Student residence is opened to provide students with accommodation close to the campus.
*'''1985''' Horticulture teaching begins at Hamilton Gardens.
*'''1986''' Tainui Trust Board representation on Waikato Technical Institute Council.
*'''1987''' Name changes to The Waikato Polytechnic to reflect the widening in the scope of its educational activities.
*'''1990s''' Following Government tertiary reforms, the institute becomes a body corporate with a Chief Executive and Council. A range of degrees in nursing, midwifery, business, sport and exercise science, information technology and media arts are developed in response to changing employment needs. The strong practical aspect of these degrees supports the successful, long-standing trades and technology reputation of the institute.
*'''1990''' Satellite campuses opened in Te Kuiti and Thames.
*'''1991''' [[Whare]] built and named Te Kākano ā te Kāahu - the seed embraced/nurtured by the indigenous hawk or cloak (or korowai). The seed represents students and the hawk refers to the [[Te Atairangikaahu|Late Māori Queen]] or a [[Māori traditional textiles#Korowai|korowai]] which provides the nurturing and development of the seed.
*'''1991''' Childcare centre opens to provide students with affordable convenient childcare on campus.
*'''1992''' First degree (Bachelor of Business) is offered.
*'''1994''' Innovative Artechmobile is built and hits the road to provide mobile computer education to regional communities.
*'''1995''' Land is purchased on Avalon Drive to establish a campus with ample space for trades, sports and hospitality training.
*'''2000''' First postgraduate qualification is offered (Postgraduate Diploma Nursing).
*'''2001''' Name changed to the Waikato Institute of Technology and two years later, the modern Wintec brand is adopted.
*'''2003''' Wintec opens office in [[Beijing]].
*'''2007''' Award-winning Gallagher Hub is opened as a student study and recreation space.
*'''2009''' Wintec wins three national tertiary education awards for its global role (particularly its partnerships in China), innovative support services (for its creative industries business incubator SODA Inc.) and relevant learning (for its employer partnership groups).

'''Winifred "Tim" Alice Asprey''' (April 8, 1917 – October 19, 2007) was an American [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]].  She was one of only around 200 women to earn PhDs in mathematics from American universities during the 1940s, a period of women's underrepresentation in mathematics at this level.&lt;ref name=murray&gt;

==Education and work== 
Asprey attended [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York (state)|New York]], where she earned her undergraduate degree in 1938. As a student there, Asprey met [[Grace Hopper]], the "First Lady of Computing," who taught mathematics at the time. After graduating, Asprey taught at several private schools in [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]] before going on to earn her MS and PhD degrees from the [[University of Iowa]] in 1942 and 1945, respectively.&lt;ref name=college_relations/&gt; Her doctoral advisor was the [[topology|topologist]] Edward Wilson Chittenden.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=43039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asprey returned to Vassar College as a professor. By then, Grace Hopper had moved to [[Philadelphia]] to work on [[UNIVAC|UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer)]] project. Asprey became interested in computing and visited Hopper to learn about the foundations of [[computer architecture]].&lt;ref name=college_relations/&gt; Asprey believed that computers would be an essential part of a liberal arts education.

At Vassar, Asprey taught mathematics and computer science for 38 years and was the chair of the mathematics department from 1957 until her retirement in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;

She created the first Computer Science Department at Vassar, the first course being taught in 1963, and secured funds for the college's first computer, making Vassar the second college in the nation to acquire an [[IBM System/360]] computer in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Zia Fariduddin Dagar''' (15 June 1932 – 8 May 2013) was an [[India]]n [[Indian classical music|classical]] vocalist belonging to the [[Dhrupad]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;tradition, the oldest existing form of [[North India|north]] [[Indian classical music]] ([[Hindustani classical music]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2005/02/20/stories/2005022000070500.htm|title= Nuances of the notes: Ustad Fariduddin Dagar..|date=20 February 2005|publisher=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?215920|title=Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar: One of Dhrupad’s oldest living exponents..|date=3 June 2002|publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the Dagar family of musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoga-ayurveda.org/yoga-ayurveda_dhrupad_dagar-vani.htm Dagar Family tree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107083431/http://www.yoga-ayurveda.org/yoga-ayurveda_dhrupad_dagar-vani.htm |date=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/1832598/report-dhrupad-maestro-ustad-zia-fariduddin-dagar-dies|title=Dhrupad maestro Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar dies|last=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=9 May 2013|publisher=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He taught at the [[Dhrupad Kendra Bhopal|Dhrupad Kendra in Bhopal]] with his elder brother [[Zia Mohiuddin Dagar]]. He also taught as a visiting professor up to the time of the [[Demolition of the Babri Masjid#Communal_violence|Babri mosque riots]]. After the riots, he decided to live at the gurukul of his brother Zia Mohiuddin Dagar at Palaspe near Panvel.&lt;ref name=pla/&gt;

He was awarded the 1994 [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]] in [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award#Vocal|Hindustani music-Vocal]] by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm|title=SNA: List of Akademi Awardees|publisher=Official website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217185616/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm|archivedate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and training==
He was born in [[Udaipur]], Rajasthan, where his father, the great Ustad Ziauddin Khansahib, was the court musician for Maharana Bhupal Singh of Udaipur. He was taught [[Dhrupad]] vocal and veena by his father. After his father’s demise, he continued learning under his elder brother, Late Ustad [[Z M Dagar]].&lt;ref name=pla&gt;[http://www.planetradiocity.com/musicopedia/music_newupdatearticle.php?conid=2209 Biography] musicopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{moresources|section|date=February 2018}}
He has performed widely in India and abroad, and received the Tansen Samman from the [[Madhya Pradesh]] government and the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]]. In 2005, he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the North American Dhrupad Association. 

By 1980, he had virtually settled down in Austria where he taught at the conservatory of Innsbruck  teaching Dhrupad in Austria and France (mainly Paris). Once, during a visit to India, one of his disciples, the filmmaker, [[Mani Kaul]] came to him and pleaded with him to provide the background score for a film, ''[[The Cloud Door]]'' (1994) &lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0196720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/person/713770/Ustad-Zia-Fariduddin-Dagar Zia Mohiuddin Dagar] [[New York Times]].&lt;/ref&gt; he was making on [[Madhya Pradesh]]. 

During the making of the film, they spent over two months in Madhya Pradesh, a lot of time in Bhopal. In those days, Shri [[Arjun Singh]] was the [[Chief Minister]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Cultural development was one of his passions. It is because of him that the magnificent [[Bharat Bhavan]] cultural center came up in [[Bhopal]]. 

At that time, the Secretary to the Department of Culture in Madhya Pradesh was Ashok Vajpayee. Vajpayee offered to start a government supported school for Dhrupad in Bhopal. Zia Fariduddin agreed to move back to India and to take charge as the teacher at this school. He taught dhrupad for 25 years at this Dhrupad Kendra, under the Ustad Allauddin Khan Music Academy, Bhopal, to students like the [[Gundecha Brothers]] and [[Uday Bhawalkar]].&lt;ref name=pla/&gt;

He was a distinguished guest faculty at 'Dhrupad Sansar', [[IIT Bombay]] for a span of 5 years. Dhrupad Sansar was started under the Cell for Human Values to create an appreciation about Indian Classical Arts and Culture among staff and students of the institution.

He was staying and teaching at the Dhrupad Gurukul near [[Panvel]], which was built by his elder brother Ustad [[Zia Mohiuddin Dagar]] and continued to perform in India and abroad until his brief illness and death on 8 May 2013.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}
