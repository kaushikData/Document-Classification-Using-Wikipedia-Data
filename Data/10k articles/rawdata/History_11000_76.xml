'''Alice Cunningham Fletcher''' (March 15, 1838 in [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]]{{snd}}April 6, 1923 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) was an American [[ethnologist]], [[anthropologist]], and [[social scientist]] who studied and documented [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] culture.

== Biography ==
Not much is known about Fletcher's parents; her father was a New York lawyer and her mother was from a prominent Boston family. Her parents moved to Havana, Cuba in vain hopes of easing her father's illness with a better climate.  Fletcher was born there in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwencyclopedia.com/topic/Alice_Cunningham_Fletcher.aspx|title=Encyclopedia.com|website=Alice Cunningham Fletcher facts, information and pictures|accessdate=6 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After her father died in 1839, the family moved to Brooklyn Heights, Fletcher was enrolled in the  Brooklyn Female Academy, an exclusive school for the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Cunningham Fletcher|url=http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2015/05/alice-cunningham-fletcher.html|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher taught school and later became a public lecturer to support herself, arguing that anthropologists and archaeologists were best at uncovering ancient history of humans.  She also advocated for the education of Native Americans "so that they could gain accoutrements of civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camping With the Sioux:Foreword|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/exhibits/fletche/forward.htm|accessdate=6 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher credited [[Frederic Ward Putnam]] for stimulating her interest in American Indian culture and began working with him at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]], [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="DAB"&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Fletcher, Alice Cunningham|volume=III, Part 2|pages=463–4|origyear=1931|year=1959|author=Frederick H. Martens}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She studied the remnants of the Indian civilization in the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi river|Mississippi valleys]], and became a member of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] in 1879.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Fletcher, Alice Cunningham|volume=10|page=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1881, Fletcher was involved with the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, where native children learned English, arithmetic, and skills designed to allow them to be integrated American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camping With the Sioux:Forward|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/exhibits/fletche/forward.htm|accessdate=6 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, Fletcher made an unprecedented trip to live with and study the [[Sioux]] on their reservation as a representative of the Peabody Museum.&lt;ref name="Camp"&gt;[http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/fletcher/ Camping With the Sioux: Fieldwork Diary of Alice Cunningham Fletcher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806103057/http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/fletcher/ |date=2011-08-06 }}, National Museum of Natural History, Archives of the Smithsonian Institution, accessed 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  She was accompanied by [[Susette La Flesche Tibbles|Susette "Bright Eyes" La Flesche]], an Omaha spokeswoman who had served as interpreter for [[Standing Bear]] in 1879 in his landmark civil rights trial.&lt;ref name="Camp" /&gt; Also with them was [[Thomas Tibbles]], a journalist who had helped publicize Standing Bear's cause and arranged a several-month lecture tour in the United States.&lt;ref name="Camp" /&gt;

These times also marked the beginning of Fletcher's 40-year association with [[Francis La Flesche]], Susette's half brother. They collaborated professionally and had an informal mother-son relationship. They shared a house in [[Washington, D.C.]], beginning in 1890.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;{{Cite ANB|title=Fletcher, Alice Cunningham|author=Joan Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alice Cunningham Fletcher at her Writing Desk.tif|right|thumb|Alice Fletcher at her writing desk]]
In addition to her research and writing, Fletcher worked in several special appointed positions during the late nineteenth century. In 1883 she was appointed special agent by the US to allot lands to the ''[[Miwok]]'' tribes, in 1884 she prepared and sent to the [[World Cotton Centennial]] an exhibit showing the progress of civilization among the Indians of North America in the quarter-century previous, and in 1886 visited the [[Alaska Native|natives of Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands]] on a mission from the commissioner of education.  In 1887 she was appointed United States special agent in the allotment of lands among the [[Winnebago (tribe)|Winnebago]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] under the [[Dawes Act]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

She was made assistant in ethnology at the Peabody Museum in 1882, and in 1891 received the Thaw fellowship, which was created for her.&lt;ref name="DAB" /&gt; Active in professional societies, she was elected president of the [[Anthropological Society of Washington]] and in 1905 as the first woman president of the [[American Folklore Society]].  She also served as vice-president of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; and was a longtime member of the [[Literary Society of Washington]].

Working through the [[Women's National Indian Association]], Fletcher introduced a system of making small loans to Indians, wherewith they might buy land and houses.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; She also helped secure a loan for [[Susan LaFlesche Picotte|Susan LaFlesche]], an Omaha woman, to enable her studies at medical school. Graduating at the top of her class, LaFlesche became the first Native American woman doctor in the United States.

Later Fletcher helped write, lobbied for and helped administer the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887, which broke up reservations and distributed communal land in allotments for individual household ownership of land parcels.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt;

}}
In 1888 Fletcher published ''Indian Education and Civilization'', a special report of the [[Bureau of Education]]. She was a pioneer in the study of American Indian music, a field of research inaugurated by a paper she gave in 1893 before the Chicago Anthropological Conference.&lt;ref name="DAB" /&gt; In 1898 at the [[Indian Congress|Congress of Musicians]] held in [[Omaha]] during the [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition]], she read several essays upon the songs of the North American Indians. A number of Omaha Indians sang their native melodies. Out of this grew her ''Indian Story and Song from North America'' (1900), exploring a stage of development antecedent to that in which culture music appeared.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Fletcher worked with [[Frederic Ward Putnam]] in his research on [[Serpent Mound|Serpents Mound]] in Ohio and assisted in the efforts to raise funds to purchase the site in 1886.  The site was donated to the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society in 1900 and is a National Historic Landmark.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alice_Cunningham_Fletcher.aspx|title=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, [[Margaret Mead]] started work  with the Omaha, and decided to concentrate on the modern aspects of the tribe, because of the extensive work already done by Alice Fletcher.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"/&gt;

Over her lifetime Alice Fletcher worked with and for the Omaha, [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], Sioux, [[Arapaho]], [[Cheyenne]], Chippewa, Oto, [[Nez Perce people|Nez Percé]], [[Ponca Tribe of Nebraska|Ponca]] and [[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska|Winnebago]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/items/ihas.200196222|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dawes Act ==
Alice Fletcher helped write and pass the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887. This act imposed a system of private land ownership on Indigenous tribes. This was a big difference because traditionally these tribes had communal land ownership. Individual Indigenous peoples would be allotted up to 160 acres of land.&lt;ref name="Alice Cunningham Fletcher"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacLean|first1=Maggie|title=Alice Cunningham Fletcher|url=http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2015/05/alice-cunningham-fletcher.html|website=History of American Women|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This land was tax-free and was to be held in trust by the government for a period of 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lurie|first1=Nancy|title=Alice Cunningham Fletcher|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alice_Cunningham_Fletcher.aspx|website=Encyclopedia|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, she thought it would enable American Indians to assimilate to European-American ways, as their best means of survival. The government also wanted to gain "surplus" land for sale to other Americans. The [[Dawes Act]] was accountable for the inevitable breakup of all Indigenous reservations. By 1932 the amount of land acquired was approximately 92,000,000 of the 138,000,000 acres Indigenous groups had owned in 1887.&lt;ref name="Alice Cunningham Fletcher"/&gt; Fletcher's land allotment work has been viewed as an error in the administration policies of Native American peoples and their land. Fletcher herself may have even realized this error because she abandoned her political policy work to focus strictly on more ethnographical work after the turn of the century.&lt;ref name="anthropology.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Life of Science and Public Service|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/exhibits/fletcher/foreword.htm|website=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fieldwork Among the Sioux==
Fletcher wrote about the experiences of her 1881 field trip in two journals. These journals included drawings of the plains, reservations, and many of her different campsites throughout eastern [[Nebraska]] and [[South Dakota]]. Even though many of her writings regarding the [[Sioux]] would seem rather insensible by contemporary anthropological standards, "Her writings reflect the attitudes regarding the movement of history and social evolution prevalent in her day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camping With the Sioux|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/exhibits/fletcher/foreword.htm|website=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary and Scientific Works ==
In 1911, with [[Francis La Flesche]], she published ''The Omaha Tribe''. It is still considered to be the definitive work on the subject. Altogether she wrote 46 monographs on ethnology.&lt;ref name="DAB" /&gt; In 1908 she led in founding the [[School for Advanced Research|School of American Archaeology]] in Santa Fe, New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Cunningham Fletcher|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Alice-Cunningham-Fletcher|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899 until 1916 Fletcher was on the editorial board of the American Anthropologist, and she also made major contributions to many issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britannica.com|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/alice-cunningham-fletcher|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher was a pioneer in the study of Native American music. She became fascinated by their music and dancing so she transcribed hundreds of their songs. In 1898 she presented several essays on the subject of Native American songs at the Congress of Musicians in [[Omaha]]. From these essays eventually came her books "Indian Story and Song from North America" and "The Hako: A Pawnee Ceremony".&lt;ref name="Alice Cunningham Fletcher"/&gt;

== Legacy==
Alice Fletcher received numerous honours for the work she accomplished throughout her career. In 1890 she was awarded the [[Margaret Copley Thaw]] Fellowship at Harvard, which granted her funding for ethnographic and reform work.&lt;ref&gt;Mark,
 ''A Stranger in Her Native Land'', 6 [https://books.google.com/books?id=883iFbaTFkUC&amp;pg=PA427&amp;lpg=PA427&amp;dq=margaret+copley+thaw+fellowship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nYhLKV8e13&amp;sig=29LEtuTS63fSH9rqBhYu7nzAYcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG4ZGkua7SAhWpqFQKHej_AywQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=margaret%20copley%20thaw%20fellowship&amp;f=false Link].&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher also became President of the [[Anthropological Society of Washington]] in 1903 and the first woman President of the [[American Folklore Society]] in 1905. One of her colleagues, Walter Hough, remembered Fletcher as one who, "Mildly, peaceably, yet with great fortitude...did what she could to advance the cause of science".&lt;ref name="anthropology.si.edu"/&gt; Her ashes are interned in the patio wall of the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]] behind a bronze plaque with a quote from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chauvenet|first1=Beatrice|title=Hewett and Friends : A Biography of Santa Fe's Vibrant Era|date=1983|publisher=Museum of New Mexico Press|location=Santa Fe, New Mexico|isbn=0890131368|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Shenandoah Shakespeare EXPRESS ===
The American Shakespeare Center was founded as the '''Shenandoah Shakespeare EXPRESS''' in 1988 by Dr. [[Ralph Alan Cohen]] and Jim Warren.&lt;ref name=ASC-History&gt;{{cite web|title=ASC - History |url=http://www.americanshakespearecenter.com/v.php?pg=50 |work=[[American Shakespeare Theatre]] |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531204805/http://www.americanshakespearecenter.com/v.php?pg=50 |archivedate=31 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first show performed by the newly organized company was ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]],'' where actors who made up the locally travelling ensemble troupe came from [[James Madison University]]'s current students and graduates, and the performance was two hours long (compared to a more typical three hour plus run time).&lt;ref name=StauntonNewsLeader-SSE-RIII-1988&gt;{{cite news|title=On the Road with William Shakespeare |url=http://www.americanshakespearecenter.com/images/88_r3_i_Page_3.jpg |accessdate=4 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Staunton News Leader]] |date=14 December 1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092549/http://www.americanshakespearecenter.com/images/88_r3_i_Page_3.jpg |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the company started performing multiple shows in rotating repertory with a season of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]].''&lt;ref name=ASC-History /&gt;&lt;ref name=SEC-SSE-1992&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Hardy M.|title=The Shenandoah Shakespeare EXPRESS at the FolgerCURRENT|url=http://shaksper.net/archive/1992/73-july/657-shenandoah-shakespeare-express-at-the-folgercurrent|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=Shakespeare Electronic Conference|volume=3|number=157|date=1 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shenandoah Shakespeare Express grew quickly during its first five years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gowen|first=Anne|title=Shakespeare Express speeds to success|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=10 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving from a single touring show in Virginia in 1988 to a three-show tour in 1992 that included the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in Washington, D.C., and an overseas leg in London and Edinburgh. Three years later, the company toured the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, and Scotland as well as starting to build the Education arm of the company with a six-week [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] institute.

In 1997, the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express introduced the Young Company Theatre Camp, a three-week intensive summer program for high school students.

=== Shenandoah Shakespeare ===
Shenandoah Shakespeare Express changed its name to '''Shenandoah Shakespeare''' in 1999 and moved to [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia]].

In September 2001, the Blackfriars Playhouse – the world's first re-creation of Shakespeare's indoor theatre – opened in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/21/travel/travel-advisory-a-virginia-theater-true-to-shakespeare.html|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|title=A Virginia Theater true to Shakespeare|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francisco|first=Dr. Virginia|title=Here's the scoop on our new theatre|newspaper=[[Staunton News Leader]]|date=11 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASC Education hosted its first Blackfriars Conference.

In 2014, another replica of the Blackfriars theatre, called the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]], was opened in London.

=== American Shakespeare Center ===
In 2005, Shenandoah Shakespeare changed its name to the '''American Shakespeare Center''' to reflect its focus on being a center for performance and research. Also in 2005, the first Actors' Renaissance Season debuted. The Actors' Renaissance Season uses Shakespeare's rehearsal conditions (self-directed, self-designed, short rehearsal period) as well as his staging conditions to delve deeper into the plays. The Actors' Renaissance Season is also an opportunity to explore rarer titles of the early modern period.&lt;ref name=AmTheatre-Feature-2006 /&gt;

In 2005, the [[Bob Carlton]] musical, ''[[Return to the Forbidden Planet]],'' which was loosely based on Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' and the [[science-fiction]] classic movie from the late 1950s, ''[[Forbidden Planet (film)|Forbidden Planet]],'' was produced by the touring company, then called the Blackfriars Stage Company. The performances incorporated acoustic music, a piano, and a three-sided [[thrust stage]], all of which were selected to maximize audience engagement.&lt;ref name=StageDirections-ShakesRocks-2005 /&gt;

The American Shakespeare Center celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 2013.

=== Shakespeare's New Contemporaries ===
In April 2017, the American Shakespeare Center launched an international playwrighting competition to develop a canon of new plays that are inspired by and in conversation with the work of William Shakespeare. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/theater/american-shakespeare-center-to-commission-38-modern-riffs.html|title=Theater to Commission 38 Modern Riffs on Shakespeare|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|date=2017-04-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2017/04/21/american-shakespeare-center-launches-playwriting-competition/|title=American Shakespeare Center Launches Playwriting Competition|date=2017-04-21|work=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each new play will be performed in rotating repertory with the Shakespeare play it corresponds with.  The first round of submissions are for ''The Merry Wives of Windsor''; ''Henry IV, Part 1''; ''The Comedy of Errors''; and ''The Winter's Tale''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sncproject.com/submit.html|title=Submit|website=Shakespeare's New Contemporaries|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Staunton, Virginia (6262010365).jpg|thumb|upright|The Blackfriars Playhouse]]
In Staunton, the ASC constructed the '''Blackfriars Playhouse,''' the first modern re-creation of Shakespeare's original indoor theatre, the [[Blackfriars Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Blackfriars&gt;{{Citation|title=Blackfriars Playhouse |publisher=American Shakespeare Center |url=http://www.americanshakespearecenter.com/v.php?pg=124 |accessdate=20 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703053753/http://www.americanshakespearecenter.com/v.php?pg=124 |archivedate=3 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As no reliable plans of that theatre are known,&lt;ref name=Skinner&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakespearetown |last=Skinner |first=David |url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/novemberdecember/feature/shakespearetown |newspaper=Humanities |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |date=November 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; architect Tom McLaughlin based the design on plans for other 17th-century theatres, his own trips to England to view surviving halls of the period, Shakespeare's stage directions and other research and consultation.&lt;ref name=Lebovich&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackfriars Shakespearean Playhouse |last=Lebovich |first=William |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/1114/news_2-1.html |newspaper=[[Architecture Week]] |date=14 November 2001 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chosen dimensions of {{convert|50|ft}} by {{convert|70|ft}} were derived from the research of theatre historian Irwin Smith.&lt;ref name=ThirdBlackfriars-2005&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theater of Teaching and the Lessons of Theater |editor1-last=Radulescu |editor1-first=Domnica |editor2-last=Stadter Fox | editor2-first=Maria | chapter=Shenandoah Shakespeare and the Building of the Third Blackfriars Playhouse |last=Cohen |first=Ralph Alan |year=2005 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham, MD |ISBN=978-0-739-11033-1 |page=155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began on the playhouse in early 2000, as part of a three-building construction plan that would also include a re-creation of the 1614 [[Globe Theatre]] and a Center for Research and Education. The theater was built with timber sourced by Dreaming Creek.&lt;ref name=DreamingCreek-BlackfriarsPlayhouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Theaters, Centers &amp; Public Places: Blackfriars Playhouse|url=http://www.dreamingcreek.com/portfolio/commercial-portfolio/theaters-centers-public-places/nggallery/galleries/blackfriars-playhouse|website=Dreaming Creek|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The playhouse was completed at a cost of $3.7 million,&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite web |title=There's much ado about the Bard in Virginia |last=Klein |first=Michael |url=http://articles.philly.com/2002-07-14/news/25358048_1_shenandoah-shakespeare-bard-elizabethan-english |work=philly.com |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |date=14 July 2002 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened in September 2001.&lt;ref name=ThirdBlackfriars-2005/&gt; Built inside a brick shell, it is a wood-pegged, [[post-and-beam]] structure,&lt;ref name=Lebovich/&gt; made of Virginia oak,&lt;ref name=Skinner/&gt; with a [[hammerbeam roof]].&lt;ref name=ThirdBlackfriars-2005/&gt; The seating capacity is 300.&lt;ref name=Lebovich/&gt; Raked benches in a pit and two levels of galleries place the audience close to the actors,&lt;ref name=ThirdBlackfriars-2005/&gt; and even seating on the stage is possible.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt; Unlike the original Blackfriars, the theatre has no painted decorations except at the back of the stage, and no windows in the auditorium. Electrical lighting reflected off the ceiling is used to simulate daylight,&lt;ref name=ThirdBlackfriars-2005/&gt; and lights simulating candles are mounted on [[sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s,&lt;ref name=Lebovich/&gt; and on wrought-iron [[chandelier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Virginia: In the historic town of Staunton, the stage is set for a Shakespearean renaissance |last=Clayton |first=Sarah |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-10-14/travel/0110140410_1_shenandoah-shakespeare-midsummer-night-dream-globe-theatre |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=14 October 2001 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Blackfriars Playhouse appeared in [[BBC]]'s documentary ''Shakespeare Uncovered,'' which aired in the U.S. in early 2013.&lt;ref name=PBS-ShakespeareUncovered-2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Shakespeare Uncovered|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/shakespeare-uncovered/|website=[[PBS]]|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shakespeare's staging conditions ==
The American Shakespeare Center gives its audiences some of the same experiences that an Elizabethan playgoer would have enjoyed by following the basic principles of Renaissance theatrical production - including Universal Lighting (audience and actors share the same pool of light), Doubling (one actor playing multiple roles in a show), cross-gender casting (men playing female characters and vice versa), and minimal sets.&lt;ref name=AmTheatre-Feature-2006 /&gt;

== Productions ==
For resident theatre companies, according to [[Zelda Fichandler]], "repertory is destiny" - a theatre company acquires its audience by the productions it presents.&lt;ref name=AmTheatre-Whither-2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fichandler|first1=Zelda|title=Whither (or Wither) Art? A Resident Theatre Pioneer Gauges the Artistic Pulse of the Contemporary American Theatre|journal=American Theatre|date=2003|volume=20|issue=5|page=28|url=https://www.tcg.org/publications/at/2003/wither.cfm|accessdate=14 May 2015|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|location=New York, NY|ISSN=8750-3255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the production at the American Shakespeare Center's are from [[William Shakespeare bibliography|Shakespeare's canon]]; however, each year several productions are works by his contemporary playwrights or more modern plays that relate directly to the Shakespeare canon or work well using Shakespeare's staging conditions.

==Educational programming==
ASC Education offers workshops, performances, staged readings, lectures, a biennial international conference, teacher training, archival materials for scholarly research, and summer programs for teens and adults.

== Mary Baldwin University ==
The ASC partners with [[Mary Baldwin University]] in the one-of-a-kind [[MLitt]]/[[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] Shakespeare and Performance graduate program for actors, directors, teachers, and [[dramaturgs]]. The program's graduates have gone on to doctoral work, tenure-track faculty positions, and professional theatre careers.&lt;ref name=MaryBaldwin-ShakespeareMFA&gt;{{cite web|title=Shakespeare and Performance|url=http://www.mbc.edu/shakespeare/|website=[[Mary Baldwin College]]|accessdate=14 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512090047/http://www.mbc.edu/shakespeare/|archive-date=2015-05-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Balzer''' Motor Company of [[The Bronx|Bronx, New York]], was founded in 1894 by [[Stephen M. Balzer]] (c.1864–1940).&lt;ref name="StandardCatalog"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimes|first1=Beverly|last2=Clark|first2=Henry|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Stephen Balzer immigrated in the 1870s from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to the USA. He apprenticed as a [[watchmaker]] at [[Tiffany's]]. When he started his own business in 1894, a machine shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsnaps.com/v/Cars+B/Balzer/|title=Balzer|website=classiccar4you.com|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he already held several patents for mechanical devices, among them a device for making milling cutters and his rotary engine. In the same year, he completed his first prototype automobile, a motorized ''quadricycle''&lt;ref name="StandardCatalog" /&gt;with a tube chassis, less than 6&amp;nbsp;ft long and 3&amp;nbsp;ft wide.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1269.html|title=Balzer automobile|website=America on the Move|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a rotary, air-cooled, 3-cylinder engine, mounted vertically in the rear and revolving around a fixed [[crankshaft]]. Turning with the crank case was a stub shaft. It further had a 3-speed manual transmission with no reverse. One lever engaged speeds and clutch. Each front wheel had its own bicycle fork axle which were connected by a bar which was operated by a tiller&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american-automobiles.com/Balzer.html&lt;/ref&gt;) By 1897, he had built three cars. 

He developed also 5-cylinder rotary engines.&lt;ref name="StandardCatalog" /&gt; When [[Smithsonian Institution]] Secretary [[Samuel P. Langley]] learned about these vehicles and their engine in 1898, he contacted Balzer, ordering one for his experimental airplane. Balzer had problems finishing this engine, delivering finally not earlier than 1900. For proper use, Langley's technical assistant, [[Charles M. Manly]] had to modify it heavily. Thus, it became the [[Manly–Balzer engine]], the first purpose-built aero-engine.

But his business was not very successful, and he left in 1902. He still worked as a mechanic, and in 1940 he died.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

== Prototype ==
On May 16, 1899, Balzer donated his prototype to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the first automobile in its collection.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; This was the first car given to the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]. It is currently in collection.

[[Image:Kingdom of Pamplona (c. 925).gif|thumb|320px|The Banu Qasi domain and its rival, the Kingdom of Pamplona, in the 10th century, after they were deprived of most of the Upper March]]
The '''Banu Qasi''', '''Banu Kasi''', '''Beni Casi''' ({{lang-ar|بني&amp;nbsp;قسي or بنو&amp;nbsp;قسي}}, meaning "sons" or "heirs of Cassius") or '''Banu Musa''' were a [[Muladi|Muwallad]] dynasty that ruled the upper [[Ebro]] valley in the 9th century, before being displaced in the first quarter of the 10th century.

==Dynastic beginnings==
The family is said to descend from the [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] or [[Visigoth]]ic nobleman named [[Count Cassius|Cassius]].{{Sfn|Ball|2009|pp=117-122}} Muslim chronicles and the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'' suggest he was a [[Visigoth]].{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=6}}{{efn|"Curiously, there has always been a great degree of insistence on defining the Banu Qasi as being of Gothic background, when there is no member of the family actually bearing any Gothic name. All Muslim authors make them to appear descending from the Visigothic Count Cassius, whose name, as well as those of many of his descendants, is Latin: Fortunius, Lupus, etc. Whence we must therefore come to deduce that the roots of this lineage are obviously Hispano-Roman."{{Sfn|Salazar y Acha|200|p=32, n.11}}}} According to the 10th century [[Muladi|Muwallad]] historian, [[Ibn al-Qūṭiyya]], [[Count Cassius]] converted to Islam in 714 as the ''[[Mawla|mawlā]]'' (client) of the [[Umayyads]], shortly after their [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquest of Hispania]].{{efn|This origin legend, as recounted by [[Ibn al-Qūṭiyya]], may be a product of the spurious antiquarianism of the latter Umayyad period that satisfied the need for stories which bridged the conquest, rather than reliable genealogy.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=6}}}} After his conversion, he is said to have traveled to [[Damascus]] to personally swear allegiance to the Umayyad [[Caliph]], [[Al-Walid I]].

Under the Banu Qasi, the region of Upper Ebro (modern districts of [[Logroño]] and southern Navarre, based in [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]]) formed a semi-autonomous principality. The tiny emirate was faced by enemies in several directions. Although never realized, the threat of Frankish attempts to regain control over the western Pyrenees was a real one. In actuality, even more menacing was the gradual eastwards expansion of the [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturian Kingdom]]; while in the south lay the [[Caliphate of Cordova]], ever anxious to impose its authority over the frontier regions.

As a local [[Muslim]] dynasty in the [[Ebro]] valley (the [[Upper March]] of [[Al-Andalus]]; {{lang-ar| الثغر الأعلى }}, ''Aṯ-Ṯaḡr al-Aʿlà''), the Banu Qasi were nominally clients of the emirate, but they thrived on regional rivalries and alliances with other [[Muladi|Muwallad]] dynasties of the Upper March, the [[Vascones|Vascon]] [[tribal chieftain]]s of [[Kingdom of Pamplona|Pamplona]] and [[County of Aragon|Aragon]],{{Sfn|Collins|1990|pp=123, 158–159}} as well as with the [[Hispanic March|Catalan counts]] of [[County of Pallars|Pallars]]-[[County of Ribagorza|Ribagorza]] to the north{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=56}} and [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]] to the east, the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] to the west and the [[Emirate of Cordova|Umayyads to the south]] over the next two centuries. They frequently intermarried with other regional nobility, both Muslim and Christian. Musa ibn Musa and the Pamplona king [[Íñigo Arista of Pamplona|Íñigo Arista]] were maternal half-brothers, while Musa also married Arista's daughter, and his own daughter and nieces were married to other Pyrenean princes. The cultural ambivalence of the Banu Qasi is also demonstrated by their mixed use of names: for example, [[Andalusian Arabic|Arabic]] (''Muhammad'', ''Musa'', ''Abd Allah''), [[Latin]]ate (''Awriya'', ''Furtun'', ''Lubb''), and [[Basque language|Basque]] (''Garshiya'').

The [[Caliphate of Cordova|Umayyads of Cordova]] sanctioned the rule of the Banu Qasi and repeatedly granted them autonomy by appointing them as governors, only to replace them as they expressed too much independence, or launch punitive military expeditions into the region. Such acts on the part of the Umayyads demonstrated their failure to ever fully resolve the problem of effective, central control of outlying regions.

==First rise to prominence==
The speculated homeland of Count Cassius was a narrow strip across the Ebro from [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]].{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=12}} The Arab historian [[Ibn Hazm]] listed the sons of Count Cassius as ''Furtun'', ''Abu Tawr'', ''Abu Salama'', ''Yunus'' and ''Yahya''. Of these, it has been suggested that the second may be the [[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Tawr, Wali of Huesca]], who invited [[Charlemagne]] to [[Zaragoza]] in 778. Likewise, the [[Banu Salama]], removed from power in [[Huesca]] and [[Barbitanya]] (the area of [[Barbastro]]) at the end of the 8th century, may have derived from Abu Salama.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=7-9}} Subsequent leaders of the family descend from the eldest son, Furtun.{{efn|This is as the pedigree appears in the work of Ibn Hazm, but historian [[Al-Udri]] refers to his descendant as ''Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Musa ibn Musa ibn Furtun ibn Garshiya'' (Muhammad son of Lubb, son of . . . son of Musa, son of Furtun, son of Garshiya). This last [[patronymic]] may simply be an error for ibn Qasi (son of Cassius), or may suggest that Ibn Hazm has dropped a generation, Garshiya, between Cassius and Furtun in his account of the senior line. An additional generation would better fit the chronology.{{Sfn|Granja|1967|pp=519–520}}}} His son, Musa ibn Furtun ibn Qasi, first garnered notice in 788, when on behalf of emir [[Hisham I of Córdoba]] he put down the rebellion of the Banu Husain in Zaragoza. The fate of Musa ibn Furtun is debated. An account of the 788 rebellion tells of Musa's murder shortly thereafter at the hands of a Banu Husain follower, yet a "Furtun ibn Musa" is said to have been killed in his own 802 Zaragoza uprising, and it has been suggested that this name may be an error for Musa ibn Furtun. However, [[Ibn Hayyan]] also reports a Furtun from the Banu Qasi forming a coalition with [[Kingdom of Pamplona|Pamplona]], [[Álava]], [[County of Castile|Castile]], [[Amaya (Burgos)|Amaya]] and [[County of Cerdanya|Cerdanya]] to fight against [[Amrus ibn Yusuf]] at this time, suggesting that this is instead a son of Musa ibn Furtun overlooked by [[Ibn Hazm]], whose genealogy provides most of what we know about the clan.{{efn|Historian Jesús Lorenzo Jiménez stresses the fact that part of Ibn Hayyan's ''al-Muqtabis'' that refers to the events that took place in Pamplona was published for the first time in 1954 whereas the part which mentions the uprisings in Huesca and Zaragoza did not come to light until 1999/2001. Therefore, Cañada Juste and other historians did not have access to the most recently published work.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=117}}}}

In the next generation, Mutarrif ibn Musa, was likely a son of Musa ibn Furtun,{{efn|Martínez Díez attempts to harmonize the difficulties with the pedigree though the insertion of two generations, making a first Musa ibn Furtun, murdered 788 the father of Mutarrif ibn Musa of 798 and Furtun ibn Musa of 802, in turn father of an otherwise undocumented Musa ibn Furtun, father of Musa ibn Musa.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=8-12}}}} although historian Ibn Hayyan only mentions his name and does not say that he was a member of the Banu Qasi clan.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=119, n. 18}}  According to Ibn Hayyan, “in (183 H: 799-800) the  people of Pamplona deceived Mutarrif ibn Musa and killed him”.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=118}} “This is perhaps one of the most quoted paragraphs by historians who on the basis of this brief news, have woven a complex web of relationships involving the Banu Qasi, the Arista and the Carolingians”. [[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]] was the first to say that “Pamplona, the capital of Vasconia, had not been governed by the Muslims since 798 (...) and that its inhabitants had killed the representative of the Umayyad authorities, Mutarrif ben Musa Ben Qasi, and had chosen one of their own, named Velasco.” This Velasco would be the same “enemy of God, [[Velasco the Gascon|Balashk al-Yalashqi]], Lord of Pamplona”, a pro-Carolingian  against whom the [[Al-Andalus|Muslims]] launched a military campaign in 816.  Spanish historian [[Claudio Sánchez Albornoz]] did not agree with this interpretation and believed that it had been the people of Pamplona, without any outside intervention, who took matters in their own hands. No where does Ibn Hayyan mention that Mutarrif ibn Musa was the governor of Pamplona or that Velasco was pro-Carolingian.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|pp=118–120}}

It was Musa's son Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi whose rule brought the family to the peak of its power.

==Musa ibn Musa==
{{Main|Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi}}
Besides the Arab sources, Musa ibn Musa is mentioned in three Latin texts: the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III|Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis]]''; the ''[[Codex Vigilanus|Albendensis]]''; and the ''[[Códice de Roda]]''.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=139}} The latter mentions his family relations as the half-brother and son-in-law of King [[Íñigo Arista]] and the properties he held. The ''Albeldensis'' describes the [[Battle of Monte Laturce]], also referred to as the second Battle of Albelda, whereas the [[Chronicle of Alfonso III]] provides a more detailed account of his life and feats.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|pp=139–141}}

While Musa had been orphaned at an early age, his military activity may have begun in the 820s, and the Banu Qasi (possibly Musa himself) most probably participated in the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|second battle of the pass of Roncevaux]] along with their relatives of Pamplona,{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=12-3}} an event leading to the establishment of the kingdom of Pamplona. Historians agree that in the 840s, Musa launched a series of revolts, in conjunction with his maternal half-brother, Íñigo Arista of Pamplona. [[Abd ar-Rahman II]] defeated them, and took Musa's son Lubb hostage. Musa repeatedly submitted, only to rise again. After repeated rebellions he controlled a region along the Ebro from [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]] to [[Logroño]], including [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Tarazona]], [[Arnedo]] and [[Calahorra]]. The 851/2 deaths of Íñigo Arista and Abd ar-Rahman II, as well as a victory over Christian forces at [[Battle of Albelda (851)|Albelda]], gave Musa unprecedented status. The new emir, [[Muhammad I of Córdoba]] named Musa the [[Wāli|Wali]] of Zaragoza and governor of the Upper March. Over the next decade Musa expanded the family's lands to include Zaragoza, [[Najera]], [[Viguera]] and [[Calatayud]], while also governing Tudela, [[Huesca]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and according to the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III|Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis]]'', Musa had his followers call him "the third king of ''Spaniae''.{{efn|tertium regem in Spania appellare precepit.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=141}}}}

However, in 859, [[Ordoño I of Asturias]] and [[García Íñiguez of Pamplona]] joined forces to deal Musa a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Albelda (859)|Albelda]], which passed into Christian legend as the [[Battle of Clavijo]].{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=142}} Emir Muhammad then stripped Musa of his titles and restored direct Cordoban control over the region. Musa died in 862 of wounds received in a petty squabble with a son-in-law,{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=214}} and the family disappeared from the political scene for a decade.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=12-4}}

==Sons of Musa==
Following the 862 death of Musa, nothing is known of the family until 871. It is presumed that the members of the family associated with the Cordoban court and military campaigns, but no record of their presence there survives. According to the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III|Chronica Adefonsi tertii regis]]'', upon learning of his father's defeat at Albelda, his son Lubb ibn Musa ibn with all his men, submitted themselves to the rule of the Asturian king Ordoño and became his lifelong subjects.{{Sfn|Lorenzo Jiménez|2010|p=142}} By the time the Banu Qasi reappear, they had lost control of most of their lands, being left with just a small area surrounding [[Arnedo]].{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=41-4}} In 870, a rebellion in Huesca initiated a chain of events that would bring the Banu Qasi back to dominance.  In that year, Amrus ibn Umar of the [[Amrus ibn Yusuf|Banu Amrus]] assassinated the ''amil'' Musa ibn Galind, son of the turncoat brother of Pamplona king García Íñiguez. The ''Amir'', Muhammad, sent an army to the north, but Amrus allied himself with García, and the Cordoban general, Abd al-Gafir ibn Abd al-Aziz, was killed before the gates of Zaragoza.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=42-3}} The Banu Qasi sons of Musa, apparently under the leadership of eldest son Lubb ibn Musa, then allied themselves with García, and reestablished control over their father's possessions. First, the residents of Huesca called on Mutarrif ibn Musa ibn Qasi for leadership. In January 872, [[Isma'il ibn Musa]] entered Zaragoza, and was there joined by Lubb, the two of them together taking [[Monzón|Monzon]]. [[Isma'il ibn Musa|Isma'il]] also allied himself with the [[Banu Jalaf]] of [[Barbastro|Barbitanya]], marrying Sayyida, daughter of Abd Allah ibn Jalaf. Furtun ibn Musa occupied Tudela, whose governor the Banu Qasi imprisoned at Arnedo, then killed following an escape.  Lubb also occupied and refortified Viguera.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=43-5}}{{Sfn|Granja|1967|pp=474, 524–520}}

The immediate response of emir Muhammad was to try to limit the expansion of the Banu Qasi by installing a rival dynasty, the [[Arab]] [[Banu Tujibi]], in Calatayud, the one part of their father's possessions not reclaimed.  In the next year, 873, Muhammad launched a campaign against the various northern rebels. He first bought off the rebels of Toledo with governorships, and this encouraged Amrus to offer his loyalty, for which he was rewarded with Huesca where he captured Mutarrif and his family, including wife Belasquita, the daughter of García Íñiguez of Pamplona.  In spite of a desperate attack by the combined troops of his brothers, Mutarrif and three sons, Muhammad, Musa and Lubb, were taken to Córdoba and crucified.{{efn|Two of Mutarrif's remaining sons, ‘Abd Allah and Isma'il, converted to Christianity and fled north.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=45-8}}}} The next year, Furtun died in Tudela, while Lubb was killed in an accident in Viguera in 875.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=48-50}} This left control of the family in the hands of two men, the remaining brother [[Isma'il ibn Musa]] in Monzon, and Lubb's son, [[Muhammad ibn Lubb|Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi]], who is first known as a defender of Zaragoza against the emirate troops.

==Muhammad ibn Lubb==
{{Main|Muhammad ibn Lubb}}
Over the next decade, following the deaths of his father and two uncles, [[Muhammad ibn Lubb|Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi]] maneuvered to become the leader of the family. He resisted 879 and 882 campaigns from Córdoba. The latter was under general, Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz, and [[Muhammad ibn Lubb|Muhammad]] tried to persuade Hashim to unite with him against the Asturians, now ruled by [[Alfonso III of León|Alfonso III]]. The earlier hostage-taking done by all parties, greatly complicated such situation. Hashim did not want to antagonize Alfonso, who was holding his son as an hostage. Hashim himself held a son of [[Isma'il ibn Musa]], and he sent his captive and other gifts to Alfonso in return for his son.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=54-6}} Muhammad would later ally himself with the kings of Pamplona and Asturias, and it was apparently he who raised the future [[Ordoño II of León]] at his court.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=57}}The struggle for power within the Banu Qasi family came to a head in 882, when Muhammad fought, near Calahorra, a 7000-man force of his uncle Isma'il ibn Musa, and Isma'il ibn Furtun, a son of his uncle Furtun. In the following internecine squabbles, Furtun's four sons were killed and [[Isma'il ibn Musa]] was forced to retreat to Monzon.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=56-8}} From there he rebuilt [[Lleida]] and routed an army sent by [[Wilfred the Hairy|Wilfred of Barcelona]].{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=59}} Muhammad ibn Lubb, now the clear head of the family, was left in control of the majority of the Banu Qasi lands.  In 884, the emir sent two military campaigns into the region and took Zaragoza, although chronicler [[Ibn Hayyan]] reports that Muhammad ibn Lubb had sold the city to count [[Raymond I of Pallars and Ribagorza]] prior to its fall. This resulted in a consolidated Banu Qasi powerbase around Arnedo, Borja, Calahorra and Viguera, with Isma'il holding an enclave to the east, around Monzon and Lleida.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=51-2, 58-60}}

In 885 and 886, Muhammad launched attacks against [[County of Castile|Castile]], in the first apparently killing count [[Diego Rodríguez Porcelos]], while the second was an attack on [[Álava]] in which many Christians were killed.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=59}}  The latter year also saw the death of emir Muhammad I of Córdoba. Muhammad ibn Lubb tested his power against the new emirs, and they responded by again trying to balance Banu Qasi power in the region, giving Zaragoza to the rival Tujibids, and Huesca to [[Muhammad al-Tawil of Huesca|Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil]] of the [[Muladi|Muwallad]] Banu Shabrit clan.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=59-63}}  The latter was shortly challenged by [[Isma'il ibn Musa]], whose sons fought a battle against al-Tawil's troops, Musa ibn Isma'il being killed and his brother Mutarrif captured. Isma'il died shortly thereafter, in 889, and al-Tawil and Muhammad ibn Lubb each took their case to emir [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi|Abd Allah]] for possession of Isma'il's lands, the emir confirming the succession of Muhammad ibn Lubb. There followed a period of relative peace and collaboration between Muhammad ibn Lubb and al-Tawil.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=63-4}}  In 891, Muhammad defeated a Christian force at Castro Sibiriano,{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=66}} but he dedicated most of his efforts in his final years against Tujibid Zaragoza, initiating what would become a 17-year siege.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=64-5}} In 897, the citizens of Toledo rose up and offered their city to Muhammad, but being occupied with Zaragoza, he sent his son Lubb.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=66-7}} Muhammad was reconnoitering Zaragoza in 898, when on 8 October, he was caught by a guard who spitted him on a lance. His head was presented to the Tujibids, who sent it to Córdoba, where it was displayed in front of the palace for eight days before being buried with the honors due a brave foe.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=67-8}}

==Lubb ibn Muhammad==
{{Main|Lubb ibn Muhammad}}
Muhammad's son, [[Lubb ibn Muhammad|Lubb ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi]], was born in 870, and was already active at the time of his father's death.  In 896, he was refortifying Monzon when al-Tawil of Huesca tried his luck.  Though being attacked by a larger, better equipped army, Lubb was able to rout al-Tawil's men, taking his brother prisoner.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=66}}  In January 897 he went to Toledo to take up the leadership offer the citizens had made his father.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=66-7}} Back in the east, he launched an attack on Aura that led to the death of Wilfred of Barcelona.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=67}}  Returning through Toledo in 898, he next marched to [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], with the intent of forming a coalition with another rebel, [[Umar ibn Hafsun]], but before Umar reached Jaén, the news of his father's death at Zaragoza forced Lubb's return to Tudela, where he formally recognized the sovereignty of the emir, Abd Allah, in exchange for the formal governorship over Tudela and Tarazona.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=67-70}} His return north found al-Tawil moving to take advantage of the temporary power vacuum and three weeks after his father's death, Lubb captured the Huesca ruler in a skirmish. To buy his freedom, al-Tawil ceded lands between Huesca and Monzon to Lubb, and agreed to pay 100,000 gold dinares for the possession of Huesca. Paying 50,000 immediately, he gave his son Abd al-Malik and daughter Sayyida as hostages to ensure payment of the second half.  Lubb would relent, forgiving the remaining debt and returning the hostages except Sayyida, whom he married.{{efn|Lubb thus also linked himself with the Galindo Aznar, Count of Aragon, whose sister was the girl's mother.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=71}}}}

Lubb ibn Muhammad continued his father's siege of Zaragoza, but found himself drawn in other directions. Perhaps in 900, Alfonso III, in conjunction with [[Fortún Garcés of Pamplona]], launched a raid against Tarazona, in Lubb's realms; which he successfully blocked.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=71-2}} Then in 903, Toledo again rebelled against [[Emirate of Cordova|Cordova]], asking Lubb to take control. He sent his brother Mutarrif, who was proclaimed their ''[[Amir]]''. Mutarrif's fate is unknown, but by 906, he had been replaced by Lubb's kinsman, Muhammad ibn Isma'il, son of Isma'il ibn Musa, who was then assassinated.{{efn|His son Lubb ibn Muhammad ibn Isma'il ibn Qasi fled to join the [[Fatimids]], taking the Banu Qasi line into Africa.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=72-3}}}} Alfonso again attacked Lubb's lands, laying siege to Grañón, but was forced to lift the siege when Lubb moved with an army toward Alava.  This threat neutralized, Lubb turned toward [[County of Pallars|Pallars]], ravaging the lands, killing hundreds and taking a thousand captives, including [[Isarn of Pallars|Isarn]], Count Raymond's son, who was kept in Tudela for a decade before being freed.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=73}}

In 905, a coalition of the King of Asturias, the counts of Aragon and Pallars, and, it is sometimes claimed, Lubb ibn Muhammad, engineered a coup in Navarre that brought [[Sancho I of Pamplona|Sancho Garcés]] to the throne in place of Fortún Garcés.  Two years later, Lubb launched an attack on Pamplona and fought at "Liédena" on 30 September 907, resulting in a total rout of the Banu Qasi forces, while Lubb was killed.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=74-5}} The transcendent battle marked a permanent change in the regional balance, Sancho's Pamplona becoming a major regional power, while it initiated the final decline of the Banu Qasi.

==Decline (862-929)==
With the fall of Lubb, his local rivals immediately fell upon the Banu Qasi lands.  Sancho descended toward Calahorra.  The Tujibids finally broke the siege of Zaragoza and captured [[Ejea de los Caballeros|Ejea]].{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=70}} Al-Tawil retook the lands he had lost, and proceeded to overrun the family's eastern enclave, taking Barbastro and Lleida. Monzon was briefly controlled by Lubb's brother Yunis ibn Muhammad, but he could not hold it, and Monzon too fell to the al-Tawil.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=77-9}}  In the reduced western lands, Lubb was succeeded by brother Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi.  In 911, Abd Allah and al-Tawil jointly, along with al-Tawil's brother-in-law [[Galindo Aznárez II]] of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], attacked Pamplona.  After destroying several castles, they developed cold feet and withdrew, but were caught by Sancho.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=79-80}} Al-Tawil defected and escaped, while Galindo was crushed and forced to recognize Sancho as feudal sovereign, ending the autonomy of the Aragon. Arab sources describe Abd Allah's rear-guard action at Luesia as a victory, but if so it was only a tactical victory and he immediately retreated south.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=79-80}} In 914, Sancho turned the tables, marching into the heart of the Banu Qasi homeland, taking Arnedo and attacking Calahorra.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=80}} In the next year, 915, Sancho turned toward Tudela, and there captured Abd Allah, killing a thousand of his best men.  Mutarrif ibn Muhammad ibn Qasi, Abd Allah's brother, rushed to relieve the city, and Abd Allah was ransomed, his daughter Urraca and probably son Furtun ibn Abd Allah being given as hostages.{{efn|Both would later convert, Urraca marrying [[Fruela II of León]].{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=81,91}}}} However, two months later Abd Allah was assassinated, it is said, through the machinations of Sancho.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=81}}

The only bright spot for the family in this period happened in the east.  In 913, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Tawil died, and the next year, the residents of Monzon rejected his son Amrus ibn Muhammad, and invited the Banu Qasi to return in the person of Muhammad ibn Lubb, son of Lubb ibn Muhammad.  After a brief siege, he was able to reclaim the city for his family, as well as Lleida.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=80–1}}

In the west, Mutarrif ibn Muhammad and his nephew Muhammad ibn Abd Allah struggled for dominance. The latter proved victorious, killing Mutarrif in 916.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=83}} Since the death of Lubb in 907, the Banu Qasi had been left fractured and weakened in the face of two resurgent powers: to the north and west, a collaboration between the new [[Kingdom of León|king of León]], [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]], and Sancho I of Navarre brought a strong army south, ravaging the Banu Qasi lands around Viguera, Najera and Tudela in 918, while the young and energetic [[Abd ar-Rahman III]], who was to temporarily reverse the centrifugal forces at work in the Emirate, soon to be [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], sent armies north, routing the Christians.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=85}} The next year, both Banu Qasi leaders, Muhammad ibn Abd Allah and Muhammad ibn Lubb, attacked the Banu al-Tawil at Barbastro, but Sancho took advantage of this, and allying himself with his cousin [[Bernard I of Ribagorza]] and the Banu al-Tawil, he attacked and burned Monzon, which was hence lost to the Banu Qasi.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=85–6}} In 920, the emir, Abd ar-Rahman III, personally led the Cordoban army north, and forced Sancho to abandon fortifications he had been building. After some maneuvering the emir met the armies of Ordoño and Sancho, and defeated them at Valdejunquera.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=86}} In 923, the Christian allies brought another force south, and while Muhammad ibn Abd Allah formed a coalition of local nobles to resist it, their armies were dispersed and Viguera and Najera fell. Like his father, Muhammad was captured, then assassinated on Sancho's orders, and when Abd ar-Rahman launched another punitive campaign the next year, on his return to Tudela he removed the Banu Qasi and sent them to Córdoba, placing their old rivals the Tujibids of Zaragoza in their place.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=88–9}}
After 923, only the eastern enclave encompassing Lleida and the ''[[Castle|husûn]]'' of Balaguer, Barbastro and Ayera were in the hands of the family. However, one by one these expelled Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi and turned to the Tujibids for leadership, leaving him only Ayera in 928, when [[Jimeno Garcés of Pamplona|Jimeno Garcés]], the new king of Navarre, intervened on his behalf in opposition to Hasim ibn Muhammad al-Tujibi.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|pp=89–90}}{{Sfn|Granja|1967|p=486}} The next year, Muhammad fell victim to an ambush and was killed by his brother-in-law, a son of Raymond of Pallars.{{Sfn|Cañada Juste|1980|p=90}}

==Legacy==
The death of Muhammad ibn Lubb marked the end of the Banu Qasi in the Ebro valley. Their rivals the Tujibids would follow their model, making an independent peace with Leon in 937, a move that resulted in a punitive expedition from the Caliph similar to those of prior years against the Banu Qasi. The Tujibids would eventually establish a full-fledged Taifa kingdom centered at Zaragoza.{{Sfn|O'Callaghan|1981|p=29}}{{Sfn|Watt|Cachia|1996|p=40}}

Two other Taifa crowns were ruled by men with names reminiscent of the Banu Qasi and are claimed as dynastic members, although the precise connection, if any, is unknown. A small Taifa state at [[Alpuente]] was founded by Abd Allah ibn Qasim. He was of a convert family that claimed a tribal affiliation with the Yamanī/Fíhrī.{{Sfn|Catlos|2004|p=40n}}

In 1144, another Christian convert and [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic from [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]], [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]], called ibn Qasi, rose and established a Taifa state at [[Mértola]], expanding it to much of southern [[Portugal]], and he encouraged the successful move of the [[Almohads]] (to whom he would submit) against [[Seville]]. They fell out and [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi|Ibn Qasi]] was assassinated in 1151 by his own men.;{{Sfn|Fletcher|2006|p=121}}{{Sfn|Kennedy|1996|p=191}}{{Sfn|Reilly|1998|p=84}}{{Sfn|O'Callaghan|1983|pp=228–9}} [[Fortún Ochoiz]], a Navarrese who ruled [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] in the first half of the eleventh century, may be a descendant of the Banu Qasi.

==Leadership of the Banu Qasi==
The following men are the documented leaders of the Banu Qasi (entries in ''italics'' are of uncertain affiliation to the family):
* [[Count Cassius|Cassius]], fl. 714
** ''[[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Tawr, Wali of Huesca]], fl. 778, perhaps son of Cassius''
* Musa ibn Furtun, grandson of Cassius
** ''Mutarrif ibn Musa, assassinated 799, perhaps son of Musa ibn Furtun''
** ''Furtun ibn Musa, killed in rebellion 801, perhaps son of Musa ibn Furtun, else identical to him''
* [[Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi|Musa ibn Musa]], d. 862, son of Musa ibn Furtun
* Lubb ibn Musa, d. 875, son of Musa ibn Musa
* [[Isma'il ibn Musa]], co-leader to 882, d. 889, son of Musa ibn Musa
* [[Muhammad ibn Lubb]], co-leader to 882, then sole leader, d. 899, son of Lubb ibn Musa
* [[Lubb ibn Muhammad]], d. 907, son of Muhammad ibn Lubb
* Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, d. 915, son of Muhammad ibn Lubb
:(succession struggle between Mutarrif ibn Muhammad and Muhammad ibn Abd Allah, 915-916)
* Muhammad ibn Abd Allah, d. 923, son of Abd Allah ibn Muhammad
* Muhammad ibn Lubb, d. 929, son of Lubb ibn Muhammad
:(end of dynasty)

The '''Bielefeld School''' is a group of German historians based originally at [[Bielefeld University]] who promote [[social history]] and [[political history]] using quantification and the methods of [[political science]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lorenz, Chris "Wehler, Hans-Ulrich" pages 1289–1290 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 2 page 1289&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaders include [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Jürgen Kocka]] and [[Reinhart Koselleck]]. Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great historical leaders, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as "historical social science" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal ''{{ill|Geschichte und Gesellschaft: Zeitschrift fur Historische Sozialwissenschaft|de|Geschichte und Gesellschaft}}'' since 1975.

Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s–60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society"—''Gesellschaftsgeschichte''—has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the [[modernization theory]] of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''German Studies Review'' 1984 7(3): 451-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte==
''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' (1987–) is Wehler's comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the eighteenth-twentieth centuries. Each volume approaches historical processes from a social history perspective, organized under the themes of demographics, economics, and social equality.  His detailed structural analysis of developmental processes supported by a vast body of notes and statistics sometimes obscures the larger context. Nonetheless, patterns of continuity and change in the social fabric are emphasized.   More than a historiographical synthesis of Ranke and Marx (envisioned by some German historians after the catastrophe of World War I), Wehler's work incorporates [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of authority, economy, and culture and strives toward a concept of "total history."

Volumes 1–2 cover the period from feudalism through the Revolution of 1848. Volume 3 ''Von der "Deutschen Doppelrevolution" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914'' (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German [[Sonderweg]] or "special path" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the twentieth century. Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  Wehler's ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914–1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society.  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's fourth volume is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the twentieth century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.  The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871–1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
British historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans]] disagreed with the Bielefeld school regarding the Sonderweg thesis. Instead he argued for the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the twentieth century in a "[[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|failed bourgeois revolution]]" in 1848. Influenced by the [[New Left]], Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history in the Imperial period "from below."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow, "Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History" ''The American Historical Review'', February 1983, Volume 88#1 pages 53–72 quote on page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'', he launched a critique of the "top-down" approach of the Bielefeld School. Evans and the others wanted a perspective from the Left that stressed the importance of the working class by highlighting "the importance of the grass roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, "Introduction: Wilhelm II's Germany and the Historians" in Evans, ed. ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'' (1978) pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Along with historians [[Geoff Eley]] and [[David Blackbourn]], Evans emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;See Evans, ''In Defence of History,'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural turn===
From the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'?

Kocka responded by arguing that social history has become so all-pervasive that it has lost its position as the cutting edge within historiography. He says, "But: in the meantime social historians' approaches, viewpoints, topics and results have been accepted and incorporated by many other historians who would not call themselves social historians. Social history has successfully penetrated its opponents."  He expects to see a return to social history, this time with more cultural and linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Magnússon, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cantigny First Division Oral Histories [http://libx.bsu.edu/collection.php?CISOROOT=/CtgnyOrHis] are a collection of video [[oral history]] interviews with [[veterans]] of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]], commonly known as the Big Red One.  The First Division was the first permanent division in the regular Army, and is recognized by its ability to improve battlefield performance through learning experiences and its exceptional “[[esprit de corps]].”

The project preserves the memories of soldiers whose military service occurred around the globe. These oral histories provide first-hand resources for scholarly research in [[military history]] and [[US history]].  They address veterans’ experiences during the time periods of the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Cold War]].

In 2008, [[Ball State University]] History professors Dr. Michael William Doyle and Dr. David Ulbrich trained [[Ball State University]] students in oral history techniques and military history.  Under their supervision, students J. Chris Reidy, Steven Brown, and Rachel (Fulton) Coleman conducted interviews with forty First Division veterans residing in [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], and [[Kentucky]].  The Ball State University Teleplex videotaped the interviews and they were transcribed by [[Ball State University]] Libraries staff.

[[High-definition video]] and [[:wikt:transcript|transcripts]] of the interviews are available online via the Ball State University Libraries’ [[Digital Media Repository]] (DMR).  The online video,  [http://dvisweb1.bsu.edu/media/library/digital_media_repository/cantigny/reidy.asx Conversations across Generations: The Cantigny First Division Oral History Project Summer 2008], summarizes the project.

The Cantigny First Division Oral Histories project was funded by a grant from the Chicago-based McCormick Foundation with administrative support from the staff of the First Division Museum at [[Cantigny]].  Copies of the interviews and transcripts are also available at the Robert R. McCormick Research Center at the First Division Museum in [[Wheaton, Illinois]]. and Ball State University Libraries Archives and Special Collections in [[Muncie, Indiana]].

'''Charles Macfarlane''' (1799–1858) was a Scottish writer, known as much for his historical and travel works as he was for his novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=17491|title=Macgfarlane, Charles|first=Rosemary|last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was the son of Robert Macfarlane. From January 1816 to May 1827 he lived in Italy. In 1827, he went to Turkey and resided for sixteen months in Constantinople and the Turkish provinces.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Macfarlane, Charles|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macfarlane returned to England on 2 February 1829, settling in London, and supported himself by writing. He was for many years on [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]]'s staff.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Accompanied by his eldest son, then 16, Macfarlane returned to Turkey in 1847. On his way home, in the summer of 1848, they visited Messina and made a tour through the kingdom of Naples, the Abruzzi, the marches of Ancona, and Rome. In July 1857 he was nominated a poor brother of the [[London Charterhouse]], where he died on 9 December 1858.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Macfarlane's most substantial work was the ''Civil and Military History of England'', part of Knight's ''Pictorial History of England'', edited by [[George Lillie Craik]], 8 vols. 1838-44. An abridgment, with a continuation bringing it up to date, was published under the title of ''The Cabinet History of England'', 26 vols. London, 1845-7. Another edition, with the title changed to ''The Comprehensive History of England'', appeared under the editorship of [[Thomas Napier Thomson]], 4 vols. London, 1856–61, and again in 1876–8; and a third, with a continuation to 1884, by Thomas Archer, was issued as ''The Popular History of England'', 3 vols. London, 1886. For Knight also, Macfarlane compiled anonymously two volumes called ‘The Book of Table Talk,’ 1836 (another edition 1847), for which [[James Robinson Planché]] wrote a brief history of [[stage costume]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Macfarlane wrote historical novels and biographies of [[Thomas Gresham]] (1847), the [[Duke of Marlborough]] (1852), the [[Duke of Wellington]] (1853, 1877, 1886), and [[Napoleon I]] (1852, 1879, 1880, 1886). His works included:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Chinese creation myths''' are symbolic narratives about the origins of the universe, earth, and life. In [[Chinese mythology]], the term "[[cosmogonic myth]]" or "[[origin myth]]" is more accurate than "[[creation myth]]", since very few stories involve a [[creator deity]] or [[divine will]]. Chinese creation myths fundamentally differ from [[monotheism|monotheistic]] traditions with one authorized version, such as the [[Judaism|Judeo]]-[[Christian]] [[Genesis creation myth]]: [[Chinese classics]] record numerous and contradictory origin myths.

Some Chinese cosmogonic myths have familiar themes in [[comparative mythology]]. For example, creation from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] (Chinese [[Hundun]] and Hawaiian [[Kumulipo]]), dismembered corpses of a primordial being ([[Pangu]] and Mesopotamian [[Tiamat]]), [[List of creation myths#World Parent|world parent]] siblings ([[Fuxi]] and [[Nüwa]] and Japanese [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]]), and [[dualistic cosmology]] ([[yin and yang]] and Zoroastrian [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]]). In contrast, other mythic themes are uniquely Chinese. While the mythologies of [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamia]], [[Egyptian mythology|Egypt]], and [[Greek mythology|Greece]] believed primeval water was the single element that existed "in the beginning", the basic element of Chinese cosmology was ''[[qi]]'' ("[[breath]]; [[air]]; [[Qi|life force]]"). [[Anne Birrell|Birrell]] explains that ''qi'' "was believed to embody cosmic energy governing matter, time, and space. This energy, according to Chinese mythic narratives, undergoes a transformation at the moment of creation, so that the nebulous element of vapor becomes differentiated into dual elements of male and female, [[yin and yang|Yin and Yang]], hard and soft matter, and other binary elements."{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=23}}

==Cosmogonic mythologies==
{{anchor|Daodejing|Tao Te Ching}}
===''Tao Te Ching''===
The ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', written sometime before the 4th century {{sc|bc}}, suggests a less mythical Chinese [[cosmogony]] and has some of the earliest allusions to creation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was something featureless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; Silent—amorphous—it stood alone and unchanging. We may regard it as the mother of heaven and earth. Not knowing its name, I style it the "Way."{{sfnp|Mair|1990|p=90}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Tao|The Way]] gave birth to unity, Unity gave birth to duality, Duality gave birth to trinity, Trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures. The myriad creatures bear [[yin (concept)|yin]] on their back and embrace [[yang (concept)|yang]] in their bosoms. They neutralize these vapors and thereby achieve harmony.{{sfnp|Mair|1990|p=9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later Taoists interpreted this sequence to mean the [[Tao]] (''Dao'', "Way"), formless (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'', "Without Ultimate"), unitary (''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'', "Great Ultimate"), and binary ([[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] or [[Tian|Heaven]] and Earth).

[[Norman J. Girardot|Girardot]] reasons that ''Tao Te Ching'' evokes the [[Tao]] as "a cosmic principle of the beginnings would seem to make little sense without seeing the possibility that it was rooted in the symbolic remembrance of archaic mythological, especially cosmogonic, themes."{{sfnp|Girardot|1976|p=300}}

{{anchor|Songs of Chu}}
===''Songs of Chu''===
The "[[Heavenly Questions]]" section of the "[[Chuci|Songs of Chu]]", written around the 4th century {{sc|bc}}, begins by asking catechistic questions about creation myths. [[Anne Birrell|Birrell]] calls it "the most valuable document in Chinese mythography" and surmises an earlier date for its mythos "since it clearly draws on a preexisting fund of myths."{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=26}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Who passed down the story of the far-off, ancient beginning of things? How can we be sure what it was like before the sky above and the earth below had taken shape? Since none could penetrate that murk when darkness and light were yet undivided, how do we know about the chaos of insubstantial forms? What manner of things are the darkness and light? How did [[yin and yang|Yin and Yang]] come together, and how did they originate and transform all things that are by their commingling? Whose compass measured out the ninefold heavens? Whose work was this, and how did he accomplish it? Where were the circling cords fastened, and where was the sky's pole fixed? Where did the [[Eight Pillars]] meet the sky, and why were they too short for it in the south-east? Where do the nine fields of [[Tian|heaven]] extend to and where do they join each other? The ins and outs of their edges must be very many: who knows their number? How does [[Tian|heaven]] coordinate its motions? Where are the Twelve Houses divided? How do the sun and the moon hold to their courses and the fixed stars keep their places?{{sfnp|Hawkes|1985|p=127}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Anne Birrell|Birrell]] describes this Chu creation narrative as a "vivid world picture. It mentions no prime cause, no first creator. From the "formless expanse" the primeval element of misty vapor emerges spontaneously as a creative force, which is organically constructed as a set of binary forces in opposition to each other-upper and lower spheres, darkness and light, [[tin and yang|Yin and Yang]] – whose mysterious transformations bring about the ordering of the universe."{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=27}}.

[[File:Ba-Gua animated.gif|thumb|right|A Taoist diagram of the creation of the "myriad things" from the original unity through the [[yin-yang]] and [[trigram]]s.]]
{{anchor|Daoyuan}}

===''Daoyuan''===
The ''Daoyuan'' (道原, "Origins of the [[Tao]]") is one of the [[Huangdi Sijing]] manuscripts discovered in 1973 among the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] excavated from a tomb dated to 168{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Like the ''Songs of Chu'' above, this text is believed to date from the 4th century {{sc|bc}} and from the same southern [[state of Chu]]. This Taoist cosmogonic myth describes the creation of the universe and humans out of formless misty vapor, and [[Anne Birrell|Birrell]] notes the striking resemblance between its ancient "all was one" concept of unity before creation and the modern cosmogonic concept of [[gravitational singularity]].{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=28}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the beginning of eternal past all things penetrated and were identical with great vacuity, Vacuous and identical with the One, rest at the One eternally. Unsettled and confusing, there was no distinction of dark and light. Though [[Tao]] is undifferentiated, it is autonomous: "It has no cause since ancient times", yet "the [[myriad|ten thousand]] things are caused by it without any exception". [[Tao]] is great and universal on the one hand, but also formless and nameless.{{sfnp|Jan|1977|p=75}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor|Taiyi Shengshui}}
===''Taiyi Shengshui''===
The 4th or 3rd century {{sc|bc}} ''[[Taiyi Shengshui]]'' ("Great One Giving Birth to Water"), a [[Taoism|Taoist]] text recently excavated in the [[Guodian Chu Slips]], seems to offer its own unique creation myth, but analysis remains uncertain.

{{anchor|Huainanzi}}

===''Huainanzi''===
The 139{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} ''[[Huainanzi]]'', an eclectic text compiled under the direction of the Han [[Prince of Huainan|prince]] [[Liu An]], contains two cosmogonic myths that develop the dualistic concept of [[Yin and Yang]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When [[Tian|Heaven]] and Earth were yet unformed, all was ascending and flying, diving and delving. Thus it was called the Grand Inception. The Grand Inception produced the Nebulous Void. The Nebulous Void produced space-time, space-time produced the original ''[[qi]]''. A boundary [divided] the original ''[[qi]]''. That which was pure and bright spread out to form [[Tian|Heaven]]; that which was heavy and turbid congealed to form Earth. It is easy for that which is pure and subtle to converge but difficult for the heavy and turbid to congeal. Therefore, [[Diyu|Hell]] was completed first; Earth was fixed afterward. The conjoined essences of [[Tian|Heaven]] and Earth produced [[yin and yang]]. The supersessive essences of [[yin and yang]] caused the four seasons. The scattered essences of the four seasons created the myriad things. The hot ''[[qi]]'' of accumulated [[Yang (concept)|yang]] produced fire; the essence of fiery ''[[qi]]'' became the sun. The cold ''[[qi]]'' of accumulated [[yin (concept)|yin]] produced water; the essence of watery ''[[qi]]'' became the moon. The overflowing ''[[qi]]'' of the essences of the sun and the moon made the stars and planets. To [[Tian|Heaven]] belong the sun, moon, stars, and planets; to Earth belong waters and floods, dust and soil.{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|pp=114–15}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of old, in the time before there was [[Tian|Heaven]] and Earth: There were only images and no forms. All was obscure and dark, vague and unclear, shapeless and formless, and no one knows its gateway. There were two spirits, born in murkiness, one that established [[Tian|Heaven]] and the other that constructed Earth. So vast! No one knows where they ultimately end. So broad! No one knows where they finally stop. Thereupon they differentiated into the [[yin (concept)|yin]] and the [[yang (concept)|yang]] and separated into the eight cardinal directions. The firm and the yielding formed each other; the myriad things thereupon took shape. The turbid vital energy became creatures; the refined vital energy became humans.{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|pp=240–41}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Anne Birrell|Birrell]] suggests this abstract [[yin and yang|Yin-Yang]] dualism between the two primeval spirits or gods may be the "vestige of a much older mythological paradigm that was then rationalized and diminished", comparable to the [[Akkadian mythology|Akkadian]] ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' creation myth of [[Abzu]] and [[Tiamat]], male [[fresh water]] and female [[salt water]].{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=29}}

===''Lingxian''===
[[Image:ZhoushiTaijitu.png|thumb|Zhou's ''Taiji tushuo'' diagram]]
The ''Lingxian'' (靈憲), written around {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}120 by the polymath [[Zhang Heng]], thoroughly accounts for the creation of [[Tian|Heaven]] and Earth.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the Great Plainness [or Great Basis, Taisu, 太素] came to be, there was dark limpidity and mysterious quiescence, dim and dark. No image of it can be formed. Its midst was void; its exterior was non-existence. Things remained thus for long ages; this is called obscurity [''mingxing'', 溟涬]. It was the root of the [[Tao|Dao]]… When the stem of the [[Tao|Dao]] had been grown, creatures came into being and shapes were formed. At this stage, the original ''[[qi]]'' split and divided, hard and soft first divided, pure and turbid took up different positions. Heaven formed on the outside, and Earth became fixed within. [[Tian|Heaven]] took its body from the [[yang (concept)|Yang]], so it was round and in motion; Earth took its body from the [[yin (concept)|Yin]], so it was flat and quiescent. Through motion there was action and giving forth; through quiescence there was conjoining and transformation. Through binding together there was fertilization, and in time all the kinds of things were brought to growth. This is called the Great Origin [Taiyuan, 太元]. It was the fruition of the [[Tao|Dao]].{{sfnp|Cullen|2008|p=47}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later texts===
The [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] provided a multifaceted cosmology in his ''[[Taiji (philosophy)#Taijitu shuo|Taiji Tushuo]]'' (太極圖說, "Diagram Explaining the Supreme Ultimate"), which integrated the ''[[I Ching]]'' with Taoism and [[Chinese Buddhism]].

==Creation mythologies==
[[File:NuwaFuxi1.JPG|thumb|A [[Han Dynasty|Han]]-era mural depicting [[Nüwa]] with a compass and [[Fuxi]] with a square]]
In contrast to the above Chinese cosmogonic myths about the world and humans originating spontaneously without a creator (e.g., from "refined vital energy" in the ''[[Huainanzi]]''), two later [[origin myths]] for humans involve divinities. The female [[Nüwa]] fashioned people from [[loess]] and [[mud]] (in early myths) or from procreating with her brother/husband [[Fuxi]] (in later versions). Myths about the male [[Pangu]] say that people derived from mites on his corpse.

===Nüwa===
In Chinese mythology, the goddess [[Nüwa]] repaired the fallen pillars holding up the sky, creating human beings either before or after. The ancient Chinese believed in a [[Flat Earth#Ancient China|square earth]] and a round, domelike sky supported by eight giant pillars (cf. the European ideas of an ''[[axis mundi]]'').

The "Heavenly Questions" of the ''[[Chuci|Songs of Chu]]'' from around the 4th century {{sc|bc}} is the first surviving text that refers to Nüwa: "By what law was [[Nü Wa]] raised up to become high lord? By what means did she fashion the different creatures?"{{sfnp|Hawkes|1985|p=130}}

Two ''[[Huainanzi]]'' chapters record Nüwa mythology two centuries later:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Going back to more ancient times, the four [of 8] pillars were broken; the [[Nine Provinces of China|nine provinces]] were in tatters. [[Tian|Heaven]] did not completely cover [the earth]; Earth did not hold up [[Tian|[Heaven]]] all the way around [its circumference]. Fires blazed out of control and could not be extinguished; water flooded in great expanses and would not recede. Ferocious animals ate blameless people; predatory birds snatched the elderly and the weak. Thereupon, [[Nüwa]] smelted together [[Wu Xing|five-colored]] stones in order to patch up the [[qing (color)|azure]] sky, cut off the legs of the [[Ao (turtle)|great turtle]] to set them up as the four pillars, killed the black dragon to provide relief for [[Ji Province]], and piled up reeds and cinders to stop the surging waters. The [[qing (color)|azure]] sky was patched; the four pillars were set up; the surging waters were drained; the [[Nine Provinces of China|province]] of [[Ji Province|Ji]] was tranquil; crafty vermin died off; blameless people [preserved their] lives. Bearing the [[Nine Provinces of China|square [nine] provinces]] on her back and embracing [[Tian|Heaven]], [Fuxi and Nüwa established] the harmony of spring and the [[yang (concept)|yang]] of summer, the slaughtering of autumn and the restraint of winter.{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|pp=224–25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Yellow Emperor]] produced [[yin and yang]]. Shang Pian produced ears and eyes; Sang Lin produced shoulders and arms. [[Nüwa]] used these to carry out the seventy transformations?{{sfnp|Major &amp; al.|2010|p=674}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Shang Pian]] (上駢) and [[Sang Lin (deity)|Sang Lin]] (桑林) are obscure mythic divinities. The commentary of [[Xu Shen]] written around {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}100 says "seventy transformations" refers to Nuwa's power to create everything in the world.

The ''[[Fengsu Tongyi]]'' ("Common Meanings in Customs"), written by [[Ying Shao]] around {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}195, describes Han-era beliefs about the primeval goddess.
&lt;blockquote&gt;People say that when [[Tian|Heaven]] and earth opened and unfolded, humankind did not yet exist, [[Nüwa|Nü Kua]] kneaded [[yellow earth]] and fashioned human beings. Though she worked feverishly, she did not have enough strength to finish her task, so she drew her cord in a furrow through the mud and lifted it out to make human beings. That is why rich [[Chinese titles|aristocrats]] are the human beings made from [[yellow earth]], while ordinary poor commoners are the human beings made from the cord's furrow.{{refn|''Feng-su T'ung-yi'',&lt;ref&gt;CFCE, 1.83.&lt;/ref&gt; cited in [[Anne Birrell|Birrell]].{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=35}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Anne Birrell|Birrell]] identifies two worldwide mythic motifs in Ying Shao's account.{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=34}} Myths commonly say the first humans were created from clay, dirt, soil, or bone; Nüwa used mud and [[loess]]. Myths widely refer to [[social stratification]]; Nüwa created the rich from [[loess]] and the poor from mud. In contrast, the builder's cord motif is uniquely Chinese and iconographic of the Goddess. In Han iconography, Nüwa sometimes holds a builder's compass.

The 9th-century ''Duyi Zhi'' (獨異志, "A Treatise on Extraordinary Things") by [[Li Rong (philosopher)|Li Rong]] records a later tradition that Nüwa and her brother [[Fuxi]] were the first humans. In this version, the goddess has been demoted from "primal creatrix to a mortal subservient to [[Tian|God in Heaven]]" and a "lowly female subservient to the male, in the [[Women in ancient and imperial China|traditional manner of marital relations]]."{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=34}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Long ago, when the world first began, there were two people, [[Nüwa|Nü Kua]] and her older brother. They lived on [[Mount Kunlun (mythology)|Mount K'un-lun]]. And there were not yet any ordinary people in the world. They talked about becoming husband and wife, but they felt ashamed. So the brother at once went with his sister up [[Mount Kunlun (mythology)|Mount K'un-lun]] and made this prayer: "Oh [[Tian|Heaven]], if Thou wouldst send us two forth as man and wife, then make all the misty vapor gather. If not, then make all the misty vapor disperse." At this, the misty vapor immediately gathered. When the sister became intimate with her brother, they plaited some grass to make a fan to screen their faces. Even today, when a man takes a wife, they hold a fan, which is a symbol of what happened long ago.{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=35}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pangu===
One of the most popular [[creation myth]]s in [[Chinese mythology]] describes the first-born semidivine human [[Pangu]] (盤古, "Coiled Antiquity") separating the [[world egg]]-like [[Hundun]] (混沌, "primordial chaos") into [[Tian|Heaven]] and Earth. However, none of the ancient [[Chinese classics]] mentions the Pangu myth, which was first recorded in the 3rd-century ''Sanwu Liji'' (三五歴記, "Historical Records of the Three Sovereign Divinities and the Five Gods"), attributed to the [[Three Kingdoms period]] Taoist author [[Xu Zheng (Eastern Wu)|Xu Zheng]]. Thus, in classical Chinese mythology, Nüwa predates Pangu by six centuries. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Tian|Heaven]] and earth were in chaos like a chicken's egg, and [[Pangu|P'an Ku]] was born in the middle of it. In eighteen thousand years [[Tian|Heaven]] and the earth opened and unfolded. The limpid that was [[yang (concept)|Yang]] became the [[Tian|heavens]], the turbid that was [[yin (concept)|Yin]] became the earth. [[Pangu|P'an Ku]] lived within them, and in one day he went through nine transformations, becoming more divine than [[Tian|Heaven]] and wiser than earth. Each day the [[Tian|heavens]] rose ten feet higher, each day the earth grew ten feet thicker, and each day [[Pangu|P'an Ku]] grew ten feet taller. And so it was that in eighteen thousand years the [[Tian|heavens]] reached their fullest height, earth reached its lowest depth, and [[Pangu|P'an Ku]] became fully grown. Afterwards, there was the Three Sovereign Divinities. Numbers began with one, were established with three, perfected by five, multiplied with seven, and fixed with nine. That is why [[Tian|Heaven]] is ninety thousand leagues from earth.{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|32–33}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like the ''Sanwu Liji'', the ''Wuyun Linian Ji'' (五遠歷年紀, "A Chronicle of the Five Cycles of Time") is another 3rd-century text attributed to Xu Zheng. This version details the cosmological metamorphosis of Pangu's microcosmic body into the macrocosm of the physical world.{{efn|See also the ''[[Neijing Tu]]''.}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the firstborn, [[Pangu|P'an Ku]], was approaching death, his body was transformed. His breath became the wind and clouds; his voice became peals of thunder. His left eye became the sun; his right eye became the moon. His four limbs and five extremities became the four cardinal points and the [[Sacred Mountains of China|five peaks]]. His blood and semen became water and rivers. His muscles and veins became the earth's arteries; his flesh became fields and land. His hair and beard became the stars; his bodily hair became plants and trees. His teeth and bones became metal and rock; his vital marrow became pearls and jade. His sweat and bodily fluids became streaming rain. All the mites on his body were touched by the wind and evolved into the [[Han Chinese|black-haired people]].{{sfnp|Birrell|1993|p=33}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Bruce Lincoln|Lincoln]] found parallels between Pangu and the [[Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Creation myth#World parent|world parent]] myth, such as the primeval being's flesh becoming earth and hair becoming plants.{{sfnp|Lincoln|1968|pp=5–20}}

==Western scholarship==
[[Norman J. Girardot]], professor of Chinese religion at [[Lehigh University]], analyzed complications within studies of Chinese creation mythology. On the one hand, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;With regard to China there is the very real problem of the extreme paucity and fragmentation of mythological accounts, an almost total absence of any coherent mythic narratives dating to the early periods of Chinese culture. This is even more true with respect to authentic cosmogonic myths, since the preserved fragments are extremely meager and in most cases are secondary accounts historicized and moralized by the redactors of the [[Confucianism|Confucian school]] that was emerging as the predominant classical tradition during the [[Western Han dynasty|Former Han period]].{{sfnp|Girardot|1976|pp=294–95}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the other hand, there are issues with what [[Norman J. Girardot|Girardot]] calls the "China as a special case fallacy";{{sfnp|Girardot|1976|p=315}} presuming that unlike "other ancient cultures more blatantly caught up in the throes of religion and myth", China did not have any creation myths, with the exception of Pangu, which was a late, and likely foreign, importation.{{sfnp|Girardot|1976|p=298}}

[[Norman J. Girardot|Girardot]] traces the origins of this "methodological rigidity" or "benign neglect" for the study of Chinese religion and mythology back to [[Protestant missions in China|early 19th-century missionary scholars]] who sought creation myths in early Chinese texts, "the concern for the study of Chinese cosmogony on the part of the missionaries resulted in a frustration over not finding anything that resembled the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian theology|doctrine]] of a [[God the Father|rational creator God]]."{{sfnp|Girardot|1976|pp=315–16}} For instance, the missionary and translator [[Walter Henry Medhurst]] claimed Chinese religions suffered because "'no first cause' characterizes all the sects",{{sfnp|Medhurst|1838|p=181}} "the Supreme, self-existent God is scarcely traceable through the entire range of their [[metaphysics]]",{{sfnp|Medhurst|1838|p=181}} and the whole system of Chinese cosmogony "is founded in materialism".{{sfnp|Medhurst|1838|p=191}}

This "China as a special case" theory became an article of faith among 20th-century scholars. The French [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Marcel Granet]]'s influential ''Chinese Thought'' said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;it is necessary to notice the privileged place given to politics by the Chinese. For them, the history of the world does not start before the start of civilization. It does not originate by a recitation of a creation or by cosmological speculations, but with the biographies of the [[sage king]]s. The biographies of the ancient heroes of China contain numerous mythic elements; but no cosmogonic theme has entered into the literature without having undergone a transformation. All of the legends pretend to report the facts of a human history.... The predominance accorded to political preoccupation is accompanied for the Chinese by a profound repulsion for all theories of creation.{{refn|[[Marcel Granet|Granet]],{{sfnp|Granet|1934|p=283}} translated by [[Norman J. Girardot|Girardot]].{{sfnp|Girardot|1976|p=300}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some further examples are:
* "In contrast to other nations the Chinese have no mythological cosmogony; the oldest sources already attempt to account for creation in a scientific way."{{sfnp|Forke|1925|p=34}}
* "It is rather striking that, aside from this one myth [concerning Pangu], China—perhaps alone among the major civilizations of antiquity—has no real story of creation. This situation is paralleled by what we find in Chinese philosophy, where, from the very start, there is a keen interest in the relationship of man to man and in the adjustment of man to the physical universe, but relatively little interest in cosmic origins."{{sfnp|Bodde|1961|p=405}}
* "…the Chinese, amongst all peoples ancient and recent, primitive and modern, are apparently unique in having no creation myth; that is, they have regarded the world and man as uncreated, as constituting the central features of a spontaneously self-generating cosmos having no creator, god, ultimate cause, or will external to itself."{{sfnp|Mote|1971|pp=17–18}}

'''Creek mythology''' is related to a [[Muscogee|Creek]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe who are originally from the [[Southern United States|southeastern United States]], also known by their original name '''Muscogee''' (or '''Muskogee'''), the name they use to identify themselves today.&lt;ref name="Transcribed documents"&gt;[http://anpa.ualr.edu/digital_library/Additional%20Texts%20-%20Yuchi%20.htm Transcribed documents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213170748/http://anpa.ualr.edu/digital_library/Additional%20Texts%20-%20Yuchi%20.htm |date=February 13, 2012 }} Sequoyah Research Center and the American Native Press Archives&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mvskoke'' is their name in traditional spelling. Modern Muscogees live primarily in [[Oklahoma]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]]. Their language, ''[[Creek language|Mvskoke]]'', is a member of the Creek branch of the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean language family]]. The [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] are close kin to the Muscogee and speak a Creek language as well. The Creeks were considered one of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]]. After the Creek War many of the Creeks escaped to Florida to create the Seminole.

==History==
[[File:Rogan plate 1 birdman HRoe 2012.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Illustration of a [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|S.E.C.C. Falcon Dancer]] based on a [[Rogan plate]] from [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] in northern Georgia]]

The early historic Creeks were probably descendants of the [[Mississippian culture]] peoples who lived along the [[Tennessee River]], in what is now modern [[Tennessee]]&lt;ref name=Finger_2001&gt;{{cite book | last = Finger | first = John R. | title = Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition | pages = 19 | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-253-33985-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alabama, and possibly related to the [[Utinahica]] of southern Georgia. More of a loose confederacy than a single tribe, the Muscogee lived in autonomous villages in river valleys throughout what are today the states of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama also consisted of many ethnic groups speaking several distinct languages, such as the [[Hitchiti]], [[Alabama (tribe)|Alabama]], and [[Coushatta]]. Those who lived along the [[Ocmulgee River]] and the [[Oconee River]] were called "Creek Indians" by British traders from [[South Carolina]]; eventually the name was applied to all of the various natives of Creek towns becoming increasingly divided between the Lower Towns of the Georgia frontier on the [[Chattahoochee River]], Ocmulgee River, and [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] and the Upper Towns of the [[Alabama River]] Valley.

The Lower Towns included Coweta, Cusseta (Kasihta, [[Cofitachequi]]), Upper Chehaw ([[Chiaha]]), Hitchiti, Oconee, Ocmulgee, Okawaigi, [[Apalachee]], [[Yamasee]] (Altamaha), Ocfuskee, Sawokli, and Tamali. The Upper Towns included Tuckabatchee, [[Abihka]], [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] (Kusa; the dominant people of [[East Tennessee]] and [[North Georgia]] during the Spanish explorations), Itawa (original inhabitants of the [[Etowah Indian Mounds]]), Hothliwahi (Ullibahali), Hilibi, Eufaula, Wakokai, Atasi, [[Alibamu]], Coushatta (Koasati; they had absorbed the Kaski/Casqui and the [[Toqua (Tennessee)|Tali]]), and Tuskegee ("Napochi" in the de Luna chronicles).

Cusseta (Kasihta) and Coweta are the two principal towns of the Creek Nation to this day. Traditionally the Cusseta and Coweta bands are considered to the earliest members of the Creek Nation.&lt;ref name="Transcribed documents"/&gt;

The Creek believed that the world was originally entirely underwater. The only land was a hill, called [[Nunne Chaha]], and on the hill was a house, wherein lived [[Esaugetuh Emissee]] ("master of breath"). He created humanity from the clay on the hill.

The Creek also venerated the Horned Serpent [[Sint Holo]], who appeared to suitably wise young men.

In the underworld, there was only chaos and odd creatures. Master of Breath created Brother Moon and Sister Sun, as well as the four directions to hold up the world.

The first people were the offspring of Sister Sun and the Horned Serpent. These first two Creeks were Lucky Hunter and Corn Woman, denoting their respective roles in Creek Society.

[[Hisagita-imisi]] (meaning "preserver of breath"; also [[Hisakitaimisi]]) was the supreme god, a [[solar deity]]. He is also called [[Ibofanga]] ("the one who is sitting above (us)").

'''Cyclax''' was established at the end of the nineteenth century making it one of the world's oldest cosmetic companies still in operation. In the UK the only older cosmetic company is [[Yardley of London|Yardley]].

==History==
The Cyclax Company was founded in 1897 by Mrs Hemming (real name '''Frances (Fanny) Forsythe''' née Hamilton [1872-1934]) in a converted front room of a house at 58 South Molton Street, London, to provide beauty treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The House of Cyclax. Achievements of a modern pioneer|journal=SPC. Soap, perfumery &amp; cosmetics.|date=October 1964|page=882|publisher=London Trade Press Ltd.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1902, Cyclax began to sell cosmetics generally and by 1910 there were over 40 preparations in the Cyclax range including skin care products, hair care products, face powders, eye lotions, lip lotions and soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Cyclax Company|title=The cultivation and preservation of natural beauty|year=1908|publisher=The Cyclax Company|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the period before the First World War, Cyclax products went on sale in Europe and across parts of the British Empire.

=== Expansion ===
In 1919 Frances Forsythe's son, '''Gery Hamilton Forsythe''' [1896-1964], returned from the United States to help with the business and he eventually assumed control of the company. He established separate companies and local manufacturing in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Marchant&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marchant Smith|first=Mary|title=Cyclax in the fourth dimension|journal=SPC: Soap, perfumery &amp; cosmetics|date=December 1971|pages=795–796|publisher=London Trade Press Ltd.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclax salons were also established in various parts of the world maintained by Cyclax trained staff some of whom travelled to London to become international Cyclax representatives.

=== Wartime ===
The Second World War presented some problems for Cyclax. Although the business at South Molton Street survived, the factory at Tottenham Court Road was destroyed during the [[London Blitz]] and temporary facilities had to be used until the new factory was established in Harlow New Town, Essex in 1953. Cyclax made a number of contributions to the war effort including a burn treatment and a camouflage cream. In 1939 they also released a lipstick shade named 'Auxiliary Red' that was specifically designed for service women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosmetics and Skin|title=Cyclax|url=http://www.cosmeticsandskin.com/companies/cyclax.php|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this lipstick started the trend for the use of bright red lipsticks during the war.

=== Postwar period ===
This was  a difficult time for Cyclax, as it was for many British cosmetic companies who faced heavy taxation and increased competition from American firms like [[Max Factor]] and [[Revlon]]. One prominent supporter of Cyclax during this period was [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]. She used a Cyclax consultant, '''Thelma Besant''', as her Cosmetician and Beauty Adviser both before and after she was crowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elizabeth will wear little makeup but this must last for many hours|newspaper=St Petersburg Times|date=2 June 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thelma advised the Queen on skin care and cosmetics for the coronation and the numerous royal tours in the early part of her reign. A [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant of Appointment]] was issued to Cyclax in 1961.&lt;ref name=Marchant/&gt;

=== Acquisition ===
Cyclax was a family owned business until it was bought by the American merchant bankers Lehman Brothers, Inc. in 1970 on behalf of a group of private investors. They closed salon in South Molton Street, streamlined the product line and repackaged it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Forsythe Saga|newspaper=The Times|date=5 October 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the 1970s and 1980s the company passed through numerous owners including British American Tobacco and SmithKIine Beecham. It was sold by Richards &amp; Appleby Ltd.&lt;ref name=Marchant/&gt;  in October 2018 to Three Pears Ltd who plan to rejuvenate the brand. The current product range is largely based on the use of natural ingredients and will be 100% manufactured in the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2640">'''Dumah''' ({{lang-ar|دومة}}; {{Lang-he|דּוּמָה}} ''Dūmāh''; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "silence") was the sixth son of [[Ishmael]], the son of [[biblical]] [[Abraham]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]].

==Biblical references==
The generations of Ishamel are the ninth recorded in the [[Book of Genesis]]. In Genesis 21:18, the [[Mal'ak Elohim|angel of God]] promises [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] and [[Abraham]] that their seed will forge a great nation and in Genesis 17:20, it is recorded that Ishmael produced 12 sons, the forefathers of 12 tribes. Dumah is sixth son of Ishmael and is mentioned in Genesis 25:14 and 1 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 1:30.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp995&gt;Bromiley, 1979, p. 995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tribe of Dumah==
[[File:Rajalil2.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins Near [[Dumat al-Jandal|Dumah]]: it is common practice in [[Saudi Arabia]] to fence archaeological sites.]]
In the [[Book of Isaiah]] ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|21:11|KJV}}), Dumah is mentioned in the context of [[Mount Seir|Seir]], which was associated with the territory of [[Edom]] in the Negev region. Attempts to locate the tribe named for and descended from Dumah have produced multiple possible identifications.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp995/&gt; A Dumah ([[Deir ad-Duma]]) in the vicinity of [[Hebron]] which is mentioned in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 15:52 is one possibility. However, according to [[Geoffrey Bromiley]], the [[oracle]] concerning Dumah in Isaiah 21:11-12 seems better suited to a place in [[Arabia]], suggesting the site of [[Dumat al-Jandal]] as a more likely contender. Known today as [[Al-Jawf]], in ancient times it is mentioned in inscriptions of the [[Assyrian empire|Assyrian monarchs]] as ''Adummatu'' and is described as "a fortress of Arabia", "situated in the desert", that was destroyed by [[Sennacherib]]'s forces.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp995/&gt;

==Career==
Fenn received a bachelor of arts degree in history (with honors)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Clay|title=Former auto mechanic makes splash in world of history|url=http://artsandsciences.colorado.edu/magazine/2011/12/former-auto-mechanic-makes-splash-in-world-of-history/|accessdate=April 26, 2015|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Duke University]] in 1981, then attended [[Yale University]], finishing her masters in 1985. Fenn originally planned to write her dissertation on [[millenarianism]] in Native American culture, but left her doctoral program at Yale before it was finished, as she was "bored" with academia. Fenn entered the auto mechanic program at [[Durham Technical Community College]] and worked as a mechanic around the [[Durham, North Carolina]] area for eight years before returning to Yale in 1995 to complete her studies. ''Pox Americana'', her dissertation about the  [[1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic]], was written while working part-time, and completed in 1999.&lt;ref name=nyteakin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eakin|first1=Emily|title=She Can Fix Your Engine, Too|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/08/books/she-can-fix-your-engine-too.html|accessdate=November 11, 2015|work=New York Times|date=September 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenn was interviewed on multiple national news outlets about biological warfare after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=dukehicks&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Sally|title=Scholar Trades Wrenches For Writing|url=http://today.duke.edu/showcase/mmedia/features/newfaculty/fenn830.html|accessdate=April 26, 2015|publisher=Duke University|date=August 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Execution by elephant''' was a common method of [[capital punishment]] in [[south Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in [[India]], where [[Asian elephant]]s were used to [[Crushing (execution)|crush]], dismember or torture captives in [[public execution]]s. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's [[absolute monarchy|absolute power]] and his ability to control wild animals.

The sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the [[European colonialism|European empires]] that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by [[Western world|Western]] powers, such as [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Carthage]], particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.

== Cultural aspects ==
The intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than [[horse]]s: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of [[war elephant]]s with generals such as [[Hannibal]]. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.

Historically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or ''[[mahout]]'', thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities.&lt;ref name="allsen"&gt;Allsen, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Several such exercises of [[pardon|mercy]] are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of [[Siam]] trained their elephants to roll the convicted person "about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt". The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor]] [[Akbar the Great]] is said to have "used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him.&lt;ref name="Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were occasionally used in [[trial by ordeal]] in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

The use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as [[Thailand]], where [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephants]] are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

== Geographical scope ==
[[File:Execution by elephant distribution map.svg|thumb|right|350px|Geographical scope of executions by elephant]]
Execution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While [[African elephant]]s are significantly larger than [[Asian elephant]]s, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.

=== Asian powers ===

==== Southeast Asia ====
Elephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]] from the earliest historical times&lt;ref&gt;Chevers, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the kingdom of [[Champa]] on the other side of the [[Indochina|Indochinese]] Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. "The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics". University of California Press, 1985. p. 80. ASIN: B0000CLTET&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Siam]], elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]] provides the following account from Siam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YCoCwtJd1gC&amp;pg=181|title=A new account of the East Indies|publisher=John Mosman|volume=2|year=1727|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For Treason and Murder, the Elephant is the Executioner. The condemned Person is made fast to a Stake driven into the Ground for the Purpose, and the Elephant is brought to view him, and goes twice or thrice round him, and when the Elephant's Keeper speaks to the monstrous Executioner, he twines his Trunk round the Person and Stake, and pulling the Stake from the Ground with great Violence, tosses the Man and the Stake into the Air, and in coming down, receives him on his Teeth, and making him off again, puts one of his fore Feet on the Carcase, and squeezes it flat.}}

The journal of [[John Crawfurd]] records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of [[Cochinchina]] (modern south [[Vietnam]]), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where "the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death."&lt;ref&gt;Crawfurd, John. "Journal of an Embassy from the Governor-general of India to the Courts of Siam and Cochin China". H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1830. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y53maIltQQwC&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=%22On%20these%20occasions%20the%20criminal%20is%20tied%20to%20a%20stake,%20and%20the%20elephant+runs+down+upon+him%20and%20crushes%20him%20to%20death%22&amp;ei=TUotStT_DaHSkATLqPT2Bg p. 419].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Asia ====

===== India =====
Elephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike "under the feet of elephants".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; The Hindu ''[[Manu Smriti]]'' or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, "the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1305, the [[Delhi Sultanate|sultan of Delhi]] turned the deaths of [[Mongol]] prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford-Genghis Khan, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era, "it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Natesan, G.A. ''The Indian Review'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]], writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler [[Shah Jahan]] ordered an offending military commander to be carried "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] ordered the crushing by elephant of an [[imam]] he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor [[Jahangir]], is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The [[France|French]] traveler [[François Bernier]], who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment.&lt;ref name="Schimmel" /&gt; Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of [[Delhi]], elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;
The Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting [[Delhi]] in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs.}}
Other Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The [[Maratha]] [[Chatrapati]]  [[Sambhaji]] ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Maratha leader, the general [[Santaji]], inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that "for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le Toru Du MOnde.jpg|thumbnail|[[Louis Rousselet]] described this execution in ''Le Tour du Monde'' in 1868.]]
The early 19th century writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] relates how the king of [[Goa]] "keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of "human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Buffon, Georges Louis Leclerc. "Natural history of man, the globe, and of quadrupeds". vol. 1. Leavitt &amp; Allen, 1857. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at [[Baroda]] in 1814 has been preserved in ''The Percy Anecdotes'':

{{quote|The man was a slave, and two days before had murdered his master, brother to a native chieftain, called Ameer Sahib. About eleven o'clock the elephant was brought out, with only the driver on his back, surrounded by natives with bamboos in their hands. The criminal was placed three yards behind on the ground, his legs tied by three ropes, which were fastened to a ring on the right hind leg of the animal. At every step the elephant took, it jerked him forward, and every eight or ten steps must have dislocated another limb, for they were loose and broken when the elephant had proceeded five hundred yards. The man, though covered in mud, showed every sign of life, and seemed to be in the most excruciating torments. After having been tortured in this manner for about an hour, he was taken to the outside of the town, when the elephant, which is instructed for such purposes, was backed, and put his foot on the head of the criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Ryley Scott, George. "The Percy Anecdotes vol. VIII". ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages''. Torchstream Books, 1940. pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, [[Louis Rousselet]] described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a [[woodcut]] and printed in "[[Le Tour du Monde]]", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Weekly'', February 3, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing power of the [[British Empire]] led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in [[Kashmir]], since the arrival of Europeans, "many of the old customs are disappearing – and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'."&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, Eleanor. "What the Crystal Revealed". ''American Theosophist Magazine'', April to September 1914. p. 859.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sri Lanka =====
[[File:Crushed by elephant.png|thumb|right|A condemned prisoner being dismembered by an elephant in [[Ceylon]]. Illustration from ''[[An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]]'' by Robert Knox (1681).]]
Elephants were widely used across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]], writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in [[Sri Lanka]]. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their [[tusk]]s fitted with "sharp Iron with a socket with three edges". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would "then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb".&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert. "[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14346 An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]". London, 1681.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century traveler [[James Emerson Tennent]] comments that "a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk."&lt;ref&gt;Tennent, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, ''An Execution by an Eliphant''.

Writing in 1850, the British diplomat [[Henry Charles Sirr]] described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last king of [[Kandy]], to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:&lt;ref&gt;Sirr, Sir Charles Henry, quoted in Barrow, George. "Ceylon: Past and Present". John Murray, 1857. pp. 135–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the native dynasty it was the practice to train elephants to put criminals to death by trampling upon them, the creatures being taught to prolong the agony of the wretched sufferers by crushing the limbs, avoiding the vital parts. With the last tyrant king of Candy, this was a favourite mode of execution and as one of the elephant executioners was at the former capital during our sojourn there we were particularly anxious to test the creature's sagacity and memory. The animal was mottled and of enormous size, and was quietly standing there with his keeper seated upon his neck; the noble who accompanied us desired the man to dismount and stand on one side.

The chief then gave the word of command, ordering the creature to 'slay the wretch!' The elephant raised his trunk, and twined it, as if around a human being; the creature then made motions as if he were depositing the man on the earth before him, then slowly raised his back-foot, placing it alternately upon the spots where the limbs of the sufferer would have been. This he continued to do for some minutes; then, as if satisfied that the bones must be crushed, the elephant raised his trunk high upon his head and stood motionless; the chief then ordered him to 'complete his work,' and the creature immediately placed one foot, as if upon the man's abdomen, and the other upon his head, apparently using his entire strength to crush and terminate the wretch's misery.}}

==== West Asia ====
During the [[medieval]] period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] empires.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; When the Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]], who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab [[Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir|Na'aman]], Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a [[Zoroastrian]]; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.

The practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. [[Rabbi]] [[Petachiah of Ratisbon]], a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]-ruled northern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]):&lt;ref&gt;Benisch, A. (trans). "Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon". London, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Execution of Prisonsers Belgrade-Suleymanname.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] miniature depicting the execution of prisoners of war in [[Belgrade|Nándorfehérvár]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matrakci |last=Nasuh |url=http://warfare.atwebpages.com/Ottoman/Suleymanname/Execution_of_Prisonsers_Belgrade-Suleymanname.htm |title=Execution of Prisoners, Belgrade |date=1588 |work=Süleymanname, Topkapi Sarai Museum, Ms Hazine 1517}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{quote|At [[Nineveh]] there was an elephant. Its head is not protruding. It is big, eats about two wagon loads of straw at once; its mouth is in its breast, and when it wants to eat it protrudes its lip about two [[cubit]]s, takes up the straw with it, and puts it in its mouth. When the sultan condemns anyone to death, they say to the elephant, "this person is guilty." It then seizes him with its lip, casts him aloft and slays him.}}

=== Western empires ===
The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[ancient Macedonians]] occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of [[war elephant]]s for military purposes, most famously in the case of [[Hannibal]]. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. [[Perdiccas]], who became regent of [[Macedon]] on the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]] thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Robin Lane. "Alexander the Great". Penguin, 2004. p. 474. {{ISBN|0-14-008878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman writer [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: "Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm Curt. 10.6-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103055130/http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm |date=2006-01-03 }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] records how the general [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus]] "after King [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted."&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Alison (Quoted by) (ed.). "A Sourcebook on the Roman Games". Blackwell Publishing, 2006. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by [[Josephus]] and the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of [[3 Maccabees]] in connection with the [[Egyptian Jews]], though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of [[Dionysus]]. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 5&lt;/ref&gt; The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21246">'''Fernando Jurado Noboa''' (born 12 October 1949, [[Quito]]) is an [[Ecuadorian]] [[psychiatrist]], [[historian]] and [[genealogist]].

==Biography==
=== Family situation ===
Jurado was born in [[Quito]] on 12 October 1949 in the traditional neighbourhood of San Juan. His parents were Ernesto Jurado Martínez and Inés Noboa Castillo, both from Quito, and he was baptized in the El Belén church on 21 January 1950 with the names Pablo Fernando Rodrigo. His father died when Jurado was still young. During his childhood he often travelled to [[Tulcán]] and [[San Juan de Pasto]] with his mother. It was on these journeys that he discovered his vocation for studying the societies of these cities.

Even before he was old enough to go to school he showed a talent for drawing and he would occupy himself drawing the outlines of photographs of the previous century onto cardboard.  This led to his interest in reconstructing his family history and that of the rest of the country.

===Studies and academic training===
He spent some months at Santa Cecilia kindergarten and between 1955 and 1961 he attended Espejo Municipal School. From the age of six years he was helped by his stepfather, Augusto Paz Proaño, who was associated with the [[socialist]] party of [[José María Velasco Ibarra]] and who sparked Jurado Noboa’s interest in reading historical literature at the age of seven.  His family were poor throughout his school years. In 1959, at a little over 9 years old, he won his first competition for historical writing and published his first article "The imprisonment and death of [[Eugenio Espejo]]".

In 1961, he went to [[Sebastián de Benalcázar]] College and he also regularly visited the city’s public libraries. He was passionate about biographies and some years later in 1964 he became interested in [[genealogy]] as a result of his innate and insatiable curiosity regarding people’s fate.  He won a book reading competition the same year.

Between 1964 and 1967 he became interested in [[public speaking]] and he won two intercollegiate competitions: the Human Rights Contest and the Oratory Competition organized by the Americas Project.

In 1966 he was declared Best Graduate among the biology students. At that time the Benalcázar was the best college in Quito.

In 1974 when the dictatorship was at the height of its power the military announced that the remains of Ecuador’s founding fathers had been found. Jurado maintained a debate with the establishment regarding this fact through the television and press which made the authorities look ridiculous and showed that many historians said one thing in public but another in private.  This possibly led to the idea of founding a group of contemporaries to carry out research. He was already using a card catalogue for arranging data and although its organization had not yet been perfected it contained around a million cards with more than 16 million pieces of data, making it the most important private archive in the country.

===Between Medicine and History===
Between 1967 and 1975, he studied [[Medicine]] at the [[Central University of Ecuador]]. He was a member of the School of Medicine Association.

In his second year at university he studied [[anatomy]] and during this time he completely ceased his historical research. In September 1969, the notable historian and genealogist Doctor Ezio Garay Arellano (who lived in Santiago de Guayaquil) introduced Jurado to Pedro Robles y Chambers who also lived in that city. The two developed a strong friendship and they would visit the country's regional archives whenever they were able.  At this time he started his training at the Social Security Hospital that continued until his graduation.  However, he never attained the same level of knowledge regarding the history and genealogy of the city of Guayaquil and its surrounding area as Garay had.

From 1969 to 1973, Jurado undertook clinical training under Doctors Asanza, Eduardo Villacís, Max Ontaneda and Hernán Proaño, who gave him a wide range of clinical experience. In 1969 he became a member of the Faculty Board and Board of Directors of Medicine.

In 1970 he started to collaborate with the magazine “Historical Museum” that was edited by Hugo Moncayo.  In 1971 he published his research in the Bulletin of the National Academy of History as well as maintaining correspondence with specialists both within and outside the country.  In 1970 and later in 1973, he travelled to [[Colombia]] for research purposes. He spent part of 1972 in [[Peru]], broadening his historical and genealogical knowledge. In 1973, he was admitted to the Academy of History, at that time he was the youngest member to be given that honour.

In 1974 he was the representative for his faculty at the International Congress on [[Paediatrics]] in Quito.

In 1975 he started to revise Quito’s protocol archives and he graduated in medicine with honours as second in his year group.

Between 1975 and 1976, Jurado completed his year of rural medicine in Guasuntos, in the south of [[Chimborazo Province]]. The local population contained three distinct social levels that were in constant conflict. These circumstances encouraged him to investigate the sociological basis for the formation of different classes.

After visiting [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Italy]] he travelled to [[Spain]] where he carried out research in [[Madrid]] and more particularly in [[Andalucía]]. At the end of 1976 he was admitted for a year to the [[University of Pamplona]] as a post-graduate in [[psychiatry]], following a recommendation by Father José Reig Satorres. However, after six months he became a member of a team that went to study to the formation of the first psychiatric hospital in Spain to use English methods. Jurado redesigned the programme by shortening it and he co-authored a book on his experiences called “Psychiatric Assistance in Navarra”. That same year he carried out further research in the north of the peninsula.  He was made Head of the Psychiatric Department at the Institute in 1978.

He married Elena Piqueras Esparza on 11 August of the same year with whom he had three children.

He was also a Professor of pre and post graduate studies in the [[psychology]] of [[tourism]] at the [[Spanish Institute of Tourism]]. In 1979 he was Head of Psychiatry and also of Residents a second time.

==Genealogy==
===CENIGA===
Jurado founded the National Centre for Genealogical and Anthropological Studies (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Genealógicas y Antropológicas, CENIGA) in 1975, along with José Freile Larrea and his sons Juan and Carlos Freile Granizo.

He was named as Director of CENIGA and produced the first three journals published by the society. Along with the [[guayaquil]]eño traditionalist [[Rodolfo Pérez Pimentel]] Jurado organised the First Ecuadorian Genealogy Conference, which unfortunately was a failure.

===Return to Ecuador===
Spain offered Jurado a promising future but his Ecuadorian roots meant that he missed his home country. In the last year of his residency he spent many hours in the public library making a thorough examination of the 88 volumes of the genealogy encyclopaedia produced by Arturo García Carrafa.  His experiences during his time in Spain had made him less Hispanophile than he had been on his arrival.  His training is the social sciences had given him a new way of seeing things and he started to slowly develop a more mestizo conception of culture in South America.

He arrived back in Ecuador in September 1979 with the intention of revolutionizing psychiatry, which he considered to be the most backward of the specialist medical disciplines in his country.  However, he did not ingratiate himself with his peers and in January 1980 he went into practice by himself in [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]]. He also started to contribute medical and historical articles to the local newspaper ''El Heraldo''.

In March of that year he gained the position of Psychiatric Researcher for the Institute of [[Criminology]] in Quito. In addition he wrote a column on mental health for newspapers in Ambato and for the magazine ''Desde el Surco''. In the latter part of 1980 he reorganized and updated diagnostic procedures and methods of treatment at the Hospital Julio Endara to improve their scientific quality and efficacy.

From September 1980 until the end of 1982 he had a punishing work schedule in trying to balance his professional and intellectual interests.  He would start work at 7am at the National Historical Archives where he collaborated on research work with Alfredo Costales on indigenous peoples, he also lectured at Marianas College.  From 11am until 1pm he taught at La Inmaculada. From 2pm until 4pm he worked as a criminologist. He returned to the National Archive between 4pm and 6pm. He then gave private consultations between 6pm and 9pm. In addition, on two days of the week he taught [[psychopathology]] at the Central University.

In 1981 Jurado, with the help of some of his students, carried out the first investigations into the consumption of [[marihuana]] in Quito and weekend binge drinking.

===Friends of Genealogy Society===
By 1982 he came to understand that not all genealogists could work together and that ideological differences within an organization can prove a distraction. Therefore in January 1983 he resigned from CENIGA to found the Friends of Genealogy Society with Costales and Enrique Muñoz Larrea. Ecuadorian genealogy was therefore split into two areas, an obsolete, elitist, traditionalist side and a progressive, social side.

In 1983, Jurado published three magazines with the new society, which proved to be such a success that three editions had to be published of each one. The families studied were of little interest to professional genealogists but they were popular with the magazine-buying public. Jurado published his classic work ''Las coyas y pallas del Tahuantinsuyo''. The initial print run of five thousand copies sold out straight away.  [[Oswaldo Viteri]] helped with the artistic and philosophical conception of racial mixing and Xerox of Ecuador published a number of editions.

That same year the town of Ambato designated Jurado as its Official Chronicler. In addition the local press published three of his books: “Themes in the History of Ambato” (''Temas de la historia de Ambato''), “Ambatonian Chronicles” (''Crónicas de la ambateñía'') and “Biographic Dictionary of the [[Tungurahua]]'' (''Diccionario biográfico del [[Tungurahua]]''), of which only the first 50 pages were ever published. He resigned from the post of Official Chronicler after two years, as he did not want to dependant on the local authorities.  His reasoning was that he would be “less enlightened but more pedantic”. However, as the post is for life he retains the title.

By the end of 1983 he no longer worked in Ambato. From July of that year he published the SAG Collection with Servimpress up until 1992.

The success of this collection gave him the idea of increasing it to fifty volumes. He has currently exceeded this number making it the country’s largest, most important and most successful cultural collection.

Jurado was accepted into the Medicinal History Academy in 1984 for his study entitled “Doctors and Medicine during Independence” ("Los Médicos y la Medicina durante la independencia"). He was also a member of the organizing committee of the International Criminology Congress that took place in Quito.  He also published a study entitled “The descendants of Benalcázar in Ecuadorian social formation" ("Los descendientes de Benalcázar en la formación social ecuatoriana") in eight volumes. That same year he made contact with Colombian historians to discuss genealogy. This collaboration gave rise to the formation of CEGAS in [[San Juan de Pasto]] in 1985 and to the First International Genealogy Congress at the end of that year.

Jurado formed the Guayas branch of SAG in 1985 with the help of Ezio Garay. Many Ecuadorian genealogists, and those from abroad as well, started to value data found in Census, Church records (capellanías and dispensas), anecdotes and family traditions which are all elements that Jurado has promoted through he work and throughout his many years of experience.  This same year he returned to Spain for a meeting of psychiatrists who trained at Navarra University. He also undertook research in Spain and Portugal.

In 1986 he organized the 3rd International Genealogy Congress that took place in Quito with representatives from five countries.

To date he has more than 300 published titles both in the areas of history and medicine. He collaborates with the “Guayaquil University Magazine”, ''Pregón'' which is published in [[Medillín]], the “Bulletin of the National Academy of History”, Friends of Genealogy Society Magazine”, SAG, and “Medical Updates” and he is a member of its assessment committee.  He also publishes articles in “Messenger”, the "Institute of Criminology Magazine”, the “Diners Information Bulletin” and the “Culture Magazine” which is published by the Central Bank.

Along with Hernán Rodríguez Castelo he is considered to be one of the foremost Ecuadorian researchers of all time.

==Jurado’s polemic==
From the start Jurado’s work has represented a breakthrough in the dissemination of historical information in Ecuador. He has always tried to avoid prejudices that do not fit with the facts. He gives genealogy a general focus that is accessible to all social classes.

All his works reflect the multi-ethnic origins of all Ecuadorians. The contributions of Indians, Africans, Arabs and Jews in Europe and Spain are a common factor in his books, articles and lectures.  A number of his books chart the rise and fall of various Ecuadorian families as social mobility is a constant in the social dynamic throughout history.

'''Historic paint analysis''' is the [[scientific analysis]] of [[architectural coatings|architectural finishes]], including not only [[paint]]s but also metallic finishes and clear and translucent finishes used on historic [[building]]s. The primary purpose of such analysis is to determine the color of the finish used at a particular time in the building's history, usually the original construction, but not always. Secondary purposes include determination of ingredients such as media ([[water]], [[oil]], [[latex]], etc.) and [[pigments]] (organic pigments, inorganic pigments, [[dyes]], etc.). Paint analysis is also used at times as a dating technique for various building elements.

Typical problems encountered in historic paint analysis include such things as paint loss, surface deterioration, newer materials, substrates, delamination, media and pigment deterioration, and alligatoring.

==History==
Historic [[architectural]] paint analysis finds its roots in the early twentieth century in the United States. The historic preservation movement began in 1849 with the preservation of [[Mount Vernon]], the home of [[George Washington]].  Early [[preservationist]]s began to realize that paints and finishes which had survived were very important but may not have been the original, or historic, finishes.  Interest in historic wallpapers also developed with the interest in historic paint and color. One of the earliest endeavors came with the restoration of [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] funded by [[John D. Rockefeller]] in the 1920s. Early investigations by simple scraping of the finishes by Susan Nash&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. "Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum". In Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; of the surviving original buildings  yielded a palette that became popularly known as Williamsburg colors. 

In the 1950s and 1960s serious efforts at investigating original paint colors were underway at [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia by architect Penelope Hartshorne Batcheler.  Her pioneering efforts introduced, for the first time in this country, the use of a stereo microscope to more closely examine the 18th century paints at [[Independence Hall]].  Batcheler also introduced the use of the [[Munsell Color System]] for matching and referencing original paint colors.  Her landmark publication, "Paint Color Research and Restoration", was the very first publication concerning the analysis of historic architectural paints for determination of original colors. At the same time, in the [[United Kingdom]], microscopy of paint samples was developed by Joyce Plesters of the [[National Gallery, London]] who worked mainly with easel paintings but also with samples from wall-paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Plesters, 'Cross-sections &amp; Chemical Analysis of Paint Samples', ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 2, (1956), 110-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and early 1970s [[Morgan W. Phillips]] at the [[Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities]] (SPNEA) became involved with historic paint and color analysis, specifically at the Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. At the same time, E. Blaine Cliver, Historical Architect, who originally worked with Batcheler at the National Park Service (NPS) in Philadelphia, then with the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in Washington, DC and later at the Northeast Regional Office of the NPS, became involved with historic paint analysis, especially in a laboratory in Building 28 of the former [[Boston Navy Yard]]. In the early 1970s, [[Frank S. Welsh]] joined the NPS in Philadelphia and began his research and study of historic paints with Penelope Batcheler, where he introduced the use of the National Bureau of Standards Color Name Charts, ([[NIST]]) for naming the colors matched to the Munsell Color System.  Welsh also was the first to introduce the term "paint analysis" into the lexicon of historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Frank S. "Paint &amp; Color Restoration," ''The Old-House Journal'', Vol. 3, No. 8, August, 1975. 1,8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; As an independent historic paint color consultant one of his first major projects was [[Monticello]], the home of [[Thomas Jefferson]].  In the mid 1970s, Matthew J. Mosca started working for the National Trust with Blaine Cliver.  Later, as a preservation consultant, Mosca researched the historic colors of [[Mount Vernon]].

The advances in the science of paint color research by these individuals suggested that the popular Williamsburg colors had been matched to faded and aged finishes. During the 1980s and 1990s [[Colonial Williamsburg]] consulted with Welsh to undertake a comprehensive paint and color analysis on numerous buildings in the historic area.&lt;ref&gt; Taylor, Jr., Thomas H. and Pappas, Nicholas A., "Colonial Williamsburg: A Changing Spectrum," in ''Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Building''s, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his research, "the first modern scientific paint analysis" there, confirmed that the Williamsburg color palette did not represent the actual historic colors.  In addition he found that in many cases their early efforts had mistakenly matched later paint layers, some nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. 'Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum,' in, ''Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings'', Roger W. Moss, ed. (New York, John Wiley, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, paint analysis was done on site by carefully removing later paint layers to reveal a sequence of finishes down to the substrate. This was the methodology employed during the early restoration of finishes at Historic Williamsburg. Although this method is employed by a few practitioners, it is not common because of its inherent problems of misinterpretation and failure to address issues such as paint ageing and discoloration.&lt;ref&gt;see the following paper: Patrick Baty [http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/scrapes.htm “To Scrape or Not to Scrape”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120185948/http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/scrapes.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} for the drawbacks of carrying out a scrape.  This was originally published in ''Traditional Paint News'' vol.1, no.2. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Because finishes analysis is performed under laboratory conditions samples are collected in the field for later analysis and can be collected by the analyst or by his client who then ships them to him.

==Laboratory analysis==
The primary purposes of analysis are to determine historic finishes and to determine principle components such as media or basic pigments. There are two methodologies in the preparation of paint samples for microscopic analysis. The first, which is derived from the medical world, is to treat the sample as a specimen and set it into a fixed position in a permanent medium such as [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]]. The specimen is then ground to a flat finish, providing a horizontal surface for viewing under a microscope. The second is to leave the samples in a loose condition with their broken surfaces which then can be manipulated under the microscope to permit a variety of views of the layers. The primary disadvantage to the first method is that the grinding process tends to blur layers together, especially layers of similar or identical colors. It also provide only a single, fixed point of viewing. The second method lacks these disadvantages, although skill and experience is required to manipulate the samples effectively.

Following preparation of the samples, they are typically viewed under an optical microscope using either natural north light or [[Polarized light|polarized artificial light]] simulating natural north light. North light is essential in order to render the colors accurately without the effects of the yellow spectrum of direct sunlight. Each individual layer is identified and, typically, matched to the [[Munsell color system]]. The Munsell color system is a scientific system in which colors have been ranged into a color fan based upon three attributes: [[hue]] or color, the chroma or [[color saturation]], and the value or neutral [[Lightness (color)|lightness]] or darkness. Unlike color systems developed by paint manufacturers, the Munsell system provides an unchanging standard of reference which is unaffected by the marketplace and changing tastes in colors.

The hue notation, the color, indicates the relation of the sample to a visually equally spaced scale of 100 hues. There are 10 major hues, five principal and five intermediate within this scale. The hues are identified by initials indicating the central member of the group: red R, yellow-red YR, yellow Y, yellow-green YG, green G, blue-green BG, blue B, purple-blue PB, purple P, and red-purple PR. The hues in each group are identified by the numbers 1 to 10. The most purplish of the red hues, 1 on the scale of 100, is designated as 1R, the most yellowish as 10R, and the central hue as 5R. The hue 10R can also be expressed as 10, 5Y as 25, and so forth if a notation of the hue as a number is desired. Chroma indicates the degree of departure of a given hue from the neutral gray axis of the same value. It is the strength of saturation of color from neutral gray, written /0 to /14 or further for maximum color saturation.

Value, or lightness, makes up the neutral gray axis of the color wheel, ranging from black, number 1, to white at the top of the axis, number 10. A visual value can be approximated by the help of the neutral gray chips of the Rock or Soil Color chart with ten intervals. The color parameters can be expressed with figures semi-quantitatively as: hue, value/chroma (H, V/C). The color "medium red" should serve as an example for presentation with the three color attributes, 5R 5.5/6. This means that 5R is located in the middle of the red hue, 5.5 is the lightness of Munsell value near the middle between light and dark, and 6 is the degree of the Munsell chroma, or the color saturation, which is about in the middle of the saturation scale.

'''Howard Irving Chapelle''' (February 1, 1901 – June 30, 1975) was an American [[naval architect]], and curator of [[maritime history]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Washington, D.C.]] In addition, he authored many books and articles on maritime history and marine architecture.

==Biography==
Chapelle was born on February 1, 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Howard Chapelle, June 1975 |work=United States Social Security Death Index |publisher=FamilySearch |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JPSX-1J8 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1919, he worked as a marine apprentice and designer for a number of shipbuilders. After 1936, he went into business for himself, and later served as head of the [[New England]] section of the [[Historic American Merchant Marine Survey]], a [[New Deal]] project designed to research American naval history and staffed by unemployed marine architects.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web |title=SIA RU007228, Chapelle, Howard Irving, Howard I. Chapelle Papers, 1969-1975 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217385 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Chapelle served in the [[United States Army Transportation Corps]] ship and boatbuilding program, rising to lieutenant colonel. In 1950, he ventured to [[England]], where he researched colonial ship design on a [[Guggenheim fellowship]]. In 1956/57, he served the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization]] as a consultant on fishing boat construction to the [[government of Turkey]]. Upon returning to America, he was appointed Division of Transportation curator of the [[National Museum of History and Technology]]. Ten years later, in 1967, he stepped down as curator to assume the role of senior historian. He retired in 1971, accepting the title of historian emeritus.&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt;

Chapelle died in [[Lewes, Delaware]], on June 30, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard I. Chapelle Dies at 74; Marine Historian and a Writer |newspaper=New York Times |date=July 2, 1975 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/02/archives/howard-i-chapelle-dies-at-74-marine-historian-and-a-writer.html |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Chapelle was a small-boat enthusiast and sailor. He felt that inexpensive yachts based on traditional workboats were the most practical way to go sailing and designed a number of small boats. His article on a {{convert|14|ft|adj=on}} Chesapeake sharpie skiff is typical of many of his articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.duckworksmagazine.com/04/s/articles/chapelle/index.cfm |first=Howard |last=Chapelle |editor-last=O'Donnell |editor-first=Craig |title=A 14-foot Chesapeake Sharpie Skiff |work=Duckworks |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''American Small Sailing Craft'' (1951) is considered a classic among small-boat builders and historians. In it he documented many fast-vanishing American working boats.

'''Stefan Zamosius (Szamosközy)''' (1570–1612) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] and [[historian]].

==Life==
Szamosközy was born in Kolozsvár, [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvania]] (now [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]) to a [[Calvinist]] family. He completed his studies at [[Heidelberg]] and [[Padova]]&lt;!-- in which year? --&gt;. In 1593 he returned to Transylvania and started to work at [[Alba Iulia|Gyulafehérvár]] for the archive of the Transylvanian court. There he started collecting materials and writing his major work on [[History of Hungary|Hungarian history]].

[[Stephen Bocskai]] nominated him as the official court historian.

==Works==
* In Padova he published a Collection of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] inscriptions in [[Dacia]]
* he published also a numismatic treatise

His unfinished Hungarian history was never published but parts are extant in many manuscript copies. [[Farkas Bethlen (1639–1679)|Farkas Bethlen]] saved longer parts in his Transylvanian history. He designed his work based on the example of [[Antonio Bonfini]]'s Decades (Tenths). [[Sándor Szilágyi]] published Szamosközy's works in four volumes in ''Szamosközy történeti maradványai'', Budapest 1876–1880.

'''James Hardiman''' (1782–1855), also known as '''Séamus Ó hArgadáin''', was a librarian at [[NUI Galway|Queen's College, Galway]].

Hardiman is best remembered for his ''[[Hardiman's History of Galway|History of the Town and County of Galway]]'' (1820) and ''[[Irish Minstrelsy]]'' (1831), one of the first published collections of Irish poetry and songs.

[[James Hardiman Library|The university library]] now bears his name.

==Biography==
Hardiman was born in [[Westport, County Mayo]], in the west of Ireland around 1782. His father owned a small estate in County Mayo. He was trained as a lawyer and became sub-commissioner of public records in [[Dublin Castle]]. He was an active member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]],&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|first=Norman|last=Moore|wstitle=Hardiman, James|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collected and rescued many examples of Irish traditional music.

In 1855, shortly after its foundation, Hardiman became librarian of Queen's College, Galway.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|first=Norman|last=Moore|wstitle=Hardiman, James|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponyms==
[[James Hardiman  Library|The university library]] was later named in his honour.

[[File:Liège, Palais Provincial05a, statues de Henri de Hornes, Jean d'Outre Meuse et Jean le Bel.JPG|thumb|Statue of Jean le Bel (right) at the façade of the provincial palace in Liège]]
'''Jean Le Bel''' (c. 1290 – 15 February 1370) was a chronicler from [[Liège (city)|Liege]]. 

==Biography==
Jean Le Bel's father, Gilles le Beal des Changes, was an alderman of [[Liège (city)|Liege]]. Jean entered the church and became a canon of the cathedral church, but he and his brother Henri followed Jean de Beaumont to England in 1327, and took part in the border warfare against the Scots. His will is dated 1369, and his epitaph gives the date of his death as 1370. Nothing more is known of his life, but [[Jacques de Hemricourt]], author of the ''Miroir des nobles de Hesbaye'', has left a eulogy of his character, and a description of the magnificence of his attire, his retinue and his hospitality. Hemricourt asserts that he was eighty years old or more when he died.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=349}}

For a long time Jean was only known as a chronicler through a reference by [[Jean Froissart]], who quotes him in the prologue of his first book as one of his authorities. A fragment of his work in the manuscript of [[Jean d'Outremeuse]]'s ''Ly Myreur des Histors'', was discovered in 1847; and the whole of his chronicle, preserved in the library of [[Châlons-en-Champagne|Chálons-sur-Marne]], was edited in 1863 by L. Polain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=349–350}}

Jean was one of the first chroniclers to write in French instead of Latin.  He was a soldier and companion of Jean, Count de Beaumont and travelled with him to England and Scotland in 1327.  At the request of the duke, he wrote ''Vrayes Chroniques'' ("True Chronicles"), which recorded the events of the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].  He is believed to be the first person to use interviews to confirm and supplement his facts.{{CN|date=July 2015}} Jean gives as his reason for writing a desire to replace a certain misleading rhymed chronicle of the wars of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] by a true relation of his enterprises down to the beginning of the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=350}}

[[Jean Froissart]] was greatly influenced by him and borrowed from his texts. Jean entered the church and became a canon of the cathedral church, but he and his brother Henri followed Jean de Beaumont to England in 1327 and took part in the border warfare against the [[Scotland|Scots]]. His will is dated 1369, and his epitaph gives the date of his death as 1370. Nothing more is known of his life, but [[Jacques de Hemricourt]], author of the ''Miroir des nobles de Hesbaye'' ("Mirror of the Nobles of Hesbaye"), has left a eulogy of his character, and a description of the magnificence of his attire, his retinue and his hospitality.

In the matter of style Le Bel has been placed by some critics on the level of Froissart. His chief merit is his refusal to narrate events unless either he himself or his informant had witnessed them. This scrupulousness in the acceptance of evidence must be set against his limitations. He takes on the whole a similar point of view to Froissart's; he has no concern with national movements or politics; and, writing for the public of [[chivalry]], he preserves no general notion of a campaign, which resolves itself in his narrative into a series of exploits on the part of his heroes. Froissart was considerably indebted to him, and seems to have borrowed from him some of his best-known episodes, such as the death of [[Robert the Bruce]], Edward III, and the [[Catherine Montagu, Countess of Salisbury|countess of Salisbury]], and the devotion of the burghers of [[Calais]]. The songs and [[virelais]], in the art of writing which he was, according to Hemricourt, an expert, have not come to light.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=350}}

'''Johannes de Thurocz''' ({{lang-hu|Thuróczy János}}; {{lang-sk|Ján z Turca}} or ''Ján de Turocz'', {{lang-de| Johannes de Thurocz}}, variant contemporary spelling: ''de Thwrocz'') ([[circa|c.]] 1435&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;1488 or 1489), was a [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] historian&lt;ref name=Setton &gt;{{cite book |title= The Papacy and the Levant |first=Kenneth|last=Meyer Setton |authorlink= |author2= |year=1978 |publisher=Diane |location= |isbn= 9780871691279 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Sz2VYI0l1IC&amp;pg=PA182J&amp;d=Johannes+de+Thurocz |accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Lucian|editor-last=Boia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrENAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Thuroczy+was+the+first&amp;pg=207|title=Great historians from antiquity to 1800: an international dictionary|volume=1|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1989|page=207|isbn= 9780313245176|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the author of the [[Latin]] ''[[Chronica Hungarorum]]'' ("Chronicle of the Hungarians"), the most extensive 15th-century work on Hungary, and the first chronicle of Hungary written by a layman.

==Life==
Thurocz's parents came from [[Turóc County]] (formerly also spelled as Thurocz), [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Turiec]] region, [[Slovakia]]) where they were members of a yeoman family recorded since the first half of the 13th century (the village of Nádasér). Johannes' uncle Andreas received a property at [[Pýr]] as a donation from King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]], and Johannes' father Peter inherited this estate.

Thurocz was educated in a [[Premonstratensian]] monastery in [[Ipolyság]] (now [[Šahy]], [[Slovakia]]), where he studied [[Latin]] and law. In 1465 he appeared in [[Buda]], as a prosecutor of the Premonstratensian monastery of Ipolyság. From 1467 to 1475 he served as a notary of the [[judge royal]] [[Ladislaus Pálóci]], from 1476 to 1486 as the main notary of the judge royal [[Stephen V Báthory|Stephen Báthory]] at the royal court, and from 1486 to 1488 as a head notary and judge of the royal personnel clerk [[Thomas Drági]]. No evidence of any university studies has been preserved, and it is possible that the title {{lang-la|"magister"}} in front of his name was merely a polite title for an official or civil servant.

==Chronicle{{anchor|Thurocz's Chronicle}}==
[[File:Matei Corvin Johannes de Thurocz f137.jpg|thumb|right|Matthias Corvinus as depicted in ''[[Chronica Hungarorum]]'' by Johannes de Thurocz]]

Thurocz's chronicle was written in three main parts:

* The first part is Thurocz's interpretation of a poem by [[Lorenzo de Monacis]] of [[Venice]]. It deals with the rule of King [[Charles II of Hungary]], and was probably written on the initiative of Thurocz's superior Stephen of Haserhag (the general notary of the Royal court), or perhaps that of the country judge Thomas Drági. Physically, this part is attached to part c) below.
*Thurocz wrote the second part was written in 1486 and describes the deeds of [[List of rulers of Hungary|Hungarian kings]] up to [[Louis the Great]]. This part in turn consists of three sub-sections:
:# the so-called Hunnish chronicle based on old Hungarian chronicles ([[Chronicon Pictum]], [[Buda Chronicle]]) and preserved manuscripts, in which Thurocz attempts to correct the errors of his predecessors;
:# an interpretation of the history of the Hungarian Kingdom from 895 (arrival of the Magyars) until the rule of King [[Charles I of Hungary]] (1307&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;42);
:# a history of part of the reign of [[Louis I of Hungary]] (reigned 1342&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;82), which arose through incorporation of a chronicle written by [[John of Küküllő]]. 
*The third part describes events from the death of King Charles II the Small (died 1386) until the conquest of [[Vienna]] and [[Wiener Neustadt]] by King [[Matthias Corvinus]] in August 1487; this can be considered Thurocz's own original work, and was mostly written in early 1487. It was inspired by the famous historico-geographical lexicon ''Cosmographia'' by [[Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini]] and was based largely on existing diplomatic documents and letters. However, information from the ''Cosmographia'' was selected somewhat one-sidedly and haphazardly.

According to his own words in the work's dedication, Thurocz had no ambitions as an historian. In fact, his chronicle contains many errors and omits a number of significant events. Besides more reliable sources, the work relies extensively on oral tradition, folk songs and anecdotes, and contains many references to "miraculous" events and wonders.

Destiny and fortune play a significant role in history as seen by Thurocz. Like many of his contemporaries he was convinced of the close relationship between human fortune, historical events and the motion of celestial bodies.

Thurocz sought an explanation of a number of events in the [[moral imperative]]. He gave much attention to describing the inner feelings of historical characters, but had an evident tendency to idealize the Hungarian heroes [[Attila]] and [[Matthias Corvinus]], while downplaying the significance of Hungary's queens.

The '''Limelight Department''' was one of the world's first film studios, beginning in 1898, operated by [[The Salvation Army]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The Limelight Department produced evangelistic material for use by the Salvation Army, including [[lantern slide]]s as early as 1891, as well as private and government contracts. In its 19 years of operation, the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it one of largest film producers of its time.

== Beginnings ==
{{The Salvation Army}}
The Salvation Army Limelight Department unofficially started in 1891, when Adjutant Joseph Perry started a photographic studio in [[Ballarat]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to supplement the income of the Salvation Army's [[Prison Gate Home]]. At the time, Perry was on compassionate leave from active ministry, as his wife Annie had died earlier that year, leaving Perry to raise their three children. In September 1891, Perry was temporarily reassigned to the Australasian Headquarters in Melbourne to assist Australasian commander, Commissioner [[Thomas Coombs]], in putting together a presentation of General [[William Booth]]'s ''In Darkest England'' program. At this stage, Perry was using [[Magic lantern|lantern slides]] which projected hand coloured photographs onto a large screen. Coombs was impressed by the quality and effectiveness of presentation, making Perry's move to Melbourne permanent. The Limelight Department was officially established on 11 June 1892.
In  1896, when Commissioner Coombs was replaced as Australasian commander by General Booth’s youngest son, 'Commandant [[Herbert Booth]]. Booth immediately warmed to the innovation of the Limelight Department, giving Perry the freedom and the financial support to expand into the newly developing medium of [[film]]. Under Booth’s direction, Perry started work on ''Social Salvation'' in 1898, one of the first presentations of its type to integrate the traditional lantern slides with film segments. On 20 December 1899, the Limelight Department premiered a series on the ''Passion'' at the [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]] corps. The presentation contained thirteen, ninety second sections which portrayed the life of [[Jesus]] from birth to death. The presentation was similar in style to that produced by the Lumiere Company earlier that year, however, as none of the original film remains, it can never be determined if the Limelight Department used Lumiere footage in the presentation.

== ''Soldiers of the Cross'' ==
The major innovation of the Limelight Department would come in 1899 when Booth and Perry began work on ''[[Soldiers of the Cross (film)|Soldiers of the Cross]]'', arguably the first feature-length film (see the last section, below).&lt;ref&gt;Ray Edmonson, "Soldiers of the Cross", ''Cinema Papers'', July 1977 p15, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation contained fifteen ninety-second sections and two hundred lantern slides, and ran for nearly two and a half hours. While some Lumiere footage was used in the opening passion sequence of the film, the majority of the footage was filmed in Melbourne, either in the attic of 69 Bourke Street, on the tennis court of the Murrumbeena Girls Home, or in the pool at [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] Baths.

The presentation itself focused of the lives and deaths of early Christian martyrs and cost £550 to produce. The scenes were considered extremely violent for their time, including such images as the stoning of [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], the burning of [[Polycarp]] and unnamed Christians being tortured, beheaded, killed by gladiators, drowned, or burned alive. The presentation included a cast of 150 Salvation Army officers who were stationed in Melbourne at the time. The many death scenes took their toll, with the cast suffering various injuries, including scorched hair and eyebrows from the fires used. The presentation premiered on 13 September 1901, at the Melbourne Town Hall, to a crowd somewhere between three and four thousand. One reviewer spoke of how the death scenes caused several women to faint in the aisles.

== The Federation of Australia ==
''Soldiers of the Cross'' fortified the Limelight Department as a major player in the early film industry. However, ''Soldiers of the Cross'' would be dwarfed by ''[[Inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth (film)|Inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth]]'', when the Limelight Department was commissioned to film the 1901 [[Federation of Australia]]. It was the hope of the New South Wales government that the film would prove an imperishable record of the event, though little of the footage still exists. Perry set up five cameras at various point of the procession route and had to use a fire carriage to move quickly from one camera to the next.

== The height of operation ==
In order that ''Soldiers of the Cross'' could be seen by a wide audience, the Limelight Department created groups known as [[Biorama Companies]]. Teams of musicians, lecturers, and projectionists would travel throughout Australia presenting the material that the Limelight Department had produced. Screenings were generally held in local halls, but it was the Biorama Companies sometimes used the sides of buildings as screens so that passersby could see it. When Herbert left the Salvation Army (taking the original ''Soldiers of the Cross'' material with him), he was replaced by Commissioner [[Thomas McKie]]. McKie encouraged the expansion of the Limelight Department, the creation of additional Biorama Companies and even the reshooting of ''Soldiers of the Cross'' in 1909, titled ''[[Heroes of the Cross]]''. In addition to the evangelical material produced for the Biorama Companies, the Limelight produced many films for private clients and the government. Some of the most notable of these were films showing the royal visit of the [[Duke]] and [[Duchess]] of [[York]] for the opening of the first sitting of the [[Parliament of Australia]] (the session itself could not be filmed due to poor lighting), the visit of America's [[Great White Fleet]], and the Victoria's [[Second Boer War]] Contingent leaving [[South Africa]]. Engaging in such private contracts was a way in which the Limelight Department raised capital to support its operation and the operation of other Salvation Army programs.

== The end of the Limelight Department ==
In 1910, McKie was replaced as the Australasian commander by a more conservative Commissioner named James Hay. Hay felt that cinema was not something that the church should be involved in and he shut down the Limelight Department at the height of its operation. In his autobiography ''Aggressive Salvationism'', Hay wrote ’the cinema, as conducted by The Salvation Army, had led to weakness and a lightness incompatible with true Salvationism and was completely ended by me.’

== Is ''Soldiers of the Cross'' the world's first feature film? ==

For many years, a question mark has hung over the question of whether ''Soldiers of the Cross'' should be counted as the first feature film. The issues of concern are basically length of the footage, length of the presentation, and the continuity of the storyline.

A feature film is generally defined as running for over sixty minutes with a constant storyline running throughout. Placed end to end, the film footage in ''Soldiers of the Cross'' equals twenty-two and a half minutes, falling short of the time requirements. Furthermore, the film did not have one long story, but rather a collection of short stories which also seems to disqualify it from contention. However, it has been argued that as the entire presentation, including films strips, lantern slides and live sections, runs for over two hours, ''Soldiers of the Cross'' should be considered a feature film.

In 1902, the year after ''Soldiers of the Cross'' was made, the Limelight Department produced ''[[Under Southern Skies]]'', a film examining life in Australia from European Settlement to Federation. This film ran about one hundred minutes but as it is a documentary, not a dramatised story, it is not considered to be a feature film. ''Heroes of the Cross'' ran for about 75 minutes and contained a more defined story thread than its predecessor; however, it was produced in 1909, three years after ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906) which is considered by most people to be the actual first feature film, including the [[Australian Film Commission]].

'''Thomas Lindsay Buick''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CMG}} (13 May 1866 – 22 February 1938) was a [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal]] [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] for Wairau, New Zealand, a journalist and a historian. He published under the name '''T. Lindsay Buick'''.

==Early life==
Buick was born in [[Oamaru]] in 1865 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's Who in New Zealand and the Western Pacific |accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1866.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=186}} His parents emigrated from England to [[Port Chalmers]] in 1860. Lindsay Buick received his education at schools in Oamaru and moved to [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] in 1884 to work as a carpenter. Although he had no relation to Ireland or Catholicism, he joined the [[Irish National League]] "purely as a lover of liberty and justice", and in 1889 he embarked on a speaker tour. He was also active in the [[temperance movement]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Buick"&gt;{{DNZB|Traue|James Edward|3b57|Buick, Thomas Lindsay|23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buick represented the [[Wairau (New Zealand electorate)|Wairau]] electorate in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] from 1890 to 1896, when he was defeated.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=186}}{{sfn|Hamer|1988|p=361}}  The [[New Zealand general election, 1896|1896 general election]] was contested by Buick and [[Charles H. Mills]], who received 2014 and 2072 votes, respectively. Mills thus succeeded Buick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Elections|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HNS18961207.2.22|accessdate=24 July 2011|newspaper=Hawera &amp; Normanby Star|volume=XXXIII |issue=3416 |date=7 December 1896|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, in July 1904 he unsuccessfully contested [[Pahiatua by-election, 1904|Pahiatua by-election]] as the official Liberal candidate.&lt;ref name="DNZB Buick" /&gt;

==Historical work==
Buick wrote numerous works on the pre-European and early contact history New Zealand, and two books on music. His ''The [[Treaty of Waitangi]]: or, How New Zealand became a British Colony'' (1916) remained the only substantial work on the Treaty until the late 1980s.

Later, he was owner/publisher of the ''[[Dannevirke]] Advocate''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, p.312&lt;/ref&gt;

Buick was appointed Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in the [[1933 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33946 |date=2 June 1933 |page=3803 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]].&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | accessdate=2 July 2013 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was educated by a certain Tigernach, and having become a [[monk]] in 1052&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Marianus Scotus|author=[[William Turner (bishop of Buffalo)|William Turner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; he crossed over to the continent of Europe in 1056, and his subsequent life was passed in the abbeys of St Martin at [[Cologne]] and of [[Abbey of Fulda|Fulda]], and at [[Mainz]]. 
He died at Mainz, on December 22, 1082 or 1083,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Marianus Scotus|first=Charles Lethbridge|last=Kingsford|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in [[Mainz Cathedral]].

Marianus wrote a ''Chronicon'', which purports to be a [[universal history]] from the creation of the world to 1082.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard E. Boyle ''Medieval Latin Palaeography: A Bibliographical Introduction''  1984 - Page 97 "the chronicle of Marianus Scotus of Mainz"&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' was very popular during the [[Middle Ages]], and in England was extensively used by [[John of Worcester]] and other writers.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Reed Kline ''Maps of Medieval Thought: The Hereford Paradigm'' 2001  Page 221 "In particular she cites the importance of the Universal Chronicle of Marianus Scotus of Mainz which was brought to Hereford by Bishop Robert of Hereford (1079-95);"&lt;/ref&gt; It was first printed at [[Basel]] in 1559, and has been edited with an introduction by [[Georg Waitz]] for the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].

==Life==
Born in [[County Mayo]] on 1 December 1809, he received most of his education at the [[Irish College, Paris]]. He came to Dublin in 1836. In the following year he joined the staff of the ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'', with which he was connected until 1850.{{sfn|Archbold|1891}}

In 1851 Haverty made an extended tour through Europe, which he described in a long series of newspaper contributions. On his return to Dublin Haverty was made sub-librarian at the King's Inns, where he remained for nearly a quarter of a century, devoting himself principally to the preparation of a general index to the books in the library. He died in Dublin on 18 Jan. 1887, and was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]]. [[Joseph Patrick Haverty]] was his brother.{{sfn|Archbold|1891}}

* ‘Wanderings in Spain in 1843,’ London, 2 vols., 1844. 
* ‘The History of Ireland, Ancient and Modern. Derived from our native annals … with copious Topographical and general Notes,’ Dublin, 1860. The materials for this history were largely gathered abroad. A second and enlarged edition appeared in 1885.

The concept of '''multiple discovery''' (also known as '''simultaneous invention''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Griswold, Martin | date = 2012-11-25 | title = Are Inventions Inevitable?

==Multiples==
When [[List of Nobel laureates#Laureates|Nobel laureates]] are announced annually—especially in physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine, and economics—increasingly, in the given field, rather than just a single laureate, there are two, or the maximally permissible three, who often have independently made the same discovery.{{says who?|date=April 2016}}{{cn|date=April 2016}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Robert K Merton.jpg|thumb|[[Robert K. Merton]]]] --&gt;
Historians and sociologists have remarked on the occurrence, in [[science]], of "multiple independent discovery". [[Robert K. Merton]] defined such "multiples" as instances in which similar [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] are made by scientists working independently of each other. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert K. |last=Merton |title=Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science |journal=European Journal of Sociology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=237–282 |year=1963 |doi=10.1017/S0003975600000801 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=eprv7hMdO-IC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;q=multiples&amp;vq=multiples&amp;dq=Merton+multiples |isbn=9780226520704 }} Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton|Merton, Robert K.]], ''The Sociology of Science,'' op. cit., pp. 371–382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MertonSociology73&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Robert K. Merton|Merton, Robert K.]] | year = 1973 | title = The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations | place = Chicago, IL, USA | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | pages = }} {{full|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton contrasted a "multiple" with a "singleton"—a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.&lt;ref name=MertonSocStruct96&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Robert K. Merton|Merton, Robert K.]] | year = 1996 | editor = [[Piotr Sztompka | Sztompka, Piotr]] | title = On Social Structure and Science | place = Chicago, IL, USA | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | page = 307 }} {{full|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Merton said, "Sometimes the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so; sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which, unknown to him, somebody else has made years before."&lt;ref name = MertonSociology73/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Sommer has introduced the term "nulltiple" to describe a scientific discovery that is suppressed or blocked from publication or dissemination via normal scientific channels, see {{cite journal |first=Toby J. |last=Sommer |title=Bahramdipity and Nulltiple Scientific Discoveries |journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–104 |url=http://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/Sommer.pdf |doi=10.1007/s11948-001-0025-7|pmid=11214387 }}. Per Sommer, nulltiple discoveries are often made serendipitously as part of an otherwise directed research program.{{verification needed|date=April 2016}} As such, they are less likely to be re-discovered by others as is the case with many multiples. Sometimes nulltiples do eventually come to light, but often within circumstances of historical research rather than as a primary scientific disclosure.{{verification needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and others, described by A. Rupert Hall;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Rupert |last=Hall |title=Philosophers at War: The Quarrel between Newton and Leibniz |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0521227322 }} {{full|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} the 18th-century discovery of [[oxygen]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others;{{cn|date=April 2016}} and the [[theory of evolution]] of [[species]], independently advanced in the 19th century by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref name = Reeve09&gt;{{cite book | author = Reeve, Tori | year = 2009 | title = Down House: the Home of Charles Darwin | location = London, ENG | publisher = [[English Heritage]] | pages = 40–41}}{{better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}} What holds for discoveries, also goes for [[invention]]s.{{says who?|date=April 2016}}{{cn|date=April 2016}} Examples are the [[blast furnace]] (invented independently in China, Europe and Africa),{{cn|date=April 2016}} the [[crossbow]] (invented independently in China, Greece, Africa, northern Canada, and the Baltic countries),{{cn|date=April 2016}} and [[magnetism]] (discovered independently in Greece, China, and India).{{cn|date=April 2016}}

Multiple independent discovery, however, is not limited to only a few historic instances involving giants of scientific research. Merton believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the ''common'' pattern in science.&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Robert K., "Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: a Chapter in the Sociology of Science," ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]'', 105: 470–86, 1961. Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton|Merton, Robert K.]], ''The Sociology of Science,'' op. cit., pp. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
{{essay | section|date=April 2016}}
Multiple discoveries in the history of science provide evidence for [[evolution]]ary models of science and technology, such as [[memetics]] (the study of self-replicating units of culture), [[evolutionary epistemology]] (which applies the concepts of [[biological evolution]] to study of the growth of human knowledge), and [[cultural selection theory]] (which studies sociological and cultural evolution in a Darwinian manner).{{cn|date=April 2016}}

A [[recombinant DNA|recombinant-DNA]]-inspired "[[paradigm]] of paradigms" has been posited, that describes a mechanism of "recombinant conceptualization."&lt;ref name = Kasparek94&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Christopher Kasparek| Kasparek, Christopher ]]| year = 1994 | title = Prus' ''Pharaoh'': the Creation of a Historical Novel | format = article | journal = [[The Polish Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm predicates that a new [[concept]] arises through the crossing of pre-existing concepts and [[fact]]s.&lt;ref name = Kasparek94&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Christopher Kasparek| Kasparek, Christopher ]]| year = 1994 | title = Prus' ''Pharaoh'': the Creation of a Historical Novel | format = article | journal = [[The Polish Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is what is meant when one says that a scientist or artist has been "influenced by" another—[[etymology|etymologically]], that a concept of the latter's has "flowed into" the mind of the former.&lt;ref name = Kasparek94&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Christopher Kasparek| Kasparek, Christopher ]]| year = 1994 | title = Prus' ''Pharaoh'': the Creation of a Historical Novel | format = article | journal = [[The Polish Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not every new concept so formed will be viable: adapting [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] [[Herbert Spencer]]'s phrase, only the fittest concepts survive.&lt;ref name = Kasparek94&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Christopher Kasparek| Kasparek, Christopher ]]| year = 1994 | title = Prus' ''Pharaoh'': the Creation of a Historical Novel | format = article | journal = [[The Polish Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple independent discovery and invention, like discovery and invention generally, have been fostered by the evolution of means of [[communication]]: [[road]]s, [[vehicle]]s, [[sailing ship|sailing vessel]]s, [[writing]], [[printing]], institutions of [[education]], reliable [[postal service]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin McGinn]], "Groping Toward the Mind" (review of [[George Makari]], ''Soul Machine:  The Invention of the Modern Mind'', Norton, 656 pp., $39.95; and [[A.C. Grayling]], ''The Age of Genius:  The Seventeenth Century and the Birth of the Modern Mind'', Bloomsbury, 351 pp., $30.00), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 11 (June 23, 2016), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[telegraphy]], and [[mass media]], including the [[internet]].{{says who?|date=April 2016}}{{cn|date=April 2016}}  [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s invention of printing (which itself involved a number of discrete inventions) substantially facilitated the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to [[modern history|modern times]].{{cn|date=April 2016}} All these communication developments have [[catalyze]]d and accelerated the process of recombinant conceptualization,{{what?|date=April 2016}} and thus also of multiple independent discovery.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

[[List of multiple discoveries|Multiple independent discoveries]] show an increased incidence beginning in the 17th century.  This may accord with the thesis of British philosopher [[A.C. Grayling]] that the 17th century was crucial in the creation of the modern  [[world view]], freed from the shackles of religion, the occult, and uncritical faith in the authority of [[Aristotle]].  Grayling speculates that Europe's [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-48), with the concomitant breakdown of authority, made freedom of thought and open debate possible, so that modern science rests on the heads of millions of dead.  He also notes the importance of the development of a reliable [[postal service]] in enabling savants to be in scholarly communication; the cooperative approach, first recommended by [[Francis Bacon]], was essential to making science open to [[peer review]] and public verification, and not just a matter of the lone individual issuing idiosyncratic pronouncements."&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin McGinn]], "Groping Toward the Mind" (review of [[George Makari]], ''Soul Machine:  The Invention of the Modern Mind'', Norton, 656 pp., $39.95; and [[A.C. Grayling]], ''The Age of Genius:  The Seventeenth Century and the Birth of the Modern Mind'', Bloomsbury, 351 pp., $30.00), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 11 (June 23, 2016), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanities==
The [[paradigm]] of recombinant conceptualization (see above)—more broadly, of recombinant occurrences—that explains multiple discovery in science and the arts, also elucidates the phenomenon of [[historic recurrence]], wherein similar events are noted in the [[history|histories]] of countries widely separated in time and geography. It is the recurrence of [[pattern]]s that lends a degree of [[prediction|prognostic]] power—and, thus, additional scientific validity—to the findings of [[history]].&lt;ref name = Trompf79&gt;{{cite book | author = Trompf, G.W. | year = 1979 | title = The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought, from Antiquity to the Reformation | location = Berkeley, CA, USA | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0520034792 | page = }}{{full|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

==The arts==
Lamb and Easton, and others, have argued that science and [[art]] are similar with regard to multiple discovery.&lt;ref name=LambEaston84/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name = Kasparek94/&gt; When two scientists independently make the same discovery, their papers are not word-for-word identical, but the core ideas in the papers are the same; likewise, two novelists may independently write novels with the same core themes, though their novels are not identical word-for-word.&lt;ref name=LambEaston84/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

==Civility==
{{editorial | section|date=April 2016}}
Discoverers understandably take pleasure in their accomplishments and generally seek to claim primacy to their discoveries.{{says who?|date=April 2016}}{{cn|date=April 2016}}  When it transpires that a discovery has multiple originators, they may either agree to share the credit or insist on their own exclusive primacy.{{says who?|date=April 2016}}{{cn|date=April 2016}}

After [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] had exchanged information on their respective systems of [[calculus]] in the 1670s, Newton in the first edition of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (1687), in a ''[[scholium]]'', apparently accepted Leibniz's independent discovery of calculus.  In 1699, however, a Swiss mathematician suggested to Britain's [[Royal Society]] that Leibniz had borrowed his calculus from Newton.  In 1705 Leibniz, in an anonymous review of Newton's ''[[Opticks]]'', implied that Newton's ''[[Newton's notation|fluxions]]'' (Newton's term for [[differential calculus]]) were an adaptation of Leibniz's calculus.  In 1712 the Royal Society appointed a committee to examine the documents in question; the same year, the Society published a report, written by Newton himself, asserting his priority.  Soon after Leibniz died in 1716, Newton denied that his own 1687 ''Principia'' [[scholium]] "allowed [Leibniz] the invention of the ''calculus differentialis'' independently of my own"; and the third edition of Newton's ''Principia'' (1726) omitted the tell-tale scholium.  It is now accepted that Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = [[Will Durant|Durant, Will]] &amp; [[Ariel Durant|Durant, Ariel]] | year = 1963 | title = The Age of Louis XIV:  A History of European Civilization in the Period of Pascal, Molière, Cromwell, Milton, Peter the Great, Newton, and Spinoza, 1648-1715 | series = [[The Story of Civilization|The Story of Civilization: Part VIII]] | location = New York, NY | publisher = Simon and Schuster | pages = 532–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another classic case of multiple discovery, the two discoverers showed more [[civility]].  By June 1858 [[Charles Darwin]] had completed over two-thirds of his ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' when he received a startling letter from a naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], 13 years his junior, with whom he had corresponded.  The letter summarized Wallace's [[theory of natural selection]], with conclusions identical to Darwin's own.  Darwin turned for advice to his friend [[Charles Lyell]], the foremost geologist of the day.  Lyell proposed that Darwin and Wallace prepare a joint communication to the scientific community.  Darwin being preoccupied with his mortally ill youngest son, Lyell enlisted Darwin's closest friend, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], director of [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]], and together on 1 July 1858 they presented to the [[Linnean Society]] a joint paper that brought together Wallace's abstract with extracts from Darwin's earlier, 1844 essay on the subject.  The paper was also published that year in the Society's journal.  Neither the public reading of the joint paper nor its publication attracted the least interest; but Wallace, "admirably free from envy or jealousy," had been content to remain in Darwin's shadow.&lt;ref name = Reeve09/&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}}

The '''Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project''' ('''OLOHP''') is a [[Oral History|collection of interviews]] created by [[Arden Eversmeyer]] for the [[Sophia Smith Collection]] to document and appreciate the lives of members of Old Lesbians Organizing for Change (OLOC). The project contains over 150 interviews and transcripts, many of which include secondary documents pertaining to their subjects such as photographs, artwork, and newspaper clippings.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://media.smith.edu/departments/ssc/olohp/olohp_list.html
 | title=OLOHP main page
 | publisher=Sophia Smith Collection
 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviewees come from a variety of backgrounds and places but are all lesbians over the age of 70.

== History ==

The Old Lesbians Organizing for Change were founded in 1987 in response to the blatant combination of ageism and sexism in regards to older lesbians. The initial meeting was inspired by the publication of Look Me in the Eye: Old Women, Aging and Ageism by  Barbara Macdonald and Cynthia Rich in 1983, 4 years prior.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss547_bioghist.html
 | title=Old Lesbians Organizing for Change Records
 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the organization is to "confront ageism in our communities and our country" through education and public discourse. They were a major presence at a variety of national lesbian events such as the National Lesbian Conference in Atlanta in 1991 hosted by the [[Atlanta Lesbian Feminist Alliance]] and the [[March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation|March on Washington]]. Supporters may be of any age and younger individuals warmly welcomed, however the minimum age of membership is 60 years old.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.oloc.org/about/index.php
 | title=Old Lesbians Organizing for Change About Page
 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 OLOC reached an even higher level of legitimacy as they reached non-profit status in the state of Texas to continue their work.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.oloc.org/herstory2.php
 | title=Old Lesbians Organizing for Change Herstory
 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLOC continues to be an active force in pursuing the equality for all.

The ""Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project" is the culmination of the individual stories of some of the founding members of OLOC. Originally created by [[Arden Eversmeyer]] the project seeks to expose the life stories of women from past generations, including images and other supplementary documents. Eversmeyer was inspired to gather these oral histories when she observed friends passing away in her area and was concerned that their stories would never be shared. While subjects such as [[feminism]] and [[civil rights]] are touched upon in many of the interviews, there is no common focus other than the shared experience of old lesbians. Much of the material is purely autobiographical in nature.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite web

Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of [[written music]], although since the beginning of the [[recording industry]], it is also disseminated through [[sound recording|recordings]]. Traditional music forms such as early [[blues]] songs or [[hymn]]s were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

"Music Genre As Method". ''Cultural Studies Review.'' 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable [[melody|melodies]]. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and chorus or [[refrain]] repeating throughout the song and the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds and the City: Popular Music, Place and Globalization|last = Lashua|first = Brett|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2014|isbn = 9781137283115|location = Basingstoke|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth Studies: An Introduction|last = Furlong|first = Andy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 9780203862094|location = London|pages = 237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examples of Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

Scholars have classified music as "popular" based on various factors, including whether a song or piece becomes known to listeners mainly from hearing the music (in contrast with [[classical music]], in which many musicians learn pieces from [[sheet music]]); its appeal to diverse listeners, its treatment as a marketplace [[commodity]] in a [[capitalist]] context, and other factors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grove Music Online|last = Middleton|first = Richard|author1-link=Richard Middleton (musicologist)|publisher = Oxford Index|year = 2001|isbn = 9781561592630|location = |pages = |last2 = Manuel|first2 = Peter|chapter = Popular Music|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain [[social class]] is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Moreover, "understandings of popular music have changed with time".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Studying Popular Music|last = Middleton|first = Richard|publisher = Open University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0335152759|location = Philadelphia|pages = 46, 136, 155, 249, 293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anahid Kassabian separated popular music into four categories; "popular as [[Populism|populist]]," or having overtones of liberation and expression; "popular as [[Folk music|folk]]," or stating that the music is written by the people, for themselves; "popular as [[counterculture]]," or empowering citizens to act against the [[oppression]] they face; and "popular as mass," or the music becomes the tool for [[oppression]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Accessibility of Music: Participation, Reception and Contact.|last = Eisentraut|first = Jochen|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9781139616294|location = Cambridge|pages = 41–42, 197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; A society's popular music reflects the ideals that are prevalent at the time it is performed or published.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Popular music and school music education: Chinese students’ preferences and dilemmas in Shanghai, China|url = http://ijm.sagepub.com/content/33/3/304|journal = International Journal of Music Education|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 0255-7614|pages = 304–324|volume = 33|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0255761415569115|first = Wing-Wah|last = Law|first2 = Wai-Chung|last2 = Ho}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Riesman states that the youth audiences of popular music fit into either a majority group or a [[subculture]]. The majority group listens to the commercially produced styles while the subcultures find a minority style to transmit their own values.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This allows youth to choose what music they identify with, which gives them power as consumers to control the market of popular music.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==Form of Western popular music==
{{Main|Song structure}}

Form in popular music is most often [[sectional form|sectional]], the most common sections being [[Song structure#Verse|verse]], chorus or refrain, and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Other common [[musical form|forms]] include [[thirty-two-bar form]], [[chorus form]] *(Middleton pg 30), and [[twelve-bar blues]]. Popular music songs are rarely composed using different music for each stanza of the lyrics (songs composed in this fashion are said to be "[[through-composed]]").&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The verse and chorus are considered the primary elements. Each verse usually has the same melody (possibly with some slight modifications), but the lyrics change for most verses. The chorus (or "refrain") usually has a melodic phrase and a key lyrical line which is repeated. Pop songs may have an [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]] ("tag"), but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs. Pop songs that use verses and choruses often have a bridge, which, as its name suggests, is a section which connects the verse and chorus at one or more points in the song.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song, while the bridge, intro, and coda (also called an "outro") tend to be used only once. Some pop songs may have a solo section, particularly in rock or blues-influenced pop. During the solo section, one or more instruments play a melodic line which may be the melody used by the singer, or, in blues- or jazz-influenced pop, the solo may be improvised based on the chord progression. A solo usually features a single instrumental performer (e.g., a guitarist or a harmonica player) or less commonly, more than one instrumentalist (e.g., a trumpeter and a sax player).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Thirty-two-bar form uses four sections, most often eight measures long each (4×8=32), two verses or A sections, a contrasting B section (the bridge or "middle-eight") and a return of the verse in one last A section (AABA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Studying Popular Music|last = Middleton|first = Richard|publisher = Open University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0335152759|location = Philadelphia|pages = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verse-chorus form or ABA form may be combined with AABA form, in compound AABA forms. Variations such as a1 and a2 can also be used. The repetition of one chord progression may mark off the only section in a simple verse form such as the twelve bar blues.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|last = |first = |publisher = Grove|year = 2001|isbn = 0333608003|location = New York|pages = 142–144|editor-last = Sadie|editor-first = Stanley|chapter = Popular Music: Form|volume = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jenny Lind in La Sonnambula.jpg|thumb|The 19th century singer [[Jenny Lind]] depicted performing ''[[La sonnambula]]'']]
"The most significant feature of the emergent popular music industry of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was the extent of its focus on the commodity form of [[sheet music]]".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Middleton, Richard and Peter Manuel. "Popular music" in ''Grove Music Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music pieces made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur, middle-class music-makers, who could play and sing popular music at home. Amateur music-making in the 19th century often centred around the [[piano]], as this instrument could play [[melody|melodies]], chords and basslines, thus enabling a pianist to reproduce popular songs and pieces. In addition to the influence of sheet music, another factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century of public popular music performances in "pleasure gardens and [[dance halls]], popular theatres and concert rooms".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The early popular music performers worked hand-in-hand with the sheet music industry to promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to attain widespread popularity was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] opera singer [[Jenny Lind]], who toured the US in the mid-19th century. In addition to living room amateur music-making during the 19th century, more people began getting involved in music during this era by participating in amateur choirs, joining [[brass bands]] or playing in amateur orchestras.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The centre of the music publishing industry in the US during the late 19th century was in New York's '[[Tin Pan Alley]]' district. The Tin Pan Alley music publishers developed a new method for promoting sheet music: incessant promotion of new songs. One of the technological innovations that helped to spread popular music around the turn of the century was [[player pianos]]. A player piano could be used to record a skilled pianist's rendition of a piano piece. This recorded performance could be "played back" on another player piano. This allowed a larger number of music lovers to hear the new popular piano tunes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By the early 1900s, the big trends in popular music were the increasing popularity of vaudeville theaters and dance halls and a new invention—the [[gramophone player]]. The record industry grew very rapidly; "By 1920 there were almost 80 record companies in Britain, and almost 200 in the USA".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The availability of records enabled a larger percentage of the population to hear the top singers and bands.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Radio broadcasting of music, which began in the early 1920s, helped to spread popular songs to a huge audience, enabling a much larger proportion of the population to hear songs performed by professional singers and music ensembles, including individuals from lower income groups who previously would not have been able to afford concert tickets. Radio broadcasting increased the ability of songwriters, singers and bandleaders to become nationally known. Another factor which helped to disseminate popular music was the introduction of "talking pictures"—[[sound films]]—in the late 1920s, which also included music and songs. In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, there was a move towards consolidation in the recording industry, which led several major companies to dominate the record industry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, the new invention of television began to play an increasingly important role in disseminating new popular music. Variety shows regularly showcased popular singers and bands. In the 1960s, the development of new technologies in recording, such as multitrack recorders gave [[sound engineer]]s and [[record producer]]s an increasingly important role in popular music. By using multitrack recording techniques, sound engineers could create new sounds and [[sound effect]]s that were not possible using traditional "live" recording techniques,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; such as singers performing their own backup vocals or having [[lead guitar]]ists play [[rhythm guitar]]s behind their [[guitar solo]]. During the 1960s era of [[psychedelic music]], the recording studio was used to create even more unusual sounds, in order to mimic the effect of taking [[psychedelic drug|hallucinogenic drug]]s, some songs used tapes of instruments played backwards or panned the music from one side to the other of the stereo image.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the 1970s, the trend towards consolidation in the recording industry continued to the point that the "... dominance was in the hands of five huge transnational organizations, three American-owned ([[Warner Music Group|WEA]], [[RCA]], [[CBS Records International|CBS]]) and two European-owned [[companies]] ([[EMI]], [[Polygram]])".{{according to whom|date=August 2016}} In the 1990s, the consolidation trend took a new turn: inter-media consolidation. This trend saw music recording companies being consolidated with film, television, magazines, and other media companies, an approach which facilitated [[marketing co-operation|cross-marketing]] promotion between subsidiaries. For example, a record company's singing star could be cross-promoted by the conglomerate's television [[talk show]]s and magazine arms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The "introduction of digital equipment (mixing desks, synthesizers, samplers, sequencers)" in the 1990s resulted in what ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music]]'' dubbed the creation of "new sound worlds", as well as facilitating DIY music production by amateur musicians and "tiny independent [[record labels]]".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the 1990s, the availability of sound recording software and [[effects unit]]s software meant that an amateur indie band could record an album—which required a fully equipped recording studio in previous decades—using little more than a [[laptop]] and a good quality [[microphone]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} That said, the audio quality of modern recording studios still outstrips what an amateur can produce.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, K.

===Criticism===
{{Main|Music journalist}}
{{See also|Rockism and poptimism}}

== Global perspective ==
In contrast to Western popular music, a genre of music that is popular outside of a Western nation, is categorized into [[World music]]. This label turns otherwise popular styles of music into an exotic and unknown category''.'' The Western concept of 'World Music' homogenizes many different genres of popular music under one accessible term for Western audiences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; New media technology has led urban music styles to filter into distant rural areas across the globe. The rural areas, in turn, are able to give feedback to the urban centers about the new styles of music.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Urbanization, modernization, exposure to foreign music and mass media have contributed to hybrid urban pop styles. The hybrid styles have also found a space within Western popular music through the expressions of their national culture.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Recipient cultures borrow elements from host cultures and alter the meaning and context found in the host culture. Many Western styles, in turn, have become international styles through multinational recording studios.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Africa ===

[[File:Didier Awadi.jpg|thumb|Senegalese rapper, [[Didier Awadi]]]]

Popular African music styles have stemmed from traditional entertainment genres, rather than evolving from music used with certain  traditional ceremonies like weddings, births, or funerals.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; African popular music as a whole has been influenced by European countries, African-American and Afro-Latin music, and region-specific styles that became popular across a wider range of people. Although due to the significance and strong position of culture in traditional African music, African popular music tends to stay within the roots of traditional African Popular Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emielu|first1=Austin|title=Some theoretical perspectives on African popular music|date=October 2011|volume= 30|pages= 371–388|jstor=23359909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The genre of music, [[Maskanda]], is popular in its culture of origin, South Africa. Although maskanda is a traditional music genre by definition, the people who listen to it influence the ideals that are brought forth in the music.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A popular maskandi artist, Phuzekhemisi, had to lessen the political influence within his music to be ready for the public sphere. His music producer, West Nikosi, was looking for the commercial success in Phuzekhemisi's music rather than starting a political controversy.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Music and Social Change in South Africa: Maskanda Past and Present|last = Olsen|first = Kathryn|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781439911389|location = Phildephia|pages = 61–62, 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political songs have been an important category of African popular music in many societies. During the continent's struggle against colonial rule, nationalistic songs boosted citizens' morale. These songs were based on Western marches and hymns reflecting the European education system that the early nationalistic leaders grew up in. Not all African political songs were based on Western styles. For example, in South Africa, the political songs during the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were based on traditional tribal styles along with hybrid forms of imported genres.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Activists used protest and freedom songs to persuade individuals to take action, become educated with the struggle, and empower others to be politically conscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds of Resistance: The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism|last = Rojas|first = Eunice|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2013|isbn = 9780313398063|location = Santa Barbara|pages = 266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; These songs reflected the nuances between the different classes involved in the liberation struggle.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

One of the genres people of Africa use for political expression is [[Hip hop]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds and the City: Popular Music, Place and Globalization|last = Saucier|first = Paul Khalil|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2014|isbn = 9781137283108|location = Basingstoke|pages = 196–197, 199, 201, 203–204, 206|chapter = Continental Drift: The Politics and Poetics of African Hip Hop|editor-last = Lashua|editor-first = Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hip hop in Africa is based on the North American template, it has been remade to produce new meanings for African young people. This allows the genre to be both locally and globally influential.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; African youth are shaped by the fast-growing genre's ability to communicate, educate, empower, and entertain.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Artists who would have started in traditional music genres, like maskanda, became hip hop artists to provide a stronger career path for themselves. These rappers compare themselves to the traditional artists like the [[griot]] and oral storyteller, who both had a role in reflecting on the internal dynamics of the larger society.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; African hip hop creates youth culture, community intelligence, and global solidarity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

[[File:KRAS.jpeg|thumb|KRAS, also known as Heavy Metal Punk Machine, is an Indonesian heavy metal band]]

Popular music in Indonesia can be categorized as hybrid forms of Western rock to genres that are originated in Indonesia and indigenous in style.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The genre of music, [[Dangdut]], is a genre of popular music specifically found in [[Indonesia]]. Dangdut formed two other styles of popular music, [[Indo pop|Indo-pop]] and [[Underground music|Underground]],&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sounds and the City: Popular Music, Place and Globalization|last = Wallach|first = Jeremy|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2014|isbn = 9781137283108|location = Basingstoke|pages = 149, 151–152, 157|editor-last = Lashua|editor-first = Brett|chapter = Indieglobalization and the Triumph of Punk in Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; together to create a new hybrid or fusion genre. The genre takes the noisy instrumentation from Underground, but still makes it easy to listen to like Indo-pop. Dangdut attempts to form many popular music genres like rock, pop, and traditional music to create this new sound that lines up with the consumers' tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = History, Modernity, and Music Genre in Indonesia: Popular Music Genres in the Dutch East Indies and Following Independence|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/asian_music/v044/44.2.wallach01.html|journal = Asian Music|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1553-5630|pages = 3–23|volume = 44|issue = 2|doi = 10.1353/amu.2013.0020|first = Jeremy|last = Wallach|first2 = Esther|last2 = Clinton}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genre has formed into a larger social movement that includes clothing, youth culture, the resurgence of Islam, and the capitalist entertainment industry.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Popular Musics of the Non-Western World|last = Manuel|first = Peter|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1988|isbn = 0195053427|location = New York|pages = 7, 11–12, 20, 85–86, 88, 205, 210, 212, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another music scene that is popular in Indonesia is [[Punk rock]]. This genre was shaped in Indonesia by the local interpretations of the media from the larger global punk movement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Jeremy Wallach argues that while [[Green Day]] was seen as the "death of punk," in Indonesia they were the catalyst for a larger punk movement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Punk in Indonesia calls on the English-speaking world to embrace the global sects of the punk culture and become open-minded to the transnational genre.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== China ====

In a 2015 study involving young students in [[Shanghai]], youths stated they enjoyed listening to both Chinese, other Asian nationalities, and Anglo-American popular music. There are three ways that young people of [[China]] were able to access global music.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The first reason was a policy change since the late 1970s where the country was opened up to the rest of the world instead of being self-contained. This created more opportunities for Chinese people to interact with people outside of their country of origin to create a more globalized culture. The second reason is that the Chinese television and music industry since the 1980s has broadcast television shows from their neighboring Asian societies and the West. The third reason is the impact of the internet and smartphones on the accessibility of streaming music.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In 2015, students in China accounted for 30.2% of China's internet population and the third and fifth most popular uses of the internet were respectively, internet music and internet video use. The youths described being able to connect to the emotions and language of the Chinese music, but also enjoyed the melodies found within Anglo-American music. The students also believed that listening to the English music would improve their English language skills.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;''

The '''Rally of Democratic Forces of Guinea''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Rassemblement des forces démocratiques de Guinée'') was a minor&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/25/Guinea.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Guinean rebel group.
It was also known as ([[French language|French]]: "Mouvement des Forces Democratiques de Guinee")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-825X.00123 | volume=38 | title=Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social and Cultural Series, January 1st-31st 2001 Published February 22nd 2001 | journal=Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social and Cultural Series | pages=14251–14286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RFDG launched a series of attacks against Guinean government forces from its base located in [[Liberia]] on September 11, 2000.

'''Renzo De Felice''' (8 April 1929 – 25 May 1996) was an Italian historian, who specialized in the Fascist era, writing, among other works, a 6000-page biography of Mussolini (4 volumes, 1965–1997). He argued that Mussolini was a revolutionary modernizer in domestic issues but a pragmatist in foreign policy who continued the [[Realpolitik]] policies of Italy from 1861 to 1922.&lt;ref&gt;James Burgwyn, "Renzo De Felice and Mussolini's Foreign Policy: Pragmatism vs. Ideology," ''Italian Quarterly'' (1999), Vol. 36 Issue 141/142, pp 93–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
De Felice was born in [[Rieti]] and studied under [[Federico Chabod]] and Delio Cantimori at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. During his time as student, he was a member of the [[Italian Communist Party]]. After the Soviet repression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], De Felice was among 101 Italian intellectuals who sharply criticized the Italian Communists for backing of the Soviets.

He broke with them and joined the [[Italian Socialist Party]]. He taught history at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]]. He was married to Livia De Ruggiero. He died in Rome.

==Mussolini biography==
De Felice is best known for a massive four volume, eight book biography of [[Benito Mussolini]] that was almost finished when he died. De Felice was the founder and editor of the influential journal ''Storia Contemporanea''. De Felice, a liberal Jew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/spettacoli/duce-govern-col-consenso-e-de-felice-ha-dimostrato-1190989.html |title=Il Duce governò col consenso. E De Felice lo ha dimostrato |last=Guerri |first=Giordano Bruno |date=5 November 2015 |work=[[il Giornale]] |access-date=17 November 2015 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;a quei tempi De Felice venne addirittura accusato di filofascismo: lui, ebreo liberale che fino a allora si era occupato soprattutto della Rivoluzione francese.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also wrote a well-regarded history of Jewish life under the Fascist government and articles on Italian [[Jacobinism]].

De Felice's leading interest was in Fascism. In his view, there were two types of Fascism, "Fascism as a movement" and "Fascism as a regime". De Felice saw Fascism, especially in the "movement" stage, as a revolutionary middle-class ideology that had deep roots in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Moreover, De Felice insisted that it was not caused by fear of a proletarian revolution on the part of the lower middle classes, as Leftist historiography maintained; it was rather an assertive movement, originated by an emerging middle class in search for its proper role.

Fascism, as a regime, was seen by De Felice as nothing more than Mussolini's policy, which tended to make of Fascist ideology just the superstructure of Mussolini's dictatorship and personal power. De Felice felt that fascism should be seen as valid political ideology, not just something to be demonized and dismissed in simplistic terms. He argued that studies on Fascism should get out from the political debate and become a historiographical issue based on scientific assertions.

Furthermore, De Felice insisted that there was no connection or valid comparisons to be drawn between Italian Fascism and German [[national socialism]], which De Felice saw as being a completely different political ideology. Critics on the Left attacked De Felice for being too sympathetic to Italian Fascism. Giuliano Procacci, [[Paolo Alatri]], Nicola Tranfaglia and others even accused De Felice of supporting Fascism. However, Italian communist leader and intellectual activist Giorgio Amendola came to de Felice's defense, and rejected many of the criticisms of Tranfaglia and Ferrara in 1975, calling for more civil dialogue on fascism and antifascism.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Amendola, "Per una nuova storia dell’ antifascismo," in ''I’Unità,'' (Italian Communist party's newspaper) 20 July 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Although he acknowledged many of de Felice's discrepancies, Amendola endorsed some of De Felice's ideas, including the "revolutionary aspect in Fascism" and the theory that Mussolini's Fascist movement attracted ample adherents among the populace.&lt;ref&gt;Aurora G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7291">'''Robert Lewis Koehl''' (6 March 1922 – 6 July 2015) was an [[United States|American]] [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Intelligence]] [[surveyor]] in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], [[author]], and a [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[history]] at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].

After the end of the war, Koehl made a name for himself for his research on [[national socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;https://history.wisc.edu/robertkoehl_memorial.htm&lt;/ref&gt; notably of studies on [[Heinrich Himmler]] as [[Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood]], as well as a pioneering work on the Nazi German [[:de:Volkstumspolitik]] during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)]]. Koehl coined the term "neofeudalism" for the characterization of the national socialist rule, and completed an account of the history of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1983.

== Biography ==
Robert Lewis [[Koehl]] was born on 6 March 1922 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He studied in at [[Harvard University]], where he was admitted as member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. In 1943, Koehl married Lieselotte Franziska Eisenhardt, who had emigrated from [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, and the couple had three children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcourier.com/news/2015/sep/06/obituary-lilo -koehl / '' Obituary: Lilo Koehl '']. In: '' Daily Courier '', 6 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II]] he interrupted his studies for the war service, serving as [[surveyor]] and [[interpreter]] for the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Intelligence]] in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi German-occupied Europe]].

Back in Harvard he acquired his [[Master of Arts]] in 1947 with the work ''A Prelude to the Third Reich''. In 1950, he earned his [[Doctor (title)|Doctor degree]] on [[Heinrich Himmler]] as [[Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood]]. He subsequently taught at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Boston]], at [[University of Nebraska]] in [[Lincoln (Nebraska)|Lincoln]] and from 1964 until his retirement 1997 in the Department of Educational Policy Studies of [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], a department of which he was an early founder.

== Research ==
Koehl's work focused on [[European history]], especially the history of [[national socialism]]. His doctorate thesis, published in revised form in 1957, was mainly based on material of the [[RuSHA trial]], and for a long time was one of few papers on the National Socialist Settlement and Population Policy in the German occupation of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;1939 Isabel Heinemann: '' Race, Settlement, German Blood. '' 'The Breed and Settlement Headquarters of the SS and the Reorganization of Europe's Racial Policy.' '2nd edition. Wallstein Verlag, Göttingen, 2013, {{ISBN|9783835320499}}, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the [[feudalism]] concept, Koehl coined the term "neofeudalism" to describe national socialism. He wanted in particular to grasp the domination conditions in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|German-occupied East]], where German rule was personalized and local commanders had absolute power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Mommsen]]: 'Cumulative radicalization and progressive self-destruction as structural determinants of the Nazi dictatorship ''. In: [[Ian Kershaw]] &amp; [[Moshe Lewin]] (Hg.): '' Stalinism and Nazism. Dictatorship in Comparison ''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an early attempt to understand the irrational aspects of national socialism. In pointing out the similarities between the charismatic elements of medieval and national socialist rule, Koehl opposed later attempts to conceive of national socialism as [[Charismatic authority|charismatic rule]] in the sense of [[Max Weber]]. However, recent research does not follow Koehl's assumption that the feudalist power relations originated from the [[Atavism|atavistic]] ideology of national socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Koehl: '' Feudal Aspects of National Socialism '' (1960). In: Neil Gregor (eds.): '' Nazism ''. Oxford UP, Oxford 2000, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koehl also referred back to the term "Concentration Camp - [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]". He thus designated a group of SS members in the concentration camps, which were not seconded to battlefields of the [[Waffen-SS]]. According to [[:de:Karin Orth]], Koehl's concept of historical reality corresponds to a national socialist functioneer elite.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Orth: '' SS perpetrators in court. The Crime of the Concentration Camp SS After Warfare '' In: Irtrud Wojak (eds.): '' Court Day Hold On Ourself ... ': History and Impact of the First Frankfurt Auschwitz Process Effect of the Holocaust ''. Campus, Frankfurt / M. 2001, p. 44&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt; For Koehl, SS perpetrators were "[[social engineering (political science)|social engineers]]". In 1983 he presented a complete version of the SS.

'''Simonas Daukantas''' ({{lang-pl|Szymon Dowkont}}; 28 October 1793 – 6 December 1864) was a Lithuanian/Samogitian historian, writer, and ethnographer. One of the pioneers of the [[Lithuanian National Revival]], he is credited as the author of the first book on the [[history of Lithuania]] written in the [[Lithuanian language]]. Only a few of his works were published during his lifetime and he died in obscurity. However, his works were rediscovered during the later stages of the National Revival. His views reflected the three major trends of the 19th century: [[romanticism]], [[nationalism]], and [[liberalism]].{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=76}}

Daukantas was born in [[Samogitia]] to a Lithuanian family. Likely a son of free peasants, he later produced proof of his noble birth to get university degree and a promotion in his government job. He attended schools in [[Kretinga]] and [[Žemaičių Kalvarija]] and was noted as an excellent student. Daukantas studied law at the [[University of Vilnius]], though his interest lay in [[philology]] and history. After the graduation, he worked as a civil servant of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1825 to 1850. He first worked at the office of the [[Baltic governorates|Governor-General of Livonia, Estonia and Courland]] in [[Riga]] then moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] to work at the [[Governing Senate]]. At the Senate, he had the opportunity to study the [[Lithuanian Metrica]], the state archive of the 14–18th century legal documents of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In 1850, Daukantas retired from his job due to poor health and moved back to Samogitia where he lived in [[Varniai]] under the care of bishop [[Motiejus Valančius]] for a few years. He hoped to publish some of his works with bishop's help, but the bishop prioritized religious work and they began to quarrel. In 1855, Daukantas moved to {{ill|Jaunsvirlauka|lv}} in present-day Latvia and later to [[Papilė]] where he died in obscurity in 1864.

While Daukantas knew seven languages, he published exclusively in Lithuanian. He was a prolific writer and worked on a wide range of books – studies on the history of Lithuania, publications of primary historical sources, collections of Lithuanian folklore, Polish–Lithuanian dictionaries, Latin textbook for schoolchildren, primer of the Lithuanian language, Catholic prayer book, agricultural manuals for peasants, translations of classical Roman texts, novel for youth inspired by ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''. However, only a few of these works were published during his lifetime. Of the four studies on history, he managed to publish only one, ''The Character of the Ancient Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians'', in 1845. While he was a well read erudite who spent considerable time and effort in obtaining [[primary sources]], his historical works are highly influenced by [[romantic nationalism]] and didactically idealize the past. He used poetic descriptions, rhetorical elements, and emotional language that brought his history works closer to a literary work. His histories are valued not for their scientific content, but for their contribution to the development of the Lithuanian national identity.{{sfn|Suziedelis|2011|p=91}} After the closing of Vilnius University in 1832, Lithuanians did not have a professionally trained historian until 1904 and used Daukantas' histories extensively. Daukantas identified language as the determining factor of nationality and articulated the nationalist anti-Polish sentiment that became the fundamental ideas of the [[Lithuanian National Revival]] and that survive in Lithuanian historiography into the 21st century.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=83}} 

== Biography ==
===Origins and primary education===
Daukantas was born on 28 October 1793 in {{illm|Kalviai (Skuodas)|lt|lt=Kalviai}} near [[Lenkimai]] in [[Samogitia]]. He was the oldest of seven children (two sons and five daughters).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=8}} With Daukantas' help, his brother Aleksandras later studied medicine at [[Vilnius University]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=9}} Baptismal records of the two sons (but not of the daughters) specified that they were children of [[Lithuanian nobles]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=7, 10}} There was an academic debate whether this information was accurate or falsified to provide the sons with better opportunities in life, a common practice among wealthier peasants at the time.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=9–11}} An analysis of inventories of [[Skuodas Manor]] revealed that the family were free peasants – different from [[serf]]s in that they had some personal freedoms and paid [[quit-rent]] instead of performing [[corvée]]. When the manor was confiscated from the [[Sapieha]]s for their participation in the [[Uprising of 1831]], the family was turned into serfs.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=12–13}} However, Eimantas Meilus argued that inventories alone do not prove that the family was not of noble origin as many poorer nobles were equated to peasants and paid quit-rent to wealthier manors.{{sfn|Meilus|1993|p=32}} The family worked about 1.5 [[Volok (unit)|voloks]] of land and pasture and raised cash for quit-rent by selling flax in [[Riga]] or [[Liepāja]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=14–15}} According to the epitaph engraved on the gravestone of Daukantas' mother, she and her husband participated in a battle near Liepāja during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] against the [[partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=8}} In 1799–1800, his father was mentioned as manor's forester.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=15}}

Daukantas' education was financed by his uncle, priest Simonas Lopacinskis (died in 1814).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=17}} Daukantas attended a two-year primary school in [[Kretinga]]. When the school was visited by an inspector from [[Vilnius University]] in 1808, Daukantas was listed among 16 exemplary second-year students (out of total 68 students).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=17}} The school curriculum included lessons on Polish and Latin grammar, geography, arithmetic, religion and morality.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=18}} At some point, Daukantas enrolled into a four-grade six-year (the last two grades took two years to finish) school in [[Žemaičių Kalvarija]]. Another inspector listed him as one of four best students in the last fourth grade in 1814.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=22}} The school curriculum was dictated by Vilnius University and included [[natural law]] (textbook by {{ill|Hieronim Stroynowski|ru|Стройновский, Иероним}}), [[classical antiquity]], rhetoric, geography, geometry, algebra, physics, natural sciences (textbook by [[Stanisław Bonifacy Jundziłł]]), gardening. However, since all teachers were Dominican monks, students had to attend daily masses and go to confession every month.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=23–24}} The subjects were taught in Polish and the use of [[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian (Lithuanian)]], even among students, was prohibited in November 1806. The official rationale was to facilitate the learning of Polish.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=25–26}} However, as later attested by [[Motiejus Valančius]], neither students nor teachers knew Polish well and Daukantas never learned proper Polish pronunciation.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=26}}

In 1814, Daukantas with 10 [[Russian rubles|rubles]] in his pocket and a bag of clothes on his back traveled on foot from Samogitia to [[Vilnius]] to attend {{ill|Vilnius Gymnasium|lt|Vilniaus gimnazijos|ru|Виленские мужские гимназии}}. The school year started on 1 September, but Daukantas was registered only on 26 September as a fifth-year student.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=27}} That school year, the school had 423 students, mostly sons of nobles and officials. The gymnasium, together with Vilnius in general, was recovering after the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812. Its original premises were occupied by a war hospital and so it temporarily shared rooms with Vilnius University.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=28}} In June–July 1815, the gymnasium organized an annual public examination of its students attended by members of the clergy and university professors. Daukantas was listed among 14 students who distinguished themselves during this event.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=30}} He successfully graduated from the gymnasium in early summer 1816.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=30}}

=== University education ===
In fall 1816, Daukantas began studies at the Faculty of Literature and Liberal Arts at [[Vilnius University]], then known as the Imperial University of Vilna. [[Adam Mickiewicz]] transferred to the faculty at the same time.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=30–31}} Daukantas was interested in [[philology]] and studied Latin, Russian, and Polish literature, French language, rhetoric, poetry, natural and land law (leges patrias).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=32–33}} His professors included {{ill|Gottfried Ernst Groddeck|de}} of classical philology and {{ill|Leon Borowski|pl|Leon Borowski (krytyk literacki)}} of poetry and rhetoric.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=33}} In 1817, Daukantas applied for a [[Candidate of Philosophy]] degree, but was rejected because he did not provide required certificates and did not complete a thesis.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=33–34}} After another year of studies, Daukantas transferred to the Faculty of Moral and Political Sciences in fall 1818. These studies could secure a more promising career as a judge or a government official.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=34}} He attended lectures of {{ill|Ignacy Żegota Onacewicz|ru|Онацевич, Игнатий}}, who formed Daukantas as a historian. Onacewicz studied at the [[University of Königsberg]] and had access to the archives of the [[Teutonic Order]] and spent a year studying archives at the estate of [[Nikolay Rumyantsev]] in [[Gomel]]. He collected enough information to establish a course on the [[history of Lithuania]] as a separate subject from the [[history of Poland]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=35}} Another key professor was {{ill|Ignacy Daniłowicz|ru|Данилович, Игнатий Николаевич}} who taught law and studied [[Lithuanian Statutes]], [[Casimir's Code]], [[Lithuanian Chronicles]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=36}}

[[File:Ignacy_Żegota_Onacewicz.jpg|thumb|Professor {{ill|Ignacy Żegota Onacewicz|ru|Онацевич, Игнатий}}, who formed Daukantas as a historian]]
On 12 July 1819, Daukantas was granted the Candidate of Law degree in [[canon law|canon]] and [[Roman law]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=44}} To get the diploma, Daukantas needed to provide proof of his noble status.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=51}} He provided a large [[parchment]], signed by [[Michał Józef Römer]] as [[marshal of the szlachta]] of the [[Vilna Governorate]] on 24 August 1820, that described an extensive genealogy of Daukantai family of {{ill|Olawa coat of arms|pl|Olawa}} that traced back to late 1500s.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=51–52}} While the document is authentic, historian [[Vytautas Merkys]] concluded that Daukantas altered the genealogy to attach his own family to the noble Daukantai family, another known practice among peasants that shared surnames with noble families.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=54}} Daukantas received his diploma on 25 January 1821.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=44}}

He continued his studies and took canon law, Roman civil law, criminal law, land law, political economy, history, logic and metaphysics. From fall 1820, Daukantas stopped attending lectures except for land law. He stopped taking classes in spring 1822.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=44–45}} In all classes he received "good" or "very good" evaluations except in logic and metaphysics taught by [[Anioł Dowgird]] where his knowledge was rated as "satisfactory".{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=45}} In spring 1821, Daukantas submitted an application for a master's degree.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=47}} The oral exams took place in October–November 1821. He had to answer questions on a wide variety of subjects, from the law and history of [[Ancient Rome]] and impostors of [[Dmitry of Uglich]] to theory of taxes and specifics of Russian economy as well as thoughts of [[Montesquieu]] and [[Adam Smith]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=48–49}} In July 1822, Daukantas defended his thesis on the power of the head of a family according to the natural, Roman, and land law. He was granted the master's degree in canon and Roman law on 15 July 1822.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=49–50}} 

However, Daukantas had to wait until 1825 to get his diploma. The degree needed a confirmation by the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education]]. The university prepared the papers in August 1822, but they were returned because they needed translation into Russian. The translated documents were not sent out until March 1824.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=56}} Part of the delay was caused by suppression of the [[Filomat]] and [[Filaret (movement)|Filaret]] secret student societies (Daukantas' name was included on a list of potential members, but there is no evidence that he ever joined them).{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=606}} Discovered in May 1823, members of these societies were tried and sentenced for anti-Tsarist activities. Until resolution of the trials, students were prohibited from leaving Vilnius and the university ceased issuing graduation certificates.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=57}} The process was delayed again due to the replacement of [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], curator of the {{ill|Vilnius educational district|ru|Виленский учебный округ}}, with [[Nikolay Novosiltsev]]. The papers had to be reviewed by the new curator who approved Daukantas' degree in February 1825 followed by the ministry's approval in March. Finally, the university issued the diploma on 30 April 1825.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=58}}

There is no reliable information on Daukantas' activities while he waited for his diploma. Earlier biographers claimed that he studied at the [[University of Dorpat]], but researchers [[Vaclovas Biržiška]] and {{ill|Antanas Tyla|lt}} found no record of Daukantas among Dorpat students.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=42}} {{ill|Jonas Šliūpas|lt}} claimed that Daukantas visited France, Germany, England,{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=60}} while other authors claimed that he studied historical documents at the [[Königsberg]] archives,{{sfn|Trumpa|1965}}{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=63}} but there is no record that he was issued a passport that would have allowed him to leave Vilnius.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=60}} Daukantas likely joined a small circle of Samogitian students that promised to promote Lithuanian language and culture signifying the early stages of the [[Lithuanian National Revival]].{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=606}} There a popular legend that he went to the [[Gate of Dawn]] and promised to write only in Lithuanian.{{sfn|Kojala|2012}} Already in 1822, he wrote ''Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių'' (Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), a 855-page manuscript on the [[history of Lithuania]]. While it was not published until 1929, two copies of the manuscript are known.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=40–41}} Researcher Roma Bončkutė proposed that Daukantas was inspired to write the work after reading ''[[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]'' by [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]], first published by [[Ludwig Rhesa]] in 1818.{{sfn|Bončkutė|2015|pp=224, 227}} In 1824, Daukantas translated 111 fables of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], but they remained unpublished until 1846.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=40, 129}}

===Civil servant===
With his master's diploma in hand, Daukantas searched for a position in a government office. In September 1825, he was issued a passport that allowed him to travel to the [[Governorate of Livonia|Governorates of Livonia]] and [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=59}} He found a post at the office of the [[Baltic governorates|Governor-General of Livonia, Estonia and Courland]] in [[Riga]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=60}} All government officials in the Russian Empire were divided into 14 categories, from imperial ministers to train conductors (see: [[Table of Ranks]]). In 1826, Daukantas was recognized as a titular councillor, 9th category official. For a promotion to collegiate assessor he needed to prove his noble status and have three years of experience.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=61}} In February 1826, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] ordered to prepare a new law that would require all nobles to prove their social status. While the law was adopted only in May 1834, it became a lot more difficult to prove one's noble birth.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=63–64}} Daukantas and his brother Aleksandras, then a student at Vilnius University, had to resubmit all documents proving their genealogy to a special commission of [[Vilna Governorate]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=64}} The commission recognized both brothers as nobles and forwarded documents to {{ill|Heroldia|ru|Герольдия}} under the [[Governing Senate]] in January 1832. In May 1833, Heroldia recognized Daukantas as noble, but not his brother.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=66–67}} Daukantas was promoted to the 8th category in April 1834.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=61}} 

[[File:Saint Petersburg, Russia (40480448912).jpg|thumb|300px|{{ill|Building of the Senate and the Synod|ru|Здания Сената и Синода}} where Daukantas worked in 1835–1850]]
During the [[Uprising of 1831]], Daukantas was in Riga – he was not granted vacations between December 1829 and July 1834.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=62}} In 1833, he received two awards of 75 and 110 rubles for excellent work. We was interested in the history of Lithuania, but could not get access to the archives of Riga magistrate. After the promotion, he decided to change his position and move to [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=62–63}} He applied for a job at the first (administrative) department of the [[Governing Senate]]. After a background check to ensure that he did not participate in the uprising, Daukantas started his new job in March 1835. He worked on paperwork related to ports and [[Russian Imperial Navy]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=71}} In March 1837, he transferred to the third department which dealt with all kinds of cases, complaints, and appeals from eastern [[governorates of the Russian Empire]], including [[Vilna Governorate|Vilna]] and [[Kovno Governorate|Kovno]]. Daukantas was attracted to this position because the office used [[Lithuanian Metrica]], a collection of the 14–18th century legal documents of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=72}} He became an assistant of [[Franciszek Malewski]]. His annual salary was 286 rubles with additional 57 rubles for food.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=73}} It was a small pay and Daukantas earned additional money by helping various people to locate needed genealogical and other documents in the Metrica.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=74}} In July 1839, Daukantas received an award equal to his annual pay for helping create a practical index of the Metrica. However, he did not receive either [[Order of Saint Anna]] (2nd class) or the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov)|Order of Saint Stanislaus]] (2nd class) which were generally awarded after 12 and 15 years of employment.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=74–75}}

In February 1841, Daukantas' brother Aleksandras was implicated in an anti-Tsarist organization established by [[Szymon Konarski]]. After an interrogation, he attempted suicide and was brought to a hospital in [[Kherson]]. He died in the hospital on 5 October 1841.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=69–70}} More repressions and restrictions, including stricter censorship, followed after the [[Revolutions of 1848]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=81}} Afraid of attracting police attention and losing his job, Daukantas kept his historical research a secret and always asked friends and acquaintances not to publish or mention his name.{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|p=409}} He used numerous non-repeating pen names and a few times published works without any name, though some researchers suggested that he also did that to create an impression that there were many Lithuanian writers.{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}} Even when sending a copy of ''Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių'' to [[Teodor Narbutt]], Daukantas described the work as if written by an unknown person.{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|p=409}} 

===Collaboration with other historians===
[[File:Teodor Narbutt.PNG|thumb|Daukantas and [[Teodor Narbutt]] hoped to publish various historical primary sources]]
In Saint Petersburg, Daukantas worked on his studies on the history of Lithuania and was close friends with his former professor {{ill|Ignacy Żegota Onacewicz|ru|Онацевич, Игнатий}} and {{ill|Vasily Anastasevich|ru|Анастасевич, Василий Григорьевич}} who both lived in an apartment provided by the [[Rumyantsev Museum]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=78}} They both died in February 1845 and Daukantas deeply mourned his friends.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=79–81}} When [[Vilnius Theological Academy]] was moved to Saint Petersburg in 1842, it brought more Lithuanian intellectuals to Saint Petersburg. Daukantas is often crediting for inspiring [[Motiejus Valančius]], future [[Bishop of Samogitia]], to write his works in Lithuanian.{{sfn|Merkys|1999|pp=130–131}} The small Samogitian circle was ruined when {{ill|Jonas Krizostomas Gintila|lt}} and Valančius returned to Lithuania in 1844–1845.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=80}} However, Daukantas and Valančius continued to correspond and collaborate. It is likely that Valančius wrote his fundamental work on the history of the [[Diocese of Samogitia]] in Lithuanian and not in Polish because of Daukantas' influence. In this work, Valančius cited Daukantas' manuscript of ''Istorija žemaitiška'' four times and Lithuanian Metrica (copies of which he could have obtained only from Daukantas) another four times,{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=155}} though likely used Daukantas and his sources more frequently as Valančius mentioned a total of 19 Samogitian cities and towns that had received royal privileges.{{sfn|Petraitienė|2018}}

[[Teodor Narbutt]], author of the nine-volume ''History of Lithuania'', began corresponding with Daukantas in March 1842.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=82}} They exchanged books and materials. In total, Narbutt wrote 19 letters to Daukantas, and Daukantas wrote 20 letters to Narbutt.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=86}} Their main concern was to obtain and publish historical documents and other [[primary sources]] related to the history of Lithuania. Daukantas was particularly wary of falsified or altered sources being published by various Polish historians.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=87}} Their plan to publish primary sources was an intentional and principled decision to publish Lithuanian documents separately from Polish historians who began publishing ''Sources for the History of Poland'' (''Źródła do dziejów Polski'').{{sfn|Griškaitė|2012|p=155}} Daukantas sent to Narbutt about 800 copies{{sfn|Orgelbrand|1899|p=455}} of various documents made during the years by himself or by Onacewicz,{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=88–89}} including a copy of ''[[Die Littauischen Wegeberichte]]''.{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}} In particular, he highly valued a copy of a manuscript by [[Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz]] that cataloged and described various coat of arms of [[Lithuanian nobility]]. When Narbutt promised to find a way to publish the manuscript, Daukantas lent him the copy for a few months with strict orders to supervise the publication so that no Polish publishers could make any changes or alterations to the original text.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=90}} Narbutt harbored plans to publish the [[Bychowiec Chronicle]] as the first volume of a series of primary source publications, but Daukantas lost his patience after receiving only promises of ever grander plans.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=91–92}} Their collaboration broke down in 1844.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=86}} Narbutt never published or returned the documents received from Daukantas who was angry over losing most valuable pieces of his collection and continued to demand their return until 1858.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=94, 96}} After Narbutt's death, his sons gifted some of the primary sources collected by their father, including 158 pages copied by Daukantas, to a library in [[Lviv]] (present-day [[Stefanyk National Science Library]]).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=98}}

===Retirement===
[[File:Simonas Daukantas memorial museum 2013-08-11.jpg|thumb|300px|The clergy house in Papilė where Daukantas lived in 1861–1864 (now a memorial museum)]]
In a 1846 letter to Narbutt, Daukantas complained of poor health which he attributed to long hours spent in cold and damp archives of the Russian Senate. He complained that he had difficulty walking, but dismissed doctors' diagnosis of [[podagra]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=148–149}} In summer 1850 he requested a three-month vacation to improve his health In September, he obtained an official certificate from a German doctor in [[Telšiai]] that at the age of 58 and troubled by many ailments he was unfit to continue his work in Saint Petersburg.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=151–152}} Daukantas was officially retired in February 1851 and allotted an annual pension of 42.90 silver rubles, but it was not enough to live on and he needed further financial support.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=153–154}} His move to Lithuania coincided with the consecration of his old friend [[Motiejus Valančius]] as [[Bishop of Samogitia]] in March 1850. Daukantas lived in [[Varniai]] where Valnčius resided and which was becoming a cultural center in Samogitia.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=155, 158}} He received a salary of 200 rubles from Valančius and worked on his historical studies that he hoped to publish with Valančius' help.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=158}} However, soon the relationship soured perhaps because Valančius prioritized religious work and literature and would assign tasks which had little to do with Lithuanian cultural work that Daukantas desired.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=159–160}} Also, Valančius had a more critical approach to writing history and reportedly criticized Daukantas' overly idealized work{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}} and carefully controlled the language of Daukantas' historical works.{{sfn|Bončkutė|2004|p=42}}

In summer 1855, Daukantas moved from Varniai. Historians usually cite the conflict between Daukantas and Valančius as the reason for the move, but ill health and fear of police persecution probably also contributed.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=165}} Due to the [[Crimean War]], Russian police became more vigilant and they came across ''Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių'' that Daukantas had published in 1845.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=162}} The censors reevaluated the book and deemed it inappropriate due to its anti-serfdom rhetoric. The police tracked down Daukantas and knew that he moved from Varniai to [[Courland]]. However, the book was already sold out and the investigation concluded with an order to keep an eye on bookstores in case a new edition of the book appeared.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=163–164}} The book was one of the first books added to a list of prohibited books compiled in October 1855.{{sfn|Girininkienė|2018}}

[[File:Daukantokapas.JPG|thumb|Grave of Daukantas in Papilė]]
Daukantas moved to {{ill|Jaunsvirlauka|lv}} ({{lang-de|Neu-Bergfried}}) in present-day Latvia to live with Petras Smuglevičius, a medical doctor and a relative of painter [[Franciszek Smuglewicz]]. Smuglevičius was accused of belonging to a secret student society, arrested for a year, later acquitted, but still lived under police supervision.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=165}} He was very supportive of Lithuanian cultural activities. In early 1858, [[Mikalojus Akelaitis]] also moved in to live with Smuglevičius. Akelaitis treated Daukantas as a fatherly figure and they supported each other's work.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=166}}  Daukantas continued to work on his historical studies, writing to linguist {{ill|Frydrichas Kuršaitis|de}} in hopes of obtaining books by [[Ludwig Rhesa]] and [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]] and copies of historical sources from [[Johannes Voigt]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=167–168}} He compiled a collection of historical documents, privileges from 1387–1561 that he had inherited from {{ill|Jerzy Konstanty Plater|lt|Jurgis Pliateris (1810)}}, and made one last attempt to collect the document he loaned to [[Teodor Narbutt]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=94, 168}} Daukantas supported the establishment of the {{ill|Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius|lt|Vilniaus Senienų muziejus}} and corresponded with [[Eustachy Tyszkiewicz]] hoping to transfer some of his collected historical documents to the museum.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=177–178}} Akelaitis, Valančius, and Daukantas wanted to establish ''Pakeleivingas'', a Lithuanian-language periodical aimed at the ordinary village people, but could not government's permission.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=168–171}} Daukantas had four manuscripts ready to be published (two booklets with agricultural advice, Lithuanian reworking of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and a second edition of a Lithuanian [[Primer (textbook)|primer]]), but they all remained unpublished due to lack of funds.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=170–171}}

Around summer 1859, Daukantas left Jaunsvirlauka and briefly lived with various friends and relatives.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=174–175}} In October 1861, he moved to [[Papilė]] to live with Ignotas Vaišvila, a parish priest.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=179}} His health continued to deteriorate. Daukantas and Valančius exchanged final bitter letters in 1861, completely severing their friendship. One of these letters was later published in ''[[Aušra]]''.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=181–182}} It is unclear what Daukantas did during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863–1864, but several of his friends were arrested, imprisoned, or exiled to Siberia. Vaišvila was arrested, but released.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=182}} Daukantas died on 6 December 1864 and was buried on the summit of the Papilė [[hill fort]] without much ceremony. Vaišvila put a simple engraved stone on the grave; twenty years later, he replaced it with an engraved ledger gravestone commissioned in Riga which survives to this day.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=185–186}} In 1925, Antanas Raudonis, a former [[Lithuanian book smuggler]] and an amateur sculptor, added a cross that is shaped as an oak stump with a growing shoot.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=187}}

====Publication history====
[[File:Simono Daukanto - Budas senoves lietuviu - kalnenu ir zemaiciu - 1845 AD.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''The Character of the Ancient Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians'' published in 1845]]
Daukantas wrote four original books on the history of Lithuania. Only one of them was published during his lifetime. In his research, Daukantas was hindered by inaccessibility of sources, lack of funds, absent institutional support (i.e. no government institution or university to assist him). It was a lonely, costly, and frustrating undertaking.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|pp=70–71}} Book publishing was an expensive undertaking. For example, Daukantas had to pay 2,000 silver rubles to the publisher of his 120-page Latin grammar.{{sfn|Aleksandravičius|1993|pp=122–123}} The only person known to have provided financial assistance to Daukantas is Ksaveras Kanapackis,{{sfn|Girininkienė|2018}} who is listed as sponsor of ten books by Daukantas.{{sfn|Aleksandravičius|1993|pp=122–123}}

He wrote his first historical work, ''Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių'' (Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), in 1822 while still a student at Vilnius University. The work starts with the 7th century BC and ends with the death of King [[Jogaila]] (Władysław II Jagiełło) in 1434.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=101}} The work was discovered in 1919{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=194}} and first published in 1929.{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=27}} The work was dedicated not to historians or learned men, but to Lithuanian mothers who taught their children and told them deeds of their ancestors.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=40–41}} Thus he recognized and acknowledged women's role in educating the younger generation.{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=609}}

His second and largest historical work, ''Istorija žemaitiška'' (Samogitian History), was completed by 1838. The manuscript had 1,106 pages. It appears that Daukantas hoped to publish it around 1848 as he ordered a clean copy, which was discovered in 1983.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=98–99}} The work ended with the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]] in 1572.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=101}} ''Istorija žemaitiška'' under the title ''Lietuvos istorija'' (History of Lithuania) was published in two volumes in 1893 and 1897 in the United States.{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=28}} In 1850, Daukantas reworked it as ''Pasakojimas apie veikalus lietuvių tautos senovėje'' (Story of the Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians) which ended with the death of Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] in 1430.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=100–101}} He hoped to publish it with the help of [[Motiejus Valančius]] and two copies with various corrections were produced. In 1882, {{ill|Jonas Šliūpas|lt}} made another copy with hopes of publishing it,{{sfn|Bončkutė|2004|pp=42–43}} but the first 96 pages up to year 1201 were printed by {{ill|Jonas Kriaučiūnas|lt|Jonas Kriaučiūnas (1864)}} at the press of [[Martynas Jankus]] in 1893 and the work was first published in full only in 1976.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=100–101}} It was the only manuscript that Daukantas signed in his real name (though he also used pen name Jonas Einoras).{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}}

His third historical book was ''Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių'' (The Character of the Ancient Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians). He created the word ''kalnėnai'' (highlanders) to refer to [[Aukštaitija]].{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=608}} Russian censors considered the manuscript in May 1844, but due to difficulties finding censors who knew Lithuanian, the work approved only in March 1845. The book was published in Saint Petersburg in February 1846.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=99–100}} It was republished in the United States in 1892 and in Lithuania in 1935.{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}} It was the first history of the [[culture of Lithuania]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=110}} Excerpts were translated to Polish in ''Rocznik Literacki'' in 1850 and to German in ''[[Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft]]'' in 1885.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=188–189}} The content was arranged not chronologically as in other works but thematically with chapters covering subjects such as religion, customs, commerce, geography.{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=28}} The short chapter on numismatics, which discussed the [[Lithuanian long currency]] and earliest coins of the Grand Duchy, retained its scientific relevance until 1930s.{{sfn|Ruzas|2004b|p=982–983, 987}} The book described material and spiritual life of Lithuanians in poetic, literary language.{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=28}} Excerpts of this work are often included in reading materials for [[Lithuanian literature]] lessons in Lithuanian schools.{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=612}}

Daukantas was one of the first to clearly distinguish a nation from a state. He believed that a nation is defined by its language and customs, not statehood.{{sfn|Mukienė|2010|p=66}} His histories were not about a territory that no longer existed (and that was mourned by [[Adam Mickiewicz]]), but about the living nation.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=64}} As long as Lithuanian language and customs (folklore, songs, tales, proverbs) existed, the Lithuanian nation would also survive.{{sfn|Trumpa|1965}} Daukanatas proposed than developing culture and pursuing education, not just military or political means, were forms of resistance.{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=609}} Therefore, he associated the Lithuanian national identity not with the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but with the Lithuanian language, folk culture, and customs – an idea that was further pursued by the [[Lithuanian National Revival]] and led to the formation of the independent Lithuania in 1918.{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=607}} He further held liberal ideas that people were born with inalienable rights and that there was a [[social contract]] between a nation and the state.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=76}} He thought that peasants and other commoners were the core of a nation thus going against the Polish trend to emphasize the [[Golden Liberty|nation of nobles]].{{sfn|Mukienė|2010|p=66}}{{sfn|Kojala|2012}} 

His primary goal was to inspire love of the homeland and Lithuanian national pride among the common folk.{{sfn|Lukšienė|2014|p=223}} He used poetic and lively descriptions, rhetorical elements, monologues and dialogues, and emotional language that brought his history works closer to a literary work.{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}} Particularly artistic are wild forest and battle scenes.{{sfn|Lukšienė|2014|pp=209–210}} Daukantas painted an idealized image of ancient Lithuanians who embodied [[Stoicism|stoic values]] and lived peacefully in their vast forests until the nobility adopted foreign customs, became lazy, and started exploiting the common folk.{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=609, 611}}{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|pp=412–413}} This depiction echoed ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] that the savage, unspoiled by the civilization, was inherently noble and good.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=75}} He depicted Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] as the great Lithuanian hero while King [[Jogaila]], who initiated the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]] in 1385, was a symbol of all ills and evils that later befell Lithuania.{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|p=419}} He blamed Poland and Polish nobility for Lithuania losing its statehood, moral enslavement of Lithuanians, and falsification and distortions of Lithuania's history.{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|p=415}}{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=72}} Poland brought economic decline and moral decay to Lithuania – the opposite of the common Polish claim that they "civilized" the pagan barbarians.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|pp=77–78}} Such strong anti-Polish sentiment was a radical and daring development among Lithuanians{{sfn|Trumpa|1965}} at the time when Polish intellectuals considered the Polish–Lithuanian union to be sacred,{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=65}} but it paved the way for separating the dual [[Polish-Lithuanian identity]] into the modern Polish and Lithuanian national identities.{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|p=417}} Daukantas identified language as the determining factor of nationality.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=76}} After the publication of ''[[Aušra]]'' in 1883, such anti-Polish attitudes became increasingly common among Lithuanian activists.{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|p=418}} 

Daukantas idealized and idolized the past.{{sfn|Trumpa|1965}} Virgil Krapauskas asserted that Daukantas' letters to Narbutt showed Daukantas to be a better scholar than his works – in the letters Daukantas emphasized the need for better methods of collecting, publishing and analyzing primary sources, though his works remained highly romantic and didactic.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|pp=69–70}} Daukantas spent considerable effort in tracking down various historical documents,{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}} but he believed that where historical records are missing, historians should use their imagination to fill in the gaps.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=69}} If a source was favorable to Lithuania, he did not evaluate it critically and readily accepted a number of legends. For example, he elaborated on the theory that Lithuanians were descendants of [[Herules]] that he took from [[Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz]] (though he rejected the legend about Roman [[Palemonids]]),{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|pp=79–80}} praised ancient democracy of Prussian king [[Widewuto]],{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=610}} and used a loose translation of the short story ''Żiwila'' by [[Adam Mickiewicz]].{{sfn|Girininkienė|2018}} But he was critical of sources that portrayed Lithuania in a negative light.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=71}} For example, he was one of the first to criticize the Teutonic account of the [[Battle of Strėva]] as a crushing defeat of Lithuanian forces or argue that the Lithuanian returned to the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and continued to fight.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=109}} While Daukantas' scholarship was poor and does not stand up to modern standards, it was on par with his contemporaries.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=82}}

Overall, Daukantas' historical works were mostly influenced by the two-volume ''Historiae Lituanae'' by [[Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz]] (published in 1650 and 1669) from which he borrowed the structure, content, rhetorical and stylistic elements. He also borrowed poetic elements from [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]{{sfn|Bončkutė|2018|pp=8–9}} Daukantas cited his sources erratically and inconsistently.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=73}} ''Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių'' had 254 references: 89 to works by [[August von Kotzebue]], 62 to [[Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz]], 29 to [[Nikolay Karamzin]], 15 to {{ill|Antoni Hlebowicz|pl}}, and 10 to [[Teodor Narbutt]], in total 31 authors.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=106–107}} ''Istorija žemaitiška'' cited 320 references; the number of different authors grew to about 70, mostly German historians. There was a shift in references used: von Kotzebue (18 references) fell out of favor and was replaced by [[Johannes Voigt]] (75 references) while Hlebowicz was not cited at all.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=107–108}} At times, he went beyond citing sources and outright plagiarized works by Kojałowicz, Kotzebue, Voigt.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=73}} Daukantas also added a number of citations to primary sources, including the [[Lithuanian Chronicles]], [[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle]], chronicles by [[Wigand of Marburg]], [[Peter von Dusburg]], [[Lucas David]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=108}} Towards the end of the manuscript, the citations became scarcer and rarer. There were only five references, including two to [[Jan Łasicki]], for 227 pages covering the period from 1440 to 1572.{{sfn|Ivinskis|1964}}

In ''Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių'', Daukantas cited a few documents from the [[Lithuanian Metrica]], but perhaps was afraid to cite it more often as it could have attracted unwanted attention from the Tsarist authorities that he was using his access to the Metrica for non-work related purposes (the Metrica was carefully guarded to avoid any alterations or falsifications).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=88, 106}} In this work, Daukantas expanded his bibliography by adding references to ''[[De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum]]'', [[Livonian Chronicle of Henry]], works by [[Alexander Guagnini]] and [[Jan Łasicki]], and others.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=108}} He also used Lithuanian folklore, etymologies, and semantics as a source.{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=610}} While Daukantas cited a wide range of works and authors, including some classical historians such as [[Tacitus]] or [[Ptolemy]], he avoided citing Polish historians who supported the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|union between Poland and Lithuania]] and considered Lithuania to be just a region of Poland. In particular, he disliked and barely cited [[Jan Długosz]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=107–108}} Overall, Daukantas was an erudite and well-read person, familiar with both classical and new western sources.{{sfn|Krapauskas|2000|p=73}} He knew seven languages: Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, Latin, German, Latvian, and French.{{sfn|Martišiūtė-Linartienė|2011|p=607}}

===Dictionaries===
In addition to the brief Latin–Lithuanian dictionary published in 1838, Daukantas compiled three other dictionaries, but they were not published.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=20}} Lithuanians still used the Polish–Latin–Lithuanian dictionary by [[Konstantinas Sirvydas]] first published in 1620. Therefore, Daukantas was not the only Lithuanian to start a new Polish–Lithuanian dictionary. [[Mikalojus Akelaitis]], [[Laurynas Ivinskis]], [[Dionizas Poška]], [[Simonas Stanevičius]], [[Kiprijonas Nezabitauskis]], and others are known to have started compiling a dictionary but their works were similarly not published.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=30}} Daukantas' entries did not provide lexicographic information (for example, gender of nouns) and had very few illustrative examples of how a certain word is used in a sentence. These lexicographic weaknesses reveal Daukantas' tendency to focus solely on words at the price of grammar, syntax, or style.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=29}} He wanted to demonstrate that Lithuanian language is rich in words and is an equal of other languages, but neglected practical aspects of the dictionaries.{{sfn|Subačius|2013|p=551}}

Sometime in 1838–1846,{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=25}} Daukantas worked on a Polish–Lithuanian dictionary that possibly contained about 23,000 words. Only a fragment with 2,244 words has been preserved. The Polish list of words was borrowed from a dictionary published by Jan Litwiński in 1815.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|pp=22–23}} Around 1842–1850, he worked on compiling a Lithuanian–Latin dictionary. The unfinished work contains 3,977 words and stops at the word ''Gwĩldós''.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|pp=26–27}} Around 1850–1855, Daukantas compiled a three-volume 2,280-page Polish–Lithuanian dictionary. It is unfinished and, according to the count by Jonas Kruopas, contains 56,567 Polish words but only 37,677 Lithuanian equivalents.{{sfn|Subačius|1990b|p=79}} For the base list of Polish words, Daukantas used the Polish–French dictionary by {{ill|Stanisław Ropelewski|pl}} published in 1847.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=27}} The manuscript of the last dictionary was transferred by Daukantas' relatives to the [[Lithuanian Scientific Society]] in 1911.{{sfn|Subačius|1990b|p=82}} There it was studied by [[Kazimieras Būga]] who picked out Lithuanian words, sometimes not known from anywhere else, for his planned [[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian]].{{sfn|Subačius|1990b|pp=84–85}} The three volumes of the Polish–Lithuanian dictionary were first published in 1993–1996.{{sfn|Sabaliauskas|2008|p=132}} 

===Books for students===
From his own experience, Daukantas understood that Lithuanian students struggled learning Latin because they had to use Polish textbooks and many Lithuanians did not speak Polish before entering school.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=124–125}} Therefore, in 1837, he published a 120-page grammar book on Latin. It started with a basic introduction to the [[Lithuanian grammar]] on which then [[Latin grammar]] rules were built on. Thus, at the same time, it was one of the first textbooks of Lithuanian grammar.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=125}} In 1838, Daukantas published ''Epitome historiae sacrae'' by the French author [[Charles François Lhomond]]{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=125}} and added a 42-page Latin–Lithuanian dictionary with about 2,350 Latin words and 250 word combinations{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=20}} and 3,880 Lithuanian words and 260 word combinations.{{sfn|Zinkevičius|1990|p=153}} The book was meant as a supplemental Latin reading for school students.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=125}} It was a popular work that was frequently published with a dictionary. Daukantas did not compile the Latin list of words, but translated it from a Polish edition.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=21}}

In 1841, Tsarist authorities, looking to weaken the Polish culture, allowed [[Samogitian Diocese]] to establish parish schools that could teach Lithuanian language.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=126}} In 1842, Daukantas published 1,500 copies of ''Abėcėlė lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių kalbos'' (Alphabet of Lithuanian, Highlander, and Samogitian Language).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=125–126}} The [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] included 18 pages dedicated to Russian language and sample reading material that was not religious.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=127}} While the book included the traditional prayers and [[catechism]], it also added short moral teachings (e.g. to respect your parents), seven fables, and 298 Lithuanian [[proverb]]s. Some of these proverbs were rather crude and vulgar and had to be manually scratched out.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=127}} However, it was not popular. In a letter to [[Motiejus Valančius]], Daukantas bitterly complained that less than 400 copies were sold in two years.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=126}} In 1849, Daukantas prepared a second edition of the primer that removed the non-religious texts, but the manuscript remained unclaimed at the censor's office.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=128}} Another edition was prepared in 1862 which returned the original text except for a few vulgar proverbs, but it could not be published due to the [[Lithuanian press ban]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=129}}

Daukantas prepared five other books for school students, but only two were published during his lifetime. He published a translation of fables by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] (he had them first translated in 1824) and a translation of biographies from ''De viris illustribus'' by [[Cornelius Nepos]], both in 1846.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=129–130}} He published the fables with hopes of awakening an interest in Lithuanian folk tales.{{sfn|Lukšienė|2014|p=213}} He twice translated and reworked ''Robinson der Jüngere'' by [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]] (inspired by ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'') – first in 1846 as 397-page ''Rubinaičio Peliūzės gyvenimas'' (The Life of Rubinaitis Peliūžė; first published in 1984) and then in 1855 as 495-page ''Palangos Petris'' (Petris of Palanga; manuscript lost).{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=131–132}}{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=154}} He adapted the text by changing names to Lithuanian names, geographic names to locations in Lithuania, aboriginal gods to pagan Lithuanian gods, and borrowing historical details from the [[Couronian colonization of the Americas]], but otherwise remained faithful to Campe's text.{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=155–156}} He also translated a work by the Roman historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=132}}

===Other works===
[[File:Daukantas handwriting pg2.jpg|thumb|Daukantas' handwriting in Polish from 1857–1859]]
Daukantas was passionate about the Lithuanian language and its purity. He was concerned that religious books, by far the most popular Lithuanian books at the time, were often translated by foreigners with poor knowledge of Lithuanian. As such, prayer book language was full of [[loanwords]] and [[Barbarism (linguistics)|barbarisms]] from various Slavic languages.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=120}} Therefore, in 1843, he undertook to prepare a prayer book – a rare feat for a layperson – in correct Lithuanian. He took prayers from various popular books of the time and submitted his manuscript to bishop {{ill|Szymon Mikołaj Giedroyć|pl}}.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=121}} The manuscript received the approval from the diocese only in 1847, but for some unknown reason was not published.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=122}}

Daukantas was the first to collect examples of all genres (songs, proverbs, fairy-tales, etc.) of Lithuanian folklore.{{sfn|Lukšienė|2014|p=212}} He added Lithuanian proverbs to several of his works, but earlier works used proverbs already published by other authors. In total, he had prepared 932 proverbs for publication.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=142}} Around 1834–1835, Daukantas started one of the first collections of Lithuanian fairy tales, fables, humorous stories. The handwritten collection was discovered by [[Jonas Jablonskis]] and published in full in 1932.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=142–143}} Daukantas more frequently collected [[Lithuanian folk songs]] – about 850 songs collected by Daukantas are preserved, mostly at the [[Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania]]. In 1846, he published a collection of 118 songs and 190 proverbs.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=142, 145}} Daukantas edited the songs freely, sometimes merging two songs together.{{sfn|Jurgutis|1993|pp=151–152}} It was a popular book, only a few copies survive in Lithuanian libraries and all those those show heavy use. About 70 of these songs were republished by [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] in 1853 and six by [[August Schleicher]] in 1857.{{sfn|Jurgutis|1993|p=154}} Daukantas worked perhaps on three more volumes, but they remained unpublished.{{sfn|Jurgutis|1993|pp=154–155}} Since Daukantas spent most of his time outside of Lithuania, he had to rely on local helpers (members of the intelligentsia or students) to visit the common villagers, write down samples of folklore, and send them to Daukantas. This way, the songs were collected by about 40 different people.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=145–147}} His collection of folklore was published in two volumes in 1983–1984.{{sfn|Jurgutis|1993|p=157}}

In 1847, Daukantas began translating and publishing booklets with agricultural advice in hopes that Lithuanian peasants could improve their economic conditions via more efficient and profitable farming methods.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=135}} They were the first practical steps towards the idea that economic development would lead to the development of the [[national consciousness]].{{sfn|Brazaitis-Ambrazevičius|1980|p=417}} He published works on [[tobacco]] and on [[hops]] in 1847. Next year, he re-published a book on beekeeping – it was already published in Lithuanian in 1801 and 1820.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=136}} In 1849, Daukantas published three booklets – on fruit trees by {{ill|Johann Hermann Zigra|de}}, on tree seeds, and on fire prevention (it was first published in Lithuanian in 1802). The last book on fodder grasses was published in 1854. Daukantas had two more texts translated from Russian and Polish, but they were not published.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=137}} Daukantas added original introductions to these texts where he often returned to history. For example, the books about tree seeds and beekeeping talked about the ancient forests of Lithuania.{{sfn|Lukšienė|2014|p=216}}

===Language and style===
Daukantas was passionate about the purity of the [[Lithuanian language]].{{sfn|Subačius|2013|p=552}} To him it was the primary proof of the language's worth and importance at the time when it was marginalized and pushed out out of the public life by Polish and Russian. Language's practical use (ease of understanding, clear meaning, convenience) was of little importance.{{sfn|Subačius|2013|p=552}} In the early works, Daukantas wrote in the heavy [[Samogitian dialect]] (dounininkai sub-dialect) using plentiful [[diacritic]]s and archaic words, some even borrowed from [[Latvian language|Latvian]] or [[Old Prussian|Prussian]].{{sfn|Subačius|1997|pp=140–141}} Even his contemporaries, including fellow Samogitians [[Motiejus Valančius]] and [[Kajetonas Nezabitauskis]], complained that they had difficulty understanding the language.{{sfn|Subačius|2013|p=551}} After 1845, when he started publishing popular booklets with agricultural advice, his language became less heavy, more similar to the [[Aukštaitian dialect]].{{sfn|Subačius|1997|pp=140–141}} His [[orthography]] is extremely varied and inconsistent, even in the same manuscript, as he experimented wanting to eliminate features of Polish and to include features of [[Prussian Lithuania]] orthography.{{sfn|Subačius|2016|p=184}}

Daukantas had to create numerous [[neologisms]]. The three volume Polish–Lithuanian dictionary contained about 3,800 neologisms.{{sfn|Subačius|1990a|p=29}} As one of the first to write a grammar in Lithuanian, he had to create a number of grammatical terms.{{sfn|Zinkevičius|1990|p=152}} Of the many neologism, a few became widely accepted and used in the modern standard Lithuanian, including ''laikrodis'' (clock), ''prekyba'' (trade), ''vaistininkas'' (pharmacist), ''vietovė'' (location), ''būdvardis'' (adjective), while many other were rejected, including ''aušrėnai'' ([[Balts]]), ''laikoskaitlis'' (chronology), ''rūdarbis'' (tailor).{{sfn|Sabaliauskas|2008|p=132}} He did not consider Latvian to be a foreign language and often borrowed its words, for example ''asinas'' from Latvian ''asins'' for blood, ''muižė'' from Latvian ''muiža'' for manor.{{sfn|Sabaliauskas|2008|p=132}} One of such borrowed words, ''valstybė'' for state or polity, became a standard Lithuanian word.{{sfn|Subačius|Vanags|2016|p=371}} Daukantas was an amateur linguist and frequently offered [[etymologies]] that were based on similar sounding words instead of the scientific [[comparative method]].{{sfn|Sabaliauskas|2008|p=132}}

[[File:Papile, Simonas Daukantas (1793–1864) - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Monument of Daukantas in Papilė errected in 1930]]

While Daukantas died in obscurity and most of his works unpublished, growing [[Lithuanian National Revival]] celebrated his patriotism. Already in the first issue of ''[[Aušra]]'', the first Lithuanian-language newspaper, [[Jonas Šliūpas]] started publishing multi-part biography of Daukantas and raised the idea of publishing his works.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=190}} Two historical studies by Daukantas were first published in ''[[Vienybė lietuvninkų]]'' and later in separate books by [[Lithuanian Americans]] in 1890s.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=191}} Daukantas' life and work were studied by {{ill|Eduards Volters|lv}}, who presented a paper to the [[Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] in 1887, [[Jonas Jablonskis]], who published an article in ''[[Varpas]]'' in 1893, and by {{ill|Mečislovas Davainis-Silvestraitis|lt}}, who published a collection of documents about Daukantas in the United States in 1898.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|pp=191–192}} In 1893, Lithuanian newspapers commemorated the 100th birth anniversary.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=192}} On that occasion, Davainis-Silvestraitis brought a painter to talk to people who knew Daukantas while he was alive and create his portrait. The resulting portrait, though of low artistic quality, was published in United States in an album compiled by [[Antanas Milukas]].{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=193}}

In 1901, [[Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas]] discovered the only known contemporary portrait, painted around 1850. Based on this portrait, [[Petras Rimša]] created a plaster relief in 1905.{{sfn|Ruzas|2004a|p=997}} In 1910, Daukantas' relatives transferred his manuscripts and library to the [[Lithuanian Scientific Society]] which promoted further study of his life and work.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=193}} Historian {{ill|Augustinas Janulaitis|lt}} published an extensive biography of Daukantas in 1913 and his surviving correspondence in 1922.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=194}} Daukantas works were added to the Lithuanian school curriculum of [[Lithuanian literature]]. In 1924, Lithuanian teachers began raising funds for a monument to Daukantas. A bronze sculpture was designed by [[Vincas Grybas]] and erected in Papilė in 1930.{{sfn|Merkys|1991|p=195}}  Since that time, Daukantas life and works were subjects of numerous academic studies. Two volumes of his selected works were published in 1955 followed by reprints or first publications of his other works.{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=29}} His biography was published as separate monographs by [[Vytautas Merkys]] (1972, second edition 1991) and Saulius Žukas (1988).{{sfn|Baar|2010|p=25}} 

In 1927, a bronze bust by sculptor [[Juozas Zikaras]] was erected in the garden of the [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]] in [[Kaunas]] (the bust was destroyed by Soviet authorities and restored in 1988).{{sfn|Antanaitienė|2010}} In 1983, [[Akmenė District Municipality]] turned the former clergy house in [[Papilė]] where Daukantas spent his last years into a memorial museum.{{sfn|ELTA|2003}} From 1993 to the [[Lithuania and the euro|introduction of the euro]] in 2015, Daukantas was featured on 100 [[Lithuanian litas|litas]] banknotes. A monument by sculptor Regimantas Midvikis in his native [[Lenkimai]] was unveiled in 1993.{{sfn|Mukienė|2010|p=67}} The Simonas Daukantas Award was established in 1989 for accomplishments in historical studies, literary work, or other cultural work. Awarded every two years, it is administered by the [[Skuodas District Municipality]] since 2003. Its past recipients included historians [[Vytautas Merkys]], [[Alfredas Bumblauskas]], [[Edvardas Gudavičius]], linguist Giedrius Subačius.{{sfn|Mukienė|2010|p=67}} His place in Lithuanian history is also commemorated by [[Daukantas Square]], facing the [[Presidential Palace, Vilnius|Presidential Palace]] in Vilnius. [[Seimas]] (Lithuanian parliament) declared 2018 as the year of Daukantas.{{sfn|Petraitienė|2018}}

'''Stanley Lloyd Miller''' (March 7, 1930 – May 20, 2007) was an American chemist who made landmark experiments in the [[origin of life]] by demonstrating that a wide range of vital  [[organic compound]]s can be synthesized by fairly simple chemical processes from [[inorganic]] substances. In 1952 he carried out the [[Miller–Urey experiment]], which showed that complex organic molecules could be synthesised from inorganic precursors.  The experiment was widely reported, and provided support for the idea that the [[cosmochemistry|chemical evolution]] of the early Earth had led to the [[abiogenesis|natural synthesis]] of [[organic compound|chemical building blocks of life]] from inanimate [[inorganic compound|inorganic molecules]].&lt;ref name=badajl&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bada JL |title= New insights into prebiotic chemistry from Stanley Miller's spark discharge experiments  |url= |journal= Chem Soc Rev  |volume= 42 |issue= 5 | pages= 2186–2196 |year=2013  |pmid= 23340907|doi=10.1039/c3cs35433d}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as the "father of prebiotic chemistry".&lt;ref name=bada&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Bada JL, Lazcano A |title=Stanley L.

==Life and career==

Stanley Miller was born in [[Oakland, California]]. He was the second child (after a brother, Donald) of Nathan and Edith Miller, descendants of Jewish immigrants from [[Belarus]] and [[Latvia]]. His father was an [[Lawyer|attorney]] and held the office of the Oakland Deputy District Attorney in 1927. His mother was a school teacher so that education was quite a natural environment in the family. In fact, while in [[Oakland High School (Oakland, California)|Oakland High School]] he was nicknamed "a chem whiz". He followed his brother to the [[University of California at Berkeley]] to study chemistry mainly because he felt that Donald would be able to help him on the subject. He completed BSc in June 1951. For graduation course, he faced financial problems, as his father died in 1946 leaving the family with a money shortage. Fortunately with the help from Berkeley faculty (UC Berkeley did not then have assistantships), he was offered a teaching assistantship at the [[University of Chicago]] in February 1951, which could provide the basic funds for graduate work. He joined this post and got registered for a PhD program in September. He frantically searched for a thesis topic to work on, meeting one professor after another, and he was inclined toward theoretical problems as experiments tended to be laborious. He was initially convinced to work with the theoretical physicist [[Edward Teller]] on [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|synthesis of elements]]. Following the customs  of the university, where a graduate student is obliged to attend seminars, he attended a chemistry seminar in which the Nobel laureate [[Harold Urey]] gave a lecture on the origin of solar system and how organic synthesis could be possible under reducing environment such as the primitive Earth's atmosphere. Miller was immensely inspired. After a year of fruitless work with Teller, and the prospect of Teller leaving Chicago to work on the Hydrogen bomb, Miller was prompted to approach Urey in September 1952 for a fresh research project. Urey was not immediately enthusiastic on Miller's interest in pre-biotic synthesis, as no successful works had been done, and he even suggested working on thallium in meteorites. With persistence Miller persuaded Urey to pursue electric discharges in gases. He found clear evidence for the production of amino acids in the reaction vessel.  He was always afraid that some specks of fly excrement might be the source of the amino acids he discovered in the reaction tube (or was so chided by his classmates). This was not the case and the result was a clear demonstration that a host of "[[Organic compound|organic]]" chemical compounds could be produced by purely inorganic processes. Miller eventually earned his doctorate degree in 1954, and a long-lasting reputation. From spectroscopic observations on stars, it is now well known that complex organic compounds are formed in the gases blown off of carbon rich stars as a result of chemical reactions. The fundamental issue of what the connection was between the "pre-biotic organic" compounds and the origin of life has remained.

After completing a [[doctorate]], Miller moved to the [[California Institute of Technology]] as a F. B. Jewett Fellow in 1954 and 1955. Here he worked on the mechanism involved in the amino and [[hydroxy acid]] synthesis. He then joined the Department of Biochemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, [[Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], where he worked for the next 5 years. When the new [[University of California at San Diego]] was established, he became the first Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry in 1960, and an Associate Professor in 1962, and then a full Professor in 1968.&lt;ref name=bada/&gt;&lt;ref name=lazc/&gt;

He supervised 8 PhD students: [[Dennis Hafemann]], [[Jeffrey L. Bada]], [[Nadav Friedmann]], [[James E. Van Trump]], [[Gordon Schlesinger]], [[William E. (Roscoe) Stribling]], [[Jason P. Dworkin]],  and [[H. James Cleaves II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanley Lloyd Miller, Ph.D. |url=https://academictree.org/chemistry/peopleinfo.php?pid=57084 |website=Academic Tree |publisher=The Academic Family Tree |accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miller's Experiment==
{{Main article|Urey-Miller experiment}}
The Miller experiment appeared in his technical paper in the 15 May 1953 issue of [[science (journal)|''Science'']],&lt;ref name=mill&gt;{{cite journal |author = Miller SL |url=|title=Production of amino acids under possible primitive earth conditions|journal=Science |year=1953 |volume=117 |issue=3046 |pages=528–529 |doi=10.1126/science.117.3046.528 |pmid=13056598}}&lt;/ref&gt; which transformed the concept of scientific ideas on the origin of life into a respectable realm of [[empiricism|empirical]] inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bada JL, Lazcano A |title= Miller revealed new ways to study the origins of life |url= |journal= Nature  |volume= 416 |issue= 6880 | pages= 475 |year= 2002 |pmid=11932715 |doi= 10.1038/416475a}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study has become a classic textbook definition of the scientific basis of origin of life, or more specifically, the first definitive experimental evidence of the [[Alexander Oparin|Oparin]]-[[J.B.S. Haldane|Haldane]]'s [[abiogenesis|"primordial soup" theory]]. Urey and Miller designed to simulate the ocean-atmospheric condition of the primitive Earth by using a continuous run of [[water vapour|steam]] into a mixture of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The gaseous mixture was then exposed to electrical discharge, which induced chemical reaction.  After a week of reaction, Miller detected the formation of [[amino acids]], such as [[glycine]], α- and β-[[alanine]], using [[paper chromatography]]. He also detected [[aspartic acid]] and [[Gamma amino butyric acid|gamma-amino butyric acid]], but was not confident because of the weak spots. Since amino acids are the basic structural and functional constituents of cellular life, the experiment showed the possibility of natural organic synthesis for the origin of life on earth.&lt;ref name=ucsd&gt;{{cite web| author=UCSD News Center |title= Father of 'Origin of Life' Chemistry at UC San Diego Dies|date= 21 May 2007| url= http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/05-07OriginofLifeKM-.asp |work= ucsdnews.ucsd.edu |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate= 2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lazcano A, Bada JL |title= The 1953 Stanley L.

===Publication problem===

Miller showed his results to Urey, who suggested immediate publication. Urey declined to be the co-author lest Miller would receive little or no credit. The manuscript with Miller as the sole author was submitted to ''Science'' on 10 February 1953. After weeks of silence, Urey inquired and wrote to the chair of the editorial board on 27 February on the lack of action in [[peer review|reviewing]] the manuscript. A month passed, but still there was no decision. On 10 March the infuriated Urey demanded the manuscript to be returned, and he himself submitted it to the ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'' on 13 March. By then, the editor of ''Science'', apparently annoyed by Urey's insinuation, wrote directly to Miller that the manuscript was to be published. Miller accepted it and withdrew the manuscript from the ''Journal of the American Chemical Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bada JL, Lazcano A |title= Perceptions of science.

===Follow-up===

Miller continued his research until his death in 2007. As the knowledge on early atmosphere progressed, and techniques for chemical analyses advanced, he kept on refining the details and methods. He not only succeeded in synthesising more and more varieties of amino acids, he also produced a wide variety of inorganic and organic compounds essential for cellular construction and metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Miller SL |title= Current status of the prebiotic synthesis of small molecules |url= |journal= Chem Scr |volume= 26 |issue= B | pages= 5–11 |year= 1986 |pmid= 11542054|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In support, a number of independent researchers also confirmed the range of chemical syntheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hough L, Rogers AF |title= Synthesis of amino-acids from water, hydrogen, methane and ammonia  |url= |journal= J Physiol |volume=  132|issue= 2| pages= 28–30 |year= 1956 |pmid=13320416 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Oro J |title=  Chemical evolution and the origin of life.|url= |journal= Adv Space Res |volume= 3 |issue= 9 | pages= 77–94 |year= 1983 |pmid= 11542466|doi= 10.1016/0273-1177(83)90044-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Basile B, Lazcano A, Oró J |title= Prebiotic syntheses of purines and pyrimidines  |url= |journal= Adv Space Res   |volume= 4 |issue= 12 | pages=125–131  |year= 1984 |pmid= 11537766|doi= 10.1016/0273-1177(84)90554-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakschitz TA, Rode BM |title= Chemical evolution from simple inorganic compounds to chiral peptides |url= |journal= Chem Soc Rev  |volume= 41 |issue= 16 | pages=5484–5489  |year= 2012 |pmid=22733315|doi= 10.1039/c2cs35073d }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the most recent revelation that, unlike the original Miller's experimental hypothesis of strongly reducing condition, the primitive atmosphere could be quite neutral containing other gases in different proportions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zahnle K, Schaefer L, Fegley B |title= Earth's earliest atmospheres  |url= |journal= Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |volume= 2 |issue= 10 | pages= a004895 |year= 2010 |pmid= 20573713|pmc=2944365|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a004895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's last works, posthumously published in 2008, still succeeded in synthesising an array of organic compounds using such condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cleaves HJ, Chalmers JH, Lazcano A, Miller SL, Bada JL |title= A reassessment of prebiotic organic synthesis in neutral planetary atmospheres  |url= |journal= Orig Life Evol Biosph  |volume= 38 |issue= 2 | pages=105–115  |year= 200 |pmid= 18204914|doi= 10.1007/s11084-007-9120-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reassessment==

In 1972 Miller and his collaborators repeated the 1953 experiment, but with a newly developed automatic chemical analysers, such as [[ion-exchange chromatography]] and [[gas chromatography]]-[[mass spectrometry]]. They synthesised 33 amino acids, including 10 that are known to naturally occur in organisms. These included all of the primary alpha-amino acids found in the [[Murchison meteorite]], which fell on Australia in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ring D, Wolman Y, Friedmann N, Miller SL |title= Prebiotic synthesis of hydrophobic and protein amino acids |url= |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  |volume= 69 |issue= 3 | pages= 765–768 |year= 1972 |pmid=4501592|pmc= 426553 |doi=10.1073/pnas.69.3.765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent electric discharge experiment actually produced more variety of amino acids than that in the meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolman Y, Haverland WJ, Miller SL |title= Nonprotein amino acids from spark discharges and their comparison with the murchison meteorite amino acids  |url= |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  |volume= 69 |issue= 4 | pages= 809–811 |year= 1972 |pmid= 16591973|pmc= 426569 |doi=10.1073/pnas.69.4.809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before Miller's death, several boxes containing vials of dried residues were found among his laboratory materials at the university. The note indicated that some were from his original 1952-1954 experiments, produced by using three different apparatuses, and one from 1958, which included [[hydrogen sulphide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the gaseous mixture for the first time and the result never published. In 2008 his students re-analysed the 1952 samples using more sensitive techniques, such as [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] and liquid chromatography–time of flight
mass spectrometry. Their result showed the synthesis of 22 amino acids and 5 amines, revealing that the original Miller experiment produced many more compounds than actually reported in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson AP, Cleaves HJ, Dworkin JP, Glavin DP, Lazcano A, Bada JL |title= The Miller volcanic spark discharge experiment|journal= Science|volume= 322|issue=5900|pages=404|doi= 10.1126/science.1161527|year=2008|pmid=18927386}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unreported 1958 samples were analysed in 2011, from which 23 amino acids and 4 amines, including 7 organosulfur compounds, were detected.&lt;ref name=badajl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parker ET, Cleaves HJ, Dworkin JP, Glavin DP, Callahan M, Aubrey A, Lazcano A, Bada, JL|title=Primordial synthesis of amines and amino acids in a 1958 Miller H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich spark discharge experiment|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=108|issue=12|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019191108|year=2011|pmid=21422282|pmc=3078417|pages=5526–5531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keim|first=Brandon|title=Forgotten Experiment May Explain Origins of Life|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/10/forgotten-exper/|accessdate=March 22, 2011|newspaper=[[Wired Magazine]]|date=October 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steigerwald|first=Bill|title=Volcanoes May Have Provided Sparks and Chemistry for First Life|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/volcanic_life_origin.html|accessdate=March 22, 2011|newspaper=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|date=October 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Miller suffered a series of strokes beginning in November, 1999 that increasingly inhibited his physical activity. He was living in a [[nursing home]] in [[National City, California|National City]], south of San Diego, and died on 20 May 2007 at the nearby Paradise Hospital. He is survived by his brother Donald and his family, and his devoted partner Maria Morris.&lt;ref name=ucsd/&gt;

==Honours and recognitions==

Miller is remembered for his seminal works in the origin of life (and he was considered a pioneer in the field of [[exobiology]]), the natural occurrence of [[clathrate hydrates]], and general mechanisms of action of [[anesthesia]]. He was elected to the US [[National Academy of Science]] in 1973. He was  an Honorary Counselor of the Higher Council for Scientific Research of Spain in 1973. He was awarded the [[Oparin Medal]] by the International Society of the Study of the Origin of Life in 1983, and served as its President from 1986 to 1989.&lt;ref name=ucsd/&gt;

He was nominated for [[Nobel Prize]] more than once, but never won any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Chi KR |title= Stanley L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">The '''Summers memo''' was a 1991 memo on trade [[neoliberalism|liberalization]] that was written by [[Lant Pritchett]] and signed by [[Lawrence Summers]] who was then Chief [[Economist]] of the [[World Bank]]. It included a section that both Summers and Pritchett say was sarcastic that suggested dumping [[toxic waste]] in [[third-world countries]] for perceived economic benefits.&lt;ref name="cato-potential-1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Jay |author2=Gary Pecquet |author3=Leon Taylor|date=Fall 2007|title=Potential Gains from Trade in Dirty Industries: Revisiting Lawrence Summers' Memo |journal=Cato Journal|publisher=Cato Institute|volume=27|issue=3|url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2007/11/cj27n3-6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the material was leaked by [[Roberto Smeraldi]] of [[Friends of the Earth]] to ''[[Jornal do Brasil]]'' on February 2, 1992.&lt;ref name="jornal"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Bank Analyst Suggests Transferring Pollution to the Poor|work=[[Jornal do Brasil]]|date=2 February 1992|ref=jornal}}, quoted on page 135 of ''[http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/nomination-of-lawrence-h-summers Nomination Of Lawrence H. Summers]: Hearing before the Committee on Finance'', Senate, 103rd Cong. 1 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Pritchett (who worked under Summers) stated that he had written the memo and Summers had only signed it, and that it was intended to be "sarcastic". According to Pritchett, the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony, and was "a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit Larry and the World Bank".&lt;ref name="harvardmag"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Toxic Memo|journal=Harvard Magazine|date=1 May 2001|url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/2001/05/toxic-memo.html|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Hausman and Michael McPherson have argued that the satirical section might seem to be based in economics as a science, but in fact contains strong moral premises which cannot be removed and still leave the argument intact.&lt;ref name="econmoral"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hausman,|first1=Daniel M.|last2=McPherson|first2=Michael S.|title=Economic Analysis, Moral Philosophy and Public Policy|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781139450652|pages=12–23|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZR_QJXfrfuEC&amp;pg=PA12|ref=econmoral}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]]ian Secretary of the Environment [[Jose Lutzenberger]] argued that it demonstrated "the arrogant ignorance of many conventional 'economists' concerning the nature of the world we live in".&lt;ref name=whirledbank&gt;[http://www.whirledbank.org/ourwords/summers.html text and commentary], The Whirled Bank (satirical website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subject: GEP

'Dirty' Industries: Just between you and me, shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging MORE migration of the dirty industries to the LDCs [Least Developed Countries]? I can think of three reasons:

1) The measurements of the costs of health impairing pollution depends on the foregone earnings from increased morbidity and mortality. From this point of view a given amount of health impairing pollution should be done in the country with the lowest cost, which will be the country with the lowest wages. I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.

2) The costs of pollution are likely to be non-linear as the initial increments of pollution probably have very low cost. I've always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly UNDER-polluted, their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City. Only the lamentable facts that so much pollution is generated by non-tradable industries (transport, electrical generation) and that the unit transport costs of solid waste are so high prevent world welfare enhancing trade in air pollution and waste.

3) The demand for a clean environment for aesthetic and health reasons is likely to have very high income elasticity. The concern over an agent that causes a one in a million change in the odds of prostrate[sic] cancer is obviously going to be much higher in a country where people survive to get prostrate[sic] cancer than in a country where under 5 mortality is 200 per thousand. Also, much of the concern over industrial atmosphere discharge is about visibility impairing particulates. These discharges may have very little direct health impact. Clearly trade in goods that embody aesthetic pollution concerns could be welfare enhancing. While production is mobile the consumption of pretty air is a non-tradable.

The problem with the arguments against all of these proposals for more pollution in LDCs (intrinsic rights to certain goods, moral reasons, social concerns, lack of adequate markets, etc.) could be turned around and used more or less effectively against every Bank proposal for liberalization.

'''The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage''', usually known by its acronym '''TICCIH''', is the international society dedicated to the study of [[industrial archaeology]] and the protection, promotion and interpretation of the [[industrial heritage]]. TICCIH's [https://web.archive.org/web/20130126093839/http://www.ticcih.org/industrial_heritage.htm Nizhny Tagil Charter (archived)], signed in 2003, is the international guidance document for the industrial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icomos.org/18thapril/2006/nizhny-tagil-charter-e.pdf Nizhny Tagil Charter (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the ''Joint ICOMOS – TICCIH Principles for the Conservation of Industrial Heritage Sites, Structures, Areas and Landscapes'', also called "The Dublin Principles", were adopted in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org/Paris2011/GA2011_ICOMOS_TICCIH_joint_principles_EN_FR_final_20120110.pdf Dublin Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its period of interest extends forward from the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and generally includes the material and documentary remains of manufacturing and extractive industry, transport and public service infrastructure. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of industrial archaeology, it draws in enthusiasts and professionals from many fields.

TICCIH was founded after the ''First International Conference for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage'' in [[Ironbridge]], [[England]], in 1973. It holds a triennial conference of which the next will be organised by [http://www.cilac.com/ CILAC] in [[Lille]], northern [[France]], in 2015. It is organized through a Board and President who are chosen by the National Representatives of the various national committees or associated societies. It has both individual members and national societies such as the North American [[Society for Industrial Archeology]] (SIA), the French [[Comité d'information et de liaison pour l'archéologie, l'étude et la mise en valeur du patrimoine industriel]] (CILAC) or the British [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]] (AIA). Members receive the digital quarterly ''TICCIH Bulletin'' and discounted fees for the congress.

TICCIH has been [[ICOMOS]]’s specialist adviser on industrial heritage since 2000 and assesses industrial sites for the [[World Heritage]] List. It has published a series of guideline documents including canals, railways, bridges and coal mines, which can be downloaded from the TICCIH or ICOMOS websites.

''Industrial Heritage Re-Tooled, the TICCIH guide to industrial heritage'' was published in November, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Heritage Re-tooled: The TICCIH guide to Industrial Heritage Conservation. James Douet (ed.). Lancaster: Carnegie Publishing, 2012. pp. 244 {{ISBN|978-1-85936-218-1}} [http://www.worldcat.org/title/industrial-heritage-re-tooled-the-ticcih-guide-to-industrial-heritage-conservation/oclc/827455632 WorldCat link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 all 61 national member organizations of the [[Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens]] (FIVA) ratified and enacted the ''"Turin Charter"'', set forth by TICCIH ''"to preserve and safeguard the history of vehicles including their engineering, form, functions and documented histories and their many and diverse relationships with society and social environments, .."'' &lt;ref name=TICCIHturin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ticcih.org/turin-charter-ratified-by-fiva-federation-internationale-des-vehicules-anciens/ |title=Turin Charter ratified by FIVA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311151521/http://ticcih.org/turin-charter-ratified-by-fiva-federation-internationale-des-vehicules-anciens/ |archive-date=2018-03-11 |dead-url=no |last=Jerina |first=Nataša G. |date=May 2014 |website= |publisher=TICCIH |access-date=2018-03-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turin Charter follows in the trail of the [[Venice Charter|Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites]], the [[Barcelona Charter]], in full the ''"European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Traditional Ships in Operation"'', and the [[Riga Charter|Riga Charter on Authenticity and Historical Reconstruction in Relationship to Cultural Heritage]], which articulated standards for the maintenance and preservation of historically significant buildings, watercraft and rail vehicles, respectively.&lt;ref name=TICCIHturin/&gt;

'''Võ Thị Sáu''' ([[Đất Đỏ]], 1933 – March 13, 1952) was a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] schoolgirl who fought as a guerilla against the French occupiers of [[Vietnam]], then part of [[French Indochina]]. She was captured, tried, convicted and executed by the French colonialists in 1952, becoming the first woman to be executed at [[Côn Đảo Prison|Côn Sơn Prison]]. Today she is considered a Vietnamese [[Martyr|national martyr]] and [[Hero|heroine]].

==Biography==
She was born in Phước Thọ Commune, [[Đất Đỏ District]] in 1933. At the time, this was part of Bà Rịa Province, but today is a part of Long Đất District, [[Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu Province]]. In 1948, she became a contact for a local guerilla group after many of her friends and family joined the [[Việt Minh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eager|first=Paige Whaley|title=From Freedom Fighters to Terrorists: Women and Political Violence|page=131|year=2008|quote=One story in particular of Vo Thi Sau exemplifies the commitment of the women to the cause of national liberation. In 1948, after many of her friends and relatives joined the Resistance against the French, Sau became a courier and saboteur for a local guerrilla group....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sáu was imprisoned in three different facilities,&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; the last of which was a police post near [[Côn Đảo Prison|Côn Sơn Prison]] in the [[Côn Đảo|Côn Đảo Islands]]. She was executed on March 13, 1952, at the age of 19 by firing squad in the corner of Bagne III; it is said that she refused to wear a blindfold.&lt;ref name="emmons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmons|first=Ron|title=Frommer's Vietnam: with Angkor War|year=2012|quote=Perhaps the most tragically poignant story of Con Son's prisoners is that of Vo Thi Sau, executed by the French at 19 years of age for lobbing a grenade at French soldiers when she was only 14. These days there is something of a cult ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was 14 she threw a [[grenade]] at a group of French soldiers in the crowded market area, killing 1 of them and injuring 12. She escaped undetected. Late in 1949, she threw another grenade at a Vietnamese canton chief &amp;mdash; a local man responsible for executing many suspected Việt Minh sympathizers. The grenade failed to explode, and she was caught by the French authorities.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnamese women in society and revolution |volume= Volume 1|first= Paul|last= Grace |year= 1974 |chapter=Introduction |quote=On March 13, 1952 the French executed a sixteen-year-old woman named Vo Thi Sau.

Late in 1949 a Vietnamese collaborator who was the canton chief of the district managed to get the French to execute hundreds of young men suspected of being Viet Minh cadres right in the market place. Sau was given the responsibility of eliminating this traitor. Since ammunition was so scarce, she was given only one hand grenade. It did not explode and she was caught by the French authorities. She went through three jails and scores of....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Sáu is considered a nationalist martyr and a symbol of revolutionary spirit. She is venerated by the Vietnamese people as an ancestral spirit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Rivka Syd Matova|title=Re-staging revolution and remembering toward change: National Liberation Front women perform prospective memory in Vietnam|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.|year=2008|page=287|quote=The Spirit of Vo Thi Sau – One of the other spirits lingering and listening in the room with us is that of the national martyr (liet si) Vo Thi Sau.

Vo Thi Sau ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has amassed almost a cult-like following of devotees who venerate her grave in [[Hàng Dương Cemetery]] on Côn Sơn Island.&lt;ref name="emmons" /&gt; There is also a temple dedicated to her in her hometown of Đất Đỏ. Many Vietnamese cities and towns also have streets and schools named after her.
