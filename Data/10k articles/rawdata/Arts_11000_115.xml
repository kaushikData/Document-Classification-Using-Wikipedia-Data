In 1953 [[Alcoa Inc|Alcoa Aluminum]]&lt;ref name="tele" /&gt; produced an advertisement promoting their HyTop twist-off [[bottle cap]]. The advertisement, often erroneously attributed to [[Del Monte Foods]],&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/sexist-ads-mad-men-era-gallery-1.1050013?pmSlide=1.1050003 |title=Del Monte Ketchup: 'You mean a woman can open it?'

== Description ==
The advertisement features a woman wearing red lipstick and looking at the reader while holding a Del Monte ketchup bottle with the appearance of being about to open it. The tagline directly below it is, "You mean a woman can open it?" with the word ''woman'' underlined. The first sentence of the article it accompanied stated, "Easily—without a knife blade, a bottle opener, or even a husband!"&lt;ref name=od&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/why-we-cant-afford-not-to-be-politically-correct |title=Why We Can't Afford Not To Be Politically Correct |work=The Odyssey |date=2016-10-17 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical review ==
The advertisement has been described as an example of targeted advertising towards women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/aridinger/postwwii-advertisements |title=Aprons in Advertising |publisher=Slideshare |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is viewed as a symbol of [[social stereotype]]s during the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Elizabeth | last =Muir  | title =Canadian Women in the Sky: 100 Years of Flight | publisher = Dundurn | edition =   | year = 2015 | isbn = 1459731883 | page = 138}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is frequently cited as emblematic of the ''[[Mad Men]]'' era.&lt;ref name=mm /&gt;&lt;ref name=ind /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wicks |first=Heidi |url=http://theindependent.ca/tag/mad-men/ |title=Mad Men |work=The Independent.ca |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly interpretation states that it implies that a woman is dependent upon her husband to do things for her.&lt;ref name=od /&gt; In one such commentary, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' stated that the woman in the advertisement is "clearly stunned and possibly delighted" at being able to open the bottle easily.&lt;ref name=ny /&gt; In addition, the advertisement has been used as a symbol of retro advertising, with a book bearing the same title as the tagline being published in 2000 by [[Adams Media]] detailing retro advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ad Nauseum |title=You Mean a Woman Can Open It...? |publisher=Adams Media |year=2000 |isbn=1580623778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that it enforced the stereotype of a woman as an unintelligent housewife.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|first=Susie |last=Rushden |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/columnists/susie-rushton-turn-the-heating-off-ndash-and-feel-virtuous-2146961.html |title=Turn the heating off – and feel virtuous |work=The Independent |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Agony in the Garden William Blake.jpg|thumb|400px|''The Agony in the Garden'', 1799–1800. [[Tempera]] on tinned iron, 27 cm × 38 cm]]
'''''The Agony in the Garden''''' is a small painting by [[William Blake]], completed as part of his 1799–1800 series of Bible illustrations commissioned by his patron and friend Thomas Butts. The work illustrates a passage from the [[Gospel of Luke]] which describes [[Agony in the Garden|Christ's turmoil]] in the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]] before his arrest and Crucifixion following [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]'s betrayal.&lt;ref name="h64"&gt;Hamlyn et al, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In Blake's painting a brilliantly coloured and majestic angel breaks through the surrounding darkness and descends from a cloud to aid and physically support Jesus in his hour of agony.&lt;ref name="r123"&gt;Raine, 123&lt;/ref&gt; The work is dominated by vertical lines, formed both from the trees and from the two arms of the angel. Two inner lines converge on Christ's palms, evoking the nails driven through him during his crucifixion. 

''The Agony in the Garden'' was bequeathed by  Blake collector Graham Robertson to the National Trust in 1948. It was acquired by the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-the-agony-in-the-garden-n05894 ''The Agony in the Garden'' c. 1799–1800]. [[Tate Britain]], London. Retrieved 14 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Between 1799 and 1803, Blake produced over 150 biblical illustrations for Thomas Butts. Around 50 were complete for the 1799–1880 series, of which around 30 are extant. They are all around the same size; all but two are significantly larger than the average 28cm x 38cm. Only the present work is on tinned steel; the majority of the others are painted on canvas. The works, all minutely detailed and richly coloured, involve complex and innovative arrangement and design.&lt;ref name="T112"&gt;Townsend et al, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The text accompanying ''The Agony in the Garden'' reads: "And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."&lt;ref name="h64" /&gt; The painting shows Christ kneeling in the garden with his arms outstretched and leaning backwards as if about to faint. He is held at the waist by an angel descending from a multi-coloured cloud. The angel supports Christ as he leans back, crying out in agony.&lt;ref name="r123" /&gt; Both the angel and cloud are composed by a dominant impasted white, and lined with brilliant varieties of red, blue, yellow and green pigments. Three vaguely described, almost ghostly, disciples kneel in the dark trees to either side. 

[[File:Nativity by Blake.jpg|thumb|''Nativity'', 1790-1800. Tempera on copper. [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]
Art historian [[Anthony Blunt]] linked this work to Blake's ''Nativity'' and ''Procession to Calvary'', and contended that they provide insight to Blake's mindset at the time. The artist had earlier been preoccupied with the nature of evil and the duality of human nature, but seemingly emerged and found hope through the ideal of salvation through Christ. According to Blunt, Blake conveys this through the motif of a bright light shining into the darkness of mankind. In the present work this is perhaps expressed through the angel appearing in brilliantly illuminated colours from the darkness and foreboding of the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Geoffrey. "'The Art of William Blake' by Anthony Blunt". ''Criticism'', Volume 2, No. 3, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is built up from a number of layers of paint above the underlying priming. In some cases the layers are separated by films of binding glue. The foreground is built from a chalk ground above the priming, which gives added texture, and is especially evident around the areas of the tress and scrubs.&lt;ref name="T120"&gt;Townsend et al, 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material==
[[File:Eve Tempted by the Serpent William Blake.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Eve Tempted by the Serpent''. Tempera on Copper. Another work from the series painted on metal, in this case copperplate.]]
The painting is unique in Blake's oeuvre in that the [[tempera]] is painted on tinned iron. Most of the works in the series were painted onto canvas, with three on copper and only the present work on tinned iron. It has been suggested that this plate may originally have formed the lid of a box, possibly a paint box.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, 103&lt;/ref&gt; The work is further unique in that he employed cherry gum in his mixture, utilising a blend more commonly associated with earlier, medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]], but which delivers a smoother and more durable effect.&lt;ref name="t120"&gt;Townsend et al, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In employing tinned iron Blake was likely experimenting with methods of etching or painting on metal, perhaps following the examples of [[Lucas van Leyden]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s work on [[Intaglio printing|copperplate]].&lt;ref name="t30"&gt;Townsend et al, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; The surface was prepared with oil and lead before the application of the paint, although red lead pigment was applied directly onto the tin around the area of the angel's lower back and waist. Unfortunately this pigment is not well bound to the surface and has suffered damage and loss of paint.&lt;ref name="m87"&gt;Mulhallen, 87&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some areas of colour were retouched by restorers around 1850 following dulling and loss of paint. This is most obvious with the bright greens to either side of Christ. However, the additions are barely noticeable as the restorers employed pigments prepared in a similar matter to the originals.&lt;ref name="t157"&gt;Townsend et al, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
''The Agony in the Garden'' is in very poor condition. This is mainly due to a built up of material following corrosion of the iron.&lt;ref name="t30" /&gt; This material has gathered between the painting's metal surface and priming, resulting in the delamination and displacement of pigment.&lt;ref name="t155"&gt;Townsend et al, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Blake sealed his metal support with red paint bound with a gum mixture and animal glue, which was at the time thought of as a corrosion inhibitor. But these surfaces offered little protection against the decay of the paint layers, and in fact contributed to the displacement of pigment.&lt;ref name="t119"&gt;Townsend et al, 119&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a damaged signature "WBinv" in white paint at the lower right, although it is undated.&lt;ref name="t118"&gt;Townsend et al, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ailerán''', also known as '''Ailerán sapientis''' (Ailerán the Wise) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[scholar]] and [[saint]] who died on 29 December, 664 or 665. His [[feast day]] is December 29.

==Biography==
Ailerán was one of the most distinguished scholars at the School of [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref name=grattan&gt;Grattan-Flood, William. "St. Aileran." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01234c.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

His early life is not recorded, but he was attracted to Clonard by the fame of Saint [[Finnian of Clonard|Finnián]] and his disciples. He became [[Reader (liturgy)|lector]] of the school&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=134 Ailerani Interpretatio Mystica Progenitorum Domini Iesu Christi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406132134/http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=134 |date=2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 650. He died of the [[Yellow Plague]], and his death is recorded in the [[Annals of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brigid-undertheoak.blogspot.com/2010/01/irish-saints-of-december-aireran-wise.html Aileran]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his knowledge of the works of [[Origen]], [[Philo]], [[St. Jerome]], [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], and others, he was well versed in patristic literature.

==Works==

According to [[John Colgan]], numerous works can be ascribed to Ailerán, including the ''Fourth Life of [[Saint Patrick]]'', a Latin litany, and the ''Lives'' of [[Saint Brigid]] and Saint [[Féichín of Fore]]. Ailerán's best known work is his mystical interpretation of the ''Ancestry of Our Lord Jesus Christ'', according to the [[genealogy of Jesus]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Saint Matthew's Gospel]].&lt;ref name=grattan/&gt; This was published in the [[Benedictine]] edition of the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]], and the editors said that they published it although Aileran was not a Benedictine, because he " unfoulded the meaning of the Sacred Scripture with so much learning and ingenuity that every student of the Sacred Volume and especially preachers of the Divine Word will regard the publication as most acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/WestCorkHistory/Monasteries.php Monasticism in Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; Another work of his is titled ''A Short Moral Explanation of the Sacred Names'', which could be a fragment of a larger work.

'''Ardian Syaf''' is an [[Indonesians|Indonesian]] [[comic book]] artist. He has worked for [[DC Comics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dccomics.com/talent/ardian-syaf |title=Ardian Syaf|publisher=DC Comics|year=2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvel Comics]], and [[Dynamite Entertainment]].

In April 2017 he became embroiled in controversy for inserting hidden anti-semitic and anti-Christian messages in ''[[X-Men Gold]]'' #1, for which his contract with Marvel Comics was terminated.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Brown, Tracy (11 April 2017). [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-april-marvel-officially-terminates-x-men-1491945410-htmlstory.html "'My career is over now': Marvel terminates 'X-Men Gold' artist's contract amid controversy"].

==Early life==
Ardian Syaf was born in [[Tulungagung]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=CNNIndonesia&gt;Khoiri, Agniya (10 April 2017).

[[CNN Indonesia]].&lt;/ref&gt; He first developed the desire to draw [[comics]] in his youth, after his father bought him his first comic. Among his influences are [[Hermann Huppen]], a Belgian comics artist for whom Syaf has expressed admiration. He embarked upon a career as a professional [[comics artist]] in 2003, deciding that leaving his interest in drawing comics and working in a conventional job was not something he was willing to do.&lt;ref name=ComicsWaitingRoom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicswaitingroom.com/dresdenfiles.html |title=Dresden File Interview |first=Avril |last=Brown |work=ComicsWaitingRoom.com |date=2008 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Syaf started his career in 2007 with [[Dabel Brothers Publishing]], illustrating ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' for 11 issues.&lt;ref name=CNNIndonesia/&gt; Syaf's work on the 2008 graphic novel ''[[Welcome to the Jungle (comics)|Welcome to the Jungle]]'' was nominated for the 2008 [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story]], losing to ''[[Girl Genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2009-hugo-awards/ "2009 Hugo Awards"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830061036/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2009-hugo-awards |date=2009-08-30 }}.

At one point Syaf met an Irish screenwriter named Catie through Dabel Brothers, through which began to get work with [[Marvel Comics]],&lt;ref name=CNNIndonesia/&gt; his earliest book assignments involving the sharing of penciling duties with other artists, such as Jorge Molina on ''[[X-Men: Manifest Destiny: Nightcrawler]]'' #1 (May 2009), and [[Leonard Kirk]] on ''[[Captain Britain and MI13]]'' #13 and 14 (July, August 2009). His earliest work for [[DC Comics]] was "[[The Origin of Congorilla]]" a backup story written by [[Len Wein]] that appeared in ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'' #1 (September 2009). He shared the art duties on ''[[Justice League of America]]'' (Vol. 2) #34 (August 2009) with [[Eddy Barrows]], but its quality was decried by critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/dc-comics/justice-league-of-america/34 "Justice League of America #34"].

In 2009, he signed a two-year exclusivity contract with DC. That contract ended in September 2011, though he indicated that it would be renewed, and that he would be drawing the ''[[Batgirl]]'' series as part of the company's 2011 reboot of its books, [[The New 52]],&lt;ref name=SingaporeComix&gt;{{cite web |url= http://singaporecomix.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/interview-with-ardian-syafstgcc-2011.html |title=Interview with Ardian Syaff at STGCC|first=Cheng |last=Tju|work=Singapore Comix|date=22 August 2011|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Jason (26 June 2009).

During his run on that series, Simone set one storyline in an [[Indonesia]]n neighborhood of [[Gotham City]] in order to exploit Syaf's experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johnston, Rich]] (12 April 2017).

[[Weekly Comic Book Review]].&lt;/ref&gt; His artwork for the premiere issue in particular drew praise by Iann Robinson of [[CraveOnline]] for the manner in which Syaf adapted his style during different parts of the story, effecting a "light and airy" during the daytime scenes with Barbara Gordon, a darker, shadowy look for in-costume scenes, and a grainy, old-fashioned cinematic appearance for the flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Iann (8 September 2011). [http://www.craveonline.com/site/173920-new-52-review-batgirl-1 "New 52 Review: Batgirl #1"]. [[CraveOnline]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in a 2011 interview what projects he would like to work on, Syaf responded that he would like to draw [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]], as that is a character that he adores. He also stated that he would like to do a ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' story set in Indonesia, which would involve the superstitious beliefs of his home country.&lt;ref name=SingaporeComix/&gt;

===Easter egg references and ''X-Men Gold'' controversy===
Syaf is known to engage in the practice of hiding [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] references to political figures in the backgrounds of his artwork. In ''[[Batgirl]]'' (Vol 4) #9 (July 2012), for example, Syaf included a storefront sign that referenced the [[President of Indonesia]], [[Joko Widodo]], although the text that accompanies the image of Widodo in Syaf's penciled artwork is covered by a caption in the final, published issue.&lt;ref name=BleedingCool8.4.17&gt;Johnston, Rich (April 8, 2017).

In April 2017, Syaf was at the center of controversy for including multiple Easter eggs in ''[[X-Men Gold]]'' #1 that referenced the [[November 2016 Jakarta protests]] against [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], the governor of Jakarta, which were viewed by readers as [[anti-Semitic]] and [[anti-Christian]].

On the double-page spread of Pages 10 and 11 of ''X-Men Gold'' #1, in which the Jewish X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]] appeals to a crowd of people for tolerance, Syaf's art places Kitty's head next to the word "Jewelry" on a storefront awning in the background. The number "212", a reference to the 2 December protest, is prominently placed on another store's awning. The number "51" is seen on the baseball cap of one of the people in the crowd, and on the shirt of another, a reference to the Quranic verse 5:51 at the center of the Indonesia protests.&lt;ref name=ComicBook.com&gt;Lovett, Jamie (April 8, 2017).

[[ComicBook.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; The third panel on that spread features a male bystander with a shirt reading "AL M", which may be a reference to Al-Maidah 51, another way to designate the controversial verse.&lt;ref name=Vulture&gt;Riseman, Abraham (10 April 2017).

[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the second panel of Page 12, the X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] wears a shirt prominently displaying the text "QS 5:51". This led to an outcry on social media on Saturday, April 8, three days after the book's publication, by readers who viewed the verse as support of intolerance towards other religions.&lt;ref name=ComicBook.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vulture/&gt; Syaf was also angrily denounced by Marvel writer [[G. Willow Wilson]], a Muslim herself, who wrote an essay elucidating the verse and warning of the danger of the conservative Indonesian interpretation of it.&lt;ref name=Vulture/&gt; The Easter eggs also drew negative reaction from Syaf's fellow Indonesian comics creators.&lt;ref name=ComicsBeat/&gt;

The perceived inappropriateness of these messages stemmed from the fact that the ''[[X-Men]]'' storylines have traditionally served as [[allegories]] warning of the dangers of bigotry since their creation in 1963 by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] (both of whom are Jewish themselves), and the characters themselves (including the Jewish Kitty Pryde and Catholic [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], a former priest) serving as stand-ins for oppressed minority groups.&lt;ref name=CBR4.9.17&gt;Ching, Albert (April 9, 2017).

Bleeding Cool.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually acknowledged the political nature of the hidden messages,&lt;ref name=CBR4.9.17/&gt; though he denied that they were an expression of intolerance on his part, stating, "I don't hate Jews and Christians... I have a many good friends [among them] too."&lt;ref name=JakartaGlobe/&gt; Syaf, who had previously posted a detail of the pencils for the double page spread on his [[Facebook]] page, removed them following the criticism leveled at him.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Yvette (April 10, 2017).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mentioned artwork in X-Men Gold #1 was inserted without knowledge behind its reported meanings.

CBR.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel's statement is notable for both the swiftness in which Marvel issued it—on a Saturday, hours after the ''X-Men Gold'' art became a point of discussion on social media—and the definitive condemnation of the implied statements in the issue. The writer of the series, [[Marc Guggenheim]], who is himself Jewish, responded to the situation on Saturday by referring readers to Marvel's statement, and [[tweeting]], "The support has been amazing. From fans and pros alike."&lt;ref name=CBR4.9.17/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBR4.11.17/&gt; Syaf reacted to this development by removing his Facebook fan page, and stating on his personal Facebook page, "My career is over now. It's the consequence what I did, and I take it. Please no more mockery, [debate], no more hate. I hope all in peace." Syaf explained that the Quran verse and protest reference that he hid in the comic was intended as a message of "justice" and "love."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCNews11.4.17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Albert (10 October 2017).

When Jews are offended, there is no mercy". After making this remark, he reiterated that he was not anti-Semitic or anti-Christian stating that if he was, he would not have worked for a foreign publisher.

[[File:S. Bing en kimono.jpg|thumb|alt=|right|[[Siegfried Bing]] in a [[kimono]] ]]
'''''Artistic Japan''''' was a magazine of [[Japanese art]], published by German-born French art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]]. It ran for thirty-six monthly issues from 1888 to 1891 in French, English, and German editions and contributed to a revival of [[Japonism]].{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=6}}

==Background==
Art critics and collectors in Europe spearheaded a craze for Japanese art in the late 19th century; prominent promoters of this [[Japonism]] included [[Edmond de Goncourt]] (1822–96), [[Philippe Burty]] (1830–90), and [[Siegfried Bing]] (1838–1905).{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=7}}  Burty made an attempt at a magazine devoted to Japanese art that lasted a single issue.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=7–8}}

The wealthy collector and dealer Bing had placed himself at the centre of Japanese art circles in Paris;{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=8}} where he had relocated from Hamburg in Germany to take over a branch of the family business dealing in imports of [[French porcelain]].{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|pp=185–186}}  In the late 1870s he opened a shop selling Japanese art objects and travelled to the Far East to study art in 1880.{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|p=186}}  He developed connections with art sources in Japan and amassed what was considered one of the finest Japanese art collections in the West.  He desired to spread word of Japanese aesthetics to a broad public, and used his wealth and connections to populate a new magazine to this end.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=8}}

==Publication==
Bing enlisted his friend, the director of the [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]] [[Justus Brinckmann]] (1843–1915), to translate and print a German-language edition of the magazine.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=8}}  The English art dealer [[Marcus Bourne Huish]] (1845–1922) handled publication of an English-language that also circulated in the United States.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=9}}

The magazine aimed to educate the public, and enjoyed high-quality printing featuring reproductions drawn from private collections.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=19}}  Each issue had several colour [[tipped-in page]]s of reproductions of Japanese artwork such as paintings or [[ukiyo-e]] prints.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=12}}  It featured essays on Japanese art and art history by critics such as Burty, de Goncourt, and {{illm|Louis Gonse|fr}}, drawn from Bing's wide circle of acquaintances in the art world.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=12–13}}  The articles examined a wide variety of Japanese arts: [[Japanese architecture|its architecture]], [[Japanese painting|painting]], [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock printing]], [[Japanese pottery|pottery]], and even [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]].{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=14–15}}  Bing also drew attention to the high aesthetic quality of everyday objects such as combs, tea ladles, and fabrics.{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|pp=186–187}}

==Reception and legacy==
Bing made effort to have  ''Artistic Japan'' widely reviewed.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=9}}  It received positive reviews throughout the West, as far away as Scandinavia and the US.  The London-based periodical ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'' praised its first issue's "attractiveness".  The American ''The Critic'' rated it "among the highest class of art-journal".{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=12}}  The established reputations of the contributing writers to which Bing had access contributed to the magazine's quick acceptance as an authority.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=13}}

The vogue for Japanese art had reached a peak by the time the magazine appeared.  French artist and collector of Japanese art [[George Auriol]] expressed hope that the magazine would rekindle an appreciation of its true aesthetic qualities in the face of its brimming commercialization.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|pp=9–10}}  The ''Japan Weekly Mail'' newspaper ran regular denigrating reviews of the magazine's reproduction and writing quality{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=10}} and Bing's understanding of Japanese history and society.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=11}}

The magazine benefited Bing as a dealer, as prices for Japanese artworks rose with awareness of their value; this was one aim of Bing's, and he attracted some criticism for it.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=10}}  The magazine's reproductions served as models to Western graphic designers.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=12}}  Gabriel&amp;nbsp;P. Weisberg has asserted that ''Artistic Japan'' was a major force in solidifying the valued position Japanese art was to have in the West.{{sfn|Weisberg|1986|p=19}}  The aesthetic quality of the magazine itself won lasting recognition; in 1906 [[Gustav Klimt]] obtained a complete run.{{sfn|Hokenson|2004|p=187}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38054">[[File:Genien, Nimrud 870 v. Chr. Aegyptisches Museum, Muenchen-4.jpg|thumb|"[[Winged genie]]", [[Nimrud]] c. 870 BC, with inscription running across his midriff.]]
[[File:Sculpted reliefs depicting Ashurbanipal, the last great Assyrian king, hunting lions, gypsum hall relief from the North Palace of Nineveh (Irak), c. 645-635 BC, British Museum (16722368932).jpg|thumb|Part of the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'', c. 645–635 BC]]
'''Assyrian sculpture''' is the sculpture of the ancient [[Assyria]]n states, especially the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] of 911 to 612 BC, which ruled modern [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and much of [[Iran]].  It forms a phase of the [[art of Mesopotamia]], differing in particular because of its much greater use of stone and [[gypsum]] [[alabaster]] for large sculpture.

Much the best-known works are the huge ''[[lamassu]]'' guarding entrance ways, and '''Assyrian palace reliefs''' on thin slabs of alabaster, which were originally painted, at least in part, and fixed on the wall all round the main rooms of palaces.  Most of these are in museums in Europe or America, following a hectic period of excavations from 1842 to 1855,&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 5–17; see Larsen in further reading&lt;/ref&gt; which took Assyrian art from being almost completely unknown to being the subject of several best-selling books, and imitated in political cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, 6–8; Hoving, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace reliefs contain scenes in low [[relief]] which glorify the king, showing him at war, hunting, and fulfilling other kingly roles.  Many works left ''in situ'', or in museums local to their findspots,&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 5&lt;/ref&gt; have been [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|deliberately destroyed]] in the recent occupation of the area by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], the pace of destruction reportedly increasing in late 2016, with the [[Mosul offensive (2016)|Mosul offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;In November 2016 the situation remains unclear. Browne, Gareth, "Isis flattened ancient capital after shipping out its treasures" in ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 19 November 2016 says that the most serious damage to Nimrud was done in late 2016, as the allied forces moved to retake [[Mosul]], where the museum also had an important collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other surviving types of art include many [[cylinder seal]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; a few [[rock relief]]s, reliefs and statues from temples, bronze relief strips used on large doors,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; and small quantities of metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 194–196&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Nimrud ivories]], an important group of small plaques which decorated furniture, were found in a palace storeroom near reliefs, but they came from around the Mediterranean, with relatively few made locally in an Assyrian style.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 313–315, 319–322 (and see index); Honour &amp; Fleming, 77; [http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2011/nimrud_ivories.aspx Nimrud ivories press release, British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palace reliefs==
[[File:VAM - Assurnasirpal II Relief 3.jpg|thumb|Detail of genie figure, palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]]]]
The palace reliefs were fixed to the walls of royal palaces forming continuous strips along the walls of large halls.  The style apparently began after about 879 BC, when [[Ashurnasirpal II]] moved the capital to [[Nimrud]], near modern [[Mosul]] in northern [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, new royal palaces, of which there was typically one per reign, were extensively decorated in this way for the roughly 250 years until the end of the Assyrian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 56–60, on the latest reliefs&lt;/ref&gt;  There was subtle stylistic development, but a very large degree of continuity in subjects and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

Compositions are arranged on slabs, or [[orthostat]]s, typically about 7 feet high, using between one and three horizontal registers of images, with scenes generally reading from left to right.  The sculptures are often accompanied with inscriptions in [[cuneiform]] script, explaining the action or giving the name and extravagant titles of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Heads and legs are shown in profile, but torsos in a front or three-quarters view, as in earlier Mesopotamian art.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; Eyes are also largely shown frontally.  Some panels show only a few figures at close to life-size, such scenes usually including the king and other courtiers,&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; but depictions of military campaigns include dozens of small figures, as well as many animals and attempts at showing landscape settings.

Campaigns focus on the progress of the army, including the fording of rivers, and usually culminate in the siege of a city, followed by the surrender and paying of tribute, and the return of the army home.  A full and characteristic [[Lachish relief|set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish]] in 701; it is the "finest" from the reign of [[Sennacherib]], from his palace at [[Nineveh]] and now in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 56 (quoted), 65–71&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ernst Gombrich]] observed that none of the many casualties ever come from the Assyrian side.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Story of Art]]'' (in its chronological place; there are too many editions to give a page number)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another famous sequence there shows the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'', in fact the staged and ritualized killing by King [[Ashurbanipal]] of lions already captured and released into an arena, from the North Palace at Nineveh.  The realism of the lions has always been praised, and the scenes are often regarded as "the supreme masterpieces of Assyrian art", although the pathos modern viewers tend to feel was perhaps not part of the Assyrian response.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 76–77; Reade, 72–79, 73 quoted; Frankfort, 186–192; Hoving, 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reliefs of minor supernatural beings, called by such terms as "[[winged genie]]", but the major Assyrian deities are only represented by symbols. The "genies" often perform a gesture of purification, fertilization or blessing with a [[bucket and cone]]; the meaning of this remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially on larger figures, details and patterns on areas such as costumes, hair and beards, tree trunks and leaves, and the like are very meticulously carved.  More important figures are often shown larger than others, and in landscapes more distant elements are shown higher up, but not smaller than, those in the foreground, though some scenes have been interpreted as using scale to indicate distance.  Other scenes seem to repeat a figure in a succession of different moments, performing the same action, most famously a charging lion.  But these were apparently experiments that remain unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

The king is often shown in narrative scenes, and also as a large standing figure in a few prominent places, generally attended by winged genies. A composition repeated twice in what is traditionally called the "throne-room" (though perhaps it was not) of Ashurbanipal's palace at Nimrud shows a "Sacred Tree" or "[[Tree of Life]]" flanked by two figures of the king, with winged genies using the bucket and cone behind him.  Above the tree one of the major gods, perhaps [[Ashur]] the chief god, leans out of a winged disc, relatively small in scale.  Such scenes are shown elsewhere on the robe of the king, no doubt reflecting [[embroidery]] on the real costumes, and the major gods are normally shown in discs or purely as symbols hovering in the air.  Elsewhere the tree is often attended to by genies.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are relatively rarely shown, and then usually as prisoners or refugees; an exception is a "picnic" scene showing Ashurbanipal with his queen.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 47; [[:File:S03 06 01 017 image 2342.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The many beardless royal attendants can probably be assumed to be [[eunuch]]s, who ran much of the administration of the empire, unless they also have the shaved heads and very tall hats of priests.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;  Kings are often accompanied by several courtiers, the closest to the king probably often being the appointed heir, who was not necessarily the oldest son.&lt;ref&gt;42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous scales of the palace schemes allowed narratives to be shown at an unprecedentedly expansive pace, making the sequence of events clear and allowing richly detailed depictions of the activities of large numbers of figures, not to be paralleled until the Roman narrative column reliefs of the [[Column of Trajan]] and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 168; Honour &amp; Fleming, 73, 75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lamassu===
[[File:Human-headed Winged Bulls Gate Khorsabad - Louvre 02a.jpg|thumb|Pair of ''[[lamassu]]'' or ''shedu'' from [[Khorsabad]], with the five legs of the left one showing.]]
Lamassu were protective minor deities or spirits, the Assyrian version of the "human-headed bull" figure that had long figured in Mesopotamian mythology and art. Lamassu have wings, a male human head with the elaborate headgear of a divinity, and the elaborately-braided hair and beards shared with royalty.  The body is that of either a bull or a lion, the form of the feet being the main difference.  Prominent pairs of ''lamassu'' were typically placed at entrances in palaces, facing the street and also internal courtyards.  They were "double-aspect" figures on corners, in high relief, a type earlier found in [[Hittite art]]. From the front they appear to stand, and from the side, walk, and in earlier versions have five legs, as is apparent when viewed obliquely.  ''Lamassu'' do not generally appear as large figures in the low-relief schemes running round palace rooms, where [[winged genie]] figures are common, but they sometimes appear within narrative reliefs, apparently protecting the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 147–148, 154; Reade, 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The colossal entrance way figures were often followed by a hero grasping a wriggling lion, also colossal and in high relief; these and some genies beside ''lamassu'' are generally the only other types of high relief in Assyrian sculpture.  The heroes continue the [[Master of Animals]] tradition in Mesopotamian art, and may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  In the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Khorsabad]], a group of at least seven ''lamassu'' and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the "throne room", "a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 147–148, 148 quoted; Reade, 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrangement was repeated in Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh, with a total of ten lamassu.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; Other accompanying figures for colossal ''lamassu'' are winged genies with the [[bucket and cone]], thought to be the equipment for a protective or purifying ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lamassu'' also appear on [[cylinder seal]]s.  Several examples left ''in situ'' in northern [[Iraq]] have been destroyed in the 2010s by ISIL when they occupied the area.  Colossal ''lamassu'' also guarded the start of the large [[canal]]s built by the Assyrian kings.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 50&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of temples, pairs of colossal lions guarding the entrances have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 23-24 (British Museum example illustrated below)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:Assyrian Royal Attendant from Nimrud, Mesopotamia..JPG|thumb|Relief fragments from Nimrud, showing the depth of the slabs (probably sawn down in excavation) and scale.  The main head belongs to a court eunuch.]] 
There are outcrops of the "Mosul marble" gypsum rock normally used at several places in the Assyrian realm, though not especially close to the capitals. The rock is very soft and slightly soluble in water, and exposed faces degraded, and needed to be cut into before usable stone was reached. There are reliefs showing quarrying for [[Sennacherib]]'s new palace at [[Nineveh]], though concentrating on the production of large [[lamassu]].  Blocks were extracted, using prisoners of war, and sawed into slabs with long iron sawed. This may have happened at the palace site, which is certainly where the carving of orthostats was done, after the slabs had been fixed into place as a facing to a [[mud-brick]] wall, using lead dowels and clamps, with the bottoms resting on a bed of [[bitumen]].&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;  For some reliefs an "attractive fossiliferous [[limestone]]" is used, as in several rooms in the South-West Palace at Nineveh.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the orthostats, the ''lamassu'' were carved, or at least partly so, at the quarry, no doubt to reduce their enormous weight.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The alabaster stone is soft but not brittle, and very suitable for detailed carving with early [[Iron Age]] tools.  There can be considerable differences in style, and quality, between adjacent panels, suggesting that different master carvers were allocated these.  Probably the master drew or incised the design on the slab before a team of carvers laboriously cut away the background areas and finished carving the figures.  Scribes then set out any inscriptions for cutters to follow, after which the slab was polished smooth, and any paint added.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Scribes are shown directing carvers in another relief (on the [[Balawat Gates]]) showing the creation of a rock relief; presumably they ensured that the depiction of royal and religious aspects of the subjects was as it should be.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliefs only covered the lower parts of the walls of rooms in the palaces, and higher areas were often painted, at least in patterns, and at least sometimes with other figures.  Brightly coloured carpets on the floor completed what was probably a striking decor, largely in [[primary colour]]s.  None of these have survived, but we have some door-sills carved with repeated geometric motifs, presumed to imitate the carpets.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the palaces were abandoned and lost their wooden roofs, the unbaked mud-brick walls gradually collapsed, covering the space in front of the reliefs, and largely protecting them from further damage from the weather. Relatively few traces of paint remain, and these are often on heads and faces – hair and beards were black, and at least the whites of eyes white. Possibly metal leaf was used on some elements, such as small scenes shown decorating textiles. Julian Reade concludes that "It is nonetheless puzzling that more traces of painting [on sculpture] have not been recorded".&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 7, 29–30, 30 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other narrative reliefs==
[[File:Assyrian - Fragments of Bands from a Gate - Walters 542335 - View A.jpg|thumb|Fragment from the [[Balawat Gates]], [[Baltimore]]]] 
Apart from the alabaster wall reliefs, all found in palaces, other objects carrying relatively large reliefs are bronze strips used to reinforce and decorate large gates. Parts of three sets have survived, all from the 9th century and the relatively minor city of Imgur-Enlil, modern [[Balawat]]. The [[Balawat Gates]] were all double gates about 20 foot high, with both the front and back sides decorated with eight bronze [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] strips, each carrying two registers of narrative reliefs some five inches high.  There were presumably equivalents at other Assyrian sites, but at the collapse of the empire the buildings at Balawat caught fire "before they had been efficiently looted" by the enemy, and remained hidden in the ashes and rubble;&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 32, quoted; Frankfort, 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; gypsum slabs were not worth the trouble of looting, unlike bronze.  The subjects were similar to the wall reliefs, but on a smaller scale; a typical band is 27 centimetres high, 1.8 metres wide, and only a millimetre thick.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=282817&amp;partId=1&amp;place=33695&amp;plaA=33695-3-1&amp;page=1  British Museum collection database]; Frankfort, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

In stone there are reliefs of a similar size on some [[stela]]e, most notably two in rectangular [[obelisk]] form, both with stepped tops like [[ziggurat]]s.  These are the early 11th-century [[White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I]] and the 9th century [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], both in the British Museum, who also have the fragmentary "Broken" or "Rassam Obelisk".  Both have reliefs on all four sides in eight and five registers respectively, and long inscriptions describing the events. The Black and Rassam Obelisks were both set up in what seems to have been the central square in the citadel of Nimrud, presumably a very public space, and the White in Nineveh.  All record much the same types of scenes as the narrative sections of wall-relief, and the gates.  The Black Obelisk concentrates on scenes of the bringing of tribute from conquered kingdoms, including Israel, while the White also has scenes of war, hunting, and religious figures.  The White Obelisk, from 1049–1031, and the "Broken Obelisk" from 1074–1056, predate the earliest known wall-reliefs by 160 years or more, but are respectively in worn and fragmentary condition.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 32, 35, 63–64; Frankfort, 167; [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=282204&amp;partId=1&amp;people=93716&amp;peoA=93716-4-7&amp;page=1 White, British Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Obelisk is of special interest as the lengthy inscriptions, with names of places and rulers that could be related to other sources, were of importance in the decipherment of [[cuneiform]] script.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The Obelisk contains the earliest writing mentioning both the Persian and Jewish peoples, and confirmed some of the events described in the [[Bible]], which in the 19th century was regarded as timely support for texts whose historical accuracy was under increasing attack.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 62–71&lt;/ref&gt;  Other, much smaller pieces with helpful inscriptions were a set of sixteen [[Assyrian lion weights|weight measures in the form of lions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Copper+Assyrian+lion+weight+palace British Museum collection database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statues and portrait stelae==
[[File:20131205 Istanbul 049.jpg|thumb|Detail of statue of [[Shalmaneser III]] in [[Istanbul]]]] 
There are very few large free-standing Assyrian statues and, with one possible exception (below), none have been found of the major divinities in their temples. Possibly others existed; any in precious metals would have been looted as the empire fell.  Two statues of kings are similar to the portraits in palace reliefs, though seen frontally. They came from temples, where they showed the king's devotion to the deity. The [[Statue of Ashurnasirpal II]] is in the British Museum, and that of [[Shalmaneser III]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Assyrian statue (BM 124963)|unique female nude statue]] in the British Museum, missing its extremities, which was found in the temple of [[Ishtar]] at Nineveh. The pubic hair is carefully represented. It carries an inscription on the back that King [[Ashur-bel-kala]] erected it for the "titilation" or enjoyment of the people.  It might represent Ishtar, goddess of love among other things,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=369402&amp;partId=1 British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; in which case it would be the only known Assyrian statue of a major divinity. All these have standing poses, though seated statues were already known in Mesopotamian art, for example about a dozen [[statues of Gudea]], who ruled [[Lagash]] c. 2144 – 2124 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 93-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Near-Eastern cultures, the Assyrians erected [[stela]]e for various purposes, including marking boundaries.  Many just carry inscriptions, but there are some with significant relief sculpture, mostly a large standing portrait of the king of the day, pointing at symbols of the gods, similar in pose to those in palace reliefs, surrounded by a round-topped frame.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar figures of kings are shown in [[rock relief]]s, mostly around the edges of the empire.  Those shown being made on the [[Balawat Gates]] are presumably the ones surviving in poor condition near the [[Tigris Tunnel]].  The Assyrians probably took the form from the Hittites; the sites chosen for their 49 recorded reliefs often also make little sense if "signalling" to the general population was the intent, being high and remote, but often near water. The Neo-Assyrians recorded in other places, including metal reliefs on the [[Balawat Gates]] showing them being made, the carving of rock reliefs, and it has been suggested that the main intended audience was the gods, the reliefs and the inscriptions that often accompany them being almost of the nature of a "business report" submitted by the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Kreppner, throughout; 368 for 49 reliefs&lt;/ref&gt;  A canal system built by the [[Neo-Assyrian]] king [[Sennacherib]] (reigned 704–681 BC) to supply water to [[Nineveh]] was marked by a number of reliefs showing the king with gods.&lt;ref&gt;Kreppner, 371; Malko, Helen, [http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/assyria-to-iberia/blog/posts/rock-reliefs "Neo-Assyrian Rock Reliefs: Ideology and Landscapes of an Empire"], Metropolitan Museum, accessed 28 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reliefs at the [[Tigris tunnel]], a cave in modern Turkey believed to be the source of the river [[Tigris]], are "almost inaccessible and invisible for humans".&lt;ref&gt;Kreppner, 374–375&lt;/ref&gt; Probably built by Sennacherib's son [[Esarhaddon]], [[Shikaft-e Gulgul]] is a late example in modern Iran, apparently related to a military campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Kreppner, 369–370; Van der Spek, R.J., [https://www.academia.edu/855254/The_Assyrian_Royal_Rock_Inscription_from_Shikaft-i_Gulgul "The Assyrian Royal Rock Inscription from Shikaft-i Gulgul"], ''Iranica Antiqua'', vol XII, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  The Assyrians added to the [[Commemorative stelae of Nahr el-Kalb]] in modern [[Lebanon]], where [[Ramses II]], [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt, had rather optimistically commemorated the boundary of his empire many centuries earlier; many later rulers added to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 22; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  The Assyrian examples were perhaps significant in suggesting the style of the much more ambitious [[Rock relief#Persia|Persian tradition]], beginning with the [[Behistun Inscription|Behistun relief and inscription]], made around 500 BC for [[Darius the Great]], on a far grander scale, reflecting and proclaiming the power of the [[Achaemenid empire]].

==Excavations==
[[File:Salle II. Bas-relief 10 (NYPL b14308483-1534751) (cropped).jpg|thumb|One of [[Eugène Flandin]]'s plates in ''Monument de Ninive'' (with Botta), 1849]]  
Iraq was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] throughout the 19th century, and the government was content to allow foreign excavations and the removal of finds with little hindrance. Even in the 1870s excavators were often only regulated by a regime intended for mining operations, and had to pay a tax based on a proportion of the value of material removed.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of the palace reliefs made excavation relatively straightforward, if the right site was chosen.  Assyrian palaces were built on high mud-brick platforms.  Test trenches were started in various directions, and once one of them had hit sculpture, the trenches had only to follow the lines of the wall, often through a whole suite of rooms.  Most trenches could be open to the sky, but at Nimrud, where one palace overlay another, tunnels were necessary in places.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 9–12&lt;/ref&gt;  Layard estimated "that he had exposed nearly two miles of sculptured walls in Sennacherib's palace alone", not to mention the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] he found there.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 14&lt;/ref&gt;  His excavation practices left a lot to be desired by modern standards; the centres of rooms were not only not excavated, but the material removed from the trench in one room might be deposited in another, compromising later excavations.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically the slabs were sawn to roughly a third of their original depth, to save weight in carrying them back to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Cohen &amp; Kangas, 5&lt;/ref&gt; which was typically more complicated and difficult than digging them up.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 11, 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botta===
[[File:Der Stier auf dem Floß.jpg|thumb|Transporting a ''lamassu'' down the [[Tigris]] by raft, by [[Austen Henry Layard]]]]
The first hint of future discoveries came in 1820 when [[Claudius Rich]], [[Resident (title)#Residents in Asia|British Resident]] (a sort of local ambassador or [[Consul (representative)|consul]]) in [[Bagdhad]], and an early scholar of the [[ancient Near East]], went to Mosul and the site of ancient Nineveh, where he was told of a large relief panel that had been found and soon broken up. His account was published in 1836; he also brought back two small fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 6; Oates, 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1842 the French consul in Mosul, [[Paul-Émile Botta]], hired men to dig at [[Kuyunjik]], the largest mound at Nineveh.  Little was found until a local farmer suggested they try [[Khorsabad]] (ancient Dur-Sharrukin) nearby, where "a short trial was dramatically successful", as a palace of [[Sargon II]] was found a few feet below the surface, with plentiful reliefs, although they had been burned and disintegrated easily.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 7; Oates, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Press reports of Botta's finds, from May 1843, interested the French government, who sent him funds and the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] sent him [[Eugène Flandin]] (1809–1889), an artist who had already made careful archaeological drawings of Persian antiquities in a long trip beginning in 1839.  Botta decided there was no more to find at the site in October 1844, and concentrated on the difficult task of getting his finds back to Paris, where the first large consignments did not arrive until December 1846.  Botta left the two huge ''lamassu'' now in the British Museum as too large to transport; [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]], by now British Resident in Bagdhad, sawed them into several pieces for transport in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1849 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Monument_de_Ninive Monument de Ninive]'' was published, a sumptuously illustrated and exemplary [[monograph]] in 4 volumes by Botta and Flandin.

===Layard and Rassam===
[[File:Entrance South West Palace Nimroud.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the South West Palace at [[Nineveh]] during Layard's excavation, 1849–50]]
[[Austen Henry Layard]] (1817–1894) was in the early 1840s "a roving agent attached to the embassy at [[Constantinople]]", who had already visited Nimrud in 1840.  In 1845 he persuaded [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|Sir Stratford Canning]], the ambassador in Constantinople, to personally fund an expedition to excavate there. On his first day digging at Nimrud, with only six workers in November 1845, slabs were found, initially only with inscriptions, but soon with reliefs.  He continued to dig until June 1847, with the British government, through the British Museum, taking over the funding from Canning in late 1846, repaying his expenditure.  The volume of finds was such that getting them back to Britain was a major task, and many pieces either were reburied, or reached other countries.  Layard had recruited the 20-year old [[Hormuzd Rassam]] in Mosul, where his brother was British Vice-consul, to handle the pay and supervision of the diggers, and encouraged the development of his career as a diplomat and archaeologist.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 9–12; Oates, 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Layard returned to England in June 1847, also taking Rassam, who he had arranged to study at Cambridge.  He left a few workers, mainly to keep other diggers off the sites, as the French were digging again.  His finds were arriving in London, to great public interest, which he greatly increased by publishing a string of books, especially ''Nineveh and its Remains'' in 1849.  The mistaken title arose because [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] had at that point become convinced that the Nimrud site was actually the ancient Nineveh, though he changed his mind soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, 6–8; Reade, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 1849 Layard was back in Mosul, accompanied by the artist Frederick Cooper, and continued to dig until April 1851, after which Rassam took charge of the excavations.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;  By this stage, thanks to Rawlinson and other linguists working on the tablets and inscriptions brought back and other material, the Assyrian cuneiform was at the least becoming partly understood,&lt;ref&gt;Hoving, 40&lt;/ref&gt; a task that progressed well over the next decade.

Initially Rassam's finds dwindled, in terms of large objects, and the British even agreed to cede the rights to half the [[Kuyunjik]] mound to the French, whose new consul, Victor Place, had resumed digging at Khorsabad.  The British funds were running out by December 1853, when Rassam hit upon the palace of [[Ashurbanipal]], which was "in some respects the finest sculptured palace of all", in the new French area of Kuyunjik.  Fortunately, Place had not started digging there, and according to Rassam "it was an established rule that whenever one discovered a new palace, no one else could meddle with it, and thus,... I had secured it for England".&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  The new palace took until 1855 to clear, being finished by the [[Assyrian Exploration Fund]], established in 1853 to dig for the benefit of British collections.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lammasu.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Lamassu]]'' or ''shedu'', a human-headed winged bull, [[Dur-Sharrukin]]/Khorsabad. [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Chicago]].  c. 721–705 BC]]

Although it was not yet realized, by "the close of excavations in 1855, the hectic Heroic Age of Assyrian archaeology ended", with the great majority of surviving Assyrian sculpture found. Work has continued up to the present day, but no new palaces have been found at the capitals, and finds have mostly been isolated pieces, such as Rassam's discovery in 1878 of two of the [[Balawat Gates]].  Many of the pieces reburied have been re-excavated, some very quickly by art dealers, and others by the Iraqi government in the 1960s, leaving them on display ''in situ'' for visitors, after the sites were configured as museums.  These were already damaged in wars in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 16–17, 16 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and have probably been [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|systematically destroyed by Daesh]] in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20161110204408.htm ''Iconic Ancient Assyrian Sites Ravaged in ISIS's Last Stand in Iraq''], by Kristin Romey, AINA repeating [http://news.nationalgeographic.com National Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
As a result of the history of excavations, much the best single collection is in the [[British Museum]], followed by the site museums and other collections in Iraq, which in the 20th century were the largest holdings when taken together,&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 5; Grove&lt;/ref&gt; though after the wars of the 21st century their current holdings are uncertain. The fate of the considerable number of pieces that have been found and then reburied is also uncertain.  At the peak of excavations, the volume found was too large for the British and French to manage, and many pieces either were diverted at some point on their journey to Europe, or were given away by the museums.  Other pieces were excavated by diggers working for dealers.  As a result, there are significant groups of large ''lamassu'' corner figures and palace relief panels in Paris, Berlin, New York, and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, 5; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other museums have panels, especially a group of college museums in [[New England]], with [[Hood Museum of Art|the museum at Dartmouth College]] having seven panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/search-collections?piction_keywords=Assyrian&amp;piction_photos_only=1&amp;op=go Hood Museum of Art], collection search on "Assyrian"&lt;/ref&gt;  Altogether there are some 75 pieces in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hoving, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the British Museum, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] has 10 reliefs (2 large, 8 small) &lt;ref&gt;[http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/nimrud/modernnimrud/atthemuseum/ashmoleanmuseumdisplays/index.html Ashmolean page]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]] has 3 large reliefs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/whats-on/lunchtime-talk-assyrian-reliefs/ Bristol page]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Museum of Scotland]] (2.4 x 2.2 m),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/explore/stories/world-cultures/assyrian-relief/ Edinburgh, Assyrian Relief Fact File]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] one relief each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O349649/relief-unknown/ Assyrian Relief at V&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BET Soul''' is an [[United States|American]] [[pay television]] [[television network|network]] that is controlled by the [[BET Networks]] division of [[Viacom]], which owns the network. The channel showcases [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[neo soul]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[jazz music|jazz]] and [[Motown]] music from various decades.

Originating as '''VH1 Soul''', a spinoff of [[VH1]], the channel moved under the editorial control of [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] on December 28, 2015 as part of Viacom's ongoing restructuring of their pay-TV operations.

==History==
The channel, which was originally a commercial-free service, debuted on May 8, 2000 with [[VH1 Classic]] as part of the "MTV Digital Suite" of [[digital cable]] channels, which was sold solely to cable providers to give them an advantage over satellite services. In its early years, VH1 Soul's main focus was on R&amp;B and soul videos of the late 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, along with live performance clips from even earlier years. [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Tony Toni Tone]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Patti LaBelle]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] were some of the channel's main staples. By 2003, the channel had stopped showing most of the pre-1990s videos, since these were often played on VH1 Classic's ''[[Classic Soul]]'' program. The channel then gradually began to focus more on underground, alternative, and [[old school hip hop|old school]] hip-hop videos, while continuing to feature new R&amp;B musicians.

On February 1, 2006, VH1 Soul revamped its format, discontinuing with the model of running videos randomly and instead airing videos on different genre-based music shows, though a basic 'wheel schedule' structure remained, and does so to this day.

In the spring of 2007, VH1 Soul, along with its sister networks [[BET Jams|MTV Jams]] and [[NickMusic|MTV Hits]], were briefly dropped from [[Time Warner Cable]]'s Southern California systems that were formerly operated by [[Adelphia Communications|Adelphia]] and [[Comcast]]. However, all three channels returned to TWC within a couple of months, under a new, specialized service tier. To date, however, the three networks remain conspicuously absent from many of Time Warner Cable and [[Bright House Networks]]' systems, most notably in New York City. Even as the 'Digital Suite' concept was discontinued, the network has never been offered to [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]].

[[File:VH1 Soul.svg|thumb|Second logo as VH1 Soul, 2006-2015|120px|right]]

The final edition of the [[Vibe Awards]] aired on the channel in November 2007, after a one-year hiatus due to the merger of [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] into [[The CW]].

For a short time from 2008 until 2009 the network aired non music video programming in some time slots, including [[VH1]]'s ''[[The Salt-n-Pepa Show]]'', along with the documentary ''[[Black to the Future]]'' as part of the network's February 2009 [[Black History Month]] programming, along with out-of-format programming such as ''VH1 [[Hip Hop Honors]] Show'', ''[[VH1 Rock Docs]]'', and other programming from its ''Celebreality'' strand of original programming. Viewer complaints that resulted from the programming substitutions soon overwhelmed VH1's management, along with other complaints for sister network [[VH1 Classic]] straying from its own mission. Soon, VH1 moved away from out-of-format programming on both channels, and by late 2009, VH1 Soul resumed a 24/7 video format.

Presently, a selection of R&amp;B hits from the past ten years, as well as several 1980s and early 1990s hip-hop videos, can be seen on VH1 Soul. Several of the more R&amp;B-influenced modern-day rappers and their newest videos can also be regularly seen in heavy rotation on VH1 Soul; for example: [[The Roots]], [[De La Soul]], [[Kanye West]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], and [[Talib Kweli]]. However, VH1 Soul still occasionally airs older 1980s or early 1990s R&amp;B/soul hits, such as Prince's "Kiss", [[Mariah Carey]]'s "Vision Of Love", Stevie Wonder's "Superstition", or [[Chaka Khan]]'s "I Feel For You". The network restored commercials on January 1, 2011.

On December 28, 2015, the channel was given over to BET Networks as part of the continuing reorganization of Viacom's assets due to ratings and financial issues in 2015, an issue that had already resulted in BET Networks taking editorial control of the former [[BET Jams|MTV Jams]] two months before. The network was rebranded as '''BET Soul''' on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2015/12/28/vh1-soul-to-become-bet-soul.html|title=VH1 Soul to Become BET Soul The 24-hour music video channel to make big switch today.|last=Chapman Jr.|first=George|date=28 December 2015|publisher=[[BET Networks]]|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BVN''' is an [[architecture]] firm based in [[Australia]]. BVN has won more [[Sir John Sulman Medal]]s than any other practice. BVN practices a whole-systems approach to architecture rather than traditional, simplistic architectural formalism. BVN employs researchers, data scientists, electronic engineers and associated disciplines to create places, measure and then analyse their use and performance with the intention of greatly improving environments and giving the practice of architecture a true formal basis.

Bligh Voller Nield was established during 1997 to 1999 with the merger of Bligh Voller Architects, [[Lawrence Nield]] and Partners Australia, Grose Bradley and Pels Innes Neilson and Kosloff. In 2009, Bligh Voller Nield became BVN Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bvn.com.au/pages/practice.html |title=BVN: Practice |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930170321/http://www.bvn.com.au/pages/practice.html |archive-date=2009-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013 BVN merged with [[Donovan Hill]] to form BVN Donovan Hill. In 2014 the practice became BVN.

BVN is one of the largest architectural practices in Australia with studios located in [[Brisbane]], [[Sydney]], and [[New York City]], with project offices in various cities around the world. BVN's portfolio includes airports, commercial, defence, education, health, science, hospitality, interiors, masterplanning, public buildings, residential, retail, sport, transport, urban design and workplace projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bvn.com.au/pages/capability.html |title=BVN |access-date=2012-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317100157/http://www.bvn.com.au/pages/capability.html |archive-date=2012-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm has been extremely successful since the early 2000s designing many landmark buildings in Australia and sport facilities for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympic Games]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympic Games]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Architects build on global reputation |work=City News |date=2 February 2010 |url=http://city-news.whereilive.com.au/news/story/architects-build-on-global-reputation/ |accessdate=18 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113405/http://city-news.whereilive.com.au/news/story/architects-build-on-global-reputation/ |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bezantée''', '''bezantie''' or '''bezanty''' is an ornamentation consisting of [[roundel]]s. The word derives from ''[[bezant]]'', a [[gold]] [[coin]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which was in common European use until circa 1250.

In architecture, '''bezantée''' moulding was much used in the Norman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bezantée |volume=3 |page=840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[heraldry]] the word is shorthand for ''semé of bezants'', i.e. strewn (literally "seeded") with bezants. A bezant is a [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] whose [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] is ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]]''. In English heraldry, a field ''sable bezanty'' often alludes to the [[Duchy of Cornwall]].
An ounce (leopard) bezanty appears as a supporter in the English bearings of [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/east_anglia_essex.html St Edmundsbury Borough Council]; a bordure bezanty appears in the coat of [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/thames_valley_chilterns.html Berkhamstead Town Council].

== History ==

=== Early Years: San Diego ===
While Bill Silva was a student at University of San Diego he started a concert promotion company for university parties.  This led him to expand into the San Diego area and establish Bill Silva Presents in 1979. Over the next two decades the company brought acts such as [[The Who]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Devo]], [[The Police]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[INXS]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Willie Nelson]] to the area.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"&gt;http://digitalmediasummit.ca/wp-content/plugins/cmw-speakers/speaker_details.php?id=25&lt;/ref&gt;

After securing a foothold in San Diego, Silva branched out into other parts of the southwest, promoting smaller shows in Arizona, Texas, Nevada, and Idaho. In 1982 he partnered with Feyline Productions and became the promoter for any of Feyline's shows outside of Colorado.&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;

In 1992 Silva teamed up with Andrew Hewitt to obtain exclusive rights to produce rock concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-23/news/mn-7298_1_hollywood-bowl "Hollywood Bowl Deal Questioned by Promoters"]. ''latimes''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Silva started representing the band [[Unwritten Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-silva-mn0001881067 "Bill Silva"]. ''AllMusic''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; after promoting one of their shows and BSE's management division, Bill Silva Management, was founded. Soon after, BSM added [[Blink-182]] to its artist roster.&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;

=== The Move To Los Angeles and the Start of the Jason Mraz Era ===

Bill Silva Entertainment moved from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1999.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt; He was introduced to [[Jason Mraz]], who he managed until 2017.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/sep/12/blurt-jason-mraz-breaks-manager-bill-silva/&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva also sold his concert division, Bill Silva Presents, to Universal Studios's concert division, which was later purchased by House of Blues Concerts. In March 2003 Andrew Hewitt and Silva left that venture, parting ways in concert promotion with the exception of their partnership at the Hollywood Bowl.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;

Silva went on to re-establish Bill Silva Presents with a touring division that was kicked off by 2000's "Up In Smoke Tour" with [[Dr. Dre]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt; In 2005 Silva hired Eric Herz, a former executive at Avalon Attractions and Metropolitan Entertainment, to oversee Bill Silva Presents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/3501/herz-joins-bill-silva-presents "Herz Joins Bill Silva Presents"]. ''All Access''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent Years: Expansion and Diversification ===
In 2011 Silva merged Bill Silva Presents with Live Nation Entertainment, placing Silva and Andrew Hewitt in charge of overseeing the company's concerts in the southwest region of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;George Varga (26 October 2011). [http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/Oct/26/live-nation-teams-bill-silva/ "Live Nation teams up with Bill Silva"]. ''The San Diego Union-Tribune''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Bill Silva Entertainment team formed a partnership with the model manager David Todd to form DT Model Management.&lt;ref name="emc|bowery"/&gt;

== Bill Silva Management ==
Bill Silva Management has managed the careers of artists, comedians, and film directors since its founding in 1993.

The company began with San Diego bands Unwritten Law and blink-182, and managed [[Jason Mraz]] from 1999 to 2017.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theuprisingcreative"&gt;The Uprising Creative.

Until 2008 Silva also managed and promoted tours for comedian [[Margaret Cho]].&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/features/20060521-9999-1a21varga.html "SignOnSanDiego.com &gt; News &gt; Features -- Hetfield and Silva honored at L.A. benefit concert"]. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silva Music Publishing ==
The publishing division of BSE began as a service for its management clients, primarily dealing with BSM artists and their collaborators.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt; In 2012 the company brought in Peter Coquillard, a music publisher who previously worked with Windswept Pacific, L.A. Reid, HITCO, and Network One Music Publishing, to expand the publishing division to include songwriters unaffiliated with BSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songsummit.com.au/program/speakers-artists/peter-coquillard/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306221059/http://www.songsummit.com.au/program/speakers-artists/Peter-Coquillard/ |archivedate=2016-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is co-directed by [[Brendan Fletcher (film director)|Brendan Fletcher]] and features [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] women including Purcell, actress [[Deborah Mailman]] and politician [[Kathryn Hay]].

&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the play someone suggested that Purcell find other indigenous women to tell their stories.&lt;ref name=capp /&gt; Purcell sought out nine other indigenous women who personally inspired her, some professional, some not.&lt;ref name=capp /&gt; The interviewees comprised politician and former [[Miss Australia]] [[Kathryn Hay]], actress [[Deborah Mailman]], [[netball]] player [[Sharon Finnan]], [[United Nations]] youth delegate [[Tammy Williams]], [[Rosanna Angus]], [[Cilla Malone]], [[Frances Rings]], [[Lisa Fraser-Gooda]] and [[Rachel Perkins]].&lt;ref name=mg /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw&gt;{{Citation

'''Carolingian minuscule''' or '''Caroline minuscule''' is a [[hand (handwriting)|script]] which developed as a calligraphic standard in [[Europe]] so that the [[Latin alphabet]] of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]] could be easily recognized by the [[literate]] class from one region to another. It was developed for the first time, in about 780, by a Benedictine monk of [[Corbie Abbey]] (about 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Paris), namely, [[Alcuin of York]].&lt;ref name=Marcia&gt;Colish, Marcia L. Medieval foundations of the western intellectual tradition, 400-1400. Yale University Press, 1999, 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] between approximately 800 AD and 1200 AD. [[codex|Codices]], [[paganism|pagan]] and [[Christian]] texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The script developed into [[blackletter]] and became obsolete, though its revival in the [[Italian Renaissance]] forms the basis of more recent scripts.

==Creation==
[[File:Minuscule caroline.jpg|thumb|Page of text (folio 160v) from a Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848), written in Carolingian minuscule. Text is [[Vulgate]] [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:15-26.]]

The script is derived from [[Uncial script|Roman half uncial]] and the [[insular script]]s that were being used in Irish and English monasteries.  The strong influence of Irish literati on the script can be seen in the distinctively cló-Gaelach (Irish style) forms of the letters, especially a, e, d, g, s and t.

Carolingian minuscule was created partly under the patronage of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] (hence Carolingian). Charlemagne had a keen interest in learning, according to his biographer [[Einhard]]:

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style: italic"&gt;Temptabat et scribere tabulasque et codicellos ad hoc in lecto sub cervicalibus circumferre solebat, ut, cum vacuum tempus esset, manum litteris effigiendis adsuesceret, sed parum successit labor praeposterus ac sero inchoatus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|He also tried to write, and used to keep tablets and blanks in bed under his pillow, that at leisure hours he might accustom his hand to form the letters; however, as he did not begin his efforts in due season, but late in life, they met with ill success.}}

As a part of Charlemagne's educational and religious reforms, and made that every church and monastery should have a copy of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]]. Charlemagne wanted to make the Vulgate Bible more readable for preachers and easier to copy for scribes. Thus, Marcia Colish explains;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Charlemagne looked first to Anglo-Saxon England for a scholar to head his court school, finding him in Alcuin (c. 730-804). He assigned to Alcuin the correction of the Vulgate. In conjunction with this project, and later in his career when he became abbot of Tours, Alcuin invented a new style of handwriting, the Caroline minuscule (Plate 6). This script was far more legible than earlier medieval hands and an improvement on Roman book hands, since it provided spaces between the words, more extensive punctuation, and a hierarchy of hands, with capitals used for titles, a mix of capitals and lower-case letters for subtitles or chapter headings, and lower case for the body of the text. With the newly corrected Bible, pastors would be able to base their teaching and preaching on what it actually said.&lt;ref name=Marcia /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Charlemagne was never fully literate, he understood the value of literacy and a uniform script in running his empire. Charlemagne sent for the English scholar [[Alcuin of York]] to run his palace school and [[scriptorium]] at his capital, [[Aachen]]. Efforts to supplant [[Merovingian script|Gallo-Roman]] and Germanic scripts had been under way before Alcuin arrived at Aachen, where he was master from 782 AD to 796 AD, with a two-year break. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen, of which the [[Ada Gospels]] provide classic models, and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)]], where Alcuin withdrew from court service as an [[abbot]] in 796 AD and restructured the scriptorium.&lt;ref&gt;The production of the scriptorium at Tours was reconstructed by E.K. Rand, ''A Survey of the Manuscripts of Tours'' (Harvard University Press), 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Carolingian minuscule was uniform, with rounded shapes in clearly distinguishable [[glyph]]s, disciplined and above all, legible. Clear capital letters and spaces between words became standard in Carolingian minuscule, which was one result of a campaign to achieve a culturally unifying standardization across the [[Carolingian Empire]].

Traditional charters, however, continued to be written in a [[Merovingian script|Merovingian "chancery hand"]] long after manuscripts of Scripture and classical literature were being produced in the minuscule hand. Documents written in a local language, like [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin, tended to be expressed in traditional local script.

Carolingian script generally has fewer [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] than other contemporary [[script (styles of handwriting)|scripts]], although the [[ampersand|''et'']] (''&amp;''), ''æ'', ''rt'', ''st'' and ''ct'' ligatures are common. The letter ''d'' often appears in an uncial form with an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] slanting to the left, but the letter ''g'' is essentially the same as the modern minuscule letter, rather than the previously common uncial ''ᵹ''. Ascenders are usually "clubbed" – i.e. they become thicker near the top.

The early period of the script, during Charlemagne's reign in the late 8th century and early 9th, still has widely varying letter forms in different regions. The uncial form of the letter ''a'', similar to a double ''c'' (''cc''), is still used in manuscripts from this period. There is also use of punctuation such as the [[question mark]], as in [[Beneventan script]] of the same period. The script flourished during the 9th century, when regional hands developed into an international standard, with less variation of letter forms. Modern [[glyph]]s, such as ''s'' and ''v'', began to appear (as opposed to the "[[long s|long ''s'']]" ''ſ'' and ''u''), and ascenders, after thickening at the top, were finished with a three-cornered wedge. The script began to evolve slowly after the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, ligatures were rare and ascenders began to slant to the right and were finished with a fork. The letter ''w'' also began to appear. By the 12th century, Carolingian letters had become more angular and were written closer together, less legibly than in previous centuries; at the same time, the modern [[tittle|dotted]] ''i'' appeared. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Spread==
The new script spread through Western Europe most widely where Carolingian influence was strongest. In luxuriously produced [[Lectionary|lectionaries]] that now began to be produced for princely patronage of abbots and bishops, legibility was essential. It reached far afield: the 10th century [[Freising manuscripts]], which contain the oldest [[Slovene language]], the first [[Latin alphabet|Roman-script]] record of any [[Slavic language]], are written in Carolingian minuscule. In [[Switzerland]], Carolingian was used in the Rhaetian and Alemannic minuscule types. Manuscripts written in '''Rhaetian minuscule''' tend to have slender letters, resembling Insular script, with the letters {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|t}}, and ligatures such as {{angbr|ri}}, showing similar to Visigothic and Beneventan. '''Alemannic minuscule''', used for a short time in the early 9th century, is usually larger and broader, very vertical compared to the slanting Rhaetian type. In [[Austria]], [[Salzburg]] was the major centre of Carolingian script, while [[Fulda]], [[Mainz]], and [[Würzburg]] were the major centres in Germany. German minuscule tends to be oval-shaped, very slender, and slants to the right. It has uncial features as well, such as the ascender of the letter {{angbr|d}} slanting to the left, and vertical initial strokes of {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}.

In northern Italy, the monastery at [[Bobbio]] used Carolingian minuscule beginning in the 9th century. Outside the sphere of influence of Charlemagne and his successors, however, the new legible hand was resisted by the [[Roman Curia]]; nevertheless the Romanesca type was developed in [[Rome]] after the 10th century. The script was not taken up in England and Ireland until ecclesiastic reforms in the middle of the 10th century; in Spain a traditionalist [[Visigothic script|Visigothic hand]] survived; and in southern Italy a '[[Beneventan script|Beneventan minuscule]]' survived in the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[duchy of Benevento]] through the 13th century, although Romanesca eventually also appeared in southern Italy.

==Role in cultural transmission==
Scholars during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] sought out and copied in the new legible standardized hand many Roman texts that had been wholly forgotten. Most of our knowledge of classical literature now derives from copies made in the [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Over 7000 manuscripts written in Carolingian script survive from the 8th and 9th centuries alone.

Though the Carolingian minuscule was superseded by [[Blackletter|Gothic blackletter]] hands, it later seemed so thoroughly 'classic' to the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the early [[Renaissance]] that they took these old Carolingian manuscripts to be [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] originals and modelled their Renaissance hand, the [[humanist minuscule]], on the Carolingian one.&lt;ref&gt;Berthold Louis Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script''. (Rome), 1960, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; From there the script passed to the 15th- and 16th-century printers of books, such as [[Aldus Manutius]] of Venice. In this way it forms the basis of our modern lowercase typefaces. Indeed, 'Carolingian minuscule' is a style of [[typeface]], which approximates this historical hand, eliminating the nuances of size of capitals, long descenders, etc.

A '''conformal field theory''' ('''CFT''') is a [[quantum field theory]] that is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under [[conformal map|conformal transformations]]. In [[two-dimensional geometry|two]] [[dimension]]s, there is an infinite-dimensional algebra of local conformal transformations, and conformal field theories can sometimes be exactly solved or classified.

Conformal field theory has important applications&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Ginsparg]] (1989), ''Applied Conformal Field Theory''. {{arxiv|hep-th/9108028}}. Published in ''Ecole d'Eté de Physique Théorique: Champs, cordes et phénomènes critiques/Fields, strings and critical phenomena'' (Les Houches), ed. by [[E. Brézin]] and [[J. Zinn-Justin]],  Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[condensed matter physics]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[quantum statistical mechanics]], and  [[string theory]]. Statistical and condensed matter systems are indeed often conformally invariant at their [[critical point (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic]] or [[quantum critical point]]s.

==Scale invariance vs. conformal invariance==
While it is possible for a [[quantum field theory]] to be [[scale invariance|scale invariant]]  but not conformally-invariant, examples are rare.&lt;ref&gt;One physical example is the theory of elasticity in two and three dimensions (also known as the theory of a vector field without gauge invariance). See 
{{cite journal|author=Riva V, Cardy J|title=Scale and conformal invariance in field theory: a physical counterexample|journal=	Phys. Lett. B|volume=622|pages=339–342|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2005.07.010|arxiv=hep-th/0504197|bibcode = 2005PhLB..622..339R }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the terms are often used interchangeably in the context of quantum field theory, even though the scale symmetry group is smaller.

In some particular cases it is possible to prove that scale invariance implies conformal invariance in a quantum field theory, for example in [[unitarity (physics)|unitary]] [[compact space|compact]] conformal field theories in two dimensions.

== Dimensional considerations ==

=== Two dimensions ===
{{main|Two-dimensional conformal field theory}}
There are two versions of 2D CFT: 1) Euclidean, and 2) Lorentzian. The former applies to [[statistical mechanics]], and the latter to [[quantum field theory]]. The two versions are related by a [[Wick rotation]].

Two-dimensional CFTs are (in some way) invariant under an ''infinite-dimensional symmetry group''. For example, consider a CFT on the [[Riemann sphere]]. It has the [[Möbius transformation]]s as the conformal group, which is isomorphic to (the finite-dimensional) [[Möbius transformation|PSL(2,'''C''')]].

However, the infinitesimal conformal transformations&lt;ref&gt;Since the [[conformal Killing equation]]s in two dimensions, &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu \xi_\nu + \partial_\nu \xi_\mu = \partial \cdot\xi \eta_{\mu \nu},~&lt;/math&gt; reduce to just the Cauchy-Riemann equations, &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\bar{z}} \xi(z) = 0 = \partial_z \xi (\bar{z}) &lt;/math&gt;, the infinity of modes of arbitrary analytic coordinate transformations &lt;math&gt;\xi(z)&lt;/math&gt; yield the infinity of [[Killing vector field]]s &lt;math&gt;z^n\partial_z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; form an '''infinite-dimensional algebra''', called the [[Witt algebra]], but this infinity of conformal transformations do not have global inverses on ℂ. Only the primary fields (or chiral fields) are invariant with respect to this full infinitesimal conformal group. Its generators are indexed by integers {{mvar|n}},
:&lt;math&gt;L_n=\oint_{z=0} \frac{dz}{2\pi i } z^{n+1} T_{zz}~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[holomorphic functions|holomorphic]] part of the non-trace piece of the [[stress-energy tensor|energy momentum tensor]] of the theory.
E.g., for a free scalar field,  
:&lt;math&gt; T_{zz}= \tfrac{1}{2} (\partial_z \phi)^2 ~. &lt;/math&gt;

In most conformal field theories, a conformal anomaly, also known as a [[Weyl anomaly]], arises in the quantum theory. This results in the appearance of a nontrivial central charge, and the [[Witt algebra]] is [[Lie algebra extension#Virasoro algebra|extended]] to the [[Virasoro algebra]].

In Euclidean CFT, one has both a holomorphic and an antiholomorphic copy of the Virasoro algebra. In Lorentzian CFT, one has a left-moving and a right moving copy of the Virasoro algebra (spacetime is a cylinder, with space being a circle, and time a line).

This symmetry makes it possible to classify two-dimensional CFTs much more precisely than in higher dimensions. In particular, it is possible to relate the spectrum of primary operators in a theory to the value of the [[central charge]], {{mvar|c}}.

The [[Hilbert space]] of physical states is a unitary [[Module (mathematics)|module]] of the Virasoro algebra corresponding to a fixed value of ''c''. Stability requires that the energy spectrum of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] be nonnegative. The modules of interest are the highest weight modules of the Virasoro algebra.

A chiral field is a holomorphic field ''W''(''z'') which transforms as
:&lt;math&gt;L_n W(z)=-z^{n+1} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} W(z) - (n+1)\Delta z^n W(z)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\bar L_n W(z)=0~.&lt;/math&gt;
Analogously, mutatis mutandis, for an antichiral field. {{mvar|Δ}} is called the ''conformal weight'' of the chiral field {{mvar|W}}.

Furthermore, it was shown by [[Alexander Zamolodchikov]] that there exists a function, C, which decreases monotonically under the [[renormalization group]] flow of a two-dimensional quantum field theory, and is equal to the central charge for a two-dimensional conformal field theory. This is known as the Zamolodchikov [[C-theorem]], and tells us that [[renormalization group flow]] in two dimensions is irreversible.

Frequently, we are not just interested in the operators, but we are also interested in the vacuum state, or in statistical mechanics, the thermal state. Unless ''c=0'', there can't possibly be any state which leaves the entire infinite dimensional conformal symmetry unbroken. The best we can come up with is a state which is invariant under L&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. This contains the Möbius subgroup. The rest of the conformal group is spontaneously broken.

Two-dimensional conformal field theories play an important role in statistical mechanics, where they describe critical points of many lattice models.

=== More than two dimensions ===

In ''d''&amp;#8239;&gt;&amp;#8239;2 dimensions, the conformal group is locally isomorphic to {{math|SO(''d''&amp;#8239;+&amp;#8239;1, 1 )}} in Euclidean signature, or {{math|SO(''d'', 2 )}} in Minkowski space.

Higher-dimensional conformal field theories are prominent in the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], in which a gravitational theory in [[anti-de Sitter space]] (AdS) is equivalent to a conformal field theory on the AdS boundary. Notable examples are ''d''&amp;#8239;=&amp;#8239;4, [[N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]], which is dual to [[Type IIB string theory]] on AdS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;×&amp;#8239;S&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''d''&amp;#8239;=&amp;#8239;3, ''N''&amp;#8239;=&amp;#8239;6 super-[[Chern–Simons theory]], which is dual to [[M-theory]] on AdS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;×&amp;#8239;S&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. (The prefix "super" denotes [[supersymmetry]], ''N'' denotes the degree of [[extended supersymmetry]] possessed by the theory, and d the number of space-time dimensions on the boundary.)

==Conformal symmetry==
[[Conformal symmetry]] is a symmetry under [[scale invariance]] and under the special [[conformal transformation]]s having the following relations.

: &lt;math&gt;[P_\mu,P_\nu]=0,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[D,K_\mu]=-K_\mu, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[D,P_\mu]=P_\mu,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_\mu,K_\nu]=0,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_\mu,P_\nu]=\eta_{\mu\nu}D-iM_{\mu\nu},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; generates [[translation (physics)|translation]]s, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; generates scaling transformations as a scalar and &lt;math&gt;K_\mu&lt;/math&gt; generates the special conformal transformations as a [[covariant vector]] under Lorentz transformation.

'''David Hume''' ({{IPAc-en|h|juː|m}}; born '''David Home'''; 7 May 1711 [[New Style|NS]] &lt;small&gt;(26 April 1711 [[Old Style|OS]])&lt;/small&gt; – 25 August 1776) was a [[Scottish Enlightenment]] [[philosopher]], [[historian]], [[economist]], and [[essayist]], who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical [[empiricism]], [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; Hume's empiricist approach to philosophy places him with [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] as a [[British Empiricism|British Empiricist]].{{sfn|Atherton|1999|p= ?}} Beginning with his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic [[science of man]] that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Against philosophical [[rationalism|rationalists]], Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour. Hume argued against the existence of [[innatism|innate ideas]], positing that all human knowledge is founded solely in [[experience]]; Hume thus held that genuine knowledge must either be directly traceable to objects perceived in experience, or result from abstract reasoning about [[Relation of Ideas|relations between ideas]] which are derived from experience, calling the rest "nothing but sophistry and illusion",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166}} a [[dichotomy]] later given the name ''[[Hume's fork]]''.

In what is sometimes referred to as [[Hume's problem of induction]], he argued that [[inductive reasoning]] and belief in [[causality]] cannot be justified rationally; instead, our trust in causality and induction result from custom and mental habit, and are attributable only to the experience of "[[constant conjunction]]" of events.  This is because we can never actually perceive that one event causes another, but only that the two are always conjoined.  Accordingly, to draw any causal inferences from past experience it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition which cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9980.html|title=Berlin, I.; Hardy, H.,: The Roots of Romanticism (Second edition) (eBook and Paperback).|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's opposition to the [[teleological argument]] for God's existence, the argument from design, is generally regarded as the most intellectually significant attempt to rebut the argument prior to [[Darwinism]].

Hume was also a [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalist]] who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that [[Fact–value distinction|"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions"]]. Hume's moral theory has been seen as a unique attempt to synthesise the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the [[virtue ethics]] tradition of [[ancient philosophy]], with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than [[deontological ethics|acts]] or their [[consequentialism|consequences]], as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hume.html?id=2_FiLAAACAAJ|title=Hume|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the [[is–ought problem]], or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] conclusion of what ''ought'' to be done.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt; Hume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only  a [[bundle theory|bundle of sensations]], and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume's [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] theory of [[free will]] takes [[determinism|causal determinism]] as fully compatible with human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-freewill/|title=Hume on Free Will|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume influenced [[utilitarianism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Immanuel Kant]], the [[philosophy of science]], early [[analytic philosophy]], [[cognitive science]], [[theology]], and other movements and thinkers. Kant himself credited Hume as the spur to his philosophical thought who had awakened him from his "dogmatic slumbers".

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Hume was the second of two sons born to Joseph Home of [[Chirnside#Ninewells House|Ninewells]], an advocate, and his wife The Hon. Katherine (''née'' Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/humelife.html|title=David Hume, "My Own Life"|author=|date=|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on 26 April 1711 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in a tenement on the north side of the [[Lawnmarket]] in [[Edinburgh]].  Hume's father died when Hume was a child, just after his second birthday, and he was raised by his mother, who never remarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humesociety.org/about/HumeBiography.asp|title=David Hume Biography|work=humesociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed the spelling of his name in 1734, because of the fact that his surname ''Home,'' pronounced ''Hume,'' was not known in England. Throughout his life Hume, who never married, spent time occasionally at his family home at Ninewells in [[Berwickshire]], which had belonged to his family since the sixteenth century. His finances as a young man were very "slender". His family was not rich, and, as a younger son, he had little [[wikt:patrimony|patrimony]] to live on. He was therefore forced to make a living somehow.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}}

Hume attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of 12 (possibly as young as 10) at a time when 14 was normal. At first, because of his family, he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, "an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over [[Johannes Voet|Voet]] and [[Arnold Vinnius|Vinnius]], [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]] were the Authors which I was secretly devouring".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}} He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that "there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books".{{sfn|Mossner|1958|pp=30–33|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Wright|2009|p=10}}}} Hume did not graduate.{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2ygCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Hume+did+not+graduate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sc4E8eb4Ij&amp;sig=4SSQXHoO4QmiGKJuz-dyzgGSxxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxp769u4vKAhUIhhoKHSs9BqcQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20did%20not%20graduate&amp;f=false p. 35]}}

Aged around 18, he made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him "a new Scene of Thought", which inspired him "to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=346}} He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations.{{Sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=8–9}} One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, is that the new "scene of thought" was Hume's realization that [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson's]] "moral sense" theory of morality could be applied to the understanding as well. Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of 10 years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a [[mental breakdown]], suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the "Disease of the Learned". Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a "Laziness of Temper", that lasted about nine months. Later, some [[scurvy]] spots broke out on his fingers. This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis. Hume wrote that he "went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills", taken along with a pint of claret every day. Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning.{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart. After eating well for a time, he went from being "tall, lean and raw-bon'd" to being "sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like".{{sfn|Hume|2011|pp=13–15}} Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his "corpulence", and his fondness for good port and cheese.

===Career===
At 25 years of age, Hume, although of noble ancestry, had no source of income and no learned profession. As was common at his time, he became a merchant's assistant, but he had to leave his native Scotland. He travelled via [[Bristol]] to [[La Flèche]] in Anjou, France. There he had frequent discourse with the [[Jesuits]] of the [[College of La Flèche]].{{sfn|Huxley|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eH67vOxyjEYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=hume+travelling+tutorship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eBOIVMH_K4nvUvflg-gG&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20travelling%20tutorship&amp;f=false pp. 7–8]}}

While Hume was derailed in his attempts to start a university career by protests over his "[[atheism]]" and bemoaned that his literary debut, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', 'fell dead-born from the press',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; he found literary success in his lifetime as an essayist, and a career as a librarian at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, ultimately resulted in Hume's writing the massive six-volume ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'', which became a bestseller and the standard history of England in its day. Hume described his "love for literary fame" as his "ruling passion"&lt;ref name="davidhume.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and judged his two late works, the so-called "first" and "second" enquiries, ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'', respectively, as his greatest literary and philosophical achievements,&lt;ref name="davidhume.org" /&gt; asking his contemporaries to judge him on the merits of the later texts alone, rather than the more radical formulations of his early, youthful work, dismissing his philosophical debut as [[juvenilia]]: "A work which the Author had projected before he left College."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/etv2.html|title=Texts - Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects, vol. 2 (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Hume's protestations, a general consensus exists today that Hume's most important arguments and philosophically distinctive doctrines are found in the original form they take in the ''Treatise''. Hume was just 23 years old when he started this work and it is now regarded as one of the most important in the history of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au" /&gt;

He worked for four years on his first major work, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', subtitled "Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects", completing it in 1738 at the age of 28. Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, the critics in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time did not agree, describing it as "abstract and unintelligible".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=195}} As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years,{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} he resolved "to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, "Being naturally of a cheerful and [[Humorism|sanguine]] temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country."{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature (Abstract)|An Abstract of a Book lately Published]]'' as a summary of the main doctrines of the ''Treatise'', without revealing its authorship.{{sfn|Hume|1740}} Although there has been some academic speculation as to who actually wrote this pamphlet{{sfn|Norton|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vv5ERpFQBCoC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=hume+abstract+author&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=70ODVLXoM4r_UIDpgNgP&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20abstract%20author&amp;f=false p. 31]}} it is generally regarded as Hume's creation.{{sfn|Redman|1997|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=An+Abstract+of+a+Book+lately+Published;+Entitled&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XRryVP6yCYX6ygPViYDABg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20Abstract%20of%20a%20Book%20lately%20Published%3B%20Entitled&amp;f=false p. 175, footnote 19]}}

After the publication of ''Essays Moral and Political'' in 1741, which was included in the later edition called ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'', Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to [[William Cleghorn]]{{sfn|Nobbs|1965|p=575}} after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-rel/ |title=Hume, David: Religion &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David Hume 1754.jpeg|thumb|left|An engraving of Hume from the first volume of his ''The History of England'', 1754]]
During the 1745 [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite rising]], Hume tutored the [[George Vanden-Bempde, 3rd Marquess of Annandale|Marquess of Annandale]] (1720–92), who was "judged to be a lunatic".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=annandale+lunatic+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bxWIVPykIYHtUtevgvAI&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=annandale%20lunatic%20hume&amp;f=false p. 172]}} This engagement ended in disarray after about a year. However, it was then that Hume started his great historical work ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]''. This took him fifteen years and ran to over a million words. During this time he was also involved with the Canongate Theatre through his friend [[John Home]], a preacher.{{sfn|Fieser|2005|loc=[https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=canongate+theatre&amp;gws_rd=ssl#hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=canongate+theatre+hume+fieser p. xxii]}}

In this context, he associated with [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]] and other [[Scottish Enlightenment]] luminaries in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to General [[James St Clair]], who was envoy to the courts of [[Turin]] and [[Vienna]]. At that time Hume also wrote ''Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding'', later published as ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Often called the ''First Enquiry'', it proved little more successful than the ''Treatise'', perhaps because of the publishing of his short autobiography, ''My Own Life'', which "made friends difficult for the first Enquiry".{{sfn|Buckle|1999|p= ?}}
In 1749 he went to live with his brother in the countryside.

Hume's religious views were often suspect. It was necessary in the 1750s for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. However, he "would not have come and could not be forced to attend if he said he was not a member of the Established Church".{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=244}} Hume failed to gain the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|chair of philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] for his religious views, too. He had published the ''[[Philosophical Essays]]'' by this time which were decidedly anti-religious. Even [[Adam Smith]], his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern public opinion would be against it.{{sfn|Rivers|2000|p=255}}

Hume returned to Edinburgh in 1751. In the following year "the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=11}} This resource enabled him to continue historical research for ''The History of England''. Hume's volume of ''Political Discourses'', written in 1749 and published by Kincaid &amp; [[Alexander Donaldson (bookseller)|Donaldson]] in 1752,{{sfn|Sher|2008|p=312}} was the only work he considered successful on first publication.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=10}}

Eventually, with the publication of his six-volume ''The History of England'' between 1754 and 1762, Hume achieved the fame that he coveted.{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=98}} The volumes traced events from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Invasion of Julius Caesar]] to the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], and was a bestseller in its day.

Hume was also a longtime friend of bookseller [[Andrew Millar]], who sold Hume's ''History'' (after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/2.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from David Hume to Andrew Millar, 12 April, 1755.|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;), although the relationship was sometimes complicated. Letters between them illuminate both men's interest in the success of the ''History''.

===Later years===
[[File:Old Calton David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume's mausoleum by [[Robert Adam]]]]
From 1763 to 1765, Hume was invited to attend [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|Lord Hertford]] in [[Paris]], where he became secretary to the British embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky, Raymond and Mossner, Ernest C. (eds.) (1954). ''New Letters of David Hume''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was well received in Paris, and while there he met with [[Isaac de Pinto]]&lt;ref&gt;POPKIN, R. H. (1970). Hume and Isaac de Pinto. Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 12(3), 417–430. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/40754109&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, Hume left Paris to accompany [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to England.  Once in England, Hume and Rousseau fell out.&lt;ref name=wsj11042017&gt;"An Enlightened Friendship", Ruth Scurr, Wall Street Journal, November 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was sufficiently worried about the damage to his reputation from the quarrel with Rousseau (who is generally believed to have suffered from [[paranoia]]) to have authored an account of the dispute, which he titled, appropriately enough ''"A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/concisegenuineac00hume|title=A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau : with the letters that passed between them during their controversy. As also, the letters of the Hon. Mr. Walpole, and Mr. D'Alembert, relative to this extraordinary affair|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1765, he served as British [[Chargé d'affaires]], writing "despatches to the British Secretary of State".{{sfn|Fieser|2003|p=59}} He wrote of his Paris life, "I really wish often for the plain roughness of [[The Poker Club]] of Edinburgh&amp;nbsp;... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness".{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=285}} In 1766, upon returning to Britain, Hume encouraged [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|Lord Hertford]] to invest in a number of slave plantations, acquired by [[George Colebrooke]] and others in the [[Windward Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldmann, Felix (ed.) (2014). ''Further Letters of David Hume''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, 2014, p.65-69; http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/all-his-remedies/ (paywall)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, Hume was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Here he wrote that he was given "all the secrets of the Kingdom". In 1769 he returned to James' Court in Edinburgh, and then lived, from 1771 until his death in 1776, at the southwest corner of St. Andrew's Square in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], at what is now 21 Saint David Street.{{sfn|Burton|1846|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;dq=hume+1767&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gUSIVLzvGIbmUsephJgK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%201767&amp;f=false p. 384–385]}} A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence, suggests the street may have been named after Hume.{{sfn|Burton|1846|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=CDYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;dq=hume+1767&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gUSIVLzvGIbmUsephJgK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22david%20street%22&amp;f=false p. 436, footnote 1]}}

In the last year of his life, Hume wrote an extremely brief autobiographical essay titled "My Own Life"&lt;ref name="andromeda.rutgers.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/humelife.html|title=David Hume, "My Own Life"|work=rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which summed up his entire life in "fewer than 5 pages",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oliveschreinerletters.ed.ac.uk/StanleyHumePersona.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and notably contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume.&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.sc.edu"&gt;http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&amp;context=ssl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048409912348781?journalCode=rajp20#.VcvMJHjeJBU|title= Hume's biography and Hume's philosophy| doi=10.1080/00048409912348781 | volume=77|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|pages=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar of 18th-century literature Donald Seibert judged it a "remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere."&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.sc.edu"/&gt;  Hume here confesses his belief that the "love of literary fame" had served as his "ruling passion" in life, and claims that this desire "never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments." One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that  with the initial literary reception of the ''Treatise'', which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the ''Essays'': "the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment". Hume, in his own retrospective judgment, suggested that his philosophical debut's apparent failure "had proceeded more from the manner than the matter." Hume thus suggests that  "I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early." Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: "my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best."  Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that "My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that "though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury", and professing of his character that "My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct." Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: " I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained."&lt;ref name="andromeda.rutgers.edu"/&gt;

Diarist and biographer [[James Boswell]] saw Hume a few weeks before his death, which was from some form of abdominal cancer. Hume told him he sincerely believed it a "most unreasonable fancy" that there might be life after death.{{sfn|Boswell|1970|p= ?}} This meeting was dramatised in semi-fictional form for the [[BBC]] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] as ''Dialogue in the Dark''.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MkTSD5UHu8AC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=dark+hume+Michael+Ignatieff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YEuIVIzbEseqUbzng_gP&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dark%20hume%20Michael%20Ignatieff&amp;f=false p. 272]}} Hume asked that his body be interred in a "simple Roman tomb". In his will he requests that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, "leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest".{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=591}} It stands, as he wished it, on the southwestern slope of [[Calton Hill]], in the [[Old Calton Cemetery]]. Adam Smith later recounted Hume's amusing speculation that he might ask [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] to allow him a few more years of life in order to see "the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition." The ferryman replied, "You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years&amp;nbsp;... Get into the boat this instant".{{sfn|Hume|1789|p=xxi}}

==Writings==
In the introduction to ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote, "'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature&amp;nbsp;... Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man." He also wrote that the [[science of man]] is the "only solid foundation for the other sciences" and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=7}} On this aspect of Hume's thought, philosophical historian [[Frederick Copleston]] wrote that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply [[Natural philosophy]]), and that "Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]".{{sfn|Copleston|1999|pp=405–406}}

Until recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of [[logical positivism]]; a form of anti-[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] empiricism. According to the logical positivists, unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e. either [[tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[contradiction|contradictory]]), then it was meaningless (this is a summary statement of their [[verificationism|verification principle]]). Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are [[logical equivalence|semantically equivalent]] to propositions about one's experiences.{{sfn|Ayer|1946|p=40}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}}

Many commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an [[epistemology|epistemological]] (rather than a [[semantics|semantic]]) reading of his project.&lt;ref name=CSW&gt;See e.g. {{harvtxt|Craig|1987|loc=Ch. 2}}, {{harvtxt|Strawson|2014|p= ?}}, and {{harvtxt|Wright|1983|p= ?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.

===Impressions and ideas===

One of the most central doctrines of Hume's philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the ''Treatise'', is his notion that the mind consists of its mental perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: ''impressions'' and ''ideas''. Hume's Treatise thus opens with the words: 'All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS."  Hume states that "I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction" and commentators have generally taken Hume to mean the distinction between [[feeling]] and [[thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognition-and-commitment-in-humes-philosophy-9780195159592?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Cognition and Commitment in Hume's Philosophy|work=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, Hume may regard the difference as in some sense a matter of degree, as he takes "impressions" to be distinguished from ideas, on the basis of their force, liveliness, and vivacity, or what Henry Allison calls the "FLV criterion" in his book on Hume.&lt;ref name="global.oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/custom-and-reason-in-hume-9780199532889?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Custom and Reason in Hume|work=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas are therefore "faint" impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching the handle of a hot pan is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan.  According to Hume, impressions are meant to be the original form of all our ideas, and Don Garret has thus coined the term "the copy principle" to refer to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately all copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.&lt;ref name="global.oup.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415283342|title=Hume|date=30 October 2014|work=routledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further broken down into simple and complex: simple impressions and ideas, and complex impressions and ideas. Hume states that “simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation,” while “the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts.”&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1896). A Treatise of Human Nature (L. A. Selby-Bigge, Ed.). Wotton-under-Edge: Oxford: Clarendon Press. Retrieved May 4, 2017, from Center for Security Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of color-sensations, which Hume sees as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation again being a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thereby referred to as being simple.
                 
A person's imagination, regardless of how boundless it may seem, is confined to the mind's ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body's sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, “as our imagination takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect."&lt;ref&gt;Fieser, J. (2011, July 1). David Hume (1711-1776). In Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved March 8, 2017, from http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume/&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of resemblance refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent resemble one another. For example, a person looking at an illustration of a flower can conceive of an idea of the physical flower because the idea of the illustrated object is associated with the idea of the physical object. The principle of contiguity describes the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are near to each other in time or space, such as when the thought of one crayon in a box leads a person to think of the crayon contiguous to it. Finally, the principle of cause and effect refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are causally related, which explains how remembering a broken window can make someone think of the baseball that caused the window to shatter.
  
Hume elaborates more on this last principle of cause and effect. When a person observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, it results in “an expectation that a particular event (a 'cause') will be followed by another event (an 'effect') previously and constantly associated with it."&lt;ref&gt;Norton, D. F. (1999). Hume, David. In R. Audi (Ed.), Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (2nd ed., pp. 398-403). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.

(1990). An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. New York, NY: Anchor/Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words, “experience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect…the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to think in this way."&lt;ref&gt;Drefcinski, S. (n.d.). [http://people.uwplatt.edu/~drefcins/humeencyclopediaentry.html A Very Brief Summary of David Hume]. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing this idea, Hume argues that "only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [can] causation safely…be applied – all other sciences are reduced to probability."&lt;ref&gt;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. (2010). Masterplots, Fourth Edition, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses this skepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.

===Induction and causation&lt;!--linked from 'Problem of induction'--&gt;===
The cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the [[problem of induction]]. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced.{{sfn| Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= ?}} The problem revolves around the plausibility of [[inductive reasoning]], that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go "beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 26}} Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present.{{sfn|Atherton|1999|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=9u56iKhWQu4C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=hume+Uniformity+of+Nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DVOIVKTQAon4UojxgJgL&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20Uniformity%20of%20Nature&amp;f=false pp. 202–203]}} Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning{{refn|These are Hume's terms. In modern parlance, ''demonstration'' may be termed ''[[deductive reasoning]]'', while ''probability'' may be termed ''[[inductive reasoning]]''.{{sfn|Millican|1996|p= ?}}|group=note}}—and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is "consistent and conceivable" that nature might stop being regular.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 111}} Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be [[circular reasoning]].{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 115}} Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.

Hume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that "Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel." Agreeing, philosopher [[John D. Kenyon]] writes: "Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment&amp;nbsp;... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief."{{sfn|Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= 254}} Commentators such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] have demurred from Hume's solution,{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uBbfizzKTDoC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;pg=PA42&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 42]}} while, some, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Karl Popper]], saw that Hume's analysis "had posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims."{{sfn|Popkin|2014}}

The notion of [[Causality|causation]] is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. There are at least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.{{sfn|Read|Richman|2002|pp=13–14 and 69}}

Hume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that 'all events have a specific course or reason.' Therefore, Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”.&lt;ref&gt;. "Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”.&lt;ref&gt;."Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume later goes on to say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume's separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as "[[Hume's fork]]".&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume explains his theory of Causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his ideas, in addition to comparing and contrasting his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief.&lt;ref name="Davidhume 1748"&gt;"Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation. Next, Hume uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have while observing the Critical Phase. “Habit or Custom” mends the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realizing it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It “makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past” &lt;ref name="Davidhume 1748"/&gt; However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads Hume to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past and the only way to justify induction is through uniformity.

The [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as "A caused B", in terms of regularities in perception: "A causes B" is equivalent to "Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow", where "whenever" refers to all possible perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;For this account of Hume's views on causation cf. {{harvtxt|Ayer|1946|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
power and necessity&amp;nbsp;... are&amp;nbsp;... qualities of perceptions, not of objects&amp;nbsp;... felt by the soul and not perceiv'd externally in bodies.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=167}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view is rejected by skeptical [[Philosophical realism|realists]], who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events.&lt;ref name=CSW /&gt; Hume said that when two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means&amp;nbsp;... there is a ''necessary connexion'' to be taken into consideration.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=78|ps=, original emphasis}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosopher Angela Coventry writes that, for Hume, "there is nothing in any particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which suggests the idea of power or necessary connection" and that "we are ignorant of the powers that operate between objects".{{sfn|Coventry|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gq348MmuojAC&amp;dq=hume+coventry&amp;q=%22effect+involving%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22effect%20involving%22&amp;f=false pp. 91–92]}} However, while denying the possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the causal principle, writing, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause."{{sfn|Hume|2011|p=187}}

It has been argued that, while Hume did not think causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully fledged realist either. Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] calls this a [[quasi-realism|quasi-realist]] reading.{{sfn|Blackburn|1990|p= ?}} Blackburn writes that "Someone talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by {{harvtxt|Dauer|2010|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hume's words, "nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=78, fn 17}}

===The self===
[[File:DavidHume.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Hume by [[Alexander Stoddart]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh]]
Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], favoured the [[bundle theory]] of [[personal identity]].{{sfn|Dicker|2002|p=15}} In this theory, "the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unity or cohesive quality".{{sfn|Maurer|2013}} The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, that the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as "self", "person", or "mind" referred to collections of "sense-contents".{{sfn|Ayer|1946|pp=135–136}} A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by [[Derek Parfit]] in his ''[[Reasons and Persons]]''.{{sfn|Parfit|1984|p= ?}}

However, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relations of similarity and causality with one another. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct "bundles" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an [[ontology|ontological]] question, philosophers, like [[Galen Strawson]], who see Hume as not very concerned with such questions have queried whether the view is really Hume's. Instead, it is suggested by Strawson that Hume might have been answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our concept of the self.{{sfn|Strawson|2011|p= ?}} In the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in Book 1. Philosopher Corliss Swain notes that "Commentators agree that if Hume did find some new problem" when he reviewed the section on personal identity, "he wasn't forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix."{{sfn|Swain|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qoh7_nZbBjYC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=hume+blackwell+new+problem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SmODVNGVG8G9UeJV&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20blackwell%20new%20problem&amp;f=false p. 142]}} One interpretation of Hume's view of the self has been argued for by philosopher and psychologist [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]]. According to his view, Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. That is, rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume is rejecting the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a "[[Personal identity#The no-self theory|no-self theory]]" and thus has much in common with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought.{{sfn|Giles|1993|p= ?}} On this point, psychologist [[Alison Gopnik]] has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.{{sfn|Gopnik|2009|p= ?}}

===Practical reason===
An essential question of practical reason for Hume was whether or not standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people's intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Jean Hampton]], and [[Elijah Millgram]] claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Michelle |authorlink= Michelle Mason |volume= 31 |issue= 2 |date=September 2005 |title=Hume and Humeans on Practical Reason |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v31n2/mason/mason-v31n2.pdf |publisher= [[Hume Studies]] |accessdate=2016-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create. As Hume explains in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1740): “Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978|title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory), Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly oppose passions. As Hume puts it, “Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.” Reason is less significant than any passion because reason has no original influence, while "A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978 |title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than the truth of propositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=practical-reason |title=Practical Reason |last=Wallace |first=Jay |date=2014 | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Hume believed that reason's shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential for dictating people's intentions and actions.

===Ethics===
{{see also|is–ought problem}}
Hume's writings on ethics began in the ''Treatise'' and were refined in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751). His views on ethics are that "[m]oral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment." It is not knowing that governs ethical actions, but feelings.{{sfn|Cranston|2014|p=4}} Arguing that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=458}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume's [[moral sentimentalism]] about morality was shared by his close friend Adam Smith,{{sfn|Hume|2013|p=548}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} and Hume and Smith were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of their older contemporary [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p= ?}} [[Peter Singer]] claims that Hume's argument that morals cannot have a rational basis alone "would have been enough to earn him a place in the history of ethics".{{sfn|Singer|2015}}

Hume also put forward the [[is–ought problem]], later called ''Hume's Law'',{{sfn|Singer|2015}} denying the possibility of logically deriving what ''ought'' to be from what ''is''. He wrote in the ''Treatise'' that in every system of morality he has read, the author begins with stating facts about the world, but then suddenly is always referring to what ought to be the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what ought to be the case, from what is the case. This because it "seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others".{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=470}}

Hume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern-day [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical theory]],{{sfn|Edwards|2002|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=0pGKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Hume++meta-ethics+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zrmIVL_FE4iBUc-JgIAG&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20%20meta-ethics%20influence&amp;f=false p. 44]}} helping to inspire [[emotivism]],{{sfn|Humber|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dh-E6oIlCkAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Hume+emotivism+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9LuIVIfhIIW1UaCIg_AM&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20emotivism%20influence&amp;f=false p. 136]}} and ethical [[expressivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]],{{sfn|Brown|2005|pp=97–100}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} as well as [[Allan Gibbard]]'s general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality.{{sfn|Angier|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ndyMavMbiZMC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Hume++influence+gibbard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0r-IVKLZF4PwUJbrgLAJ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20%20influence%20gibbard&amp;f=false p. 114]}}

===Aesthetics===
Hume's ideas about [[aesthetics]] and the [[theory of art]] are spread throughout his works, but are particularly connected with his ethical writings, and also the essays ''[[Of the Standard of Taste]]'' and ''[[Of Tragedy]]''. His views are rooted in the work of [[Joseph Addison]] and Francis Hutcheson.{{sfn|Gracyk|2011|loc= ch. 1}} In the ''Treatise'' he wrote of the connection between beauty and deformity and vice and virtue,{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=Sect. VII and Sect VIII, pp. 295–304}} and his later writings on this subject continue to draw parallels of beauty and deformity in art, with conduct and character.{{sfn|Costelloe|2013|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=MH3_R04jW80C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=hume+aesthetics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hvGFVMcPy_5So1I&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=deformity&amp;f=false p. viii]}}

In ''Of the Standard of Taste'', Hume argues that no rules can be drawn up about what is a tasteful object. However, a reliable critic of taste can be recognised as being objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and having extensive experience.{{sfn|Harris|2013|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=zWMBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=hume+aesthetics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AxaGVPzBHcjsUsjwgOAP&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20aesthetics&amp;f=false p. 401]}} ''Of Tragedy'' addresses the question of why humans enjoy [[tragedy|tragic drama]]. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSXlNY6xIMoC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=hume+of+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RBqGVPnpBMb9Utelg9AP&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20of%20tragedy&amp;f=false pp. 325–326]}} Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.{{sfn|Scruton|2014|p=18}}

===Free will, determinism, and responsibility===
Hume, along with Thomas Hobbes, is cited as a classical [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] about the notions of [[free will|freedom]] and [[determinism]].{{sfn|McKenna|Coates|2015|loc=Ch. 3}} The thesis of compatibilism seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist belief that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, whose happenings are governed by [[physical law]]s. Hume, to this end, was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution and by in particular Sir Isaac Newton.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}} Hume argued that the dispute about the compatibility of freedom and determinism has been continued over two thousand years by ambiguous terminology. He wrote: "From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot&amp;nbsp;... we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression", and that different disputants use different meanings for the same terms.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=81}}{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&amp;f=false p. 73]}}

Hume defines the concept of necessity as "the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=82}} and [[liberty]] as "a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=95}} He then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty ''requires'' necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would "have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other". But if our actions are not thus connected to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of "chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=96}} Australian philosopher [[John Passmore]] writes that confusion has arisen because "necessity" has been taken to mean "necessary connexion". Once this has been abandoned, Hume argues that "liberty and necessity will be found not to be in conflict one with another".{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&amp;f=false p. 73]}}

Moreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held [[morally responsible]], it is required that our behaviour be caused or necessitated, for, as he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some ''cause'' in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=98|ps=, original emphasis}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.{{sfn|Mounce|Mounce|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qyepEVWo0v8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=hume+liberty+of+spontaneity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bjeMVOKlG4L6UJe1gNgL&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20liberty%20of%20spontaneity&amp;f=false p. 66]}}

Education writer Richard Wright considers that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher [[Jean Buridan]]. The [[Buridan's ass]] puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has on both sides of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no [[autonomy]]. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}}

Hume's argument is supported by modern-day compatibilists such as [[R. E. Hobart]], a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{harvtxt|Hobart|1934|p=?}} and {{harvtxt|Carroll|Markosian|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=f6bcZq4_4gUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=hume+hobart+Free+Will+as+Involving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vjiMVJalEcjzUIu6gdgL&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20hobart%20Free%20Will%20as%20Involving&amp;f=false p. 54, note 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[P. F. Strawson]] argued that the issue of whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.{{sfn|Strawson|2008|p=?}}{{sfn|Prasad|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=66b8FJmZQ38C&amp;dq=hume+strawson&amp;q=hume+moral%2C+reactive#v=snippet&amp;q=hume%20moral%2C%20reactive&amp;f=false p. 348]}}

===Writings on religion===
The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that Hume "wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question in the philosophy of religion." His "various writings concerning problems of religion are among the most important and influential contributions on this topic."{{sfn|Russell|2014|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Hume on Religion]}} His writings in this field cover the philosophy, psychology, history, and anthropology of religious thought. All of these aspects were discussed in Hume's 1757 dissertation, ''The Natural History of Religion''. Here he argued that the [[monotheistic]] religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all derive from earlier [[polytheistic]] religions. He also suggested that all religious belief "traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown."{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=hume+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1s_GU_r3KPPH7Abi94GgAg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20religion&amp;f=false pp. 7–8]}} Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first ''Enquiry'', as well as later in the ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''.{{sfn|Russell|2014|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Ch. 1]}}

====Religious views====
Although he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume's personal views are unclear, and there has been much discussion concerning his religious position.&lt;ref&gt;E.g in {{harvtxt|Russell|2010}}, {{harvtxt|O'Connor|2013}}, and {{harvtxt|Norton|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or at least un-Christian, and the [[Church of Scotland]] seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him.{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=206}} The fact that contemporaries thought that he may have been an atheist is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.{{sfn|Scharfstein|1998|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=hume++fishwives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wi3KU6jOGMaM7AaRoIDYBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20%20fishwives&amp;f=false p. 454, footnote]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in works such as ''Of Superstition and Enthusiasm'', Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the [[Catholic Church]], dismissing it with the standard [[Protestant]] accusations of superstition and idolatry,{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=51}}{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=70}} as well as dismissing as idolatry what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs.{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=34}} He also considered extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called "enthusiasts", to be corrupters of religion.{{sfn|Hume|1741|pp=73–76}} By contrast, in his ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]'', Hume presented arguments suggesting that [[polytheism]] had much to commend it over [[monotheism]].{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=63}}

Philosopher [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] writes that it is likely that Hume was sceptical about religious belief, but not to the extent of complete atheism.  He suggests that perhaps Hume's position is best characterised by the term "irreligion",{{sfn|Russell|2010|pp=202, 204–205, and 284}} while philosopher David O'Connor argues that Hume's final position was "weakly [[deistic]]". For O'Connor, Hume's "position is deeply ironic. This is because, while inclining towards a weak form of [[deism]], he seriously doubts that we can ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify accepting any religious position." He adds that Hume "did not believe in the God of standard theism&amp;nbsp;... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity", and that "ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion".{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22but+he+did+not+rule+out+all+concepts+of+deity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ulLs4-GWED&amp;sig=XcJNdJXP3jP-N0ynFZ8wroDbAUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CtwmVd-BKueP7AbA14CYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22but%20he%20did%20not%20rule%20out%20all%20concepts%20of%20deity%22&amp;f=false pp.11, 19]}}

====Design argument====
One of the traditional topics of [[natural theology]] is that of the [[existence of God]], and one of the ''[[a posteriori]]'' arguments for this is the ''argument from design'' or the [[teleological argument]]. The argument is that the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the complexity of the world. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that this is "the most popular, because [it is] the most accessible of the theistic arguments&amp;nbsp;... which identifies evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer&amp;nbsp;... The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it."&lt;ref name = RE&gt;[[#{{harvid|RE}}|RE]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}

In ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Hume wrote that the design argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents "always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=148}} Philosopher Louise E. Loeb notes that Hume is saying that only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume, "we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes."{{sfn|Loeb|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ECxW_2tAf0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=companion+hume+observe+neither+God+nor+other+universes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z0OMVMfjJob1UvykgLAN&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=companion%20hume%20observe%20neither%20God%20nor%20other%20universes&amp;f=false p. 118]}}

Hume also criticised the argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'' (1779). In this, he suggested that, even if the world is a more or less smoothly functioning system, this may only be a result of the "chance permutations of particles falling into a temporary or permanent self-sustaining order, which thus has the appearance of design."&lt;ref name=RE /&gt;

A century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life are a result of the [[natural selection]] of inherited characteristics.&lt;ref name=RE /&gt; For philosopher James D. Madden, it is "Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition."{{sfn|Madden|2005|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=UKSZeRnuyjAC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=teleological+god+hume+darwin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FvrIU4uBMYOu7AaV1oGQCw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20god%20hume%20darwin&amp;f=false p. 150, emphasis removed.]}}

Finally, Hume discussed a version of the [[anthropic principle]], which is the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to allow for man's existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced by an incompetent designer, whom he called a "stupid mechanic". In his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'', Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.{{sfn|Hume|1779|p=167}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that this mechanical explanation of teleology, although "obviously&amp;nbsp;... an amusing philosophical fantasy", anticipated the notion of natural selection, the 'continued improvement' being like "any Darwinian selection algorithm."{{sfn|Dennett|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=i1tNI9646Q4C&amp;pg=PA620&amp;dq=hume++anthropic+principle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4zXKU_nGCqaw7Aa-w4GAAg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20%20anthropic%20principle&amp;f=false pp. 620–621]}}

====Problem of miracles====
{{main|Of Miracles}}

In his discussion of [[miracle]]s, Hume argues that we should not believe that miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think that God exists.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|p=101}} In ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent". Hume says that we believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur. Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A wise man [...] considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments [...] A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments [...] and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=110–111}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible. "[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

Although Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history:{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=116–131|ps=, Part II of Section X}} He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in "ignorant and barbarous nations"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=119}} and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}

Hume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his ''Enquiry''. He states "I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=110}} Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}

The criterion for assessing a belief system for Hume is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.{{sfn| Ahluwalia|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-PCV11VQ8PYC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Understanding+Philosophy+of+Religion%22+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6qs4Vbe4EofXPeywgbgN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Understanding%20Philosophy%20of%20Religion%22%20hume&amp;f=false pp.104–106]}}{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

Despite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that "The gazing populace [...] receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=126}}

Critics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and [[natural law]]s prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of [[begging the question]]. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature, but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that "there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/essayinanswertom00adamiala#page/14/mode/2up |title=An essay in answer to Mr. Hume's Essay on miracles |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.{{sfn|Levine|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fC3-d89f7qoC&amp;dq=hume+miracle+criticism&amp;q=%22hume+with+a+glaring%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22hume%20with%20a%20glaring%22&amp;f=false p. 3]}}

Of Campbell, it is rumoured that, having read Campbell's Dissertation, Hume remarked that "the Scotch theologue had beaten him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Campbell |url=http://historicalapologetics.org/campbell-george/ |title=Campbell, George « Library of Historical Apologetics |publisher=Historicalapologetics.org |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature. Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either ones senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken. Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the Prince "reasoned justly"; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

So for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who "is moved by faith to assent" to revealed testimony "is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=131|ps=, emphasis removed}}{{sfn|MacKie|1982|p=29}} Hume writes that "All the testimony which ever was really given for any miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

===As historian of England===
[[File:David Hume 2.jpg|thumb| David Hume by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1766]]
From 1754 to 1762 Hume published ''The History of England'', a 6-volume work, which extends, says its subtitle, "From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688". Inspired by [[Voltaire]]'s sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well. He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved "the most entire system of liberty that was ever known amongst mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Hume's History of England, vol, 6, p. 531 cited in {{harvtxt|Kenyon|1984|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "must be regarded as an event of cultural importance. In its own day, moreover, it was an innovation, soaring high above its very few predecessors."{{sfn|Jessop|2015}}

Hume's coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]]'s ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England'' (1646–69). Generally, Hume took a moderate [[royalist]] position and considered revolution unnecessary to achieve necessary reform. Hume was considered a Tory historian, and emphasised religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie explains that "Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but&amp;nbsp;... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-royalist coloring."{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=16}} For "Hume shared the&amp;nbsp;... Tory belief that the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=25}} "Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the ''History'' as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=27}}
Historians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.{{sfn|Wertz|1975|p=?}}

Robert Roth argues that Hume's histories display his biases against [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s and [[Puritan]]s. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.{{sfn|Roth|1991|p=?}}

Hume was an early cultural [[history of science|historian of science]]. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Hume particularly praised [[William Harvey]], writing about his treatise of the circulation of the blood: "Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made, by reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science".{{sfn|Wertz|1993|p=?}}

The ''History'' became a best-seller and made Hume a wealthy man who no longer had to take up salaried work for others.{{sfn|Morris|Brown|2011|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/hume/#LifWor Chapter Life and Works]}} It was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]] (1757), [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] (1771) and others. By 1894, there were at least 50 editions as well as abridgements for students, and illustrated pocket editions, probably produced specifically for women.{{sfn|Phillipson|2012|p=131}}

===Political theory===
{{Utilitarianism}}
It is difficult to categorise Hume's political affiliations. His writings contain elements that are, in modern terms, both conservative and liberal,{{sfn|Dees|2010|p=403}} although these terms are anachronistic. [[Thomas Jefferson]] banned the ''History'' from [[University of Virginia]], feeling that it had "spread universal toryism over the land".&lt;ref&gt;so quoted in {{harvtxt|Livingston|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Samuel Johnson]] thought Hume "a Tory by chance&amp;nbsp;... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist", a follower of [[Thomas Hobbes]].{{sfn|Hume|1888|loc=note 13 to letter LXXXIV}} A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics: public spirit and regard to the community.{{sfn|Forbes|1985|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PX86AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=politics+moderation+hume&amp;q=politics+moderation+hume+detested#v=snippet&amp;q=politics%20moderation%20hume%20detested&amp;f=false p. 150]}}

This outlook needs to be seen within the historical context of 18th-century Scotland. Here, the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided.{{sfn|Wiley|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q94tuawjdYUC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=hume+enthusiasm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r6vjU73yDKbD7AaP54GYAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20enthusiasm&amp;f=false p. 211]}}{{failed verification|date=August 2015}} Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he does write that a republic must produce laws, while "monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to law."{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=119}}

Hume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=550}} However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[Tory|Tories]]. Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My views of ''things'' are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of ''persons'' to Tory prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;so quoted in {{harvtxt|Mossner|1980|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&amp;q=whig#v=snippet&amp;q=whig&amp;f=false p. 311]}}, original emphasis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur writes that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a "precautionary conservative",{{sfn|McArthur|2007|p=124}} whose actions would have been "determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate."{{sfn|McArthur|2007}}{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Hume supported the [[freedom of the press|liberty of the press]], and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian [[Douglass Adair]] has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for [[James Madison]]'s writings, and the essay "[[Federalist No. 10]]" in particular.{{sfn|Adair|1957|p=?}}

Hume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled "Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth", which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. He hoped that, "in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world". He defended a strict [[separation of powers]], [[decentralization|decentralisation]], extending the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy. The system of the [[military of Switzerland|Swiss militia]] was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid.{{sfn|Hume|1987}} Political philosophers [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], writing of Hume's thoughts about "the wise statesman", note that he "will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age". Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his innovations will take account of the "ancient fabric", in order not to disturb society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7mScxst9UoC&amp;dq=History+of+Political+Philosophy&amp;q=%22limits+of+human+foresight%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22limits%20of%20human%20foresight%22&amp;f=false |title=Strauss, L. and Cropsey, J., '&amp;#39;History of Political Philosophy'&amp;#39;, University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 556 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political analysis of philosopher [[George Holland Sabine|George Sabine]], the scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of [[consent of the governed|government by consent]]. He notes that "allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently as much a part of human nature as any other motive."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sabine|Sabine, GH.]], ''A History of Political Theory'', Dryden Press, 1973 (1937), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1770s, Hume was critical of British policies toward the American colonies and advocated for American independence.  He wrote in 1771 that "our union with America... in the nature of things, cannot long subsist".&lt;ref name=wsj11042017 /&gt;

===Contributions to economic thought===
[[File:David_Hume_and_Adam_Smith_statues,_Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Statues of David Hume and [[Adam Smith]] by David Watson Stevenson on the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] in Edinburgh]]
Hume noted his views as economist in his ''Political Discourses'', which were incorporated in ''Essays and Treatises'' as Part II of ''Essays, Moral and Political''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Hume#toc12268|title=David Hume {{!}} Scottish philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent he was influenced by Adam Smith is difficult to stress, however both of them had similar principles supported from historical events.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt;  At the same time Hume did not demonstrate concrete system of economic theory which could be observed in Smith's [[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]. However, he introduced several new ideas  around which the “classical economics” of the 18th century was built.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt; Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on [[private property]], inflation, and [[international trade|foreign trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel ''A History of Economic Thought: The LSE Lectures'' edited by Medema and Samuels. Ch 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his essay "[[Of the Balance of Trade]]", economist [[Paul Krugman]] has remarked that "David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=How We Know The Earth Is Old|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com//2012/11/20/how-we-know-the-earth-is-old/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Locke, Hume believes that private property is not a natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are limited. Private property would be an unjustified, "idle ceremonial", if all goods were unlimited and available freely.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=hume+idle+ceremonial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plOMVOCrMozuaMjCgqgD&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20idle%20ceremonial&amp;f=false ''Understanding the Global Economy''], Peace Education Books, 2004, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also believed in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David ''An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals'' (1751)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, JB., [https://books.google.com/books?id=MTYABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=hume+private+property&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hlKMVLXeHtfwaLf1gagD&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20private%20property&amp;f=false ''Opinion and Reform in Hume's Political Philosophy''], Princeton University Press, 2014, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Due to Hume's vast influence on contemporary philosophy, a large number of approaches in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science are today called "Humean."&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Don, ''Hume (The Routledge Philosophers)'', Routledge -Reprint edition, 2014, p. ? {{ISBN|978-0415283342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' (1783), credited Hume with awakening him from his "dogmatic slumber".&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I., ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'': 'Introduction'&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], "there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]] and [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] taken together."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=OHIJgObqoXoC&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+World+as+Will+and+Representation+volume+2+hume&amp;q=page+hume+together#v=snippet&amp;q=page%20hume%20together&amp;f=false ''The World as Will and Representation''], Vol. 2, Ch. 46, p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. J. Ayer]], while introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism in 1936, claimed: "The views which are put forward in this treatise derive from&amp;nbsp;... doctrines&amp;nbsp;... which are themselves the logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3M3ycPeuRNoC&amp;dq=ayer+truth&amp;q=%22The+views%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22The%20views%22&amp;f=false Ayer, AJ., ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', London, Preface to First Edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]], in 1915, wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating his theory of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A., in a letter of 14 December 1915, to Moritz Schlick (Papers, A, Vol. 8A, Doc.165)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's problem of induction was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of Karl Popper. In his autobiography, ''Unended Quest'', he wrote: "Knowledge&amp;nbsp;... is ''objective''; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's ''problem of induction''". This insight resulted in Popper's major work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmoQBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Hume+Unended+Quest&amp;q=%22is+hypothetical+or+conjectural%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22is%20hypothetical%20or%20conjectural%22&amp;f=false ''Unended Quest; An Intellectual Autobiography''], 1976, pp. 95–96, {{ISBN|0-415-28590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zXh9AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=popper+conjectures&amp;q=%22approached+the+problem%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22approached%20the%20problem%22&amp;f=false ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge''], Routledge, 2014, . 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The writings of Scottish philosopher and contemporary of Hume, [[Thomas Reid]], were often criticisms of Hume's scepticism. Reid formulated his [[common sense]] philosophy in part as a reaction against Hume's views.&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reid/#ComSenFirPri "Thomas Reid"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume influenced and was influenced by the Christian philosopher [[Joseph Butler]]. Hume was impressed by Butler's way of thinking about religion, and Butler may well have been influenced by Hume's writings.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=8zTVtbQQuKsC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=butler+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wkWLVNOLN4T6ULC9hPgJ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=butler%20hume&amp;f=false ''Philosophy and Religion in Enlightenment Britain: New Case Studies''], Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= plat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion |author=Paul Russel |date=17 May 2010 |work=First published October 4, 2005 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's [[rationalism]] in religious subjects influenced, via German-Scottish theologian [[Johann Joachim Spalding]], the German [[neology]] school and [[rational theology]], and contributed to the transformation of German theology in the [[age of enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schröter: Transformationen des Theologiebegriffes in der Aufklärung.

Danish theologian and philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] adopted "Hume's suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance." However, Kierkegaard took this as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or [[fideism]]. The "fact that Christianity is contrary to reason ... is the necessary precondition for true faith." Political theorist [[Isaiah Berlin]], for example, has pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against [[rational theology]].&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;Miles, T.

According to philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]], Hume's ''Treatise'' is "the founding document of [[cognitive science]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/writers/philosophers/david-hume.html|title=David Hume Biography|work=Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume engaged with contemporary intellectual luminaries such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[James Boswell]], and [[Adam Smith]] (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and [[political philosophy]]).

[[Isaiah Berlin]] once said of Hume that "No man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/podcasts/Impressions_of_David_Hume|title=Impressions of David Hume - Podcasts - Philosophy Now|work=philosophynow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His nephew and namesake, [[David Hume (advocate)|David Hume of Ninewells]] (1757–1838), was a co-founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1783.

* ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects'' (1739–40). Hume intended to see whether the [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ ''Treatise of Human Nature''] met with success, and if so to complete it with books devoted to Politics and Criticism. However, it did not meet with success. As Hume himself said, "It fell ''dead-born from the press'', without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots"{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} and so was not completed.
* ''An Abstract of a Book lately Published: Entitled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. (1740) Anonymously published, but almost certainly written by Hume&lt;ref&gt;For this see the introduction by J. M. Keynes and P. Sraffa in: Hume, David (1965). ''An Abstract of A Treatise of Human Nature 1740. Connecticut: Archon Books&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to popularise his ''Treatise''. Of considerable philosophical interest, because it spells out what he considered "The Chief Argument" of the ''Treatise'', in a way that seems to anticipate the structure of the ''Enquiry concerning Human Understanding''.
* ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'' (first ed. 1741–2) A collection of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–4. Many of the essays are focused on topics in politics and economics, though they also range over questions of [[aesthetics|aesthetic judgement]], love, marriage and polygamy, and the demographics of ancient Greece and Rome, to name just a few of the topics considered. The Essays show some influence from [[Joseph Addison|Addison]]'s ''Tatler'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', which Hume read avidly in his youth.
* ''A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh: Containing Some Observations on a Specimen of the Principles concerning Religion and Morality, said to be maintain'd in a Book lately publish'd, intituled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. Edinburgh (1745). Contains a letter written by Hume to defend himself against charges of atheism and scepticism, while applying for a chair at Edinburgh University.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748) Contains reworking of the main points of the ''Treatise'', Book 1, with the addition of material on free will (adapted from Book 2), miracles, the Design Argument, and mitigated scepticism. ''[[Of Miracles]]'', section X of the ''Enquiry'', was often published separately.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751) A reworking of material from Book 3 of the ''Treatise'', on morality, but with a significantly different emphasis. It "was thought by Hume to be the best of his writings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoI6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=david+hume++essay+concerning+morals+best+work&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0kLhU-74D5Ge7Aar4oCoBg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20hume%20%20essay%20concerning%20morals%20best%20work&amp;f=false |title=Samson, G., '&amp;#39;The Concise Cambridge History of English Literature'&amp;#39;, CUP Archive, 1941, p. 548 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Four Dissertations]]'' London (1757). Included in reprints of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (above).
* ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' (Sometimes referred to as ''The History of Great Britain'') (1754–62) More a category of books than a single work, Hume's history spanned "from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688" and went through over 100 editions. Many considered it ''the'' standard history of England in its day.
* ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. Included in "Four Dissertations" (1757)
* "Sister Peg" (1760) Hume claimed to have authored an anonymous political pamphlet satirizing the failure of the British Parliament to create a Scottish militia in 1760. Although the authorship of the work is disputed, Hume wrote Dr. Alexander Carlyle in early 1761 claiming authorship. The readership of the time attributed the work to [[Adam Ferguson]], a friend and associate of Hume's who has been sometimes called "the founder of modern sociology." Some contemporary scholars concur in the judgment that Ferguson, not Hume, was the author of this work.
* "My Own Life" (1776) Penned in April, shortly before his death, this autobiography was intended for inclusion in a new edition of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects''. It was first published by Adam Smith who claimed that by doing so he had incurred "ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7Bef_1f_w0C&amp;pg=PA466&amp;dq=david+hume++%22ten+times+more+abuse+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PUThU9oelI3sBr2PgIgE&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20hume%20%20%22ten%20times%20more%20abuse%20%22&amp;f=false |title=Berry, CJ., Paganelli, MP. and Smith, C., '&amp;#39;The Oxford Handbook of Adam Smith'&amp;#39;, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 466 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) Published posthumously by his nephew, David Hume the Younger. Being a discussion among three fictional characters concerning the nature of God, and is an important portrayal of the argument from design. Despite some controversy, most scholars agree that the view of Philo, the most sceptical of the three, comes closest to Hume's own.

[[File:Cross of the Scriptures detail - Crawford plate 146.png|thumb|Scene from the east face of the Cross of the Scriptures, [[Clonmacnoise]]. The figures probably represent Saint [[Ciarán of Clonmacnoise|Ciarán]] and Diarmait mac Cerbaill founding Clonmacnoise: "Then Ciarán planted the first stake, and Diarmait son of Cerball was along with him. Said Ciarán to Diarmait when setting the stake, 'Let, O warrior, thy hand be over my hand, and thou shalt be in sovranty over the men of Ireland.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, ''Book of Lismore'', p. 276. Needs ref for identification.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Diarmait mac Cerbaill''' (died ''[[circa|c]]''. 565) was [[King of Tara]] or [[High King of Ireland]]. According to traditions, he was the last High King to follow the [[paganism|pagan]] rituals of inauguration, the ''ban-feis'' or marriage to goddess of the land.

While many later stories were attached to Diarmait, he was a historical ruler and his descendants were of great significance in Medieval Ireland.  He is not to be confused with the later [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill (King of Osraige)]], son of king [[Cerball mac Dúnlainge]].

It is believed that the earliest of the [[Irish annals]] which came to make up the lost ''[[Chronicle of Ireland]]'' were kept as a contemporary record from no later than the middle of the 7th century, and may be rather older as it has been argued that many late 6th century entries have the appearance of contemporary recording. There is general agreement that the annals are largely based, in their earliest contemporary records, on a chronicle kept at the monastery on [[Iona]], and that the recording moved to somewhere in the midlands of Ireland only around 740. Although it is thus possible that the records of Diarmait's times in the annals are nearly contemporary, the later history of the annals is complex and much debated, so that it is uncertain to what extent surviving late annals such as the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' and ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' faithfully reproduce the earlier records.

Diarmait mac Cerbaill was the last to hold the sacral kingship of Tara.  He has also some title to be ranked as the first Christian high-king of Ireland.  Two of his sons bore the specifically Christian name of Colmán, deriving from the Latin [[Columbanus]].  This ambivalent character, together with the fact that he was the direct ancestor of the two most powerful dynasties of the [[Southern Uí Néill]], made him an obvious figure for saga and legend.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants of Niall==
Diarmait was the son of Fergus Cerrbél, son of [[Conall Cremthainne]], son of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]]. Yet of Niall's own historicity there is little reason to doubt.  His descendants quarrrelled incessantly among themselves after the manner of most Irish dynastic families and had no cause to invent a common ancestry, since by unanimous testimony the high-kingship of Tara prior to Niall's days had not been the preserve of any one tribe or family.  By the end of the fifth century, however, it was well on the way to becoming so.  Niall's sons and grandsons proclaimed their intention of monopolising it to the exclusion of their western cousins by discarding the tribal appellation of Connachta and adopting the dynastic name [[Uí Néill]], ''nepotes Néill''.  As a great-grandson of Niall, Diarmait and his descendants were counted among the Uí Néill, the name meaning "descendants of Niall".&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two great Southern Uí Néill dynasties of the midlands were the Síl nÁedo Sláine (the Seed of Áedo of Slane), kings of Brega in the east, and the [[Clann Cholmáin|Clann Cholmáin Máir]] (the Children of Colmán the Great) in Mide with their centre in the heart of modern Westmeath.  The former are more prominent in the seventh century, but after the death of Cináed mac Írgalaig in 728 all the high-kings of the Southern Uí Néill come from the Clann Cholmáin except for a brief period between 944 and 956 when the king of Knowth, Congalach Cnogba, restored the high-kingship to the Brega line.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is remarkable that the Síl nÁedo Sláine and Clann Cholmáin derive their origin, not directly from Niall Noígiallach, but from his great-grandson Diarmait mac Cerbaill.  The annals date Diarmait's reign as high-king from about 544 to 565.  The petty Uí Néill kings of Cenél nArdgail traced their ancestry to an uncle of Diarmait's, but never won the high kingship.  Besides Colmáin Már and Áed Sláine, Diarmait had a third son Colmáin Bec, whose descendants, the dynasty of Caílle Follamain, ruled an area corresponding to the baronies of Fore, between Mide and Brega.&lt;ref name=Byrne_90&gt;Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarmait's immediate origins are obscure and may arouse some suspicion.  In spite of his patronymic (latinised by Adomnán as ''filius Cerbulis'') the genealogical tradition says that his father's name was Fergus, nicknamed ''Cerrbél'' or 'crooked mouth'.  His grandfather Conall son of Niall was nicknamed Cremthainne (possibly denoting fosterage among the Uí Chremthainn of Airgialla), to distinguish him from his brother Conall Gulban, ancestor of the Cenél Conaill.  The habit of giving the same name to different sons remained common among the prolific Irish princes until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Byrne_90/&gt;

==Reign==
The [[Annals of Tigernach]] record that Diarmait celebrated the Feast of Tara, his inauguration as King, in 558 or 560. The previous King of Tara, according to the earliest lists, was Óengarb, an [[epithet]] meaning "extremely rough", presumed to refer to Diarmait's kinsman [[Tuathal Maelgarb]]. What followed the inauguration was "a surprisingly unpropitious reign for so famous a king".&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarmait was defeated at the [[Battle of Cúl Dreimhne|battle of Cúl Dreimne]] (near [[Ben Bulben]] in modern [[County Sligo]]) in 560 or 561. This was the "Battle of the Books", supposedly the result of Diarmait's judgement in a dispute between Columba and [[Finnian of Moville]]. Columba, it is said, had secretly copied a [[Cathach of St. Columba|book]] belonging to Finnian, and the matter of ownership of the copy had come to be settled by Diarmait, who adjudged in Finnian's favour, reportedly saying "[t]o every cow its calf and to every book its copy." Columba sought support from his kinsmen among the [[Cenél Conaill]] and the [[Cenél nEógain]] of the northern Uí Néill who went to war with Diarmait. This is a late tradition, and annalistic accounts claim that the battle was fought over Diarmait's killing of Diarmait of Curnán, son of [[Áed mac Echach]] (d.575), the [[King of Connacht]] who was under Columba's protection.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 95. A recent work on the battle is Brian Lacey, "The battle of Cúl Dreimne – a reassessment" in the ''Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland'', volume 133 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this defeat, Diarmait lost the battle of Cúil Uinsen to Áed mac Brénainn, king of Tethbae in [[Leinster]]. Diarmait played no part in the great Uí Néill victory over the [[Cruthin]] at Móin Daire Lothair in 563. He was killed in 565, probably at Ráith Bec in Mag Line (Moylinny, near [[Larne]]) in [[Ulster]] by [[Áed Dub mac Suibni]], king of the Cruthin.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the later Irish historians, Diarmait was followed as King of Tara by Domnall Ilchegalch and Forguss, sons of Muirchertach mac Ercae, of the Cenél nEógain. More contemporary sources suggest that the Kingship of Tara all but disappeared in the years following Diarmait's death, and that it was not until the time of [[Domnall mac Áedo]], or perhaps of [[Fiachnae mac Báetáin]], that there was a High King of Ireland again.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 104&amp;ndash;105 &amp; 276&amp;ndash;277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saints and Druids==
[[Adomnán of Iona]], writing less than 150 years after Diarmait's death, describes him as "ordained by God's will as king of all Ireland." Given that the annals say that Diarmait celebrated the Feast of Tara, the pagan inauguration ceremony, Adomnán's words represent his view of kingship rather than the reality of Diarmait's life.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnán, I, 36 and editor's note 157; Byrne, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Most traditions portray Diarmait as in conflict with saints and holy men, notably Columba. A later poet has Diarmait say "Woe to him that contends with the clergy of the churches".&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 95&amp;ndash;96. The poem is in the [[Book of Leinster]] and is available [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G800011C/text025.html here] at CELT. No translation is presently available.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[{Swim Two Birds]]--&gt;

A poem, ''Mairg thochras fri cléirchib cell'' ("Woe to him who contends with the clergy of the churches") in the Book of Leinster, is ascribed to Diarmait.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic Death of Diarmait==
Supernatural features in Diarmait's reign are not limited to prose and verse works or to lives of saints. Even the [[Irish annals]] include a reference to [[druid]] fences being created at the battle of Cúl Dreimne. The main subject for later writers and poets however, was not Diarmait's life but his death.

Diarmait is told by [[Bec mac Dé]] that [[Áed Dub mac Suibni|Áed Dub]] , Diarmait's foster-son, will be his killer. Accordingly, Diarmait banishes Áed Dub.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnán, I, 36, places Áed's exile after the killing of Diarmait.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Ruadán]] gives the prophecy that Diarmait will be killed by the roof-beam of his hall at Tara. Diarmait has the beam cast into the sea. Diarmait then asks his druids to find the manner of his death, and they foretell that he will die a [[threefold death]], by slaughter, drowning and burning, and that the signs of his death will be a shirt grown from a single seed of flax, a mantle made of wool from a single sheep, ale brewed from one seed of corn, and bacon from a sow which has never farrowed.  On a circuit of Ireland, Diarmait comes to the hall of Banbán at Ráith Bec, and there the fate of which he was warned comes to pass. The roof beam of Tara has been recovered from the sea by Banbán and set in his hall, the shirt and mantle and ale and bacon are duly produced for Diarmait. Diarmait goes to leave Banbán's hall, but Áed Dub, waiting at the door, strikes him down and sets fire to the hall. Diarmait crawls into an ale vat to escape the flames and is duly killed by the falling roof beam. Thus, all the prophecies are fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 97&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like tales are told of Muirchertach mac Ercae and Adomnán records that Columba prophesied a similar death, by wounding, falling and drowning, for Áed Dub.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100; Adomnán, I, 36; Ó Cróinín, pp. 64&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''escort agency''' is a company that provides [[call girl|escorts]] for clients, usually for [[sexual services]]. The agency typically arranges a meeting between one of its escorts and the client at the customer's house or hotel room (outcall), or at the escort's residence (incall). Some agencies also provide escorts for longer durations, who may stay with the client or travel along on a holiday or business trip.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20041018164614/http://indiadaily.com/editorial/10-18f-04.asp Camera catches Bollywood’s biggest business boom – Adult escort services and Adult travel agencies!]'' - [[India Daily]], Thursday 18 October 2004. Retrieved September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While the escort agency is paid a fee for this booking and dispatch service, the customer must negotiate any additional fees or arrangements directly with the escort for any other services that are not provided by the agency involved, such as providing sexual services (regardless of the legality of these services).

==Business model==
Escort agencies claim that they are dispatching these individuals to provide a social or conversational service rather than a sexual service, since [[prostitution laws]] often forbid taking payment for sex or communicating for the purpose of arranging a contract for sexual services. [[Advertisements]] for escort agencies often carefully skirt the legal line, and avoid specifically offering [[prostitution]] or sexual services. This fact in turn is well-known to police and the political powers, who, [[prostitution by country|where prostitution is illegal]], usually prefer to act against more visible and problematic [[street prostitution]]. This has been criticized as hypocrisy, especially where governments license and tax the escort agencies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.missingpeople.net/how_cities_'license'_off-street_hookers-june_16,_2002.htm How cities 'license' off-street hookers]'' - originally from ''The Ottawa Citizen'', Sunday 16 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, there almost certainly do exist agencies that do go by these laws and do not facilitate prostitution. Some countries have used a two-pronged approach of criminalizing street prostitution but permitting or licensing prostitution in [[brothels]] or via escort agencies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/sdavis.html#fraser Prostitution in Canada: The Invisible Menace or the Menace of Invisibility?]'' -  Davis, Sylvia; research paper, last modified Saturday 14 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruiting===
Escort agencies often recruit individuals to work as escorts by placing employment advertisements in a magazine or newspaper. Escort agencies typically maintain a list of escorts of different ages and appearances to cater to the varying interests of clients. Some agencies may specifically deal in a certain type of escort. There are male-for-male, female-for-male, and female-for-female escort agencies, as well as a few male-for-female agencies. Agencies commonly specialize in only one sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/escort-agencies-luring-students-into-prostitution-to-pay-for-college-26318574.html |title=Escort agencies luring students into prostitution to pay for college|work=independent.ie|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transsexual or transgender escorts are available from some escort agencies.

It is very common for escorts to enter the business through referrals from friends who have been in the business. The effectiveness of ads in [[Weekly newspaper|weeklies]] or specialized sites has been questioned by some operators as there are so many that they are diluted. Typically, an escort will interview with an agency.

===Advertising===
Once an agency decides to hire an escort, she or he will provide photographs or pose for a photographer. These pictures are posted on the agency's website or circulated among clients to promote business.

Some larger escort agencies maintain websites with photo galleries of their escorts. Clients contact agencies by telephone and offer a description of what kind of escorts are sought. The agency will then suggest an escort who might fit that client's need.

The agency collects the client's contact information and calls the escort. Usually, to protect the identity of the escort and ensure effective communication with the client, the agency arranges the appointment. Sometimes, it may be up to the escort to contact the client directly to make arrangements for the location and time of an appointment. Generally, the escort is also expected to call the agency upon arrival at the location and upon leaving, to ensure the safety of the escort.

==Legal considerations==
The [[arm's length]] relationship between the escort and the escort agency is designed to protect the escort agency (to some degree) from prosecution for breaking [[laws against prostitution]]. If the employee is solely responsible for arranging any illegal prostitution-oriented activities, the agency can maintain [[plausible deniability]] should an arrest be made.

Escort services aim to provide an experience that allows the operators to claim that whatever happens between the escort and the client is consensual. Operators tend to avoid discussing specifics over the telephone or via emails to avoid complications with the law.

===India===
[[Prostitution in India]] is legal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/debates/south_asian_debates/1459792.stm|title= Prostitution: should the laws be changed?|date= 2001-08-03|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of related activities, including owning or managing a [[brothel]], [[pimp]]ing and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pandering]], are crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/sca/119134.htm|title=2008 Human Rights Reports: India|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}

In 2010, Mexico Legislators added a law similar to that of the UK called the Anti Trafficking in Persons Act (rough translation) which makes it a crime to offer the sexual services of another person against their will. The law is still broadly interpreted and has many websites who offered the services of escorts running for cover and even newspapers like El Universal stopped taking classified ads for escorts or "executive massages" because of the law which also goes after anyone promoting the trafficking of persons. The legislator, who is spearheading the campaign here has filed a lawsuit against the newspaper ''[[Reforma]]'' because they have not stopped taking the classified ads for these services, but have instead put in place a mandatory presentation of official identification of the person placing the ad and the signing of a waiver stating that they are placing the ad on their own behalf and releasing the  newspaper from anything that may come from the services offered.

Most recently, the legislature in Mexico has modified the law to close some loop holes or grey areas and are like the United States zooming in on the "End User" or client.  The new law now encompasses penalties of 7 to 9 years in prison for contracting an escort, 7 – 9 years in prison for transporting an escort to her appointment and now the most broad addition like in the United States, "facilitation" of any person, persons or company that promotes or services of an escort whether a newspaper, internet ad or website is subject to 9 to 11 years in prison, which grows to a maximum of 23 years if the offending person is a public servant of any kind.

Escort prostitution is one of the forms that the sex trade takes in the United Kingdom, along with prostitution practiced in [[massage parlors]], saunas, private flats (such as the [[Soho walk-up]]s) and street prostitution. Working as an outcall escort is not an offence, and neither is working as a prostitute in private. However, under the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]] it is a criminal offence to pay for services of a prostitute who is controlled for gain if any third party uses force, threat (whether or not relating to violence) or any other form of coercion. In 2015 the [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] set up a dedicated “adult entertainment task force” to collect unpaid income tax from, among others, online escort agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Collinson |first= Patrick |date=4 December 2015 |title=Strippers told to bare all about tax affairs under HMRC crackdown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/04/adult-entertainment-taskforce-tax-fraud-strip-clubs |newspaper=The Guardian |location= |access-date=9 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial considerations==
The amount of money that is made by an escort varies with many factors, such as sexual attractiveness, competition from legal and illegal sources, and the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to be paid to the agency. Typically, an agency will charge their escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the pre-arranged rate. According to police in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada, the high fees charged by escort agencies may make escorting less lucrative than street prostitution, especially as agencies often also deduct the license fees directly from the earnings.&lt;ref name="Uni"&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040814080018/http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/8635 Escort agency hiring at U of C]'' - ''Gauntlet'', [[University of Calgary]], Thursday 10 October 2002. Retrieved September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent escorts may have differing fees depending on the season, or whether the client is a regular or semi-regular customer. Independent escorts may tend to see clients for extended meetings involving dinner or social activities whereas agency escorts tend to be split into two categories: Cheaper services, especially if mainly based around incall appointments (client visiting the escort at her accommodation), often only provide sexual services, while agencies that provide mainly outcall appointments (the escort visiting the client at either their home or hotel) tend to offer services similar to that of independent escorts.

In New York City, escort services charge anywhere from $200 to $1500 or more per hour.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The industry standard for dividing the money is 50% to the escort, 40% to the agency, and 10% to the booker (a kind of sales representative). Given the level of business can vary week to week, it is not uncommon for escorts to be featured by more than one agency provided they are operated by the same ownership group.

==Statistics==
A 2005 government survey in [[Prostitution in New Zealand|New Zealand]] ([[Prostitution in New Zealand|where prostitution was regulated]] and for the most part legalized in 2003), estimated that of the 6,000 prostitutes surveyed, around 20% worked for escort agencies.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10121228"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10121228 |title=Snapshot of sex industry finds 6000 prostitutes |date=19 April 2005 |agency=[[NZPA]] |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7463">{{Confuse|Folk etymology}}
A '''false etymology''' ('''popular etymology''', '''etymythology''',&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-1403917232}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''pseudo-etymology''', or '''par(a)etymology'''), sometimes called '''folk etymology''' – although the last term is also [[folk etymology|a technical term in linguistics]] – is a popularly held but false belief about the origin or derivation of a specific word.

Such [[etymology|etymologies]] often have the feel of [[urban legend]]s, and can be much more colorful and fanciful than the typical etymologies found in dictionaries, often involving stories of unusual practices in particular subcultures (e.g. Oxford students from non-noble families being supposedly forced to write ''sine nobilitate'' by their name, soon abbreviated to ''s.nob.'', hence the word ''[[Wikt:snob|snob]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/22147/etymology-of-snob |title=nouns – Etymology of "snob" – English Language &amp; Usage Stack Exchange |publisher=English.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-origin-of-the-word-snob |title=What is the origin of the word 'snob'? – Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date=2013-08-21 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recent examples are "backronyms" ([[acronym]]s made up to explain a term), as in ''snob'', and ''posh'' for "port outward, starboard homeward"; many other sourced examples are listed in the article on [[backronym]]s.

==Source and influence of false etymologies==
Erroneous etymologies can exist for many reasons.  Some are reasonable interpretations of the evidence that happen to be false.  For a given word there may often have been many serious attempts by scholars to propose etymologies based on the best information available at the time, and these can be later modified or rejected as linguistic scholarship advances.  The results of [[medieval etymology]], for example, were plausible given the insights available at the time, but have often been rejected by modern linguists.  The etymologies of [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars in the early modern period began to produce more reliable results, but many of their hypotheses have also been superseded.

Other false etymologies are the result of specious and untrustworthy claims made by individuals, such as the unfounded claims made by [[Daniel Cassidy]] that hundreds of common English words such as ''baloney'', ''grumble'', and ''bunkum'' derive from the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zwicky |first=Arnold |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005098.html |title=Language Log: Gullibility in high places |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman |first=Mark |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003326.html |title=Language Log: The bunkum of "The Bunkum of Bunkum"? |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with urban legends==
Some etymologies are part of [[urban legend]]s, and seem to respond to a general taste for the surprising, counter-intuitive and even scandalous. One common example has to do with the phrase ''[[rule of thumb]]'', meaning "a rough guideline". An urban legend has it that the phrase refers to an old English law under which a man could legally beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb.&lt;ref name=thumb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-rul1.htm |title=World Wide Words: Rule of thumb |publisher=Quinion.com |date=1999-11-13 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Centuries ago, under common law a man might chastise his wife in moderation, as he might a servant or child.  In 1782 Judge [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Buller]] appears to have codified this as a thin stick: chastisement compared to bludgeoning.&lt;ref name=thumb /&gt;}}

In the [[United States]], some of these scandalous legends have had to do with [[racism]] and [[slavery]]; common words such as ''picnic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/picnic.htm |title=Picnic Pique |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=5 March 2018|date=21 January 2017|last= Mikkelson|first =David}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''buck'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/buck.htm |title=Etymology on the phrase 'passing the buck' |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''crowbar''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/crowbar.asp |title=Etymology of Crowbar |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been alleged to stem from derogatory terms or racist practices. The "discovery" of these alleged etymologies is often believed by those who circulate them to draw attention to racist attitudes embedded in ordinary discourse. On one occasion, the use of the word ''[[Controversies about the word "niggardly"|niggardly]]'' led to the resignation of a US public official because it sounded similar to the unrelated word ''[[nigger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mniggard.html |title=Is "niggardly" a racist word? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2000-01-03 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivational-Only Popular Etymology (DOPE) versus Generative Popular Etymology (GPE)==

[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] proposes a clear-cut distinction between '''Derivational-Only Popular Etymology (DOPE)''' and '''Generative Popular Etymology (GPE)''':&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"/&gt;

* "DOPE consists of etymological reanalysis of a pre-existent lexical item [...] The DOPE producer is applying his/her '''Apollonian Tendency''', the wish to describe and create order, especially with unfamiliar information or new experience [...], the craving for meaningfulness."&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"/&gt; DOPE is "merely passive", "mistaken derivation, where there is a rationalization ''ex postfacto''."&lt;ref name="Zuckerman2003"/&gt;
* GPE, on the other hand, involves the introduction of a new sense (meaning) or a new lexical item – see, for example, [[Phono-semantic matching]].

'''Faux bois''' (from the French for ''false wood'') refers to the artistic imitation of wood or wood grains in various media. The craft has roots in the [[Renaissance]] with [[trompe-l'œil]]. It was probably first crafted with concrete using an iron [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] by garden craftsmen in France called "[[rocailleur]]s" using common iron materials: rods, barrel bands, and [[chicken wire]]. 

Early examples of the craft survive at [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]] opened for an exposition in Paris in 1867. In 1873, the inventor of [[ferrocement]], [[Joseph Monier]] expanded his patents to include bridges. He designed the first bridge of [[reinforced concrete]], crossing the [[moat]] at the Chateau Chazelet, in France. It was sculpted to resemble timbers and logs. &lt;ref name="light"&gt;Light, Patsy Pittman (2005). ''Capturing Nature: the Cement Sculpture of Dionicio Rodriguez''. Texas A&amp;M University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrocement faux bois uses a combination of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[grout]] applied to a steel frame or armature to sculpt lifelike representations of wooden objects. Final sculpting can be done while the mixture is wet, in a putty state, or slightly stiff.  Techniques vary among artisans.  Most popular in the late 19th century through the 1940s, ferrocement faux bois has largely disappeared with the passing of those most expert in its practice. What few objects remain from that peak period (mostly in the form of garden art, such as planters and birdbaths) are now highly prized by collectors.

In Mexico and Texas, this style is sometimes known as "el trabajo rústico" (''the rustic work''). It is often characterized by a more realistic look in both composition and coloring, as well as a more finely detailed finish than comparable European work. One highly regarded artist who worked in this style was [[Dionicio Rodriguez]], a Mexican who relocated to Texas in the early 1920s. Although Rodriguez is not widely known, his large-scale faux bois installations have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="light" /&gt; Dionicio's great-nephew is one of the handful of artists still creating faux bois today.

[[Image:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 47.jpg|right|thumb|Byron in the 1870s]]
'''Henry James Byron''' (8 January 1835 – 11 April 1884) was a prolific English dramatist, as well as an editor, journalist, director, theatre manager, novelist and actor.

After an abortive start at a medical career, Byron struggled as a provincial actor and aspiring playwright in the 1850s.  Returning to London and beginning to study for the [[Bar examination|Bar]], he finally found playwriting success in [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and other punny plays.  In the 1860s, he became an editor of humorous magazines and a noted man-about-town, while continuing to build his playwriting reputation, notably as co-manager, with [[Marie Wilton]], of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  In 1869, he returned to the stage as an actor and, during the same period, wrote numerous successful plays, including the historic international success, ''[[Our Boys]]''.  In his last years, he grew frail from [[tuberculosis]] and died at the age of 49.

==Biography==
Byron was born in [[Manchester]], England, the son of Henry Byron (1804–1884, second cousin to the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and descendant of many Lord Byrons), at one time British consul in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and Elizabeth Josephine ''née'' Bradley.  He was educated in [[Essex]] and then at St. Peter's Collegiate School in [[Eaton Square]], London.  Although his mother wanted him to pursue a career in the Navy, Byron did not do so.  Instead, he first became a physician's clerk in London for four years and then studied medicine with his grandfather, Dr. James Byron Bradley, in [[Buxton]].  Byron married Martha Foulkes (1831–1876) in London in 1856.  He entered the [[Middle Temple]] as a student briefly in 1858, but he had already begun writing for the stage and soon returned to that vocation.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Thomson, Peter. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4280 "Byron, Henry James (1835–1884)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 19 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Byron-jack-the-giant-killer.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for Byron's 1859–60 pantomime, ''Jack the Giant Killer'']]
Byron joined several provincial companies as an actor from 1853–57, sometimes in his own plays and sometimes in those of [[T. W. Robertson]] (with whom he acted and starved) or others, but had little success.  He described his early attempts at acting, and the hardships of the journeyman touring actor, in an 1873 essay for ''The Era Almanack and Annual'' called "Eighteen Parts a Week".  He began writing [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] of melodramas and [[extravaganza]]s in the mid-1850s.  In 1857, his burlesque of ''Richard of the Lion Heart'' premièred at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]].  His successful works in 1858 included ''The Lady of Lyons, or, Twopenny Pride and Pennytence'' and ''Fra Diavolo Travestie; or, The Prince, the Pirate and the Pearl'', also at the Strand, which later played in New York.  This was so well received that Byron abandoned the law to concentrate full-time on theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another successful Strand burlesque in 1858 was ''The Maid and the Magpie; or, The Fatal Spoon'' an early play to include a dance at the end of a song.  This starred [[Marie Wilton]] as Pippo and was also revived in New York.  In 1859, he wrote another successful burlesque, ''The Babes in the Wood and the Good Little Fairy Birds''.  He soon wrote other burlesques for the Strand, the [[Olympic Theatre]], and the [[Adelphi Theatre]], as well as a sequence of Christmas [[pantomime]]s for the [[Princess's Theatre]], beginning in 1859 with ''Jack the Giant Killer, or, Harlequin, King Arthur, and ye Knights of ye Round Table''&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Amy Wai Sum. [http://whaleyween.com/Holly/DLB344_19thC_BritishDramatists/Byron.pdf "Henry J. Byron"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hong Kong Baptist University&lt;/ref&gt; and followed the next year by ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday and the King of the Caribee Islands!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script for ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday'']{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1860)&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron also wrote for periodicals, and in 1861, he became the first editor of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine, where he showcased the comic talents of the then-unknown [[W. S. Gilbert]].  He became editor of ''Comic News'' in 1863.  He also founded the short-lived ''Comic Trials'' and wrote a [[three-volume novel]], ''Paid in Full'', in 1865.  In 1867, he became the editor of ''Wag'', another humour magazine.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; He wrote numerous dramatic critiques and humorous essays for magazines, including the rival of ''Fun'', ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 14 April 1884, p. 7, col. C&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he was a well-known man-about-town, joining, and popular as a guest at, various London dining clubs and, in 1863, becoming a founding member of the Arundel Club.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; [[Henry Morley]] acknowledged with dismay Byron's position in the literary world as chief punster but found in him "a true power of fun that makes itself felt by high and low".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of a London Playgoer'', 1866, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Member of the Dramatic Authors' Society by 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script of Byron's ''Robinson Crusoe; or, Harlequin Friday'' (1860)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, he continued writing for the Strand, the Adelphi, the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and the Princess's, among other London theatres.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Among Byron's dozens of plays in the early 1860s, his early successes were mostly burlesques, such as ''Bluebeard from a New Point of Hue'' (1860); ''Cinderella'' (1860); ''Aladdin, or, The Wonderful Scamp'' (1861);&lt;ref&gt;Byron's 1861 ''Aladdin'' featured the début of the [[pantomime]] character, [[Widow Twankey]], first played by James Rogers.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Esmeralda, or, The Sensation Goat'' (1861), all in rhymed couplets.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Jane. [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=23619681# ''W.S. Gilbert: A Classic Victorian and His Theatre''], Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Another success was ''George de Barnwell; or Harlequin Folly in the Realms of Fancy'' (1862).  Several of these early plays were revived in Britain and received New York productions.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

[[File:Dearer Than Life.jpg|thumb|left|350px|1868 production of ''Dearer Than Life'' showing seated l. to r. [[J.L. Toole|Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]] and [[Henry Irving|Irving]]]]
Between 1865 and 1867, he joined [[Marie Wilton]], whom he had met through his early work at the Strand, in the management of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  She provided the capital, and he was to write the plays.  His first was a burlesque of ''[[La sonnambula]]''.  However, Wilton wanted to present more sophisticated pieces. She agreed to produce three more burlesques by Byron, but he agreed to write his first prose comedies, ''War to the Knife'' (a success in 1865) and ''A Hundred Thousand Pounds'' (1866).  They also staged one of T. W. Robertson's biggest successes, ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', in 1865.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Upon his severing the partnership and starting theatre management on his own account in the provinces, he lost money, ending up in bankruptcy court in 1868.  However, he produced many of his plays at these theatres while continuing to write for London theatres.  One successful provincial work was ''Dearer than Life'' (1867), which received many revivals, beginning with a London revival in 1868 starring [[J. L. Toole]] and the young [[Henry Irving]].  Another, the same year, was ''The Lancashire Lass; or, Tempted, Tried and True'' (1867), a melodrama, also revived in London in 1868.  He even collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on ''Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife'', which played in 1867 at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

===Return to acting and later years===
He returned to acting, making his London acting début, in 1869, achieving much greater success than in his early attempts, as Sir Simon Simple in his comedy ''Not Such a Fool as He Looks''.&lt;ref name=utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289–301, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with successful outings as Fitzaltamont in ''The Prompter's Box: A Story of the Footlights and the Fireside'' (1870), ''The Prompter's Box'' (1870, revived in 1875 and often thereafter, and later renamed ''The Crushed Tragedian''), Captain Craven in ''Daisy Farm'' (1871) and Lionel Leveret in ''Old Soldiers'' (1873).  Byron's acting was again admired in ''An American Lady'' in 1874, with which he began as the manager of the [[Criterion Theatre]], and then ''Married in Haste'' (1875) which was much revived.  In 1886, he played in his ''The Bull by the Horns'' and ''Old Chums''.  Other roles included Dick Simpson in ''Conscience Money'' (1878), Charles Chuckles in his ''An English Gentleman'' (1879) and John Blunt in his ''Michael Strogoff'' (1881).&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; In 1881, he played the role of Cheviot Hill in a revival of his friend Gilbert's eccentric comedy, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]''.&lt;ref name=utility/&gt; He continued acting until 1882, when ill health forced him to retire.  Not surprisingly, Byron achieved his greatest acting successes in timing of the delivery of his own witty lines.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  ''The Times'' explained that "in such parts as Gibson Greene in ''Married in Haste'', a self-possessed, observant, satirical, well-bred man of the world, [Byron] was beyond the reach of rivalry.  To ease and grace of manner he united a peculiar aptitude for the delivery of the good things he put into his own mouth."&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

[[File:Ourboys2a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Our Boys'', 1875]]
Byron continued to write prose comedies with the ambitious semi-autobiographical ''Cyril's Success'' (1868), ''The Upper Crust'' (starring Toole), ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' (1870, starring Henry Irving), ''An English Gentleman'' (1871, starring [[Edward Sothern]]),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1871, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''Weak Woman'' (1875, starring [[Marion Terry]]), and his greatest success, ''[[Our Boys]]'' (1875–79, [[Vaudeville Theatre]]).&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; With 1,362 performances in its original production, ''Our Boys'' set the record for the longest-running play in history and held it for almost two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. Review of plays by H. J. Byron including ''Our Boys'' in ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 82, No. 3, pp. 716-17, July 1987, Modern Humanities Research Association&lt;/ref&gt; It was also much revived, especially in America.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; From 1876 to 1879, he wrote several successful burlesques for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], such as a burlesque of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''Don Caesar de Bazan'' called ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Information about ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'' and the Gaiety Theatre] at VictorianWeb.org&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Gaiety Gulliver'' (1879).  Also during that period, he edited the humour magazine ''Mirth''.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; In 1878, he co-wrote a highly successful charity pantomime, ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'', together with [[Robert Reece]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[F. C. Burnand]]. In 1880, four volumes of his plays were published, with fourteen plays in each book.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Henry James. "Plays Volumes One to Four", Samuel French &amp; Thomas Lacy (1880)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1880, as his health greatly declined, so did Byron's playwriting output.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

Byron is described by Jim Davis in the introduction to his 1984 collection, ''Plays by H. J. Byron'', as the most prolific playwright of the mid-Victorian period, as he produced over 150 dramatic pieces.  ''The Times'' called Byron a master of "genial wit and humour".&lt;ref&gt;"Funeral of the Late Mr. H. J. Byron", ''The Times'', '18 April 1884, p. 10, col. C&lt;/ref&gt; It also commented that "The secret of his success... lay chiefly in his dialogue, which is seldom otherwise than neat, pointed and amusing.  He fires verbal shots in such rapid succession that one laugh has scarcely died away when another is raised.  In the delineation of character, too, he is often extremely happy".&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

By 1874, he was showing symptoms of [[tuberculosis]], which caused his retirement in 1882. His first wife died in 1876 at the age of 45, and the same year he remarried Eleanor Mary ''née'' Joy, the daughter of Edward Joy, a lawyer.  His son Henry and daughter Crede (a pun on ''Crede Byron'', the Byron family motto) also became actors, and he had another son.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

During the last few years of his life Byron was in frail health, and he died at his home in [[Clapham]], London, England, in 1884 at the age of 49. He is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

The '''Herodotus Machine''' was a machine described by [[Herodotus]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] born in [[Halicarnassus]], [[Caria]] (modern-day [[Bodrum]], [[Turkey]]). Herodotus claims this invention enabled the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians to construct the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]. The contraption supposedly allowed workers to lift heavy building materials. Herodotus is believed to have encountered the device while traveling through Egypt. With limited reference and no true schematics, this machine has stimulated many historians' theories of how the Ancient Egyptians were able to create pyramids.

==Herodotus in Egypt==

Herodotus is suspected of having [[Herodotus#Reliability|embellished &amp;ndash; or made up entirely &amp;ndash;]] some of his historical accounts, but scholars generally accept this particular account as Herodotus provides otherwise reasonable accounts of Egypt and it would have been quite possible for someone living in [[Parnassus]] to safely and easily travel to Egypt during Herodotus' lifetime. Trade existed between the Greek City States and the kingdom of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Homan|first1=Michael|title=Beer and Its Drinkers: An Ancient near Eastern Love Story|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|volume=67|issue=2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus#Reliability|In Egypt]] Herodotus is thought to have conversed with locals on the matter.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;Herodotus, Robin Waterfield, and Carolyn Dewald. ''The Histories''. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herodotus' description===

Herodotus provides a description of the process in [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]].

{{quotation|The pyramid was built in steps, battlement-wise, as it is called, or, according to others, altar-wise. After laying the stones for the base, they raised the remaining stones to their places by means of machines formed of short wooden planks. The first machine raised them from the ground to the top of the first step. On this there was another machine, which received the stone upon its arrival and conveyed it to the second step, whence a third machine advanced it still higher. Either they had as many machines as there were steps in the pyramid, or possibly they had but a single machine, which, being easily moved, was transferred from tier to tier as the stone rose — both accounts are given and therefore I mention both. The upper portion of the Pyramid was finished first, then the middle and finally the part which was lowest and nearest to the ground}}

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] is believed to have sketched a machine based on Herodotus' description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renouveau-democratie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Brochure-Bruxelles-240314-LR1.pdf|title=Niccolai, Gabriele. Leonardo da Vinci a Genius and His Secrets|publisher=European Commission Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later depictions are premised upon da Vinci's sketches in the ''[[Codex Madrid (Leonardo)|Codex Madrid]]''. Visual depictions cannot authoritatively claim to represent Herodotus' machine. Some scholars argue that da Vinci may have had access to ancient texts, since lost, that provided additional details.

Since Herodotus provides more of a description of the components of the design rather than detailed form or usage, many ideas have been put forward and scale models built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.great-pyramid-building.com/machine-of-herodotus.htm|title=CHEOPSPYRAMIDE - gebaut mit den eigenen Barken}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egyptianpyramidsecrets.blogspot.it/|title=Herodotus' machine - building pyramids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Joachim Winckelmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|ŋ|k|əl|ˌ|m|ɑː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/winckelmann "Winckelmann"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈvɪŋkl̩man|lang}}; 9 December 1717 – 8 June 1768) was a [[Germany|German]] [[art historian]] and [[archaeologist]].&lt;ref&gt;The biography in English is a popular account, Wolfgang Leppmann, ''Winckelmann'' (London) 1971; David Irwin offers a brief account to introduce his volume of selected writings, ''Winckelmann: Writings on Art'' (London: Phaidon) 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pioneering [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenist]] who first articulated the difference between Greek, Greco-Roman and Roman art.  "The prophet and founding hero of [[modern archaeology]]",&lt;ref name=b584&gt;[[#Boorstin|Boorstin]], 584&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the [[history of art]]. Many consider him the father of the discipline of [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Walter |title=Instant Art History |date=February 1995 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=0-449-90698-1 |page=240 |chapter=Introduction |quote=The father of official art history was a German named Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–68).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first to separate Greek Art into periods, and time classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59818023|title=History of the art of antiquity|last=1717-1768.|first=Winckelmann, Johann Joachim,|date=2006|publisher=Getty Research Institute|others=Potts, Alex.|isbn=9780892366682|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|oclc=59818023}}&lt;/ref&gt; His would be the decisive influence on the rise of the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] movement during the late 18th century. His writings influenced not only a new science of archaeology and art history but Western painting, sculpture, literature and even philosophy. Winckelmann's ''History of Ancient Art'' (1764) was one of the first books written in German to become a classic of European literature.  His subsequent influence on [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Stefan George|George]], and [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]] has been provocatively called "the Tyranny of Greece over Germany."&lt;ref&gt;[[E. M. Butler|Butler, Eliza M.]] (1935). ''The Tyranny of Greece over Germany''. Cambridge Univ. Press, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]'s Winckelmann Institute is dedicated to the study of classical archaeology.

Winckelmann was homosexual, and open [[homoeroticism]] informed his writings on aesthetics. This was recognized by his contemporaries, such as Goethe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuzniar|first=Alice A.|title=Outing Goethe and His Age|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|isbn=0804726140|pages=9–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geXxdlFrgGkC&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Alice A. Kuzniar|accessdate=May 23, 2013|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Winckelmann was born in poverty in [[Stendal]] in the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. His father, Martin Winckelmann, worked as a cobbler, while his mother, Anna Maria Meyer, was the daughter of a weaver. Winckelmann's early years were full of hardship, but his academic interests pushed him forward. Later in Rome, when he had become a famous scholar, he wrote: "One gets spoiled here; but God owed me this; in my youth I suffered too much."

Winckelmann attended the Köllnisches Gymnasium in [[Berlin]] and the Altstädtisches Gymnasium at [[Salzwedel]], and in 1738, at age 21, went as a student of theology to the [[University of Halle]]. However, Winckelmann was no theologian; he had become interested in Greek classics in his youth, but soon realized that the teachers in Halle could not satisfy his intellectual interests in this field. He nonetheless devoted himself privately to [[Greeks|Greek]] art and literature and followed the lectures of [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], who coined the term "[[aesthetics]]".{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

With the intention of becoming a physician, in 1740 Winckelmann attended medical classes at [[university of Jena|Jena]]. He also taught languages. From 1743 to 1748, he was the deputy headmaster of the gymnasium of [[Seehausen, Altmark|Seehausen]] in the [[Altmark]] but Winckelmann felt that work with children was not his true calling. Moreover, his means were insufficient: his salary was so low that he had to rely on his students' parents for free meals. He was thus obliged to accept a tutorship near [[Magdeburg]]. While tutor for the powerful Lamprecht family, he fell into unrequited love with the handsome Lamprecht son.&lt;ref name=b584/&gt;  This was one of a series of such loves throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Boorstin 1983"&gt;[[#Boorstin|Boorstin]]&lt;/ref&gt;  His enthusiasm for the male form excited Winckelmann's budding admiration of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.&lt;ref name="Boorstin 1983"/&gt;

===Von Bünau's librarian===
In 1748, Winckelmann wrote to [[Heinrich von Bünau|Count Heinrich von Bünau]]: "... little value is set on Greek literature, to which I have devoted myself so far as I could penetrate, when good books are so scarce and expensive". In the same year, Winckelmann was appointed secretary of von Bünau's library at Nöthnitz, near [[Dresden]]. The library contained some 40,000 volumes. Winckelmann had read [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]], [[Sophocles]], [[Xenophon]], and [[Plato]], but he found at Nöthnitz the works of such famous [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers as [[Voltaire]] and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]. To leave behind the spartan atmosphere of Prussia came as a great relief for him. Winckelmann's major duty involved assisting von Bünau in writing a book on the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and helping collect material for it. During this period he made several visits to the collection of antiquities at Dresden, but his description of its best paintings remained unfinished. The treasures there, nevertheless, awakened in Winckelmann an intense interest in art, which was deepened by his association with various artists, particularly the painter [[Adam Friedrich Oeser]] (1717–1799)—Goethe's future friend and influence—who encouraged Winckelmann in his aesthetic studies. (Winckelmann subsequently exercised a powerful influence over [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goethe, ''Winkelmann und sein Jahrhundert'', 1805.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, Winckelmann published his ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'' ("Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture"), followed by a feigned attack on the work and a defense of its principles, ostensibly by an impartial critic. The ''Gedanken'' contains the first statement of the doctrines he afterwards developed, the ideal of "noble simplicity and quiet grandeur" (''edle Einfalt und stille Größe'') and the definitive assertion, "[t]he one way for us to become great, perhaps inimitable, is by imitating the ancients". The work won warm admiration not only for the ideas it contained, but for its literary style. It made Winckelmann famous, and was reprinted several times and soon translated into French. In England, Winckelmann's views stirred discussion in the 1760s and 1770s, although it was limited to artistic circles: [[Henry Fuseli]]'s translation of ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks'' was published in 1765, and reprinted with corrections in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000601390&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
In 1751, the papal nuncio and Winckelmann's future employer, [[Alberico Archinto]], visited Nöthnitz, and in 1754 Winckelmann joined the Roman Catholic Church. Goethe concluded that Winckelmann was a pagan, but his conversion ultimately opened the doors of the papal library to him.  On the strength of the ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der Griechischen Werke'', [[Frederick Augustus II of Poland|Augustus III]], king of Poland and elector of Saxony, granted him a pension of 200 [[thaler]]s, so that he could continue his studies in Rome.

Winckelmann arrived in Rome in November 1755. His first task there was to describe the statues in the [[Cortile del Belvedere]]—the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'', the ''[[Laocoön]]'', the so-called ''[[Antinous]]'', and the ''[[Belvedere Torso]]''—which represented to him the "utmost perfection of ancient sculpture."

Originally, Winckelmann planned to stay in Italy only two years with the help of the grant from Dresden, but the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763) changed his plans. He was named librarian to [[Cardinal Passionei]], who was impressed by Winckelmann's beautiful Greek writing. Winckelmann also became librarian to [[Alberico Archinto|Cardinal Archinto]], and received much kindness from Cardinal Passionei. After their deaths, Winckelmann was hired as librarian in the house of [[Alessandro Albani|Alessandro Cardinal Albani]], who was forming his magnificent collection of antiquities in the villa at [[Porta Salaria]].

Winckelmann's method of careful observation allowed him to identify Roman copies of Greek art, something that was unusual at that time—Roman culture was considered the ultimate achievement of Antiquity. His friend Mengs became the channel through which Winckelmann's ideas were realized in art and spread around Europe. ("The only way for us to become great, yes, inimitable, if it is possible, is the imitation of the Greeks," Winckelmann declared in the ''Gedanken''. With imitation he did not mean slavish copying: "... what is imitated, if handled with reason, may assume another nature, as it were, and become one's own"). Neoclassical artists attempted to revive the spirit as well as the forms of ancient Greece and Rome. Mengs's contribution in this was considerable—he was widely regarded as the greatest living painter of his day. The French painter [[Jacques-Louis David]] met Mengs in Rome (1775–80) and was introduced through him to the artistic theories of Winckelmann. Earlier, while in Rome, Winckelmann met the Scottish architect [[Robert Adam]], whom he influenced to become a leading proponent of neoclassicism in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boorstin|Boorstin]], p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;  Winckelmann's ideals were later popularized in England through the reproductions of [[Josiah Wedgwood]]'s "Etruria" factory (1782).&lt;ref name="Boorstin 1983"/&gt;

In 1760, Winckelmann's ''Description des pierres gravées du feu [[Philipp von Stosch|Baron de Stosch]]'' appeared, followed in 1762 by his ''Anmerkungen über die Baukunst der Alten'' ("Observations on the Architecture of the Ancients"), which included an account of the temples at [[Paestum]]. In 1758 and 1762, he visited [[Naples]] to observe the archaeological excavations being conducted at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;"WINCKELMANN, Johann Joachim (1779)" [http://www.horti-hesperidum.com/show.php?item=192 1]

''Taste and the Antique''. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 101. {{ISBN|0300029136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann's poverty may have played a part: the trade in antiquities was an expensive and speculative game. In 1763, with Albani's advocacy, he was appointed [[Pope Clement XIII]]'s Prefect of Antiquities.

From 1763, while retaining his position with Albani, Winckelmann worked as a prefect of antiquities (Prefetto delle Antichità) and scriptor (Scriptor linguae teutonicae) of the Vatican. Winckelmann visited Naples again, in 1765 and 1767, and wrote for the use of the electoral prince and princess of Saxony his ''Briefe an Bianconi'', which were published, eleven years after his death, in the ''Antologia romana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horti-hesperidum.com/show.php?item=202 "Scritti di G.L.

Università degli Studi di Roma “Tor Vergata”, Facoltà di Lettere e Filosofia, Edificio B, IV&lt;/ref&gt;

Winckelmann contributed various essays to the ''Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften''; and, in 1766, published his ''Versuch einer Allegorie''. Of much greater importance was the work entitled ''Monumenti antichi inediti'' ("Unpublished monuments of antiquity", 1767–1768), prefaced by a ''Trattato preliminare'', which presented a general sketch of the history of art. The plates in this work are representations of objects which had either been falsely explained or not explained at all. Winckelmann's explanations were of tremendous use to the future science of archaeology, by showing through observational method that the ultimate sources of inspiration of many works of art supposed to be connected with Roman history were to be found in [[Homer]].

Winckelmann's masterpiece, the ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' ("The History of Art in Antiquity"), published in 1764, was soon recognized as a permanent contribution to European literature. In this work, "Winckelmann's most significant and lasting achievement was to produce a thorough, comprehensive and lucid chronological account of all antique art— including that of the Egyptians and Etruscans."&lt;ref name=Haskell/&gt; This was the first work to define in the art of a civilization an organic growth, maturity, and decline.  Here, it included the revelatory tale told by a civilization's art and artifacts—these, if we look closely, tell us their own story of cultural factors, such as climate, freedom, and craft. Winckelmann sets forth both the history of Greek art ''and of Greece''. He presents a glowing picture of the political, social, and intellectual conditions which he believed tended to foster creative activity in ancient Greece.

The fundamental idea of Winckelmann's artistic theories are that the goal of art is beauty, and that this goal can be attained only when individual and characteristic features are strictly subordinated to an artist's general scheme. The true artist, selecting from nature the phenomena suited to his purpose and combining them through the exercise of his imagination, creates an ideal type in which normal proportions are maintained, and particular parts, such as muscles and veins, are not permitted to break the harmony of the general outlines.

===Death===

In 1768 Winckelmann journeyed north over the Alps, but the Tyrol depressed him and he decided to return to Italy. However, his friend, the sculptor and restorer [[Bartolomeo Cavaceppi]] managed to persuade him to travel to Munich and Vienna, where he was received with honor by [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]. On his way back, he was murdered in [[Trieste]] on 8 June 1768, in a hotel bed by a fellow traveller, a man named Francesco Arcangeli, for medals that Maria Theresa had given him. Arcangeli had thought that he was only "un uomo di poco conto" ("a man of little account"). Arcangeli was executed a month later by [[breaking on the wheel]].

Winckelmann was buried in the churchyard of [[Trieste Cathedral]]. {{ill|Domenico Rossetti De Scander|it}} and {{ill|Cesare Pagnini|it}} documented the last week of Winckelmann's life; {{ill|Heinrich Alexander Stoll|de}} translated the Italian document, the so-called "Mordakte Winckelmann", into German.

==Critical response and influence==
Winckelmann's writings are key to understanding the modern European discovery of: ancient (sometimes idealized) Greece;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philhellenism]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[neoclassicism]]; and the doctrine of art as imitation (''Nachahmung''). The mimetic character of art that imitates but does not simply copy, as Winckelmann restated it,&lt;ref&gt;The earlier conflict posed as an antithesis between imitation and invention, was a major theme in the seventeenth century [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]], which was fought, however, in the field of literature rather than the arts.&lt;/ref&gt; is central to any interpretation of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] classical idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larson, James L. |title=Winckelmann's Essay on Imitation|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=9|issue=3 |year=1976|pages=390–405|jstor=2737517 |doi=10.2307/2737517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann stands at an early stage of the transformation of taste in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, Rudolf (1965) "Imitation, eclecticism, and genius" in Earl R. Wasserman, ed. ''Aspects of the Eighteenth Century''. Baltimore: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winckelmann's study ''Sendschreiben von den Herculanischen Entdeckungen'' ("Letter about the Discoveries at Herculaneum") was published in 1762, and two years later ''Nachrichten von den neuesten Herculanischen Entdeckungen'' ("Report on the Latest Discoveries at Herculaneum"). From these, scholars obtained their first real information about the excavations at Pompeii.

His major work, ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' (1764, "The History of Ancient Art"), deeply influenced contemporary views of the superiority of Greek art. It was translated into French in 1766 and later into English and Italian. Among others, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] based many of the ideas in his 'Laocoon' (1766) on Winckelmann's views on harmony and expression in the visual arts.

In the historical portions of his writings, Winckelmann used not only the works of art he himself had studied but the scattered notices on the subject to be found in ancient writers; and his wide knowledge and active imagination enabled him to offer many fruitful suggestions as to periods about which he had little direct information. To the still existing works of art, he applied a minute empirical scrutiny. Many of his conclusions, based on inadequate evidence of Roman copies, would be modified or reversed by subsequent researchers. Nonetheless, the fervid descriptive enthusiasm of passages in his work, its strong and yet graceful style, and its vivid descriptions of works of art gave it a most immediate appeal. It marked an epoch by indicating the spirit in which the study of Greek art and of ancient civilization should be approached, and the methods by which investigators might hope to attain solid results. To Winckelmann's contemporaries it came as a revelation, and it exercised a profound influence on the best minds of the age. It was read with intense interest by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], who found in the earliest of Winckelmann's works the starting-point for his ''[[Laocoon]]'', and by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Goethe]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;In the English language, translation of Winckelmann's major writings was slow: [[Henry Fuseli]] translated some minor writings, but ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' was not translated into English until 1849 by G. Henry Lodge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], [[Florence]], Italy, and is therefore commonly called “The Uffizi Madonna” among art historians.&lt;ref name="number3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="number4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=number5&gt;{{cite web|title=Madonna with Child and two Angels by Filippo Lippi|url=http://www.uffizi.org/artworks/madonna-with-child-and-two-angels-by-filippo-lippi/|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Filippo Lippi}}

[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi portrait.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|300px|A self-portrait of Fra Filippo Lippi.]]

Fra Filippo was born in 1406 in Florence to a poor family where his father was a butcher. He entered a monastery with his brother at an early age. Later in his life, he was moved to a monastery in [[Prato]], and here fell in love with a nun, Lucrezia Buti, with whom he had two children. He encountered more trouble when his patrons claimed that Fra Filippo did not fulfill his contracts. Fra Filippo’s main patrons were the [[Medicis]].&lt;ref name=hartt /&gt;

==History==
The commission and the exact execution date of the painting are unknown. In 1457, Giovanni de’ Medici wished to gift a panel to the [[King of Naples]] and commissioned Fra Filippo to paint it. Fra Filippo, who was working in Prato at that time, decided to temporarily return to his residence in Florence to work on this project. Fra Filippo wrote letters to Giovanni that show that the painter abandoned the project because of a lack of funding. Although art historian Ulmann believes that Fra Filippo presented the Uffizi Madonna to Giovanni to thank him for acting as an intermediary between him and the King of Naples, Edward C. Strutt states that this belief is incorrect. However, he also states that the Uffizi Madonna was in all probability executed around this time, while Fra Filippo was staying in Florence. This is also demonstrated by the techniques that Fra Filippo used to realize this painting: the blunt execution and the bold colors highlight how the painter was influenced by the technique of [[fresco painting]]. Since he acquired such techniques by working at the [[Prato Cathedral]], long before he moved to Florence, Strutt believes that Fra Filippo must have executed this painting after his time working at the Cathedral.&lt;ref name=number3 /&gt;

The Madonna is traditionally identified with Lucrezia Buti, as for most of Fra Filippo's Madonnas.&lt;ref name=hartt /&gt;&lt;ref name=number5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=number6&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jonathan|title=Madonna With Child and Two Angles, Filippo Lippi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/feb/14/art|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-10-30|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible interpretation of the painting is that the unusual size is perhaps connected to a personal event, such as the birth of his son, [[Filippino Lippi|Filippino]] (1457): however, if Filippino was chosen as model for the angel in the foreground, the panel could be from a date as late as around 1465.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;

An 18th-century inscription in the rear of the panel testifies the presence of the painting  in the [[Medici]] [[Villa del Poggio Imperiale]] at the time. On 13 May 1796 it entered the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Gran Ducal]] collections in Florence, which formed the base of the future Uffizi museum.&lt;ref name=number3 /&gt;

==Description==

[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi - Madonna and Child (detail) - WGA13195.jpg|thumb|250px|Fra Filippo's [[National Gallery of Art]] ''Madonna and Child'', c. 1440, one of the artist's earlier Madonnas.]]

The Uffizi Madonna is associated with the taste of the new age, as the Madonna is “lovelier and more fashionable than any of Filippo’s earlier Madonnas”.&lt;ref name=hartt /&gt;
The group of Madonna and Child is, unusually for the period, placed in front of an open window beyond which is a landscape inspired to [[early Netherlandish painting|Flemish painting]].&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; The Madonna sits on a chair, at the window of a house located on a hilltop, which offers a view of an elaborate landscape of “plains, distant mountains, a city and a bay”. Her eyes are pointed down and her hands are folded in prayers before [[child Jesus]], who is held up to her by two angels. She is wearing an elaborate coiffure with a soft veil and pearls: these elements, along with her costume, represent the elegance of the mid-1400s and were re-used in numerous late 15th century works in Florence.&lt;ref name=hartt /&gt;
Furthermore, as in many [[Renaissance]] paintings, the Madonna’s hair is shaved farther back because, “the forehead [was] an object of special beauty” that resembled “a glowing, beautifully set pearl”.&lt;ref name=hartt /&gt;
[[File:Fra Filippo Lippi - Madonna with the Child and Scenes from the Life of St Anne - WGA13236.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Fra Filippo's ''Madonna with the Child and Scenes from the Life of St Anne'', also known as the ''Pitti tondo''. It is closely related to the Uffizi Madonna.]]

This Madonna resembles other Madonnas from the same artist. For example, it is closely related to Fra Filippo's ''Pitti tondo'' Madonna, but it lacks “the pathetic girlish loveliness” of the ''Pitti tondo'' and rather has “a more womanly and mature type of beauty”.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt;

The angel on the right is one of the most curious parts of the painting: he is looking at the viewer with a “roguish smile, more expressive of mischief than of seraphic perfection”.&lt;ref name=number3 /&gt; His pose does not resemble that of an angel, and he does not seem to be playing his part, rather he seems to be the real child.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt;

==Technique==
The large window placed behind the Madonna helps reducing the gap between the viewer and the figures, which are also very close to the plane to assist in making the viewer feel part of the painting.&lt;ref name=number2 /&gt;

Fra Filippo’s [[fresco]] background from his time in Prato influences this painting from the coloring and the inattention to details. The colors are applied in bold strokes, that almost look independent from each other, which shows that Fra Filippo was “taking very little trouble to ensure harmonious blending of the various tints”, which is a characteristic of frescoes. The composition of the painting is of pyramidal shape, and the foreground and background are arranged in a way that suggest that Fra Filippo was also influenced by the methods of [[Donatello]]’s school.&lt;ref name=number3 /&gt;
[[File:Lippi, banchetto di erode.jpg|thumb|right|upright|350px|''The Feast of Herod'', a fresco by Fra Filippo, part of ''[[Stories of St. Stephen and St. John the Baptist]]'', c. 1452-1465.]]

From his earlier paintings, it is evident that Fra Filippo was influenced by [[Masaccio]].&lt;ref name=number7&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berenson|first1=Bernard|title=The Italian Painters of the Renaissance|date=1959|publisher=The Phaidon Press|location=Cromwell Place, London|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Masaccio’s [[chiaroscuro]] has disappeared in the Uffizi Madonna, and figures are now illuminated by a soft glow with harsh shadows. This greatly reduces the sense of volume that was peculiar in Fra Filippo’s earlier paintings.&lt;ref name=hartt /&gt;

==Symbolism==
This painting contains [[religious symbols]]: there are rocks and the seashore outside the window, which are recurrent themes in Florentine Renaissance paintings. The seashore probably alludes to the Virgin Mary’s title “star of the sea and port of our salvation”, and the rocks allude to the tales of prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]&lt;ref name=hartt /&gt;

==Interpretation==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right

The angel on the right has always been of particular importance to art historians. Marylin Lavin argues that the Uffizi Madonna “should be understood as a representation of the marriage of Christ and the Virgin Mary”. According to Barnaby Nygren, the fact that the Madonna is not holding the child, but rather he is being presented to her argues Lavin’s interpretation. However, [[Bernard Berenson]] argues that “the relationship between bride and groom is not as the Virgin Mary and Christ but rather as the individual devout soul and God”.&lt;ref name=number4 /&gt; Finally, [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] argues that the Madonna is “one of the most beautiful paintings of the Renaissance” and an exemplification of the humanizing of religion that dates back to [[Giotto]]. According to him, Fra Filippo, with this painting, makes the relation between the Madonna and the child that of a real mother and baby.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt;

'''Narrative art''' is [[art]] that tells a [[narrative|story]], either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. Some of the earliest evidence of human art suggests that people told stories with pictures. 

Although there are some common features to all narrative art, different cultures have developed idiosyncratic ways to discern narrative action from pictures. Prior to the advent of literacy most narrative art was done in a simultaneous narrative style with very little overarching organization. Once literacy developed in different parts of the world pictures began to be organized along register lines, like lines on a page, that helped define the direction of the narrative.  This method of linking scenes together led to other ways of telling stories in the 20th century, namely the [[newspaper]], [[comic strip]]s and [[comic book]]s.

In painting in traditional [[Western art]] since the [[Renaissance]], the concept of [[history painting]] covers most narrative scenes.

== History ==
Though it requires sophisticated conventions to make the narrative clear, narrative art occurs very early in the [[history of art]].  A number of reliefs in the [[European Bronze Age]] [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] show monscenic narratives of hunting or battle, the former sometimes indicating the movements of hunter or prey with indications of their tracks in a way similar to modern diagrammatic illustrations.  One of the earliest works of [[Ancient Egyptian art]] is the [[Narmer Palette]] relief in the [[Louvre Museum]], which shows a victory of King [[Narmer]] (c. 31st century BC) in several scenes.

Narrative art was employed extensively in the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]]. Most significantly, the walls of the major Assyrian royal palaces (the Northwest Palace of [[Assurnasirpal II]] at [[Nimrud]],&lt;ref&gt;Budge, E.A.W. 1914. ''Assyrian Sculptures in the British Museum: Reign of Ashur-nasir-pal, 885-860 BC''. London: British Museum.
&lt;/ref&gt; the Central Palace of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] at Nimrud,&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Richard D. &amp; Falkner, M. 1960. ''Assyrian Palace Reliefs and Their Influence on the Sculptures of Babylonia and Persia''. London: Batchworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the Palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Khorsabad]],&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Albenda 1986. ''The palace of Sargon king of Assyria: monumental wall reliefs at Dur-Sharrukin, from original drawings made at the time of their discovery in 1843-1844 by Botta and Flandin''. Paris: Éditions Recherche sur les civilisations.&lt;/ref&gt; the Southwest Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at [[Nineveh]],&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Richard D.; Bleibtreu, Erika; Turner, G. 1998. ''Sculptures from the Southwest Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh''. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and the North Palace of [[Assurbanipal]] at Nineveh&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Barnett 1976. ''Sculptures from the north palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh (668-627 BC).'' London : British Museum Publications Ltd. for the Trustees of the British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;) were lined orthostats sculpted in low relief with scenes depicting the activitives of the king (hunting, battle, and ritual). Sometimes, scenes were also depicted on glazed bricks or wall paintings (e.g. at [[Til Barsip]]). Bronze bands decorating the doors of Assyrian temples and palaces were also sometimes decorated with scenes of the king's activities in narrative style. The most famous of these are the "[[Balawat Gates]]" commissioned by [[Shalmaneser III]] for his palace at [[Balawat]] (ancient Imgur-Enlil);&lt;ref&gt;King, L.W. 1915. ''Bronze Reliefs from the Gates of Shalmaneser, King of Assyria BC 860-825''. London: Trustees of the British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schachner, Andreas 2007. ''Bilder eines Weltreichs: kunst- und kulturgeschichtliche Untersuchungen zu den Verzierungen eines Tores aus Balawat (Imgur-Enlil) aus der Zeit von Salmanassar III, König von Assyrien''. Turnhout: Brepols.&lt;/ref&gt; additional fragmentary bronze gate bands dating to Assurnasirpal II have been found at Balawat,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John &amp; Tallis, Nigel 2008. ''The Balawat Gates of Ashurnasirpal II''. London: British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and very poorly preserved fragments from other sites, such as Khorsabad, Nimrud, [[Assur]], and Tell Hadad.&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, Eleanor 2008. “Bronze reliefs from Khorsabad,” in Biggs, R.D., Myers, J. and Roth, M. (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale Held at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005''. Chicago: University of Chicago, pp. 389-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lives of [[Jesus]] and [[Buddha]], the founders of new religions, their followers, and in the case of Buddha also the [[Jataka|former lives]], were to provide new subject-matter for narrative art, as did elements of older religions such as the [[Labours of Hercules]]. [[Trajan's Column]] is an exceptional example of Imperial Roman narrative art.  In [[Christian art]] the [[Life of Christ in art]] and [[Life of the Virgin]] supplied the most common subjects, based around the incidents celebrated in the major feasts of the [[church calendar]], but the lives of saints gave many others. 

[[Book illustration]]s are found from ancient times in several cultures, and are very often narrative in nature. There appear to have been some lavishly illustrated books in Western [[Late Antiquity]], no doubt belonging to wealthy collectors, including both classic literary texts ([[Vergilius Vaticanus]] and [[Vergilius Romanus]]) and [[Bible|biblical]] texts; the [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]] seems to have had between two and four images facing every text page, and to have been more densely illustrated than any subsequent biblical text in an [[illuminated manuscript]].

Narratives occur in a space and unfold in time. In narrative art, the artist chooses how to portray the story, represent the space, and how to shape time within the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative art can be categorized into various types, also known as modes or styles.  A piece of artwork is not limited to only one type of narrative.  An artwork may have a narrative type as a whole, as well as portions of the artwork itself that depict separate types of narratives. Several of these types are covered below.  A depicted action in itself can suggest a scene or setting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can imagine the Trojan War taking place at Troy without having to depict the actual city of Troy. You can show Achilles dragging Hector’s body around the city of Troy without having to depict the walls of the city. Nonetheless, the idea that each action is limited to a specific place can still pertain, because the Trojan War did take place at Troy and Achilles did drag Hector’s body around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Simultaneous narrative ==
A simultaneous narrative is a type of narrative that has very little visually discernible organization to those who are not acquainted with its purpose.  It can focus on geometric or abstract designs as well as the placement or arrangement of items within the artwork.  Simultaneous narratives concentrate on repeatable patterns and redundant systems with a focus on dualities.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of a simultaneous narrative is dependent on the reason for its creation or its creator because this  would convey who would be able to interpret it as it was meant to be.

This type of narrative is common in cultures that are oral in nature rather than literate. This is because simultaneous narratives require human agency in order to be understood as originally intended.  This is common in illiterate societies because of a lack of ways to transpire information from one generation to another without a written language. Thus simple patterns and dualities are used because they can be easily remembered and referenced to by those for whom the piece of art is meant.

== Monoscenic narrative ==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}
A monoscenic narrative is a type of narrative that represents a single scene. There is no repetition of characters and there is only one action taking place.  The scene is one that is easily identifiable in context of the narrative and is of significant importance.

Under this definition, most art that is usually not considered a narrative would fit under the monoscenic narrative type. Narrative art is art that tells a story, either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. This in retrospect makes a good portion of art narrative art. Landscapes and portraits however do not meet the criteria of the definition provided, though they might be, depending on the artist’s intention.

===Achilles kills Penthesilea (amphora) by Exekias===
Exekias was an ancient Greek vase-painter and potter. A good portion of his vase work included scenes from Greek mythology. He was known for his ability to capture the most critical points of a story and illustrate them into one simple scene. The amphora portraying Achilles killing Penthesilea is such an example.

This monoscenic narrative illustrated on this amphora exemplifies a vital part of the Trojan saga. It is the moment in which Achilles and Penthesilea fall in love. In the heat of battle, Achilles battles Penthesilea and with a fatal blow, causes her helmet to be pushed back. When their eyes meet, it is said that they fall in love. This is ruined by Achilles’ inability to control his bloodlust.  Due to this tragedy, Achilles refuses to fight and from this many consequences arise that eventually could be linked to his demise.

===British art tradition===
A line of development of narrative art begins with [[William Hogarth]], the English painter. His monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in a narrative were taken up in the 19th century by other British painters. The Victorian terms applied to this style were "subject painting" or "anecdotic" painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela M. Fletcher|title=Narrating Modernity: The British Problem Picture, 1895-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvT_0aOkOSkC&amp;pg=PA146|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3568-0|page=146 note 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuous narrative ==
[[File:Relief Kolumna Trajana.jpg|left|thumb|150px| [[Trajan's Column]] is an example of a continuous narrative]]
A continuous narrative is a type of narrative that illustrates multiple scenes of a narrative within a single frame. Multiple actions and scenes are portrayed in a single visual field without any dividers. The sequence of events within the narrative is defined through the reuse of the main character or characters.  It emphasizes the change in movement and state of the repeating characters as indicators of scene or phase changes in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Column of Trajan ===
The Column of Trajan depicts one event:  the Dacian Wars. This continuous narrative can be broken down into a series of events. These events flow from one scene to another without any physical indicators such as vertical lines. Because of how the narrative is read, from standing in front of the column, it seems to ebb right to left and then left to right which is common in continuous narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative becomes rather hard to read as the column gets higher.  Research suggests that the column was originally planned to be read while walking a circular staircase around the column itself .&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt; The story then would not ebb and continue on in a sequential manner.

=== Bayeux Tapestry ===
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|Section of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]
The '[[Bayeux Tapestry]]' (a misnomer as it is really an [[embroidery]] not a [[tapestry]]) tells the story of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066. The theme of the Bayeux Tapestry is treason and deception.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell 1966, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative reflects a partisan Norman view of the events of the conquest of England.  Though the tapestry seems to be framed because it is separated by registers, horizontal lines, it is still a continuous narrative.  Registers are needed in order to separate a story to fit within a certain area.  If cut up and placed next to each other, a continuous narrative would exist.  A continuous narrative does not have any separation between scenes and actions.

== Synoptic narrative ==
A synoptic narrative depicts a single scene in which a character or characters are portrayed multiple times within a frame to convey that multiple actions are taking place.  This causes the sequence of events to be unclear within the narrative.  Synoptic narratives typically provide visual cues that convey the sequence, but still might be difficult to decipher for those unfamiliar with the story.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaddanta Jataja, Amaravati ===
An instance of a synoptic narrative is one represented in a medallion from the stupa at Amaravati.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; It, like many synoptic narratives,  can be difficult to interpret.  The medallion is meant to present the reader with the story of Buddha’s previous birth as the elephant Chaddanta.  The center of the medallion has only decorative carving, which is a visual cue on how the medallion is meant to be interpreted; which is in a circular pattern.  Other than that subtle visual cue the artist leaves very little indication of the order.

[[File:Chaddanta Jataja Amaravati.jpg|thumb|300px| Illustrates how the medallion is meant to be read.]]
The medallion can be separated into 3 episodes:
*  1 - Chaddanta presents his chief queen with lotus.
* 2 - Junior queen in offended.
* 3 – She, the junior queen, leaves to be on her own.
* 4 – She lays dying, hoping for revenge.
* 5 – A hunter aims an arrow at Chaddanta.
* 6 – The hunter saws off Chaddanta’s tusks.
* 7- The hunter is seen departing with the tusks. (This isn’t numbered but is at the very top center)&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panoptic narrative ==
[[File:006MAD Frieze.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the north frieze of the [[Siphnian Treasury]] at [[Delphi]]]]
A panoramic narrative is a narrative that depicts multiple scenes and actions without the repetition of characters.  Actions may be in a sequence or represent simultaneous actions during an event.

=== Siphnian Treasury North Frieze ===
The [[Siphnian Treasury]] at [[Delphi]] has four marble [[frieze]]s, one for each cardinal direction. These four friezes depict panoramic narratives through the use of carvings of the marble. The north frieze is an illustration of a battle between the Olympic gods and the giants. In the far left two giants attack Zeus in his chariot, who is no longer visible due to deterioration. [[Hera]] is seen finishing off a giant to the right of [[Zeus]] with [[Athena]] behind her (further right) fighting two giants. To the right of Athena is her brother [[Ares]] who is fighting two other giants with one already dead at his feet. There are multiple narratives taking place with each combatant in varying scenes. The dead giant at Ares' feet was downed by Athena but Ares is depicted as moving forward in the narrative by stepping over the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Petrakos 1977, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progressive narrative ==
[[File:Toepffer Cryptogame 13.png|right|thumb|A page by [[Rodolphe Töpffer]]]] 
A progressive narrative portrays a single scene in which characters do not repeat. However, multiple actions are taking place in order to convey a passing of time in the narrative. A progressive narrative is not to be interpreted as a group of simultaneous events but rather a sequence that is dependent on its location.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Penny Small  1999, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;  Actions displayed by characters in the narratives compact present and future action into a single image.

== Sequential narrative ==
A sequential narrative is very much like a continuous narrative with one major difference. A sequential narrative focuses on enframement to develop temporal progression.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; Each scene and action is represented within its frame as a unit. Each frame is a particular scene during a particular moment.  A sequential narrative is the type of narrative generally used in [[comic]]s and [[manga]].

'''Pearson Playwrights' Scheme''' (formerly '''Thames Television Theatre Writers Scheme''') is a British organisation established in 1973 to support theatre writing. It runs the '''Pearson Award for Best New Play'''.

==History==

In 1973, [[Howard Thomas]], then managing director of [[Thames Television]], launched the ''Thames Television Theatre Writers Scheme'' to support and celebrate new writing in the theatre. He believed that television owed much to the theatre for its supply of creative talent. In 1993 [[Pearson PLC]] took over the sponsorship of the scheme and it became the ''Pearson Playwrights' Scheme''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writersservices.com/agent/bur/Pearson_Playwrights.htm ''Pearson Playwrights' Scheme''] writersservices.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shenton's View, [http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/mt/mt-search.cgi?blog_id=2&amp;tag=Pearson%20Playwrights%27%20Scheme&amp;limit=20&amp;IncludeBlogs=2 ''The Nurturing of New Playwrights''] The Stage&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the past 30 years,{{When|date=February 2011}} the scheme has helped launch some of the finest British play-writing talent. Each year, bursaries are awarded to new writers and an additional award is offered to the writer of the best play. These are selected by the scheme's panel, chaired by Sir [[John Mortimer]] CBE QC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/?lid=4432 "Thirty years of the Pearson Playwrights' Scheme"] National Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are called the Pearson Award for Best New Play.

Since 2014 the scheme has been sponsored by [[Channel Four (United Kingdom)|Channel Four]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/c4-takes-over-pearson-playwrights-scheme-in-its-40th-anniversary-year&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panel and patrons ==

The panel has included [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], [[Thelma Holt]] CBE, [[Sue Summers]], [[Catherine Johnson (playwright)|Catherine Johnson]], [[Beryl Bainbridge]] DBE and [[John Tydeman]].

Patrons include Sir [[Alan Ayckbourn]] CBE, [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Stephen Daldry]], Dame [[Judi Dench]], Sir [[Richard Eyre]], Sir [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] CBE, Sir [[Jeremy Isaacs]], [[Joan Plowright]] CBE, Sir [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[Sue Townsend]].

The scheme is administrated by Jack Andrews MBE, and is supported by The Peggy Ramsay Foundation and The Olivier Foundation.

'''''Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather''''' is an 1896 painting by [[Camille Pissarro]] in the collection of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ago.net/agoid6668 Camille Pissarro, ''Pont Boieldieu in Rouen'', Art Gallery of Ontario]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a series of painting Pissarro did of [[Pont Boïeldieu]] and the industrial quays surrounding it. Pissarro spent time in Rouen in 1896 seeking to paint the industrial modernity of the area. He had earlier made a trip in 1883, and did one series of images of the city then. On his 1896 trip he stayed at the [[Hôtel de Paris]] in Rouen, from January to April 1896, and it is in this period that this painting was made. His room overlooked the [[Seine]], and it is from this vantage point that it is painted.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz Eitner. ''19th century European painting: David to Cézanne.'' Westview Press, 2002 pg. 427&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subject is the Pont Boieldieu, an iron bridge completed a few years before in 1885. Across the river is the Gare d'Orléans train station and the Place Carnot square. The painting shows Pissarro's interest in moving beyond traditional landscape paintings of verdant rural scenes. His Rouen series instead focuses on the bustle of the modern city. The Rouen pictures would be followed by a series of paintings of urban Paris. Style-wise, ''Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather'' is a return to [[Impressionism]] after a decade of experimenting with [[Post-Impressionism]] and [[Pointalism]].  Pissarro deliberately sought out a view of the busy industrial section of the town, and produced a number of paintings of the view from the hotel in different light conditions and different weather. He did another picture of the Pont Boieldieu from the same angle, but in a foggy sunset that is today at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]].

In a letter written that year, Pissarro himself describes the painting: "The theme is the bridge near the Placede la Bourse with the effects of rain, crowds of people coming and going, smoke from the boats, quays with cranes, workers in the foreground, and all this in grey colors glistening in the rain."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Bernier. ''Monument, moment, and memory: Monet's cathedral in fin de siècle France'' Bucknell University Press, 2007. pg. 36 &lt;/ref&gt; He further wrote, "what particularly interests me is the motif off the iron bridge in wet weather with all the vehicles, pedestrians, workers on the embankment, boats, smoke, haze in the distance; it's so spirited, so alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Gallery of Ontario: Selected Works.'' Art Gallery of Ontario, 1990 pg. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario by [[Reuben Wells Leonard]] upon his death in 1937. It is one of six Pissarros on public display in Canada, with two others at the AGO, and the others being at the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Art Gallery of Hamilton]] and the [[Art Gallery of Greater Victoria]].

[[File:CRT phosphors.png|right|thumb|375px|The [[emission spectra]] of the three [[phosphor]]s that define the '''additive primary colors''' of a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] color video display.  Other electronic color display technologies ([[LCD]], [[Plasma display]], [[OLED]]) have analogous sets of primaries with different emission spectra.]]

A set of '''primary colors''' is, most tangibly, a set of ''real'' [[colorant]]s or colored lights that can be combined in varying amounts to produce a [[gamut]] of colors. This is the essential method used in applications that are intended to elicit the perception of diverse sets of color, e.g. electronic displays, color printing, and paintings. Perceptions associated with a given combination of primary colors are predicted by applying the appropriate mixing model ([[additive mixing|additive]], [[subtractive mixing|subtractive]], additive averaging etc.) that embodies the underlying physics of how light interacts with the media and ultimately the retina.

Primary colors can also be conceptual, either as additive mathematical elements of a [[color space]] or as irreducible phenomenological categories in domains such as psychology and [[Philosophy of color|philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; have led to practically useful insights.

All sets of real and color-space primaries are ''arbitrary'', in the sense that there is no one set of primaries that can be considered the canonical set. Primary pigments or light sources selected for a given application on the basis of subjective preferences as well as practical factors such as cost, stability, availability etc.  Color-space primaries can be subjected to meaningful [[Injective function|one-to-one]] transformations so that the transformed space is still complete and each color is specified with a unique sum.

== Additive mixing of light ==

[[File:LCD pixels RGB.jpg|thumb|350px|A photograph of the red, green, and blue elements (subpixels) of an [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]].  Additive mixing explains how light from these colored elements can be used for photorealistic color image reproduction.]]

The perception elicited by multiple light sources co-stimulating the same area of the retina is additive, i.e., predicted via summing the [[spectral power distribution]]s or tristimulus values of the individual light sources (assuming a color matching context). For example, a purple spotlight on a dark background could be matched with coincident blue and red spotlights that are both dimmer than the purple spotlight. If the intensity of the purple spotlight was doubled it could be matched by doubling the intensities of both the red and blue spotlights that matched the original purple.  The principles of additive color mixing are embodied in [[Grassmann's law (optics)|Grassmann's laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Additive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the [[CIE 1931]] colorspace. The original ''[[monochromatic]]'' primaries of the (arbitrary) wavelengths of 435.8&amp;nbsp;nm (violet), 546.1&amp;nbsp;nm (green), and 700&amp;nbsp;nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The exact colors chosen for additive primaries are a technological compromise between the available [[phosphor]]s (including considerations such as cost and power usage) and the need for large chromaticity gamut. The [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709-5]]/[[sRGB]] primaries are typical.

It is important to note that additive mixing provides very poor predictions of color perception outside the color matching context.  Well known demonstrations such as [[The dress]] and other examples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; show how the additive mixing model alone is not sufficient for predicting perceived color in many instances of real images. In general, we cannot completely predict all possible perceived colors from combinations of primary lights in the context of real world images and viewing conditions.  The cited examples suggest just how remarkably poor such predictions can be.

== Subtractive mixing of ink layers ==

{{See also|CMYK color model}}
[[File:Halftoningcolor.svg|thumb|350px|A magnified representation of small partially overlapping spots of cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) [[halftone]]s in [[CMYK]] process printing.  Each row represents the pattern of partially overlapping ink "rosettes" so that the patterns would be perceived as blue, green, and red when viewed on white paper from a typical viewing distance. The overlapping ink layers mix subtractively while additive mixing predicts the color appearance from the light reflected from the rosettes and white paper in between them.]]

The [[subtractive color|subtractive]] color mixing model predicts the spectral power distributions of light filtered through overlaid partially absorbing materials on a reflecting or transparent surface. Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths of light from the illumination spectrum while letting others pass through multiplicatively, resulting in a colored appearance. Overlapping layers of ink in printing mix subtractively over reflecting white paper in this way to generate photorealistic color images.  The typical number of inks in such a printing process ranges from 3 to 6 (e.g., [[CMYK]] process, [[hexachrome|Pantone hexachrome]]). In general, using fewer inks as primaries results in more economical printing but using more may result in better color reproduction.

[[Cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] are good subtractive primaries in that the spectral power distributions of light reflected from idealized inks can be combined for the largest chromaticity gamuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The color of light (i.e., the spectral power distribution) reflected from illuminated surfaces coated in paint mixes, slurries of pigment particles, is not well approximated by a subtractive or additive mixing model. Color predictions that incorporate light scattering effects of pigment particles and paint layer thickness require approaches based on the Kubelka–Munk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; equations. Even such approaches cannot predict the color of paint mixtures precisely since small variances in particle size distribution, impurity concentrations etc. can be difficult to measure but impart perceptible effects on the way light is reflected from the paint.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mix desired colors from a small initial set of primaries and do not use mathematical modelling.

There are hundreds of commercially available pigments for visual artists to use and mix (in various media such as oil, watercolor, acrylic, gouache, and pastel).  A common approach is to use just a limited palette of primary pigments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often between four and eight) that can be physically mixed to any color that the artist desires in the final work.  There is no specific set of pigments that are primary colors, the choice of pigments depends entirely on the artist's subjective preference of subject and style of art as well as material considerations like lightfastness and mixing heuristics.  Contemporary classical realists have often advocated that a limited palette of white, red, yellow, and black pigment (often described as the "Zorn palette") is sufficient for compelling work.&lt;ref name="gurney_zorn"&gt;{{cite web

A [[chromaticity diagram]] can illustrate the gamut of different choices of primaries, for example showing which colors are lost (and gained) if you use RGB for ''subtractive'' color mixing (instead of CMY).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Westland, "subtractive mixing – why not RGB?", October 4, 2009 http://colourware.org/2009/10/04/subtractive-mixing-why-not-rgb/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919234439/http://colourware.org/2009/10/04/subtractive-mixing-why-not-rgb/ |date=2017-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color-space primaries ==
A contemporary description of the [[color vision]] system provides an understanding of primary colors that is consistent with modern [[color science]]. The human eye normally contains only three types of color photoreceptors, known as long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) [[cone cell]]s. These photoreceptor types respond to different degrees across visible electromagnetic spectrum. The S cone response is generally assumed to be negligible at long wavelengths greater than about 560&amp;nbsp;nm while the L and M cones respond across the entire visible spectrum.&lt;ref name="stockmansharpe2006"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LMS primaries are imaginary since there is no visible wavelength that stimulates only one type of cone (i.e., humans cannot normally see a color that corresponds to pure L, M or S stimulation). The LMS primaries are complete since every visible color can be mapped to a triplet specifying the coordinates in [[LMS color space]].

[[File:Normalized Cone Sensitivities.png|thumb|center|375px|Normalized cone [[spectral sensitivity]] curves]]

The L, M and S response curves (''cone fundamentals'') were deduced from ''color matching functions'' obtained from controlled color matching experiments (e.g., [[CIE 1931]]) where observers matched the color of a surface illuminated by monochromatic light with mixtures of three monochromatic primary lights illuminating a juxtaposed surface. Practical applications generally use a canonical linear transformation of LMS space known as [[CIEXYZ]]. The X, Y, and Z primaries are typically more useful since luminance (Y) is specified separately from a color's chromaticity.  Any color space primaries which can be mapped to physiologically relevant LMS primaries by a linear transformation are necessarily either imaginary or incomplete or both. The color-matching context is always three dimensional (since LMS space is three dimensional) but more general ''color appearance'' models like [[CIECAM02]] describe color in six dimensions and can be used to predict how colors appear under different viewing conditions.

Thus for trichromats like humans, we use three (or more) primaries for most general purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two primaries would be unable to produce even some of the most common among the named colors. Adding a reasonable choice of third primary can drastically increase the available gamut, while adding a fourth or fifth may increase the gamut but typically not by as much.

Most [[placental mammal]]s other than primates have only two types of color photoreceptor and are therefore [[dichromacy|dichromats]], so it is possible that certain combinations of just two primaries might cover some significant gamut relative to the range of their color perception.  Meanwhile, [[birds]] and [[marsupials]] have four color photoreceptors in their eyes, and hence are [[tetrachromats]]. There is one scholarly report of a functional human tetrachromat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The presence of photoreceptor cell types in an organism's eyes do not directly imply that they are being used to functionally perceive color. Measuring functional spectral discrimination in non-human animals is challenging due to the difficulty in performing psychophysical experiments on creatures with limited behavioral repertoires who cannot respond using language. Limitations in the discriminative ability of shrimp having twelve distinct color photoreceptors have demonstrated that having more cell types in itself need not always correlate with better functional color vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Main|Opponent process}}

The [[opponent process]] is a color theory that states that the human [[visual system]] interprets information about [[color]] by processing signals from [[cone cell|cones]] and [[rod cell|rods]] in an antagonistic manner.  The theory states that every color can be described as a mix along the three axes of red vs. green, blue vs. yellow and white vs. black.  The six colors from the pairs might be called "psychological primary colors", because any other color could be described in terms of some combination of these pairs.

'''RAW artists''' (RAW:natural born artists) is an international independent arts organization operating in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] that supports artists in visual art, music, film, photography, fashion, hair design, makeup artistry, and performing art. The organization promotes starting and independent artists through multi-genre art events as well as through its online network, providing them with resources, the networking experience, professional photos and promotion.  As of January 2018, the RAW artists organization has showcased over 100,000 artists and has hosted over 1,000 showcase events

==Business model==

Sales of RAW tickets are enacted by the artists featured, who are expected to purchase tickets from RAW and sell them on. Whilst RAW does not provide any compensation to the artists involved, the artists retain the proceeds from any sales of their work. This business practice has let to criticism from some artists, who have derided RAW as "pay-to-play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaragoza |first1=Alex |title=Beef Week: A RAW Deal for Local Artists |url=https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/beef-week-a-raw-deal-for-local-artists/ |publisher=Voice of San Diego |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gibson |first1=Dan |title=Article About RAW: Natural Born Artists Might Confirm What You Thought About the Organization |url=https://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2014/03/14/article-about-raw-natural-born-artists-might-confirm-what-you-thought-about-the-organization |publisher=Tucson Weekly |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hortillosa |first1=Summer Dawn |title=RAW artists, international arts organization, schedules exhibit in Hudson County |url=https://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/raw_artists_schedule_a_exhibit.html |publisher=Jersey Journal |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== RAWards ==

At the end of every season (October), RAW artists hosts an awards show called RAWards. The awards season is a two-month process with an online voting, local semi-final shows with live voting, and lastly, a selection by a panel of judges made up of industry professionals from each field. One winner is chosen from each category (e.g. "RAW Visual Artist of the Year") and the nine winners are honored at a RAWards ceremony and show in Hollywood, CA in January. In 2012, RAW artists hosted two separate awards shows, in the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, Brenna (2012) ''The Indie RAWards: So Not Your Average Awards Show!''

'''Rococo''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|k|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ}}), less commonly '''roccoco''', or "'''Late Baroque'''", was a highly ornamental and theatrical style of decoration which combined asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted molding, and [[trompe l'oeil]] frescoes to create the illusions of surprise, motion and drama. It first appeared in France and Italy in the 1730s and spread to Central Europe in the 1750s and 1760s.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/video-rococ-writing-table|title=What is Rococo?|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}}&lt;ref&gt;"Rococo" Larousse Encyclopedia online &lt;/ref&gt; It is often described as the final expression of the [[Baroque]] movement.{{Sfn|Owens|2014|page=92}}

The Rococo style began in France in the first part of the 18th century in the reign of [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV]]  as a reaction against the more formal and geometric [[Style Louis XIV]]. It was known as the ''style [[rocaille]]'', or ''rocaille style''.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}} It soon spread other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Bavaria, Austria, other parts of Germany, and Russia. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware and glassware, painting,  music, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/506448/Rococo-style |title=Rococo style (design) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Zwiefalten 28 04 2011 23.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Integrated rococo carving, [[stucco]] and [[fresco]] at [[Zwiefalten Abbey]] (1739–45)]] 
The word ''rococo'' was first used in 1835 in France, as a humorous variation of the word ''rocaille'' or a combination of ''rocaille'' and ''[[baroque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary On-Line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monique Wagner, ''From Gaul to De Gaulle: An Outline of French Civilization.'' Peter Lang, 2005, p. 139. {{ISBN|0-8204-2277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rocaille was originally a method of decoration, using pebbles, seashells and cement, which was often used to decorate grottoes and fountains since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Larousse dictionary on-line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Stokstad, ed. Art History. 4th ed. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 17th and early 18th century it became the term for a kind of decorative motif or ornament that appeared in the late [[Style Louis XIV]], in the form of a seashell interlaced with [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves. In 1736 the designer and jeweler Jean Mondon published the ''Premier Livre de forme rocquaille et cartel'',  a collection of designs for ornaments of furniture and interior decoration. It was the first appearance in print of the term  "rocaille" to designate the style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;   The carved or molded seashell motif was combined with palm leaves or twisting vines to decorate doorways, furniture, wall panels and other architectural elements.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier''(2006) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the term was used to describe architecture or music which was excessively ornamental.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html Ancien Regime Rococo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411162829/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html |date=11 April 2018 }}. Bc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007210702/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c17th-mid19th/rococo.htm Rococo – Rococo Art]. Huntfor.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the mid-19th century, the term has been accepted by [[art historians]]. While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style, Rococo is now often considered as a distinct period in the development of [[European art]].

==Characteristics==
&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

Rococo featured exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}}

The style often integrated painting, molded stucco, and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that the those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where cherubs and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included included stucco,  either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods; lacquered wood in the Japanese style, and ornament of gilded bronze. The intent was to create an impression of surprise, awe and wonder on first view.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

==France==
{{See also|Rocaille|Louis Quinze}}
The  ''[[Rocaille]]'' style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign [[Louis XV]], and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Lovreglio, Aurélia and Anne, ''Dictionnaire des Mobiliers et des Objets d'art'', Le Robert, Paris, 2006, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;  The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests.  The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris, designed by [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] (1735–40). The characteristics of French Rococo included exceptional artistry, especially in the complex frames made for mirrors and paintings, which sculpted in plaster and often gilded; and the use of vegetal forms (vines, leaves, flowers) intertwined in complex designs.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|pp. 92-93}}   The furniture also featured sinuous curves and vegetal designs. The leading furniture designers and craftsmen in the style included [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]], [[Charles Cressent]], and [[Nicolas Pineau]].{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=382}}&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA587|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|pages=583–584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rocaille style lasted in France until the mid-18th century, and while it became more curving and vegetal, it never achieved the extravagant exuberance of the Rococo in Bavaria, Austria and Italy. The discoveries of Roman antiquities beginning in 1738 at [[Herculanum]] and especially at [[Pompeii]] in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant neo-classicism.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Italy==
Artists in Italy, particularly [[Venice]], also produced an exuberant rococo style.  Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille, but with a particular Venetian variation; the pieces were painted, often with landscapes or flowers or scenes from [[Guardi]] or other painters, or [[Chinoiserie]], against a blue or green background, matching the colours of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] of painters whose work decorated the salons. Notable decorative painters included [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos, and [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] who painted the ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] in the [[illusionistic ceiling painting|quadraturo]] manner, giving the illusion of three dimensions. Tiepelo travelled to Germany with his son during 1752–1754, decorating the ceilings of the [[Würzburg Residence]], one of the major landmarks of the Bavarian rococo.  An earlier celebrated Venetian painter was [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]], who painted several notable church ceilings. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

The Venetian Rococo also featured exceptional glassware, particularly [[Murano glass]], often engraved and coloured, which was exported across Europe. Works included multicolour chandeliers and mirrors with extremely ornate frames. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Southern Germany and Russia==
The Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and central Europe from the 1730s until the 1770s. It was first introduced from France through the publications and works of French architects and decorators, including the sculptor [[Claude III Audran]], the interior designer [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], the sculptor Jean Mondon, and the draftsman and engraver [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Lepautre]]. Their work had an important influence on the German Rococo style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'' (1977), pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; 

German architects adapted the Rococo style but made it far more asymmetric and loaded with more ornate decoration than the French original.  The German style was characterized by an explosion of forms that cascaded down the walls. It featured molding formed into curves and counter-curves, twisting and turning patterns, ceilings and walls with no right angles, and stucco foliage which seemed to be creeping up the walls and across the ceiling. The decoration was often gilded or silvered to give it contrast with the white or pale pastel walls.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=150-153}}

The Belgian-born architect and designer [[François de Cuvilliés]] was one of the first to create a Rococo building in Germany, with the pavilion of [[Amalienburg]] in Munich, (1734-1739), inspired by the pavilions of the  [[Trianon]] and [[Marly]] in France. It was built as a hunting lodge, with a platform on the roof for shooting pheasants.  The Hall of Mirrors in the interior, by the painter and stucco sculptor [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], was far more exuberant than any French Rococo.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another notable example of the early German Rococo is [[Würzburg Residence]] (1737–1744) constructed for the Prince-Bishop of Wurzburg by [[Balthasar Neumann]].   Neumann had traveled to Paris and consulted with the French rocaille decorative artists [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Robert de Cotte]].  While the exterior was in more sober Baroque style,  the interior, particularly the stairways and ceilings, was much lighter and decorative. The Prince-Bishop imported the Italian Rococo painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] in 1750–53 to create a mural over the top of the three-level ceremonial stairway. &lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; B.M. Field ''The Worlds Greatest Architecture:  Past and Present, Regency House Publishing Ltd, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann described the interior of the residence as  "a theater of light".  The stairway was also the central element in a residence Neumann  built at the [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl|Augustusburg Palace in Brühl]] (1743–1748).  In that building the stairway led the visitors up through a stucco fantasy of paintings, sculpture, ironwork and decoration, with surprising views at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1740s and 1750s, a number of notable pilgrimage churches were constructed in [[Bavaria]], with interiors decorated in a distinctive variant of the rococo style. One of the most notable examples is the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754) designed by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]].   Like most of the Bavarian pilgrimage churches, the exterior is very simple, with pastel walls, and little ornament.  Entering the church the visitor encounters an astonishing theater of movement and light.  It features an oval-shaped  sanctuary, and  a deambulatory in the same form, filling in the church with light from all sides.  The white walls contrasted with columns of blue and pink stucco in the choir, and the domed ceiling surrounded by plaster angels below a dome representing the heavens crowded with colorful Biblical figures.  Other notable pilgrimage churches include the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743–1772).{{Sfn|Ducher|1988| page=152}}{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|pp. 89–94}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Johann Michael Fischer]] was the architect of [[Ottobeuren Abbey]] (1748–1766), another Bavarian Rococo landmark. The church features, like much of the rococo architecture in Germany,  a remarkable contrast between the regularity of the facade and the overabundance of decoration in the interior.&lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"/&gt;

The Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] was another admirer of the Rococo; The Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace in the palace complex of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]] near Saint Petersburg, designed by the Italian [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]],  is an example of the Russian Rococo.

==Britain==
In Great Britain, rococo was called the "French taste"  and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe. although its influence was felt in such areas as silverwork, porcelain, and silks. [[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not mentioning rococo by name, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rococo was slow in arriving in England. Before entering the Rococo, British furniture for a time followed the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Palladian]] model under designer [[William Kent]], who designed for Lord Burlington and other important patrons of the arts. Kent travelled to Italy with Lord Burlington between 1712 and 1720, and brought back many models and ideas from Palladio.  He designed the furniture for [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1732), Lord Burlington's [[Chiswick House]] (1729), London, Thomas Coke's [[Holkham Hall]], Norfolk, Robert Walpole's pile at [[Houghton Hall|Houghton]], for [[Devonshire House]] in London, and at Rousham.{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=382}}

[[Mahogany]] made its appearance in England in about 1720, and immediately became popular for furniture, along with [[walnut]] wood. The Rococo began to make an appearance in England between 1740 and 1750. The furniture of [[Thomas Chippendale]] was the closest to the Rococo style,  In 1754 he published "Gentleman's and Cabinet-makers' directory", a catalog of designs for rococo, ''chinoiserie'' and even Gothic furniture, which achieved wide popularity, going through three editions.  Unlike French designers, Chippendale did not employ marquetry or inlays in his furniture.  The predominant designer of inlaid furniture were Vile and Cob, the cabinet-makers for King George III.  Another important figure in British furniture was [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], who in 1761,  very late in the period, published a catalog of Roroco furniture designs.  These include furnishings based on rather fantastic Chinese and Indian motifs, including a canopy bed crowned by a Chinese pagoda (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

Other notable figures in the British Rococo included the silversmith Charles Friedrich Kandler.

==Decline and end==
The art of [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and other painters of the period, with its emphasis on decorative mythology and gallantry, soon inspired a reaction, and a demand for more "noble" themes.  While the Rococo continued in Germany and Austria, the French Academy in Rome began to teach the classic style. This was confirmed by the nomination of [[Le Troy]] as director of the Academy in 1738, and then in 1751 by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].

[[Madame de Pompadour]], the mistress of Louis XV contributed to the decline of the Rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named director general of the King's Buildings. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting and architecture.{{sfn|Cabanne|1988|p. 106}}

The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]]. In Germany, late 18th-century Rococo was ridiculed as ''Zopf und Perücke'' ("pigtail and periwig"), and this phase is sometimes referred to as ''Zopfstil''. Rococo remained popular in the provinces and in Italy, until the second phase of neoclassicism, "[[Empire style]]", arrived with Napoleonic governments and swept Rococo away.

==Furniture and decoration==
The ornamental style called ''[[rocaille]]'' emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of [[Louis XV]];  the style was also called ''[[Louis Quinze]]''.  Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance. On the walls of new Paris salons, the twisting and winding designs, usually made of gilded or painted stucco, wound around the doorways and mirrors like vines.  One of the earliest examples was the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1704–05), with its famous oval salon decorated with paintings by Boucher, and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=102}}

The best known French furniture designer of the period was [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]] (1695–1750), who was also a sculptor, painter. and goldsmith for the royal household. He held the title of official designer to the Chamber and Cabinet of Louis XV.  His work is well known today because of the enormous number of engravings made of his work which popularized the style throughout Europe. He designed works for the royal families of Poland and Portugal.

Italy was another place where the Rococo flourished, both in its early and later phases.  Craftsmen in Rome, Milan and Venice all produced lavishly decorated furniture and decorative items.

The sculpted decoration included fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage, carved in wood. The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls. The Commodes, or chests, which had first appeared under Louis XIV, were richly decorated with rocaille ornament made of gilded bronze. They were made by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] and also featured marquetry of different-coloured woods, sometimes placed in checkerboard cubic patterns, made with light and dark woods.  The period also saw the arrival of [[Chinoiserie]], often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes, called ''falcon de Chine'' of ''Vernis Martin'', after the ebenist who introduced the technique to France. [[Ormolu]], or gilded bronze, was used by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]]. Latz made a particularly ornate clock mounted atop a cartonnier for [[Frederick the Great]] for his palace in [[Potsdam]]. Pieces of [[Chinese export porcelain|imported Chinese porcelain]] were often mounted in [[ormolu]] (gilded bronze) rococo settings for display on tables or consoles in salons. Other craftsmen imitated the [[Japanese lacquer|Japanese art of lacquered furniture]], and produced commodes with Japanese motifs.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

[[Great Britain|British]] Rococo tended to be more restrained. Thomas Chippendale's furniture designs kept the curves and feel, but stopped short of the French heights of whimsy. The most successful exponent of British Rococo was probably [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], a gifted carver and furniture designer working in London in the mid-18th century.

==Painting==
Elements of the ''Rocaille'' style appeared in the work of some French painters, including a taste for the picturesque in details; curves and counter-curves; and dissymmetry which replaced the movement of the baroque with exuberance, though the French ''rocaille'' never reached the extravagance of the Germanic rococo.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  The leading proponent was [[Antoine Watteau]], particularly in [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717), [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]], in a genre called ''[[Fête galante|Fête Galante]]''  depicting scenes of young nobles gathered together to celebrate in a pastoral setting.  Watteau died in 1721 at the age of thirty-seven, but his work continued to have influence through the rest of the century. The ''Pilgrimage to Cythera'' painting was purchased by [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia in 1752 or 1765 to decorate his palace of [[Charlottenberg]] in Berlin.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}

The successor of Watteau and the ''Féte Galante'' in decorative painting was [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770), the favorite painter of [[Madame de Pompadour]].  His work included the sensual ''Toilette de Venus'' (1746), which became one of the best known examples of the style.  Boucher participated in all of the genres of the time, designing tapestries, models for porcelain sculpture, set decorations for the Paris opera and ''opera-comique'', and decor for the Fair of Saint-Laurent.  {{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other important painters of the ''Fête Galante'' style included [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pater]].  The style particularly influenced [[François Lemoyne]], who painted the lavish decoration of the ceiling of the Salon of Hercules at the [[Palace of Versailles]], completed in 1735.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  Paintings with fétes gallant and mythological themes by Boucher, [[Pierre-Charles Trémolières]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] decorated the famous salon of the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1735–40).{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other Rococo painters include: [[Jean François de Troy]] (1679–1752), [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]] (1685–1745), his two sons [[Louis-Michel van Loo]] (1707–1771) and [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] (1719–1795), his younger brother [[Charles-André van Loo]] (1705–1765), and [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1690–1743).

In Austria and Southern Germany, Italian painting had the largest effect on the Rococo style.  The Venetian painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], assisted by his son, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]],  was invited to paint frescoes for the [[Würzburg Residence]] (1720–1744).  The most prominent painter of Bavarian rococo churches was [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], who painted the ceiling of the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754)

==Sculpture and porcelain==
[[File:The Music Lesson MET DP-14272-001 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''The Music Lesson'', [[Chelsea porcelain]], c. 1765, 15 3/8 × 12 1/4 × 8 3/4 inches, 22 lb. (39.1 × 31.1 × 22.2 cm, 10 kg)]]
Religious sculpture followed the Italian baroque style, as exemplified in the theatrical altarpiece of the Karlskirche in Vienna.  However, much of Rococo sculpture was lighter and offered more movement than the classical style of Louis XIV.  It was encouraged in particular by [[Madame de Pompadour]], mistress of Louis XV, who commissioned many works for her chateaux and gardens. The sculptor [[Edmé Bouchardon]] represented [[Cupid]] engaged in carving his darts of love from the club of [[Hercules]] Rococo style—the demigod is transformed into the soft child, the bone-shattering club becomes the heart-scathing arrows, just as [[marble]] is so freely replaced by [[stucco]]. [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) was another leading French sculptor during the period.  The French sculptors, [[Jean-Louis Lemoyne]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], [[Louis-Simon Boizot]], [[Michel Clodion]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle|Pigalle]]  were also active.  In Italy, [[Antonio Corradini]] was among the leading sculptors of the Rococo style.  A Venetian, he travelled around Europe, working for [[Peter the Great]] in St. Petersburg, for the imperial courts in Austria and Naples. He preferred sentimental themes and made several skilled works of women with faces covered by veils, one of which is now in the [[Louvre]].

A new form of small-scale sculpture appeared, the [[porcelain]] figure, or small group of figures, initially replacing sugar sculptures on grand dining room tables, but soon popular for placing on mantelpieces and furniture.  The number of European factories grew steadily through the century, and some made porcelain that the expanding middle classes could afford. The amount of colourful [[overglaze decoration]] used on them also increased.  They were usually modelled by artists who had trained in sculpture. Common subjects included figures from the [[commedia dell'arte]], city street vendors, lovers and figures in fashionable clothes, and pairs of birds.  

[[Johann Joachim Kändler]] was the most important modeller of [[Meissen porcelain]], the earliest European factory, which remained the most important until about 1760.  The Swiss-born German sculptor [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] produced a wide variety of colourful figures for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in Bavaria, which were sold throughout Europe.  The French sculptor [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) followed this example.  While also making large-scale works, he became director of the [[Sevres Porcelain]] manufactory and produced small-scale works, usually about love and gaiety, for production in series.

==Music==
A Rococo period existed in [[music history]], although it is not as well known as the earlier Baroque and later Classical forms. The Rococo music style itself developed out of baroque music both in France, where the new style was referred to as [[Galante music|''style galante'']] ("gallant" or "elegant" style), and in Germany, where it was referred to as ''empfindsamer Stil'' ("sensitive style"). It can be characterized as light, intimate music with extremely elaborate and refined forms of [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]]. Exemplars include [[Jean Philippe Rameau]], [[Louis-Claude Daquin]] and [[François Couperin]] in France; in Germany, the style's main proponents were [[C. P. E. Bach]] and [[Johann Christian Bach]], two sons of the renowned [[J.S. Bach]].

In the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred, primarily against its perceived overuse of ornamentation and decoration. Led by [[C.P.E. Bach]] (an accomplished Rococo composer in his own right), [[Domenico Scarlatti]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], this reaction ushered in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. By the early 19th century, Catholic opinion had turned against the suitability of the style for ecclesiastical contexts because it was "in no way conducive to sentiments of devotion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13106a.htm Rococo Style – Catholic Encyclopedia]. Newadvent.org (1912-02-01). Retrieved on 2014-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian composer of the Romantic era [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] wrote The [[Variations on a Rococo Theme]], Op. 33, for cello and orchestra in 1877. Although the theme is not Rococo in origin, it is written in Rococo style.

== Fashion ==
[[File:Sackbackgown.jpg|thumb|Sack-back gown and petticoat, 1775-1780 V&amp;A Museum no. T.180&amp;A-1965]]
Rococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration. Women’s fashion of the seventeenth-century was contrasted by the fashion of the eighteenth-century, which was ornate and sophisticated, the true style of Rococo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion: A history from the 18th to the 20th century|last=Fukui, A., &amp; Suoh, T.|first=|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These fashions spread beyond the royal court into the salons and cafés of the ascendant bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historyofeuropeanfashion.wordpress.com/category/baroquerococo-1650-1800/|title=Posts about Baroque/Rococo 1650-1800 on History of Costume|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exuberant, playful, elegant style of decoration and design that we now know to be ‘Rococo’ was then known as ‘''le style rocaille’, ‘le style moderne’, ‘le gout’.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rococo: The continuing curve, 1730-2008|last=Coffin|first=S.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A style that appeared in the early eighteenth-century was the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''robe volante''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a flowing gown, that became popular towards the end of King Louis XIV’s reign. This gown had the features of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour palate was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style, transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/09-10/daily-life-france-fashion-marie-antoinette/|title=Marie Antoinette's Style Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as trims. Shortly after the typical women’s Rococo gown was introduced, ''robe à la Françoise,'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a gown with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers.

The ''Watteau pleats'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who painted the details of the gowns down to the stiches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy. Later, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'pannier'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' and ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'mantua''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' became fashionable around 1718, they were wide hoops under the dress to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.8 metres) in diameter,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18sil/hd_18sil.htm|title=Eighteenth-Century Silhouette and Support|last=Glasscock|first=J.|date=|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as '''guardainfante','' initially designed to hide the pregnant stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called ''‘a la turque’.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was made popular by Louis XV’s mistress, Madame Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles Andre Van Loo, to paint her as a Turkish sultana.  
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''
In the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the '''polonaise''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', with inspiration taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen, which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the ''‘robe a l’anglais’'', which included elements inspired by the males’ fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the 'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat.

Accessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Shakiragha mausoleum''' ({{lang-az|'''Şakirağa türbəsi'''}}) is a historical monument of the XV century. It is located in [[Balaxanı|Balakhany]] village in the city of [[Baku]] in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="sabunchu"/&gt;

==History==
Shakiraga mausoleum is located in Balakhani Cemetery and was built in 1427–1428.&lt;ref name="sabunchu"&gt;{{cite web|title= Ölkə və yerli əhəmiyyətli Memarlıq və Arxeoloji abidələr|url= http://sabunchu-ih.gov.az/page/120.html|publisher= sabunchu-ih.gov.az|language= az|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also It is six meters from the Haji Shahla mosque which was built in 1385–1386. The information about the monument is limited. The monument was once destroyed by the Soviet as a religious monument.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

During an excavation in 1976, gold was found at its foundation. At that time, big earthenware pots full of gold were buried in basis of the monuments for their future restoration. The mausoleum was repaired with few percent of the found gold.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Hacı Şakir türbəsi|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/cemetery/8ea7ee12d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two-lined inscription in [[Arabic]] on the [[arch]]-shaped entrance door. Is written in the text:

{{cquote|''"Mirirakhur Shakir Agha ibn-marhum Murtaza, one of the elders of the nation and religion, ordered the construction of this monument. Year 831 (1427–28)"''}}
According to another source, Shakiragha mausoleum was erected by [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan|Shirvan Ibrahim]]’s vizier in honor of his son in 1427, and is called a mansion.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

==Architectural features== 
The mausoleum consists of hall with a dome and a main arch of the facade with ledge. It is built of white stone, which is characteristic for Absheron architecture.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

The mausoleum is cross-shaped in the plan. There are several cross-shaped monuments (Khan's Garden pavilion in [[Nardaran]], mausoleum in [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]] complex and others) by its interior structure in [[Absheron Peninsula|Absheron]]. However, there is no second monument in the shape of cross by its both internal and external structure as Shakiragha mausoleum in Azerbaijan.

The entrance to the mausoleum is the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] on the north. At internal area of the portal, octagonal prism-shaped niches, which are completed with arrow-shaped arch at both sides, are placed. There are also 8 niches of different sized rectangles inside the mausoleum.

The entrance is from the door, which is finished with a low arrow-shaped arch. The arch on the door is hewed from a whole stone. The surface of the stone is decorated with a plant ornament. There is also another stone placed on arch stone of the entrance, on which two lines of an epic writing is carved. The entrance and the stone with writing are framed with profiled large stone blocks.

A '''Single Screen''' game perspective can apply to all video games in which the entire playfield is shown on the screen, and the player character is unable to move beyond the boundaries of the screen either to a) scroll the game world (e.g. [[Mappy]]), or b) move to a different screen (e.g. [[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]). It is not to be confused with the [[Diorama (game perspective)|diorama]] perspective, which refers to non-screen based games ([[shooting range#Shooting gallery|shooting galleries]], [[pinball]] and other mechanical games) which were popular before and during the early years of video games. Also not to be confused with hybrid perspective games such as Caveman (Gottlieb), and [[Boot Hill (video game)|Boot Hill]] (Midway), which because of their dual camera nature are harder to classify into one perspective.
[[File:Pong.png|thumbnail|left|Single Screen]]

==History==
Single Screen video games became popular in the early 1970s with [[Pong]]. They offered a simpler and more affordable alternative to the expensive electro mechanical games of the time (such as Sega's Periscope).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon and Beyond : the Story Behind the Craze that Touched Our Lives and Changed the World|url = https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Ultimate_History_of_Video_Games.html?id=C2MH05ogU9oC&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher = Prima Pub.|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780761536437|language = en|first = Steve L.|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: from Pong to Pokemon and beyond...the story behind the craze that touched our li ves and changed the world|url = https://books.google.co.za/books?id=PTrcTeAqeaEC&amp;pg=PT469&amp;lpg=PT469&amp;dq=periscope++sega+1295&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=amEv-8_Yfe&amp;sig=g-GkfQ8s4JjjzwuDKvFnFxb8Ojo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Crown/Archetype|date = 2010-06-16|isbn = 9780307560872|language = en|first = Steven|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of these early games though was their lack of color and three dimensional effects compared to other games like [[Sonar (arcade game)|Sonar]].
In spite of these limitations single screen games were made covering multiple genres, including racing ([[Gran Trak 10]]), vehicle combat ([[Tank (video game)|Tank]]), shooting galleries ([[Qwak!]]), evasion / collection ([[Shark Jaws]]), and multiplayer shooters ([[Western Gun]]). In contrast to Pinball though (which could offer many more minutes per play) these games were still lacking, due to either their timed play mechanics (through a clock or limited ammunition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tracer - Videogame by Sega|url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=12739|website = www.arcade-museum.com|accessdate = 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest Arcade games to move beyond these limitations was [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]], and when it was released in 1976 it would go on to inspire [[Space Invaders]], the second game to offer a much longer play time than what was common in this game perspective. The next big evolution in this game perspective was then the introduction of multiple screen types ([[Donkey Kong]]) and randomized elements in combination with destructible environments ([[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]) to add not only duration, but greater variety in the single screen experience.

The '''''Social Register''''' is a semi-annual publication in the [[United States]] that indexes the members of [[High society (social class)|high society]]. First published in the 1880s by newspaper columnist [[Louis Keller]], it was later acquired by [[Malcolm Forbes]]. Since 2014 it has been owned by Christopher Wolf. 

Long a directory of well-connected, [[old money|patrician]] families from the [[northeast United States]] it has, in recent years, diversified both in the geography and ethnicity of those it lists. At the same time, however, its importance as an arbiter of class has waned. 

==History==
[[File:Biltmore_Estate.jpg|thumb|The ''Social Register'' was born out of the Gilded Age. Pictured is the Gilded Age mansion, [[Biltmore Estate|Biltmore]], in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].]] 

In antebellum [[New York City]], the social elite was still a small enough group that no formal method of tracking individuals was necessary.&lt;ref name="mont"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Maureen E.|title=Displaying Women: Spectacles of Leisure in Edith Wharton's New York|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134952864|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[Gilded Age]], however, fashionable ladies began the practice of leaving [[Visiting card|calling cards]] at the homes of other notable women whom they visited; these cards would be cataloged into "visiting lists".&lt;ref name="mont"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rr"/&gt; In 1887 Louis Keller, a [[newspaper]] society columnist and [[golf]] promoter, compiled the names  of those on the visiting lists of the most prominent New York women into a published volume titled the ''Social Register''.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winship|first1=Frederick|title=Social Register Marks 100 Years of Listing Everybody Who's Anybody|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-11/news/vw-42230_1_social-register|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 11, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A ''Social Register'', published by Keller for [[Newport, Rhode Island]], preceded the New York edition by one year.&lt;ref name="higley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higley|first1=Stephen|title=Privilege, Power, and Place: The Geography of the American Upper Class| date=1995|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0847680215|pages=29-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Inclusion in the registry was done under the supervision of an anonymous advisory committee composed of some of those listed.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; This first edition of the ''Social Register'' listed more than 5,000 people, most of whom were descended from early American settler families. Joseph Pulitzer was the only [[Jew]] to be listed, and people from [[new money]] were generally not included.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; The register, it has been noted, was very much a product of Gilded Age excess.&lt;ref name="higley"/&gt;

By [[World War I]], the ''Social Register'' had expanded into a multi-volume annual which included listings of Society members in 26 U.S. cities.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rr"/&gt; Following Keller's death in 1924, the ''Social Register'' passed to several of his heirs.&lt;ref name="higley"/&gt; 

A 1973 column in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about that year's ''Social Register'' observed that &amp;ndash; unlike males listed &amp;ndash; the volume did not list the universities attended by females, unless they were students: "The fact that Mazie Cox is a 1967 graduate of [[Smith College|Smith]] is not mentioned, although pains are taken to indicate that she is a member of the Colony Club, the [[Daughters of the Cincinnati]] and the [[Colonial Dames of America]]."&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Ruth|title='74 Social Register Has Few Surprises|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/05/archives/74-social-register-has-few-surprises-not-in-new-edition.html|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 5, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also noted that married women who chose to retain their [[maiden name]]s would be listed under the surname of their husband regardless.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;

In 1976, ownership of the ''Social Register'' was acquired by [[Malcolm Forbes]] and, the following year, he re-consolidated the various city books back into a single volume for the whole of the United States.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; A study of the 1988 ''Social Register'' found that approximately 10 percent of those listed resided in [[Manhattan]] with the [[Upper East Side]] [[zip code]] of 10021 hosting the greatest concentration of listed persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morin|first1=Richard|title=America’s Social Elite Still Love New York|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/aug/06/americas-social-elite-still-love-new-york/|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[Spokesman Review]]|agency=[[Universal Press Syndicate]]|date=August 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forbes family retained ownership of the ''Social Register'' until 2014, when it was sold to Christopher Wolf, a "longtime, listed member".&lt;ref name="rr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Keith|title=Forbes sells directory that catalogs Old Money families|url=https://nypost.com/2014/11/01/forbes-sells-directory-that-catalogs-old-money-families/|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[New York Post]]|date=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
Inclusion in the ''Social Register'' has historically been limited to members of polite society, members of the [[American upper class]] and [[The Establishment]], and/or those of "[[old money]]" or [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) families, within the ''Social Register'' cities.   According to McNamee and Miller:  "the acronym WASP... is exemplified by the ''Social Register'', a list of prominent upper-class families first compiled in 1887... There is great continuity across generations among the names included in these volumes."&lt;ref&gt;  {{cite book|author1=Stephen J. McNamee|author2=Robert K. Miller|title=The Meritocracy Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9AUI0CJ5eIC&amp;pg=PA63|year=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=63|isbn=9780742510562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cities are [[Newport, Rhode Island]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[New York City|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;The Philadelphia volume included [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pittsburgh]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as ones for "Southern Cities".&lt;ref&gt;examples may be found in [http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/cgi-bin/Ebind2h3/umsl7?seq=2 Page 2 of the 1925 Social Register of St. Louis, Missouri]&lt;/ref&gt; In European countries, similar directories for the perceived [[upper class]], such as ''[[Burke's Peerage]]'' and ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry|Landed Gentry]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], have been published for centuries.

According to the ''[[Robb Report]]'', inclusion in the ''Social Register'' "bespeaks old money, [[Ivy League]], trust funds, privileges of birth, fox hunting, debutante balls, yachting, polo, distinguished forebears, family compounds in the Adirondacks, and a pedigree studded with 19th-century robber barons".&lt;ref name="rr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Jack|title=The Membership You Weren’t Allowed to Talk About Is Now Open to New Recruits|url=http://robbreport.com/lifestyle/sports-leisure/the-membership-you-werent-allowed-to-talk-about-is-now-open-to-new-recruits-2771295/|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[Robb Report]]|date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while inclusion in the ''Social Register'' was once so important for members of Society that, according to [[Brooke Astor]], "if someone wasn't listed, you just didn't know them", by the late 1990s its influence had seriously waned.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In 2002, novelist [[Tom Wolfe]] said that he no longer heard regular reference to the ''Social Register'' and opined that the "world of social luster has been so overshadowed by celebrities that it doesn’t have any kick anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DiGiacomo|first1=Frank|title=The Forbes Family is Scaling Back Social Register|url=http://observer.com/2002/06/the-forbes-family-is-scaling-back-social-register/|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[New York Observer]]|date=June 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
[[File:Social_Register_1920.png|thumb|right|A page from the 1920 edition of the ''Social Register'']]
Printed editions of the Social Register have traditionally been bound in black with [[pumpkin (color)|pumpkin]] lettering.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; Each edition includes, in epigram, a quote by [[Thomas Jefferson]]: 

{{cquote|Let us in education dream of an aristocracy of achievement arising out of a democracy of opportunity.&lt;ref name="rr"/&gt;}}

An individual's listing in the Social Register has generally included contact information, schools attended, and the social and country clubs to which they belong.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allison|first1=Sargent|title=The Social Register: Just a Circle of Friends|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/21/style/the-social-register-just-a-circle-of-friends.html|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many of the institutions cited are done so repeatedly, an extensive system of abbreviations is used; for instance "P" stands for [[Princeton University]] while "BtP" represents the Bath and Tennis Club of [[Palm Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Inclusion and exclusion==

===Inclusion===
Wealth or fame has, traditionally, been insufficient for inclusion in the ''Social Register''; [[Kim Kardashian]] and [[Gloria Vanderbilt]] were never listed and [[Donald Trump]], prior to his election as President of the United States, was also not included.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt; A 1985 article reported that "enrollees need plenty of green (money), blue (blood), and lily white".&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Martha|title=Cleaning House At Social Register -- High Society Can`t Pass (blood)|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-08/features/8501080213_1_social-register-letters-names|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|agency=Scripps-Howard News Service|date=February 8, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Listing in the ''Social Register'' has typically been through birth; children born to a person listed in the ''Social Register'' are themselves added.  Persons have also been permitted to apply for inclusion in the Social Register. Such applications require letters of sponsorship from five persons already listed, followed by vetting from the advisory committee. A spokesman for the ''Social Register'''s then 25-member advisory committee, in 1997, described the criteria by which a person might be added to the directory.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The committee, he said, asked themselves "would one want to have dinner with this person on a regular basis"?&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

The [[President of the United States]] and [[Vice-President of the United States]] are, by custom, always added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Widdicombe|first1=Lizzie|title=Original|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/26/original|accessdate=May 6, 2018|work=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion===
Reasons for removal from the ''Social Register'' have traditionally been opaque.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mills|first1=C. Wright|title=The Power Elite|date=1956|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=55-57, 72, 74, 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, historian [[Dixon Wecter]] observed that those excluded tended to be persons unfavorably reported upon in the press and that, as long as one's private life "keeps out of the [newspaper's] columns" the risk of exclusion was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Wright Mills|title=The Power Elite|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1ISDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|year=2000|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Social Register'' spokesman reported, in 1985, that elderly persons who failed to remit the questionnaire sent to listed persons by the register for eleven consecutive years were removed. In addition, someone who marries a person who is not, themselves, listed in the ''Social Register'' is dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Smith, "Cleaning House At Social Register -- High Society Can`t Pass (blood)' ''Providence Journal'' February 08, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1988, about 35,000 individuals were included in the ''Social Register''.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; By 2014, this number was reported to be approximately 25,000.&lt;ref name="rr"/&gt;

== ''Spill: Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity'' ==
''Spill'' is a 2017 book of prose and poetry by Alexis Pauline Gumbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/spill|title=Spill|work=Duke University Press|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a labor of love, and an experimental and poetic work of literary criticism based on the work of [[Hortense Spillers]] and the literary archive of freedom seeking black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexispauline.com/brillianceremastered/bio/|title=Bio|last=Gumbs|first=Alexis Pauline|date=22 Mar 2018|website=alexispauline.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Containing the first syllable of Spillers’ last name, it is an ode to Hortense, the individual, as much as it nurtures–and is nurtured by–black femme folk across vast spatiotemporal locations. The subtitle, "''Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity"'' nods to [[Saidiya Hartman]]’s Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-making in Nineteenth Century America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/scenes-of-subjection-9780195089844?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America|date=1997-09-04|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195089844|series=Race and American Culture|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work pays homage to not just Saidiya, and not just Hortense, in fact not any singular “I” understood within a Cartesian ''"[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" which would subordinate the collective to the individual. “When I turned these phrases, doors opened and everyone came through,” Gumbs writes of her engagement with Spillers’ work, “all the black women writers Spillers wrote about and didn’t write about. All the characters those black women writers acknowledged and ignored.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gumbs converses with black study and black womanhood: past, present, and future.

== Interventions ==
By introducing the concept of writing "with" black women as opposed to writing "about" or "to" an audience, ''Spill'' is testament to the fact that an academic book can be written whilst citing one black woman directly in the text. This is a key intervention, performance, and achievement. Every in-text citation references Spillers’s ''Black, White, and in Color: Essays on American Literature and Culture.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo3624045.html|title=Black, White, and in Color}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Spill’''s endnotes, Gumbs lists a bibliography of “Indirect References and Suggested Reading,” composed entirely of women of color authors––most of whom are black. If nothing else, the following message is clear: read and cite black women. By engaging Spillers through poetry, an omnitemporal, omnipresent black womanhood emerges on the page. 

== Reception ==
Hortense Spillers stated in public conversation: "Nobody else is like Alexis. ...There is really nothing else like this book in my experience as a student, a scholar, a reader, a teacher. The kind of conversation that the text is setting up between poetry and prose, and between a poetic posture and a scholarly posture, I don't think I've ever seen that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=John Hope Franklin Center at Duke University|title=Left of Black with Hortense Spillers and Alexis Pauline Gumbs|date=2017-03-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-EZQ1BTfE&amp;t=1989s|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The La Review of books calls it "''a 'poetilitical praxis,' an unflinching look at what pain has wrought and what fruit might yet be born.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/we-stay-in-love-with-our-freedom-a-conversation-with-alexis-pauline-gumbs/#!|title=We Stay in Love with Our Freedom: A Conversation with Alexis Pauline Gumbs - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spill'' was nominee in the '''29th [[Lambda Literary Awards]],''' held on June 12, 2017 in the category of LGBTQ Non-Fiction.

The book was also reviewed by [[Bitch (magazine)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/spill-scenes-black-feminist-fugitivity/alexis-pauline-gumbs|title=“Spill” Maps a Future In Which Black Women Inherit the Universe|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Star Davis, a teenage orphan, leaves [[foster care]] to save her younger sister Simone Davis, who were split after their mothers death, from physical and [[sexual abuse]] at her foster home. While escaping the tragedy, Star finds muse in a singer/songwriter Alexandra Crane, a New York resident who lives in her celebrity father shadows. Star offers Alex a proposal to escape and leave town with them to become a singing group. They move to [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] and seek refuge in a [[Surrogacy|surrogate mother]], Carlotta Brown, who is a close friend and singing partner of Star and Simone's mother. Carlotta made a promise to look after the girls after their mother's death and would protect them. She persuades the girls to work to make ends meet and wasn't enthusiastic about the girls chasing their dreams but rather attend and be active in church. Finding odds to make their endeavors come true, they struggled to find ways to get a record deal and find hope in a music producer Jahil Rivera, who took a chance with them. Within months developing themselves as rising new artist in Atlanta gaining the name of the group "''Big Troubl''e", they face new multiple troubles in their relationships with each other and with their past coming back to haunt them. However they escape the many troubles of their past and starts to become successful in gaining recognition. 'Big Trouble' soon wins notable competitions that led them fiances to get a major record deal. The girls eventually sign with a record label, Midtown Sound as a favor from The Lyon Family of [[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire Entertainment]] and soon begin their journey as professional R&amp;B/Pop artists ''[[Draft:Take 3 (STAR Characters)|TAKE 3]].'' Subsequently they learn that the music industry is hard to navigate as they sacrifice a lot to stay on top and relevant while they tour with the labels' other artist and find themselves at constant war with each other. 

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
* [[Jude Demorest]] as Star Davis, a tough 17-year-old who spent her childhood in and out of foster homes after the death of her mother Mary. Wanting to pursue a career in music, she forms a girl group, Take 3 (formerly Big Trouble), with her half sister Simone and friend Alex who she met online. Though she has a lot of talent, her egotistical nature tends to bother others. At the start of the third season, she is pursuing a career as a solo artist, and dealing with the consequences of an unexpected pregnancy.&lt;ref name="FutonCritic Details"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/star/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|publisher=Futon Media|title=DevWatch - STAR on FOX|author=|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brittany O'Grady as Simone Davis, Star’s biracial 16-year-old half sister. She is rescued by Star from the abusive foster home in which she was placed five years before. While supportive of her sister's ambitions, Simone has dreams of her own, and will do whatever it takes to achieve them. In Season 2, she ends up in state custody for abusing marijuana. She is then liberated from juvie by Ayanna and ends up marrying Angel in a bid to avoid being recommitted. When he is deported to the [[Dominican Republic]], she leaves Atlanta to be with him.&lt;ref name="FutonCritic Details"/&gt;
* [[Ryan Destiny]] as Alexandra "Alex" Crane, a wealthy 18-year-old who grew up in New York and is Star's best friend. She is looking to step out of the shadows of her famous father and make it on her own, and becomes increasingly involved in political advocacy through her boyfriend Derek. However, she struggles to escape her toxic relationship with her parents, especially her alcoholic mother Rose. This leads her to slowly separate herself from the other girls in order to make a name outside of Take 3, while also dealing with the psychological aftereffects of surviving a plane crash.&lt;ref name="FutonCritic Details"/&gt;
* [[Amiyah Scott]] as Cotton Brown, Carlotta's transgender daughter. She works at her mother's salon and helps the girls kickstart their career. She also has a troubled relationship with Carlotta, as the latter has not accepted her daughter's transition, and is not understanding or fully supportive of the difficulties she faces as a trans woman, although she slowly comes around. After stealing money from her boyfriend Elliot, Cotton is sent to prison, but eventually gets released. She now works with Miss Bruce to manage her mother's salon.
* [[Quincy (actor)|Quincy Brown]] as Derek Jones, Alex's boyfriend who lives next door to the girls. He is a civil rights activist affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, and is committed to civil disobedience. After a car accident leaves him paralyzed from the waist down, their relationship becomes strained. Derek ultimately breaks up with Alex to start a relationship with his physical therapist. However, they eventually get back together.
* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Jahil Rivera (seasons 1–2; guest season 3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/benjamin-bratt-star-lee-daniels-848024|title=Benjamin Bratt to Co-Star in Lee Daniels' Fox Music Drama Pilot|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 1, 2016|date=December 11, 2015|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; a talent manager who believes Take 3 is his ticket back to the top. However, he is hobbled by both a cocaine addiction and money problems.&lt;ref name="FutonCritic Details"/&gt; In Season 2, it is revealed that he faked his death with the help of Carlotta to avoid being framed for Hunter's murder. He ends up forming a new duo with his nephew Angel to compete with Take 3. In the mid-season 2 finale, Angel fires him as manager and he goes on a drug-fueled bender before briefly slipping into a coma.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} He is later shot in a drive-by shooting while shielding Andy and dies in season 2.
* [[Queen Latifah]] as Carlotta Renee Brown, the owner of an Atlanta beauty salon, who worked with Mary Davis in the R&amp;B duo Mixed Harmony back in the 1990s. She becomes a surrogate mother to the three girls, even though she doesn’t approve of their musical dreams. At the end of Season 1, she takes over as manager from Jahil. Her attempts to make Take 3 a success prove largely ineffective as the girls struggle with their own problems, and in the mid-season 2 finale, her salon is burned down. She is eventually promoted to a senior position within Midtown by Ayanna, and eventually gets named as head of newly-formed Gravity Records by Mateo.&lt;ref name="FutonCritic Details"/&gt;
* Miss Lawrence as Miss Bruce (season 2–present; recurring season 1), a [[genderqueer]] hairdresser who works at Carlotta's salon, taking over from her as owner when she commits to managing Take 3.
* [[Luke James]] as Noah Brooks (season 2–present),  a formerly top-selling R&amp;B artist at Midtown Sound looking to make a much-needed comeback after his career collapsed due to alcoholism. He is a charming sweet talker with an ambitious streak, and strikes up a relationship with Alex, Star and Gigi, at first for promotion, but it gradually evolves into an affair. By the third season, he seems to have largely conquered his addictions after a suicide attempt and is working to take more control over his career.
* [[Michael Michele]] as Ayanna Floyd (season 2), the unsympathetic president and CEO of Midtown Sound, the record label that signed Take 3. She forms a maternal bond with Simone, even becoming her legal guardian, but also enables her to maintain her addiction to prescription drugs. At the mid-season 2 finale, she is disgraced and removed as president of Midtown after being caught trying to buy the label out from under her father. She is later restored to her former position after getting him fired for sexual harassment of a Midtown artist. However, she then becomes pregnant with Jahil's child, and decides to sell Midtown to Mateo Ferrara.
* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Brody Dean (season 2), Star’s long lost biological father who re-emerges as the girls get their first taste of fame, but turns out to have an agenda concerning Hunter's death. Upon discovering the abuse Hunter inflicted on Star, however, he leaves town after murdering Hunter's mother, Arlene. He is subsequently electrocuted to death by Arlene's twin sister in revenge.
* [[Lance Gross]] as Maurice Jetter (season 3; recurring season 2)&lt;ref name="Gross-Noszka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spoilertv.com/2018/08/star-episode-301-first-look-photo.html|title=Star - Episode 3.01 - Secrets &amp; Lies - Promotional Photos + Press Release|work=SpoilerTV|date=September 19, 2018|accessdate=September 19, 2018|last=Anop|first=Anop}}&lt;/ref&gt; , A&amp;R at Midtown Records. He helps Carlotta navigate the treacherous currents of the company and his boss, Ayanna, but their relationship is destroyed when she catches him kissing his old girlfriend, Natalie. Maurice then sets his sights on persuading Star to leave Take 3 for a shot at a solo career. He later leaves Midtown when Ayanna sells the company and launches his own label with Cassie.
* [[Matthew Noszka]] as Jackson "Jax" Ellis (season 3; recurring season 2)&lt;ref name="Gross-Noszka"/&gt; , an aspiring musician who became involved romantically with Star. It later turns out that he is the father of her baby.
* [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] as Cassandra Augustine Brown "Cassie" (season 3; recurring season 2)&lt;ref name="BrandyN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/star-brandy-norwood-promoted-series-regular-season-3-fox-series-1202419999/|title='Star': Brandy Norwood Upped To Series Regular For Season 3 Of Fox Series |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=July 2, 2018 |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |last=Petski |first=Denise}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Carlotta's younger sister, who is deeply involved in organized crime.

Smith announced in September 2015 that he was leaving [[Tested.com]] to start his own [[virtual reality]] company which would focus on "some different ways to communicate in VR", saying that he had come to find VR "captivating".&lt;ref name=EG&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/02/will-smith-foo-show-vr-talk-show/ |title= Tech journalist Will Smith launches a talk show in VR |date= 2 April 2016 |accessdate= 28 November 2016 |author= Timothy Seppala |work= Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://medium.com/will-smith/it-s-time-for-me-to-tackle-something-new-1f592b6022c7 |title= It’s Time For Me To Tackle Something New |author= Will Smith |publisher= Medium |date= 10 September 2015 |accessdate= 28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has said that he is interested in "figuring out the native language of VR storytelling" to create content that would be impossible in another format,&lt;ref name=vb/&gt; and is open to trying a number of different styles with their developed technology, from non-interactive linear experiences to full adventure games.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The show is produced through the use of [[HTC Vive]] headsets to capture the participants performances,&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; and is planned to run on a weekly schedule.&lt;ref name=vb/&gt;

In November 2016 Smith announced a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund the show's first, 5 episode, season for release in December, along with more episodes in January and February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/18/will-smith-vr-talk-show-needs-help/ |title= Tech host Will Smith needs help funding his VR talk show |date= 18 November 2016 |accessdate= 28 November 2016 |author= Billy Steele |work= Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://venturebeat.com/2016/11/20/the-foo-show-is-crowdfunding-first-season-of-its-vr-program/ |title= The Foo Show is crowdfunding first season of its VR program |date= 20 November 2016 |accessdate= 28 November 2016 |author= Ian Hamilton |work= VentureBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Plastic Club''' is an arts organization located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Founded in 1897, the Plastic Club is one of the oldest art clubs in the United States. It is located on the 200 block of Camac Street, the "Little Street of Clubs" that was a cultural destination in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hiddencityphila.org/2014/03/little-clubs-on-a-wooden-street/|title=Little Clubs On A Wooden Street {{!}} Hidden City Philadelphia|website=hiddencityphila.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the club's membership also includes men.&lt;ref name=HSP /&gt;

==History==
The Plastic Club was founded by art educator [[Emily Sartain]]. It was founded as an arts organization for women to promote collaboration and members' works, partly in response to the [[Philadelphia Sketch Club]], an exclusively male arts club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Hook|first=Bailey|date=2009-01-01|title=The Early Career of Violet Oakley, Illustrator|jstor=40605220|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first President was the etcher [[Blanche Dillaye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croly|first1=Jane Cunningham|title=The History of the Women's Club Movement in America|date=1898|publisher=Henry G.

[[File:Womendesignersof00ston 0053.jpg|left|thumb|430x430px|Insignia of The Plastics Club]]
The Plastic Club insignia was designed by [[Elisabeth Hallowell Saunders|Elisabeth M.

Beam|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=36|lccn=21001867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club offered art classes, social events, and exhibitions. Its annual masquerade party was called "the Rabbit."&lt;ref name=HSP&gt;[https://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid3106plasticclub.pdf ''The Plastic Club.''] The Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

Early members included [[Elenore Abbott|Elenore Plaisted Abbott]], Paula Himmelsbach Balano, [[Cecilia Beaux]], [[Fern Coppedge]], [[Elizabeth Shippen Green]], [[Charlotte Harding]], [[Frances Tipton Hunter]], [[Violet Oakley]], [[Emily Sartain|Emily]] and Harriet Sartain, [[Jessie Willcox Smith]], and [[Alice Barber Stephens]], many of whom had been students of [[Howard Pyle]].&lt;ref name=HSP /&gt;&lt;ref name="May" /&gt; When the fall exhibition was held in 1898, the works of Pyle's former students—[[Elizabeth Fearne Bonsall]], Elizabeth Shippen Green, Jessie Willcox Smith, Charlotte Harding, Violet Oakley, and Angela De Cora—were singled out.&lt;ref name="May" /&gt;

In 1918, the club was involved in the founding of the Philadelphia School of Occupational Therapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/loc.ark:/13960/t3ws95r99|title=Philadelphia in the world war, 1914-1919.|date=1922-01-01|publisher=New York :}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the connection between [[occupational therapy]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in the United States between the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="peloquin2005"&gt;Peloquin, S.

In 1991 the organization opened its membership to include men. During the 1990s the club also sought to attract art students, offering free membership to two recent graduates a year.&lt;ref name="HSP" /&gt;

The Plastic Club building at 247 South Camac Street was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruedig|first1=Reagan Baydoun|title=The Plastic Club of Philadelphia: A Site Management Study and Building Analysis|date=2007|page=9|url=http://www.plasticclub.org/Thesis-Revised.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective''''' is a limited-edition [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by &amp;Now Books in 2016.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective'' masquerades as a catalogue for a real retrospective of experimental films by a non-existent videographer. Author [[Lance Olsen]] and his wife, videographer Andi Olsen, stage the fake retrospective in galleries in Europe and the U.S. The result is a three-dimensional text: a real place dedicated to an unreal career of an artist named Alana Olsen. From her videos and the texts surrounding them (including this catalogue/novel), the viewer/reader is invited to treat her like a fictional character, inferring her character, development, obsessions, and relationship with her daughter, Aila, who allegedly curates the exhibit, but is in fact another fictive character. The catalogue/novel is made up of critical and biographical essays, stills, and reminiscences about Alana's small body of work (fewer than 20 videos over five decades, some of which have  gone missing) produced in relative anonymity, yet apparently a large influence on artists as varied as [[Lars von Trier]], [[Douglas Gordon]], and [[Martin Arnold]].

Thematically, ''There's No Place Like Time,'' then, forms part of a larger [[conceptual art]] installation that investigates the difficulties inherent in identity and knowledge about the past.

[[File:Girls playing video games in Japan.jpg|thumb|Women playing ''[[The House of the Dead III]]'' in an [[amusement arcade]] in [[Video gaming in Japan|Japan]], 2005.]]

The relationship between '''women and video games''' has received extensive academic, corporate, and social attention. Since the 1990s,&lt;ref name=polygonNoGirls /&gt; female [[gamer]]s have commonly been regarded as a minority, but industry surveys have shown that in time the gender ratio has become closer to equal, and since the 2010s, women have been found to make up about half of all gamers. [[Sexism in video gaming]], including [[sexual harassment]] and the [[Gender representation in video games|underrepresentation of women as characters in games]], is an increasing topic of discussion in [[video game culture]].

Advocates for increasing the number of female gamers stress the problems attending disenfranchisement of women from one of the fastest-growing cultural realms as well as the largely untapped nature of the female gamer market. Efforts to include greater female participation in the medium have addressed the problems of gendered advertising, social stereotyping, and the lack of female video game creators (coders, [[Video game developer|developers]], producers, etc.). The term "'''girl gamer'''" has been used as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]] for female players to describe themselves, but it has also been criticized as counterproductive or offensive.

== Demographics of female players ==
{{See also|Video game#Demographics}}
Female participation in gaming is increasing. According to a [[Entertainment Software Association]] survey, women players in the United States increased from 40% in 2010 to 48% in 2014.&lt;ref name="wsjWomenHalf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaming-no-longer-a-mans-world-1408464249|title=Women Now Make Up Almost Half of Gamers|first1=Sven|last1=Grundberg|first2=Jens|last2=Hansegard|date=20 August 2014|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/22/adult-women-gamers-outnumber-teenage-boys/|title=Study: More women than teenage boys are gamers|date=August 22, 2014|first=Gail |last=Sullivan|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, despite the dominant perception that most gamers are men,&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015" /&gt; the ratio of female to male gamers is balanced, mirroring [[Human sex ratio|the population at large]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/adult-women-largest-gaming-demographic/?fb=ss&amp;prtnr=nerdist|title=Adult women are now the largest demographic in gaming|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=2014|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=Nicholas White|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] study found that among teens, 65% of men and 35% of women describe themselves as daily gamers. This trend was found to be stronger the younger the age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Kahna | first2=Joseph | last3=Middaugh | first3=Ellen | last4=Macgill | first4=Alexandra Rankin | last5=Evans | first5=Chris | last6=Vitak | first6=Jessica | date=16 September 2008 | title=Teens, Video Games, and Civics | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | publication-place=Washington D.C. | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Teens_Games_and_Civics_Report_FINAL.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that while adult men are significantly more likely to play [[Console game|console games]] than adult women, on other platforms they are equally likely to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Jones | first2=Sydney | last3=Macgill | first3=Alexandra Rankin | date=7 December 2008 | title=Pew Internet Project Data Memo | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Adult_gaming_memo.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even in this area, the numbers are moving towards equality: in 2013, [[Nintendo]] reported that half of its users were women,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2013/dudes-38-xbox-users-female-51-kids/ |title= Not just dudes: 38% of Xbox users female, 51% have kids |publisher= Geek Wire |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 another Pew study found that more American women (42%) than men (37%) owned video game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=New survey findings show more women own game consoles than men|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/4/9669110/pew-research-center-female-gamers-statistics|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=Polygon|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that female participation increased with age (61% of women and 57% of men aged 45 to 64 played games).&lt;ref name=variety2013&gt;{{citation |url= https://variety.com/2013/digital/features/womengamers1200683299-1200683299/ |title= Videogame Biz: Women Still Very Much in the Minority |publisher= Variety |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20 |author= Marc Graser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-2015 survey reported by UKIE indicates that 42% of UK gamers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ukie.org.uk/sites/default/files/cms/UK%20Games%20Industry%20Fact%20Sheet%2026%20January%202016.pdf |title= UK Video Games Fact Sheet |publisher= The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment |date= 26 August 2016 |accessdate= 8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data collection ===
In North America, national demographic surveys have been conducted yearly by the U.S. [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA){{efn|The ESA was known as the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) prior to 16 July 2003.}} since at least 1997, and the Canadian [[Entertainment Software Association of Canada]] (ESAC) since 2006. Other organizations including the Australian/New-Zealander [[Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association]] (IGEA) since 2005 collect and publish demographic data on their constituent populations on a semi-regular basis. In Europe, the regional [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]] (ISFE) and numerous smaller national groups like the [[Belgian Entertainment Association]] (BEA), the [[Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van beeld- en geluidsdragers]] (NVPI), and the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) have also begun to collect data on female video gamers since 2012. One-off market research studies and culture surveys have been produced by a wide variety of other sources including some segments of [[video game journalism|the gaming press]] and other culture writers since the 1980s as well.

Not only has the general female gaming population been tracked, but the spread of this population has been tracked over many facets of gaming. For more than 10 years, groups like the ESA and ESAC have gathered data on the gender of video game purchasers, the percentage of women gamers within certain age brackets, and the average number of years women gamers have been gaming. The ESAC in particular has gone into great depth reporting age-related segmentation of the market between both male and female gamers. Other statistics have been collected from time to time on a wide variety of facets influencing the video game market.

=== Historical prevalence ===
*The author of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', [[Toru Iwatani]], attempted to appeal to a wider audience—beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021|title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man|first=Chris|last=Morris|date=March 3, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic Games'' reported in 1982 that it was "the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worley|first=Joyce|title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=May 1982|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30–33 [33]|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-05/Electronic_Games_Issue_03_Vol_01_03_1982_May#page/n31/mode/2up|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the nine arcade games that ''How to Win Video Games'' (1982) discussed, ''Pac-Man'' was the only one with women as a majority of players.&lt;ref name="howtowin"&gt;{{Cite book |title=How to Win Video Games |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1982 |isbn=0-671-45841-8 |pages=82-90 | url=https://archive.org/stream/book_how_to_win_video_games#page/n81/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the sequel [[Ms. Pac-Man]], launched in 1981, featured a female protagonist.
*In May 1982, sociologist Sidney J. Kaplan reported the composition of [[arcade video game]] players to be roughly 80% male and 20% female.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Sidney J. "The Image of Amusement Arcades and Differences in Male and Female Video Game Playing". ''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]''. Vol.17. Pp.93–98. June 1983. {{ISSN|0022-3840}} (Presented as "Amusement Arcades: Video Games and Differences in Male and Female Participation" before the [[North Central Sociological Association]]. Detroit Michigan. May 1982 annual meeting.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''How to Win Video Games'' estimated that men were 95% of ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'' and 90% of ''[[Omega Race]]'' players, while women were half the players of ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and three other games.{{r|howtowin}}
*In 1983, researcher John W. Trinkaus published findings that there were 8 male players to every 3 female players in video game arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Trinkaus, John. W. "Arcade Video Games: An Informal Look", ''[[Psychological Reports]]''. Vol.52, No.2. Pg.586. 1983. {{ISSN|0033-2941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin.

*In 1983, a [[Coleco]] executive stated at the [[Boston Computer Society]] that the target audience for the new [[Coleco Adam|Adam]] home computer, based on its [[ColecoVision]] console, was "boys age 8 to 16 and their fathers. We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases". When audience members booed, he added that the marketing strategy was based on consumer research.&lt;ref name="coleco19830928"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |title=Coleco Presents The Adam Computer System |date=2016-05-03 |publisher=YouTube |orig-year=1983-09-28 |time=44:30 |quote=We're doing that with five new television commercials, which have just been completed, and which will be shown in conjunction with the Adam launch date.

*In 1988, Epyx CEO [[David Shannon Morse]] stated that ''[[California Games]]'' was the first game from his company to appeal equally to boys and girls during [[playtesting]].&lt;ref name="compute198809"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_100_1988_Sep#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Epyx Grows with David Morse | work=Compute! | date=September 1988 | accessdate=November 10, 2013 |author1=Ferrell, Keith |author2=Keizer, Gregg | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, ''[[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]]'' reported that among primary video game users, women represented 21% of all gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Main |first = Peter |title= Column: How high is up for video games?

*A 1993 self-reported survey by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found that 7% of its readers were female.&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=What You've Been Playing Lately | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1993-04-01 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1994, a survey by ''[[Electronic Games]]'' reported that, among American women gamers, the [[Sega Genesis]] was most popular, with 75% ownership, followed by the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] with 58.3% ownership, the [[Game Boy]] with 58%, and [[MS-DOS]] with 50%.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Games'', issue 23 (August 1994), pages 36-42&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1997, Mattel, Inc. released [[Barbie Fashion Designer]], selling over 600,000 copies. The game was considered an important step in advancing an interest in the design of games for women.&lt;ref name="Dickey2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickey|first1=Michele D.|title=Girl gamers: the controversy of girl games and the relevance of female-oriented game design for instructional design|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=37|issue=5|year=2006|pages=785–793|issn=00071013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' stated that the video game market for young girls was "exploding" with titles such as ''[[The American Girls Premiere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8460578.html|title=VIRTUAL EQUALITY?

=== Self-identification as gamers ===
While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as [[gamer]]s, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be [[Gamer#Dedication spectrum|core or hardcore gamers]].&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=SuperData Research - Games data and market research  » Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a [[EEDAR]] survey found that nearly 60 percent of female gamers played on mobile devices and that 63 percent of these female mobile gamers played online multiplayer mobile games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/10/03/nearly-60-of-mobile-gamers-are-women-says-analyst/ | title= Nearly 60% of mobile gamers are women, says analyst|publisher=Vg247.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun 'Gamer' Label}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Girl gamers" or "gamer girls" is a label for women who regularly play games. While some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]],&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; others have described the term as unhelpful,&lt;ref name=ng /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; offensive, and even harmful or misleading. The word "girl", for example, has been seen as an inherently age-linked term that glosses over the difference between women over 30 and younger women.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; The term "girl gamer" rather than simply "gamer" has also been described as perpetuating the minority position of female gamers.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; For many critics uncomfortable with the term "girl gamer", its over-embracement may lead to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; of female gamers as [[Sexual objectification|oversexualized]], casual, and sometimes defiant or confrontational.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Tyler. ''[http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-girl-gamer-stereotypes The Top 7... Girl gamer stereotypes]''. [[GamesRadar]]. 18 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trinder, Aja. ''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/technology/the-box/646926/Not-a-Girl-Gamer-just-a-gamer Not a Girl Gamer just a gamer]''. [[Stuff.co.nz]]. 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn can result in poor game design.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; These critics submit that there is no single definition of a female gamer, and that women gamers are as diverse as any other group of people.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt;

A lack of role models for female gamers&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Brown, Janelle. ''[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1996/11/516 Girl Gamers: Sugar, Spice, Everything Profitable?]''. [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]. 19 November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to a feeling that they should edit their femininity in order to maintain credibility as a gamer, and that they must fit into the caricatured role of the "girl gamer" in order to be accepted.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; Negative stereotyping of female video game players as "girl gamers" quite often comes from male gamers who have themselves been negatively stereotyped by the broader society.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women to distance themselves from the term "[[gamer]]", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt;&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

Controversially, some{{which|date=December 2015}} critics have suggested that the term "gamer" is endemic to the stereotypical male audience and has become outmoded by the industry's changing demographics.&lt;ref name="newstatesmanLoveGames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="slateJournalismOver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/09/gamergate_explodes_gaming_journalists_declare_the_gamers_are_over_but_they.html|title=Gaming Journalism Is Over|first=David|last=Auerbach|date=4 September 2014|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are considerable differences between the [[video game genre]]s preferred, on average, by women and men. According to a 2017 report by the video game analytics company Quantic Foundry, based on surveys of about 270,000 gamers, the following proportions of gamers within a genre are women or men, respectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=Beyond 50/50: Breaking Down The Percentage of Female Gamers By Genre|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2017/01/19/female-gamers-by-genre/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While male audiences prefer fast-paced explosive action and combat,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; women tend to prefer in-game communication&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; and interpersonal relationships (character development and plot dynamics).&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; Women have also been shown to prefer [[role-playing video game]]s to first-person shooters,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; and [[Thomas W. Malone]] of Stanford University found that girls preferred to play a [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]] video game over a darts simulation that boys enjoyed.&lt;ref name="malone198112"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n259/mode/2up | title=What Makes Computer Games Fun? | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=12 August 2015 | author=Malone, Thomas W. | pages=258–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-game activities may also differ between the sexes in games with less linear plots such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. Women are often characterized as preferring story-driven games or constructive games like ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', but this is not universally true.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that thirty percent of women were playing more violent games. Of this 30%, 20% played [[Call of Duty]] and 15% played [[Grand Theft Auto]].&lt;ref name=variety2013/&gt; There has been persistent female interest in [[action-adventure game]]s and [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]] like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; Compared to men, female MMORPG players tend to place more emphasis on socialization relative to achievement-oriented play. This emphasis on socialization extends beyond just the game itself: In a study published in the ''Journal of Communication'' in 2009, researchers found that 61% of female MMORPG players played with a romantic partner, compared to 24% of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri|last1=Williams|first2=Mia|last2=Consalvo|first3=Scott|last3=Caplan|first4=Nick|last4=Yee|title=Looking for Gender: Roles and Behaviors Among Online Gamers|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2009|volume=59|issue=4|pages=700–725|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01453.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data collected by Quantic Foundry in 2016, the primary motivations why people play video games differ, on average, by gender. While men frequently want most to compete with others and destroy things, women often want most to complete challenges and immerse themselves in other worlds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=7 Things We Learned About Primary Gaming Motivations From Over 250,000 Gamers|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2016/12/15/primary-motivations/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While video games and advertising were initially gender-neutral, advertising began to narrow its focus to young boys as a [[target market]] following the [[video game crash of 1983]].&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|last=Lien|first=Tracey|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|title=No Girls Allowed|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overlandBrendan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-218/feature-brendan-keogh/|title=Hackers, gamers and cyborgs|publisher=overland.org.au|date= Autumn 2015|first= Brendan|last=Keogh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial hits such as ''[[Myst]]'' and ''The Sims'' appealed to women, these were nonetheless seen by some as being outside the gaming mainstream. Critic [[Ian Bogost]] opined, "We're looking at where there isn't diversity and we're saying those games are the most valid games."&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls" /&gt; Industry studies on the lack of women in gaming have also suffered at times from biases of interpretation. Kevin Kelly of [[Joystiq]] has suggested that a high degree of [[circular reasoning]] is evident when male developers use focus groups and research numbers to determine what kinds of games girls play. After making a bad game that targets those areas suggested by the marketing research, the game's lack of popularity among both genders is often attributed to the incorrect prejudice that "girls don't play games" rather than the true underlying problems such as poor quality and playability of the game. Whereas market data and research are important to reveal that markets exist, argues Kelly, they shouldn't be the guiding factor in how to make a game that appeals to girls.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; The argument has also been advanced that emphasis on market research is often skewed by the participants in the study. In studies on male gamers of the baby boomer generation, for example, players displayed a marked aversion to violence. The incorrect conclusion that could be drawn from this result—that men dislike violent games—may also be comparable to incorrect conclusions drawn from some female-oriented gaming studies.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; It has been suggested that developers can learn what girls want in a game by observing similarities in how different girl teams will react to and modify a game if given the opportunity.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

[[File:Casio-Loopy-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The [[Casio Loopy]], created by [[Casio]] and released in October 1995 in Japan, was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Leah B.|title=Man Sets Guinness World Record for Largest Game Collection|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/24/man-sets-guinness-world-record-for-largest-game-collection|publisher=[[IGN.com]]|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the past, "[[girl games]]" have frequently been created by adapting girl-oriented material in other media like ''[[The Baby-sitters Club]]'', ''[[Barbie]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; while leaving male-targeted genres such as sport and driving sims, role playing games, and first person shooters to the boys.&lt;ref name=yap /&gt; This has begun to change, however, with the expansion of entrepreneurial feminism and the concept of "games by girls for girls" that has been embraced by companies such as [[Her Interactive]], [[Silicon Sisters]] and [[Purple Moon]]—all video gaming start ups that are female owned and largely female staffed. Creating games designed with regard to sociological, psychological, and cognitive research into girls' cultural interests, such companies hope to awaken a female-only market emphasizing fundamental differences between what girls want and what boys want in gaming.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; The movement to expand the existing market to include women through the development of gender-neutral games has also had a number of advocates. Critics have proposed that female gamers, especially older female gamers&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; prefer gender-neutral games such as ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', or the ''[[King's Quest]]'' games to "girl games".&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;&lt;ref name=yap /&gt;

In examining game play habits at [[Internet café]]s, South Korea has seen a rise in female gamers publicly playing games such as ''[[Lineage (video game)|Lineage]]'', while in other Asian countries this kind of public female gaming has remained rare; similarly, games such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'' are seen as a gender neutral in Japan, but have been regarded as girls' games in the West.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, as in the case of a rising number of female ''Lineage'' players in Korea having led to increased number of female ''Lineage'' players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise of [[Kawaii|cute culture]] and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] and where parents usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

== Skill levels ==
An aspect of game design that has been identified as negatively impacting female interest is the degree of expertise with gaming conventions and familiarity with [[Game controller|game controls]] required to play the game.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; In-game tutorials have been found to bring both sexes into games faster,&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; and new controllers such as Nintendo's [[Wii Remote]], Microsoft's [[Kinect]], and the [[Game controller#Variants|various rhythm game controllers]] have affected demographics by making games easier to pick up and by providing a level playing-field.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; This trend has continued through the efforts of [[Nintendo]] in its release of the [[Wii]].&lt;ref name=watts&gt;Watts, Steve.

In a 2016 study published in the ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,'' researchers found that, after controlling for confounds such as the amount of play time and guild membership, women players advance at least as fast as men do in two MMOs, [[EverQuest II]] and [[cmn:剑侠情缘网络版III|Chevaliers' Romance III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Cuihua|last2=Ratan|first2=Rabindra|last3=Cai|first3=Y.

=== Male behavior towards female gamers ===
{{Main|Sexism in video gaming}}
A 2015 study found that lower-skilled male players of ''[[Halo 3]]'' were more hostile towards teammates with a female voice, but behaved more submissively to players with a male voice. Higher-skilled male players, on the other hand, behaved more positively towards female players. The authors argued the male hostility towards female gamers in terms of [[evolutionary psychology]], writing, "female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pmid=26176699|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=7|pages=e0131613|year=2015|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|pmc=4503401|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1031613K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top female players in [[Esports|competitive gaming]] mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, including such games as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'', and ''[[StarCraft II]]''. Canadian ''StarCraft II'' player [[Sasha Hostyn]] (Scarlett) first gained notoriety in the open qualifiers of IGN ProLeague 4, where she defeated top-tier Korean players. She is well known for being one of the few non-Korean players who can play at the same skill level as male Korean players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|title=Meet Scarlett, the 20-year-old woman who's blazing trails in 'StarCraft'|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=dailydot.com|date=21 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029105206/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|archivedate=29 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Street Fighter x Tekken]]'' player ArisBakhtanians commented on the lack of female players in the community, saying "[[sexual harassment]] is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/is-pervasive-sexism-holding-the-professional-fighting-game-community-back/|title=Is pervasive sexism holding the professional fighting game community back?|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Kyle Orland|date=29 Feb 2012|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/women-are-gamers-but-largely-absent-from-e-sports/|title=Women are gamers, but largely absent from "e-sports"|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Casey Johnston|date=18 Feb 2014|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, organizers for a ''[[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft|Hearthstone]]'' tournament in Finland were criticized for limiting registrations to male players only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft-tournament-ban-female-finland|title=Hearthstone gaming tournament bans women players – ignites 'sexism' row|publisher=theguardian.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the tournament being an offline qualifier for the IeSF World Championship, with its ''Hearthstone'' tournament only open to male players. The winner of the Finnish qualifier would risk not being eligible to participate in the main event if that player were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/02/hearthstone-tournament/|title=Hearthstone tournament explains why women aren't allowed to play [updated]|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IeSF organization ultimately removed the male-only restriction from all of their tournaments, and in turn the Finnish qualifier that originally sparked the controversy also removed this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/03/iesf-removes-male-only-restriction-from-its-e-sports-tournaments/|title=IeSF removes male-only restriction from its e-sports tournaments|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

League of Legends player Maria (Sakuya) Creveling, who at the time was known as Remilia or (Remi), finished first in the 2015 Challenger Series Summer Split along with her teammates Renegades which qualified the team for the 2016 North America League Championship Series (NA LCS) Spring Split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescoreesports.com/lol/news/11201-sakuya-on-returning-to-competitive-lol-and-entering-the-latin-american-scene|title=Sakuya on returning to competitive LoL and entering the Latin American scene|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became both the first female and also the first transgender player to compete professionally in the (NA LCS).

In 1989, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry.&lt;ref name=variety2013 /&gt; In 2013, Gary Carr (the creative director of [[Lionhead Studios]]) predicted that within the next 5 to 10 years, the games development workforce would be 50% female.&lt;ref name=variety2013 /&gt; According to [[Gamasutra]]'s Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made.

=== Support groups for women in the video game industry ===

==== WIGSIG (Women In Games Special Interest Group) ====
WIGSIG is a special interest group of IDGA (International Game Developers Association). The group was formed in order to foster a positive impact on the game industry regarding gender balance in the workplace and/or marketplace. It provides a community, resources, and opportunities for people in the gaming industry. It also works to assess the numbers of the women in the games industry and tracks the changes of these numbers over time. Additionally, it works to recruit women into the games industry and make the field more attractive to women while providing them with the support and connections they need to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.igda.org/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; WIGSIG |publisher=Women.igda.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in Games International ====
Founded in 2005, Women in Games International (WIGI), made up of both female and male professionals, works to promote the inclusion and advancement of women in the global games industry.
WIGI promotes diversity in video game development, publishing, media, education and workplaces, based on a fundamental belief that increased equality and camaraderie among genders can make global impacts for superior products, more consumer enjoyment and a stronger gaming industry.
Women In Games International stands as strong advocates for issues crucial to the success of women and men in the games industry, including a better work/life balance, healthy working conditions, increased opportunities for success and resources for career support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com/ |title=missionstatement |publisher=getwigi.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com|title=WIGI Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WIGJ (Women In Games Jobs) ====
WIGJ is a group that works to recruit, preserve, and provide support for the advancement of women in the games industry by positively and energetically endorsing female role models and providing encouragement and information to women interested in working in the gaming field.  The group was incorporated under the UK's [[Companies Act 2006]] on June 2, 2011 as a "not for profit" or Community Interest Company. Companies in the game development industry have, in recent years, been seeking to balance the gender ratios on development teams and consoles like the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] have seen increased numbers of female players.  In addition to using this growing interest in women in the game developing industry, WIGJ works to put more women in traditional game development with less stigma attached to them.  WIGJ seeks to help women find their place within the growing and rewarding field of game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeningamesjobs.com |title=(WIGJ) for more women in gaming |publisher=Womeningamesjobs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in video game streaming ==

The relationship between women and [[video game live streaming]] has been a rocky one. As streaming services such as YouTube and Twitch became increasingly popular, female gamers began to jump on board. Many notable streamers arose from this streaming revolution including Hafu, Glitterlanced, and Sovitia.

Geneviève Forget, a video game streamer, states in a Kotaku interview that "Harassment does happen in my stream chat from time to time that people start discussing my appearance but it really isn't the focus on my stream. I'd like to think people come back to watch it because it is quite entertaining and I try to interact with the chat as much as possible."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = They're Attractive, They're Women, And They Play Games Live On The Internet. But They're Not 'Camwhores.'|url = http://kotaku.com/5982137/theyre-attractive-theyre-women-and-they-play-games-live-on-the-internet-but-theyre-not-camwhores|website = Kotaku|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female streamers are most often criticized for purportedly using services like Twitch as an alternative to soft-core cam websites to solicit donations by performing sexually suggestive acts. Many male gamers, who dominate the industry, correlate female streamers' success to this behavior. Vivyan Andrew, a 29-year-old twitch streamer addresses this in an interview with Kotaku, ""Yes, if you're a woman and you're streaming, the misconceptions are that you're seeking attention and/or trying to use your 'assets' to receive donations. The misconceptions are very superficial as they invalidate the streamer as a person and what she has to offer beyond her appearance."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Terence Chiang of MMOs.com, writes, "gaming as a 'male hobby' seems to be integrated into our society, with the computer and technology areas commonly being seen as 'Masculine'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Girl Gamers in Streaming and eSports|url = http://mmos.com/editorials/girl-gamers-in-streaming-and-esports|website = MMOs.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This social integration makes the acceptance of female entry into gaming as a legitimate pastime difficult. Research has found that 52% of the gaming world is made up of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 52% of gamers are women – but the industry doesn't know it {{!}} Meg Jayanth|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most remain less visible in the context of the dominant culture, due to the stereotypes between masculinity and gaming.

== Gender disparity ==

Critics attribute the seeming lack of female interest in video games to the negative [[portrayal of women in video games]] and to [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] attitudes common among professional and hardcore gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/22786_To_My_Someday_Daughter.html|author=Geordie Tait|title=To My Someday Daughter|publisher=Starcitygames.com|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[Twitter]] discussion among women working in games, collated under the [[hashtag]] ''#1reasonwhy'', argued that sexist practices such as the oversexualization of female characters, disinterest in topics that matter to women, as well as workplace harassment and unequal pay for men and women were common in the games industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Locker|first=Melissa|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry/|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[TIME magazine]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|title=Here's a Devastating Account of the Crap Women in the Games Business Have to Deal With.

Regarding elements of game design, areas such as gameplay, mechanics, and similar features have been described as gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player.&lt;ref name=hex&gt;[[Stephanie Bendixsen|Bendixsen, Stephanie 'Hex']].

=== Effects ===
The concept that [[video games as art|video games are a form of art]] is one that has begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. [[National Endowment for the Arts]] recognizing games as a form of art in May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. In viewing video games as [[cultural artifact]]s and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity to take part in the cultural dialogue that gaming inspires.&lt;ref name=spark&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan.

''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; From an education perspective, certain [[Video game genres|gaming genres]] particularly lacking in female players such as the [[first-person shooter]] game have been shown to increase spatial skills thereby giving advantages to players of the games that are currently skewed along gender lines.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; Video games have also been determined to provide an easy lead-in to computer literacy for children and correlations have been drawn between male video gaming and the predominance of male workers within the computer industry.&lt;ref name=nzegwu&gt;Nzegwu, Uzoamaka. ''[http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~WS30/WS30F2000/compvideo.html Gender and Computer/Video games]''. [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]]. 15 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing importance of tech jobs in the 21st century and the increased role of online networking, the lack of female video game players suggests a loss of future career opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt;

=== Responses ===
The majority of the people who work on game development teams are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burrows|first=Leah|title=Women remain outsiders in video game industry|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=Globe Correspondent|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified that one of the best ways to increase the percentage of female players comes from the aspect of authorship (either in-game as with ''[[Neopets]]'' and ''[[Whyville]]'', or indirectly as with the [[List of Harry Potter related topics#Video games based on the books and films|''Harry Potter'' series]]' inclusion of Hermione as a playable character subsequent to fan requests).&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;Dillon, Beth A.

In addressing the future of the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal should be directed to women in particular.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosen, Jill|title=The gender divide: video-gaming has been largely a man's- or boy's- world, but with games by and for women, that's starting to change|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 2008|location=Maryland|page=C1|type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include women could be seen in [[Sega]]'s&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; Other examples of this include games like ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', ''[[Remember Me (video game)|Remember Me]]'', and ''[[the Last of Us]]'', which include a female option for the main character.&lt;ref name="Dewitt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewitt|first=James|title=Lara Croft and the Future of Women in Videogames|url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/opinion/lara-croft-and-the-future-of-women-in-videogames|publisher=Thunderboltgames.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales.&lt;ref name="Dring"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dring|first=Christopher|title="Women are the future of gaming" - how Tomb Raider and co have put females back on the agenda|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/women-are-the-future-of-gaming/0111714|publisher=Mcvuk.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of IGN's [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2012|title=Big Games at E3 2012 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2013]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2013|title=Big Games at E3 2013 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Kyle.
