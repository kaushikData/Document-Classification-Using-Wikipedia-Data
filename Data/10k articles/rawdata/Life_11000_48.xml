'''Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri''' (died 755) was an [[Arab]] noble of the [[al-Fihri|Oqbid]] or [[al-Fihri|Fihrid]] family, and ruler of [[Ifriqiya]] (North Africa) from 745 through 755 AD.

==Background==
Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib was a great-grandson of [[Uqba ibn Nafi|Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri]] (Muslim Arab [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|conqueror of North Africa]]). His family, the [[al-Fihri]]s, were among the leading Arab families of the [[Maghreb]].

In 740, Ibn Habib joined his father [[Habib ibn Abi Obeida]] in an Arab expedition across the water to [[Sicily]] in what was possibly the first attempt at a full-scale invasion of the island (rather than a mere raid).  They had a successful landing and laid a brief siege to [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], securing its submission and agreement to pay tribute.  But the break-out of the [[Berber Revolt|Great Berber Revolt]] in the [[Maghreb]] forced the al-Fihris to cease their invasion of Sicily and ship their army quickly back to North Africa to help quell the uprising.  The Arabs were defeated by the Berbers at the [[Battle of Bagdoura]] (near the [[Sebou River|Sebou]]) in 741.  His father was killed in the field of battle, while Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib narrowly escaped and fled across the straits to Spain with the remnant of the Arab army.

While in Spain, Ibn Habib involved himself in the conflicts which immediately erupted between the commanders of the defeated army (the Syrian regiments (''junds'')), and the resident governor, [[Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al-Fihri]]. When the Syrian commander [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri]] tortured and executed the elderly Ibn Qatan, a [[Fihrid]] relative, Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib openly broke with the Syrians and joined the Andalusian (''baladi'') party.  Ibn Habib participated in the Battle of Aqua Portora in August 740 and it was claimed by at least one chronicler (Ibn al-Khatam) that he sought out and fatally wounded Balj in the heat of battle (although the chronicler may have confused Ibn Habib with another Abd al-Rahman, Ibn al-Qama al-Lakhmi, the governor of Narbonne and commander of the Andalusians).
  
In the aftermath, Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib tried to put himself forward as a candidate to replace the governor, but gave up on these ambitions with the arrival of [[Abu l-Hattar al Husam ibn Darar al-Kalbi|Abu al-Khattar ibn Dirar al-Kalbi]] as Andalusian governor in 743, who then set about pacifying the situation.

Soon after, Ibn Habib left Spain and returned to [[Ifriqiya]] (although, apparently, he may have left his son, [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf]], behind).  Ibn Habib may have served briefly under the [[Kairouan]] governor, [[Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi]], in a variety of military capacities, including command of the [[Tunis]] garrison.

==Tunisian Coup==
In late 744, in the turmoil following the death of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]], Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib assembled a small force in [[Tunis]] and declared himself emir of [[Ifriqiya]].  Although urged to quash the usurper, the Ifriqiyan governor [[Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi]] decided it was best to avoid bloodshed and consented to return to Damascus in February 745, rather than put up a fight.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nonetheless, on hearing of the governor's departure, Handhala ibn Safwan laid a curse on the usurper: "Oh God, do not permit Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib to enjoy his usurped authority! Let his partisans derive no profit from this attempt, may they shed each other's blood!  Send against them, O Lord, the most evil of all the men You have created!" &lt;ref&gt;En-Nuweiri, as quoted in "De la Province d'Afrique et du Maghrib, traduite de l'arabe d'En-Noweiri par M. le baron MacGuckin de Slane", 1841, ''Journal Asiatique'', p.451-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Handhala extended the curse to [[Ifriqiya]] itself, the land and its ungrateful people, invoking upon them famine, pestilence and war.  As it turned out, save from some brief seasonal interruptions, Ifriqiya was indeed gripped by pestilence for the next seven years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Ruler in Ifriqiya==
Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib had come to power essentially as the figurehead of the local Arab high military caste, a group much despised and feared by the common population.  Their appetites and aspirations had long been kept in check by the Umayyad governors.  But with the connection with Damascus now cut, the high nobles fully expected to be allowed free rein by 'their' emir.  But they were soon to be disappointed. Ibn Habib wanted a country to govern, and was not prepared to see it fragmented and handed over to the anarchic ways of a feudal nobility.  Ibn Habib consequently faced the prospect of revolts whatever he did - should the nobles be let loose, the people would revolt; hold the reins tight, the nobles would turn against him.  To assert himself Ibn Habib consequently turned to his greatest asset - his family, the [[Fihrid]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

No sooner had Ibn Habib installed himself in [[Kairouan]], then revolts by Arabs and Berbers, began erupting all over the country.  [[Tunis]] was raised to revolt by Orwa ibn ez-Zobeir es-Sadefi, [[Tabinas]] by Ibn Attaf el-Azdi, [[Béja]] was taken by the [[Sanhaja]] Berber rebel Thabit al-Sanhaji, and many more.  Ibn Habib patiently and ruthlessly crushed the revolts one by one.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The most serious threat came from [[Tripolitana]], then governed by Ibn Habib's brother [[Ilyas ibn Habib al-Fihri]].  In 747, Ilyas tried to crack down on the fledgling [[Ibadi]]tes, a puritanical [[Kharijite]] sect, that was growing strong in the cities of [[Djerba]] and [[Tripoli]] and among the Berbers in the surrounding districts.  The Ibadites, inspired by the success of their brethren in [[Hadramut]] and [[Oman]], revolted under the leadership of their imam al-Harith, and seized control of much of Tripolitana (between [[Gabès]] and [[Sirte]]).  But in 752, Ibn Habib dispatched an Ifriqiyan army and reconquered Tripolitana from the Ibadites, driving their remnants south into the [[Nafusa Mountains|Jebel Nafusa]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In Spain, Handhala's deputy [[Abu l-Hattar al Husam ibn Darar al-Kalbi|Abu al-Khattar ibn Dirar al-Kalbi]] had been toppled in 745 and civil war broke out anew between the Syrian ''junds'' and the Andalusian Arabs.  Ibn Habib intervened, dispatching an Ifriqiyan force to help restore order. In 747, Ibn Habib's kinsman (by patronymic record, his son), [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]], was put forward as a compromise candidate and installed as governor of [[al-Andalus]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

But the western Maghreb - Morocco and eastern Algeria - remained out of his reach. Since the [[Berber Revolt]] of 740, the region had descended into tribal anarchy.  It was fragmented and ruled autonomously by Berber tribes.  The Masmuda Berber tribes established an independent state in 744, the [[Berghwata]] confederation, with their own 'prophet' and [[syncretist]] beliefs.  Ibn Habib's attempts to reimpose his rule there failed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 752, perhaps feeling confident in the possession of his lands for the first time, Ibn Habib transported an Ifriqiyan army to [[Sicily]], perhaps hoping to resume the invasion [[Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri|his father]] had interrupted back in 740.  But finding the defences too strong, the expedition limited itself to raiding the coasts and returned to North Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Relations with the Caliphs==
Ibn Habib also tried to repair his relations with [[Damascus]]. After repeated entreaties, he finally managed to secure confirmation in his post from the Umayyad Caliph [[Marwan II]].  Marwan II did not really have any options, for at that time, his resources were engaged in fending off the [[Abbasid Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Egypt fell to the Abbasids in the middle of 750 and the last Umayyad caliph [[Marwan II]] was caught and killed. Hoping the chaos in the east would allow him to carve out an independent state for himself, Ifriqiyan governor Ibn Habib at first sought an understanding with the Abbasids but was soon disappointed by Abbasid demands for submission. Ibn Habib then decided to revolt against the Abbasids and dropped the name of the Abbasid caliph from the Friday prayers, publicly burnt the official robes of state dispatched by the Abbasids and invited the fleeing members of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in his dominions.  Among his guests was the Umayyad prince, [[Abd ar-Rahman I|Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu’awiya ibn Hisham]], a grandson of Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]].  Two other notables, sons of the  caliph [[Al-Walid II|Walid II]], were appointed to high posts, one of them made ''[[qadi]]'' of [[Kairouan]].  His own brother, Ilyas ibn Habib, married into the Umayyad family.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

But not long after their arrival, Ibn Habib changed his mind, probably fearing the prominent Umayyad exiles might serve as a focal point for discontented Arab nobles and challenge his own usurped power.  Ibn Habib expressed sufficient hostility to prompt the fugitive Umayyad prince to flee into the hinterlands of [[Kabylie]] and hide among the [[Nafza]] Berbers (his mother's family).  In 755, Abd al-Rahman left in his African hideout and crossed the straits to Spain and went on to depose [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf al-Fihri]] and found the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Umayyad emirate of Córdoba]] in 756.

In 755, Ibn Habib discovered what he thought was a plot engineered by the Umayyad ''[[qadi]]'', and ordered the arrest and execution of the plotters.  But he didn't count on the revenge of his sister-in-law, the Umayyad wife of his brother Ilyas.  Later that year, urged on by his wife, [[Ilyas ibn Habib al-Fihri|Ilyas]] assassinated his brother Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib in his personal quarters, plunging a dagger into his back while he played with his children.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun (1852:368); Mercier (1888:p.240)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ilyas ibn Habib al-Fihri|Ilyas ibn Habib]] proceeded to assume power for himself, but was himself deposed and killed by the end of the year by Abd al-Rahman's son, [[Habib ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 757, the [[Warfajuma]] Berbers and their [[Sufri]]te allies swept up from southern Tunisia and captured [[Kairouan]], killing Habib and putting an end to the [[al-Fihri|Fihrid]] dynasty.  In the meantime, the  [[Ibadi]]tes that Ibn Habib had driven out of Tripoli came back.  Rallied by their imam [[Abu al-Khattab al-Ma'afiri]] in Jebel Nefusa, the Ibadites recaptured [[Tripoli]] and went on to take [[Kairouan]] from the Berbers in 758, establishing a Kharijite imamate over [[Ifriqiya]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Abiathar and Sidonia''' were a legendary [[Jewish]] priest of [[Mtskheta]] and his daughter. Abiathar is said to have been the first person [[Saint Nino]] converted to [[Christianity]]. An apocryphal account of the life and miracles of Saint Nino is attributed to them. They are regarded as [[saint]]s in the church in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and are mentioned in Bessarion's ''[[The Saints of Georgia]]'' and the ''[[Menologium der Orthodox-Katholischen Kirche des Morgenlandes]]''.

It is said that after the death of Christ his Robe was carried to [[Mtskheta]] by Elioz, Sidonia's brother. After having listened to her brother's grief story about the death of Christ she "clutched the Robe to her breast and immediately gave up her spirit". She was buried with the Saint Robe in her embrace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthochristian.com/107099.html/ KING MIRIAN AND QUEEN NANA OF MTSKHETA, ST. ABIATHAR OF MTSKHETA, AND ST. SIDONIA, DISCIPLE OF ST. NINA] Retrieved on 18 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt; And Abiathar and her daughter Sidonia are also considered to be the first Georgian writers. A lot of pseudo-epigraphical texts that tell about spreading of Christianity in Georgia are ascribed to them.

Their [[feast day]] is celebrated on October 1 in Georgia.

The name "[[Abiathar]]" is derived from a Biblical character, a priest of the Jerusalem Temple in the time of [[King David]].

'''Ambrosius Aurelianus''' ({{lang-cy|Emrys Wledig}}; [[Anglicised]] as '''Ambrose Aurelian''' and called  '''Aurelius Ambrosius''' in the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and elsewhere) was a [[King of the Britons|war leader]] of the [[Romano-British]] who won an important battle against the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the 5th century, according to [[Gildas]].  He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. Eventually he was transformed into the uncle of [[King Arthur]], the brother of Arthur's father [[Uther Pendragon]], and predeceases them both.

Due to Gildas' description of him, Ambrosius is one of the figures called the [[Last of the Romans]].&lt;ref name="Venning"&gt;Venning (2013), Ambrosius Aurelianus, unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

==According to Gildas==
Ambrosius Aurelianus is one of the few people that [[Gildas]] identifies by name in his sermon ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', and the only one named from the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Fletcher_15"&gt;{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=15–16|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn| isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Excidio'' is considered the oldest extant British document about the so-called Arthurian period of [[Sub-Roman Britain]].&lt;ref name="Reno"&gt;Reno (1996), p. 263–282&lt;/ref&gt; Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as:

{{quote|a gentleman who, perhaps alone of the Romans, had survived the shock of this notable storm. Certainly his parents, who had worn the purple, were slain in it. His descendants in our day have become greatly inferior to their grandfather's [''avita''] excellence. Under him our people regained their strength, and challenged the victors to battle. The Lord assented, and the battle went their way.&lt;ref name="Korrel"&gt;Korrel (1984), pp. 5–30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some basic information on Ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage: Ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a [[Christian]] (Gildas says that he won his battles "with [[God]]'s help").&lt;ref name="Fletcher_15" /&gt; Ambrosius' parents were slain by the Saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt;

According to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders. However, this victory was not decisive: "Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens [meaning the Romano-British inhabitants] were victorious."

===Two questions===
Two points in Gildas' description have attracted much scholarly commentary. The first is what Gildas meant by saying Ambrosius' family "had worn the purple". [[Roman emperor]]s and male [[patrician (Ancient Rome)|Patricians]] wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class so the reference to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage. [[Tribune#Tribune of the soldiers|Roman military tribunes]] (''tribuni militum''), senior officers in Roman legions, wore a similar purple band so the reference may be to a family background of military leadership. The tradition was old as the [[toga]]s and [[pallium (Roman cloak)|pallia]] of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band. In the church "the purple" is a euphemism for blood and therefore "wearing the purple" may be a reference to martyrdom&lt;ref name="Gidlow_80"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gidlow|first= Christopher|title= The Reign of Arthur: From History to Legend|pages=80|year= 2004|publisher= Sutton Publishing| isbn = 0-7509-3418-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craughwell"&gt;Craughwell (2008), pp. 106–112&lt;/ref&gt; or a bishop's robe. In addition, in the later [[Roman Empire]] both [[Roman consul]]s and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe. The ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a Roman catalogue of official posts, lists four or five provincial governors in [[Roman Britain]] and two of them were of consular rank. One was the governor of [[Maxima Caesariensis]] and the other that of [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]]. The parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors, whose names were not recorded.&lt;ref name="Ashley"&gt;Ashley (2005), ''De Excidio'', unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by historian Alex Woolf that Ambrosius may have been related to the 5th century Romano-British usurpers [[Marcus (usurper)|Marcus]] or [[Gratian (usurper)|Gratian]] – Woolf expresses a preference based on nomenclature for Marcus.&lt;ref name="Woolf_354"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Woolf |first=Alex |editor1-last=Goetz |editor1-first=Hans-Werner|editor2-last=Jarnut |editor2-first=Jorg |editor3-last=Pohl |editor3-first=Walter |encyclopedia=Regna and Gentes: The relationship between Late Antique and Early Medieval Peoples and Kingdoms in the Transformation of the Roman World |title=The Britons: from Romans to Barbarians |date=2003 |publisher=BRILL |series=The Transformation of the Roman World |volume=13 |isbn=9004125248 |pages=345–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank D. Reno, an Arthurian scholar, has instead argued that the name "Aurelianus" indicates the possible descent of Ambrosius from the [[List of Roman emperors|Roman emperor]] [[Aurelian|Lucius Domitius Aurelianus]] (Aurelian, reigned 270–275).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- possibly &lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; ? --&gt; Aurelian's military campaigns included the conquest of the [[Gallic Empire]]. N. J. Higham suggests that Ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late [[Roman Empire]], such as the [[Theodosian dynasty]]. Branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western Roman provinces like [[Hispania]].&lt;ref name="Higham"&gt;Higham (1994), p. 35–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] instead focuses on the name "Ambrosius". In his view, it seems to suggest connection to [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrosius]], a fourth-century [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Bishop of Milan]], who also served as consular governor in areas of [[Roman Italy]]. The father of the Bishop is sometimes claimed to be a fourth century [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|Praetorian prefect of Gaul]] named Aurelius Ambrosius, whose areas included Britain, though some modern scholars doubt that Saint Ambrosius was related to this man (instead identifying his father with an official named Uranius mentioned in an extract from the [[Theodosian Code]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. D., "The Election of Ambrose of Milan", in: Johan Leemans (ed), ''Episcopal Elections in Late Antiquity'', de Gruyter, 2011, pp 39–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazzarino, S. "Il padre di Ambrogio", ''Helikon'' 13–14, 1973–1974, 111–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazzarino, S., "Storia sociale del vescovo Ambrogio", ''Problemi e ricerche di storia antica'' 4, Rome 1989, 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley suggests that Ambrosius Aurelianus was related to the two Aurelii Ambrosii.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; Tim Venning points out that the name "Aurelianus" could be the result of a [[Adoption in ancient Rome|Roman adoption]]. When a boy was adopted into a new [[gens]] (clan), he received the family names of his new family, plus an additional [[cognomen]] indicating his descent from his original gens/family. The additional cognomen often had the form "-anus". When [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] from gens [[Octavia (gens)|Octavia]] was adopted into the [[Julii Caesares]] family, his new name became Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus.&lt;ref name="Venning"/&gt; In this case, Ambrosius may have been a member of gens [[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelia]] who was adopted by another gens/family. His original name Aurelius became Aurelianus.&lt;ref name="Venning"/&gt;

The second question is the meaning of the word ''avita'': Gildas could have meant "ancestors", or intended it to mean more specifically "grandfather" – thus indicating Ambrosius lived about a generation before the [[Battle of Badon]]. Lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions.

===Gildas' motives===
N. J. Higham wrote a book on Gildas and the literary tropes that he used. He has suggested that Gildas may have had considerable motive for drawing attention to Ambrosius. He was not attempting to write a historical biography of the man, according to Higham, but setting him as an example to his contemporaries. It was essential to the philosophy of Gildas that Briton leaders who achieved victory over the [[barbarian]]s were only able to do so because of divine aid. And only those who had superior Christian virtues were deserving of this aid.&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt; Ambrosius Aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians. In order to fit him in his worldview, Gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as a man of exceptional virtues and obedience to God. He was made to fit Gildas' version of a model leader.&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;

Higham also suggests that the Roman lineage of Ambrosius was highlighted for a reason. Gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the Romans. He was also contrasting him with the subsequent Briton rulers whose reigns lacked in such legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;

===Identifying historical figures===
Gildas is a primary source for the [[Battle of Badon]], yet he never mentions the names of the combatants. Therefore, we cannot know if Ambrosius Aurelianus or his successors took part in the battle.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt; The names of the Saxon leaders in the battle are also not recorded.

The identities of Ambrosius' descendants are unknown, since Gildas never identifies them by name. It is safe to assume that they were Gildas' contemporaries and known to the author.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt; Higham suggests that they were prominent figures of the time. Their lineage and identities were probably sufficiently familiar to his intended audience that they did not have to be named.&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt; The work portrays Ambrosius' descendants as inferior to their ancestor as part of his criticism on rulers of his time, according to Higham. Those criticized were likely aware that the vitriol was intended for them, but probably would not challenge a work offering such a glowing report of their illustrious ancestor.&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;

Mike Ashley suggests that the descendants of Ambrosius could include other people named by Gildas. He favors the inclusion in this category of one [[Aurelius Conanus|Aurelius Caninus]] ("Aurelius the little dog" or "Aurelius the whelp"), whom Gildas accuses of [[parricide]], [[fornication]], [[adultery]], and warmongering. His name "Aurelius" suggests Romano-British descent. The insulting nickname "Caninus" was probably invented by Gildas himself, who similarly insults other contemporary rulers. Due to the name used by Gildas, there are theories that this ruler was actually named [[Conan (disambiguation)|Conan]]/[[Cynan]]/[[Kenan (name)|Kenan]]. Some identify him with [[Cynan Garwyn]], a 6th-century [[Kingdom of Powys|King of Powys]], though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of Gildas or lived one or two generations following him.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt; Another theory is that this ruler did not reign in Britain but in [[Brittany]]. Caninus, in this view, might be [[Conomor]] ("Great Dog"). Conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of Gildas. Conomor was likely from [[Domnonée]], an area of Brittany controlled by British immigrants from [[Dumnonia]]. He might be remembered in British legend as [[Mark of Cornwall]].&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt;

Gildas primarily features the Saxons as barbarian raiders; their invasions involved a slow and difficult process of military conquest. By AD 500, possibly the time described by Gildas, [[Anglo-Saxons]] controlled the [[Isle of Wight]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], and coastal areas of [[Northumberland]] and [[Yorkshire]]. The rest of the former [[Roman Britain]] was still under the control of the local Britons.&lt;ref name="Craughwell"/&gt; Gildas also mentions depopulation of cities and this probably reflects historical facts. [[Londinium]], once a major city, was completely abandoned during the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Craughwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt;

==According to Bede==
[[Bede]] follows Gildas' account of Ambrosius in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'',&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt; but in his ''Chronica Majora'' he dates Ambrosius' victory to the reign of the [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] (474–491).

Bede's treatment of the 5th century history of Great Britain is not particularly valuable as a source. Until about the year 418, Bede could choose between several historical sources and often followed the writings of [[Orosius]]. Following the end of Orosius' history, Bede apparently lacked other available sources and relied extensively on Gildas. Entries from this period tend to be close paraphrases of Gildas' account with mostly stylistic changes.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt; Bede's account of Ambrosius Aurelianus has been translated as following:

{{quote|When the army of the enemy had exterminated or scattered the native peoples, they returned home and the Britons slowly began to recover strength and courage. They emerged from their hiding-places and with one accord they prayed for the help of God that they might not be completely annihilated. Their leader at that time was a certain Ambrosius Aurelianus, a discreet man, who was, as it happened, the sole member of the Roman race who had survived this storm in which his parents, who bore a royal and famous name, had perished. Under his leadership the Britons regained their strength, challenged their victors to battle, and, with God's help, won the day.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt;}}

Bede does not mention the descendants of Ambrosius Aurelianus, nor their supposed degeneracy.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt;

==According to Nennius==
The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', attributed to [[Nennius]],&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; preserves several snippets of lore about Ambrosius. Despite the traditional attribution, the authorship of the work and the period of its writing are open questions for modern historians. There are several extant manuscript versions of the work, varying in details. The most important ones have been dated to between the 9th and the 11th century. Some modern scholars think it unlikely that the work was composed by a single writer or compiler, suggesting that it may have taken centuries to reach its final form,&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt; though this theory is not conclusive.

In Chapter 31, we are told that [[Vortigern]] ruled in fear of Ambrosius. This is the first mention of Ambrosius in the work. According to Frank D. Reno, this would indicate that Ambrosius' influence was formidable, since Vortigern considered him more of a threat than northern invaders and attempts to restore Roman rule in Britain.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; The chapter relates events following the end of Roman rule in Britain and preceding Vortigern's alliance with the Saxons.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

The most significant appearance of Ambrosius is the story about Ambrosius, Vortigern, and the two [[dragon]]s beneath [[Dinas Emrys]], "Fortress of Ambrosius" in Chapters 40–42.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; In this account, Ambrosius is still an adolescent but has supernatural powers. He intimidates Vortigern and the royal [[Magician (fantasy)|magicians]]. When it is revealed that Ambrosius is the son of a [[Roman consul]], Vortigern is convinced to [[Cession|cede]] to the younger man the castle of Dinas Emrys and all the kingdoms in the western part of Britain. Vortigern then retreats to the north, in an area called Gwynessi.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; This story was later retold with more detail by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his fictionalized ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', conflating the personage of Ambrosius with the Welsh tradition of [[Merlin|Myrddin]] the visionary, known for [[Oracle|oracular]] utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native [[Celt]]ic inhabitants of Britain over the [[Saxons]] and the [[Normans]]. Geoffrey also introduces him into the ''Historia'' under the name Aurelius Ambrosius as one of three sons of [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]], along with [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] and [[Uther Pendragon]].

In Chapter 48, Ambrosius Aurelianus is described as "[[Kings of the Britons|king among all the kings of the British nation]]". The chapter records that Pascent, the son of Vortigern, was granted rule over the regions of [[Buellt]] and [[Gwrtheyrnion]] by Ambrosius.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; Finally, in Chapter 66, various events are dated from a [[Battle of Guoloph]] (often identified with [[Middle Wallop|Wallop]], {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} ESE of [[Amesbury]] near [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]]), which is said to have been between Ambrosius and Vitolinus. The author dates this battle as taking place 12 years from the reign of Vortigern.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

It is not clear how these various traditions about Ambrosius relate to each other, or whether they come from the same tradition; it is very possible that these references are to different men with the same name. Frank D. Reno points out that the works call all these men "Ambrosius"/"Emrys". The [[cognomen]] "Aurelianus" is never used.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' dates the battle of Guoloph to "the twelfth year of Vortigern", by which the year 437 seems to be meant.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; This is perhaps a generation before the battle that Gildas says was commanded by Ambrosius Aurelianus.

The text never identifies who Ambrosius's father is, just gives his title as a Roman consul. When an adolescent Ambrosius speaks of his father, there is no suggestion that this father is deceased. The boy is not identified as an orphan.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; The exact age of Ambrosius is not given in his one encounter with Vortigern. Frank D. Reno suggests that he might be as young as 13 years old, barely a teenager.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

It is impossible to know to what degree Ambrosius actually wielded political power, and over what area. Ambrosius and Vortigern are shown as being in conflict in the ''Historia Brittonum'', and some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another, one headed by Ambrosius and the other by Vortigern. [[J. N. L. Myres]] built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in [[Pelagianism]] reflected an actively provincial outlook in Britain and that Vortigern represented the Pelagian party, while Ambrosius led the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] one. Subsequent historians accepted Myers' speculation as fact, creating a narrative of events in 5th century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail. Yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the ''Historia Brittonum'' is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of Vortigern, who at this time were a ruling house in [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]]. This interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about Vortigern in the ''Historia Brittonum'', which include his alleged practice of [[incest]].&lt;ref&gt;As argued by Nora K. Chadwick, "A Note on the Name Vortigern" in ''Studies in Early British History'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1954), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity is somewhat obscure of Ambrosius' last mentioned enemy Vitalinus. Various manuscripts of the ''Historia'' and translations render his name "Guitolin", "Guitolini", "Guitholini", and "Vitalinus". He is mentioned in chapter 49 as one of four sons of [[Gloiu]] and co-founder of the city of [[Gloucester]]. No other background information is given.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; There are theories that Gloiu is also the father of Vortigern, but the genealogy is obscure and no supporting primary text can be found. There have been further attempts to identify Vitalinus with a pro-Vortigern or anti-Roman faction in Britain, opposed to the rise of the Romano-British Ambrosius. However, this is rendered problematic since Vitalinus seems to also have a Romano-British name. The traditional view of pro-Roman and pro-Briton factions active in this period might oversimplify a more complex situation.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

==According to William of Malmesbury==

Ambrosius appears briefly in the ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]]'' ("Deeds of the Kings of the English") by [[William of Malmesbury]]. Despite its name, the work attempted to reconstruct British history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of Gildas, Bede, Nennius, and various chroniclers.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt; The work features Ambrosius as the apparent employer of [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. The relative passage has been translated as following:

{{quote|On the death of [[Vortimer]], the strength of the Britons grew faint, their diminished hopes went backwards; and straight-way they would have come to ruin, had not Ambrosius, the sole survivor of the Romans, who was monarch of the realm after [[Vortigern]], repressed the overweening [[barbarian]]s through the distinguished achievements of the warlike Arthur.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt;}}

William swiftly shifts attention from Ambrosius to Arthur, and proceeds to narrate Arthur's supposed victory in the [[Battle of Badon]].&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt; The narrative is probably the first to connect Ambrosius and Arthur. William had to reconcile the accounts of Gildas and Bede who implied that Ambrosius was connected to the battle, and that of Nennius which clearly stated that it was Arthur who was connected to the battle. He solved the apparent discrepancy by connecting both of them to it. Ambrosius as the king of the Britons and Arthur as his most prominent general and true victor of the battle.&lt;ref name="Korrel"/&gt;

==According to Geoffrey of Monmouth==

Ambrosius Aurelianus appears in later pseudo-chronicle tradition beginning with [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' with the slightly garbled name ''Aurelius Ambrosius'', now presented as son of a King Constantine. King Constantine's eldest son Constans is murdered at Vortigern's instigation, and the two remaining sons (Ambrosius and Uther, still very young) are quickly hustled into exile in [[Brittany]]. (This does not fit with Gildas' account, in which Ambrosius' family perished in the turmoil of the Saxon uprisings.) Later, the two brothers return from exile with a large army when Vortigern's power has faded. They destroy Vortigern and become friends with [[Merlin]].  They go on to defeat the Saxon leader [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengist]] in two battles at Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near [[Sheffield]]) and [[Conisbrough|Cunengeburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=English |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Maisbeli: A Place-Name Problem from Geoffrey of Monmouth |url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/1/11.short?rss=1 |journal=Notes &amp; Queries |volume=259 |pages=11–13 |accessdate=14 July 2014 |doi=10.1093/notesj/gjt236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hengist is executed and Ambrosius becomes king of Britain. However, he is poisoned by his enemies, and Uther succeeds him. The text identifies the poisoner as Eopa.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

Judgements tend to vary wildly of the value of Geoffrey as both a historian and a literary storyteller. He has been praised for giving us detailed information about an otherwise obscure period and possibly preserving information from lost sources, and condemned for an excessive use of [[artistic license]] and possibly inventing stories wholecloth. 
&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; According to Frank D. Reno, whenever Geoffrey uses extant sources, the details in the text tend to be accurate. Assuming that he was also using sources lost to us, it may be difficult to decide which details are truthful. Reno suggests that "individual judgements" have to be made about various elements of his narrative.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

Geoffrey changed the word "Aurelianus" to "[[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelius]]", which is the [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|name]] of a Roman [[gens]].&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; Geoffrey retains the story of Emrys and the dragons from Nennius, but identifies the figure with [[Merlin]]. Merlin is Geoffrey's version of a historical figure known as [[Myrddin Wyllt]]. Myrddin is only mentioned once in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', at an entry dated to 573.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; The name of Merlin is given in Latin as Ambrosius Merlinus. "Merlinus" may have been intended as the [[agnomen]] of a Roman or Romano-British individual like Ambrosius.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

Elements of Ambrosius Aurelianus, the traditional warrior king, are used by Geoffrey for other characters. Ambrosius' supposed supernatural powers are passed to Merlin. Geoffrey's Aurelius Ambrosius rises to the throne but dies early, passing the throne to a previously unknown brother called [[Uther Pendragon]]. The role of warrior king is shared by Uther and his son [[King Arthur|Arthur]].&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

Geoffrey also uses the character [[Gloiu]], father of Vitalinus/Vitolinus, derived from Nennius. He names this character as a son of Claudius and appointed by his father as Duke of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. His predecessor as Duke is called [[Arvirargus]].&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt; Assuming that Claudius and Arvirargus are supposed to be contemporaries, then this Claudius is the Roman emperor [[Claudius|Claudius I]] (reigned 41–54). It seems unlikely that Claudius would have living grandsons in the 5th century, four centuries following his death. Reno suggests that [[Claudius Gothicus|Claudius II]] (reigned 268–270) would be a more likely "Claudius" to have living descendants in the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Reno"/&gt;

Geoffrey for the first time gives a genealogy of Ambrosius. He is supposedly a paternal nephew of [[Aldroenus]], King of Brittany, son of [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine]] and an unnamed Briton noblewoman, adoptive grandson (on his mother's side) of Guthelinus/Vitalinus, [[Bishop of London]], younger brother of [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans]] and older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]].&lt;ref name="Ashley2"&gt;Ashley (2005), Geoffrey of Monmouth, unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; Ambrosius and Uther are supposedly raised by their adoptive maternal grandfather Guthelinus/Vitalinus.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; It is not explicitly covered in Geoffrey's narrative, but this genealogy makes Constantine and his children descendants of [[Conan Meriadoc]], legendary founder of the line of Kings of Brittany. Conan is also featured in the ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', where he is appointed king by Roman emperor [[Magnus Maximus]] (reigned 383–388).&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

Constantine's reign is placed by Geoffrey as following the [[Groans of the Britons]] mentioned by Gildas. Constantine is reported killed by a [[Picts|Pict]] and his reign is followed by a brief succession crisis. Candidates for the throne included all three sons of Constantine, but there were problems for their eventual rise to the throne. Constans was a [[monk]], and Ambrosius and Uther were [[Minor (law)|underage]] and still in their [[Bassinet|cradle]].&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; The crisis is resolved when [[Vortigern]] places Constans on the throne, and then serves as his chief [[adviser]] and [[power behind the throne]]. When Constans is killed by the Picts serving as bodyguards of Vortigern, Vortigern feigns anguish and has the killers executed. Ambrosius is still underage and Vortigern rises to the throne.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

The chronology offered by Geoffrey for the early life of Ambrosius contradicts Gildas and Nennius, and is also internally inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; The [[Groans of the Britons]] involves an appeal by the Britons to Roman consul "Agitius". This person has been identified with [[Flavius Aetius]] (d. 454), [[magister militum]] ("master of soldiers") of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and consul of the year 446. The Groans are generally dated to the 440s and 450s, preceding the death of Aetius. If Geoffrey's Constantine rose to the throne immediately following the Groans, this would place his reign in this period.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Geoffrey gives a 10-year reign for Constantine and his marriage lasts just as long. However the eldest son Constans is clearly older than 10 years by the time his father dies. He is already an adult candidate of the throne and has had time to follow a monastic career. Even assuming there is a time gap between the death of Constantine and the adulthood of Constans, his younger brothers 
have not aged at all in the narrative.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;
Geoffrey's narrative has an underage Ambrosius, if not a literal [[infant]], in the 460s. Accounts deriving from Gildas and Nennius place Ambrosius in the prime of his life in the same decade.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Most telling is that Geoffrey has Vortigern rising to the throne in the 460s. Nennius places the rise of Vortigern in the year 425, and Vortigern is entirely absent in chronologies of the 460s. Suggesting that he was deceased by that time.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

Geoffrey's narrative includes as a major character [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengist]], as leader of the Saxons. He is featured as the father of Queen [[Rowena]] and father-in-law of Vortigern.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Other Saxon characters in the narrative tend to receive less attention by the writer, but their names tend to correspond to Anglo-Saxons known from other sources.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Henginst's supposed son Octa is apparently [[Octa of Kent]], a 6th-century ruler variously connected to Hengist as a son or descendant. The other son, Ebissa, is more difficult to identify. He might correspond to kinsmen of Hengist variously identified as "Ossa", "[[Oisc of Kent|Oisc]]", and "Aesc". A minor Saxon character called "Cherdic" is probably [[Cerdic of Wessex]], though elsewhere Geoffrey calls the same king "Cheldric". He actually may appear under three different names in the narrative, since Geoffrey elsewhere calls the interpreter of Hengist "Ceretic", a variant of the same name.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

Geoffrey, in the last chapters featuring Vortigern, has the king served by [[magician (fantasy)|magicians]]. This detail derives from Nennius, though Nennius was talking about Vortigern's "wise men". They may not have been magic users but advisers.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Vortigern's encounter with Emrys/Merlin takes place in this part of the narrative. Merlin warns Vortigern that Ambrosius and Uther have already sailed for Britain and are soon to arrive, apparently to claim his throne. Ambrosius soon arrives at the head of the army and is crowned king. He besieges Vortigern at the castle of "Genoreu", which is identified with Nennius' ''Cair Guorthigirn'' ("[[Caer|Fort]] [[Vortigern]]") and the [[British hillforts|hillfort]] at [[The Doward|Little Doward]]. Ambrosius burns the castle down and Vortigern dies with it.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

Having killed Vortigern, Ambrosius next turns his attention to Hengist. Despite the fact that no earlier military actions of Ambrosius are recorded, the Saxons have already heard of his bravery and battle prowess. They immediately retreat beyond the [[Humber]].&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Hengist soon amasses a massive army to face Ambrosius. His army counts 200,000 men and Ambrosius' only 10,000 men. He marches south and the first battle between the two armies takes place in Maisbeli, where Ambrosius emerges the victor. It is unclear what location Geoffrey had in mind. Maisbeli translates to "the field of Beli", and could be related to the [[Beli Mawr]] of Welsh legend and/or the [[Celtic deities|Celtic god]] [[Belenus]]. Alternatively it could be a field where the [[Beltane]] festival was celebrated.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Geoffrey could derive the name from a similar-sounding toponym. For example, [[Meicen]] of the [[Hen Ogledd]] ("Old North"), traditionally identified with [[Battle of Hatfield Chase|Hatfield]].&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

Following his defeat, Hengist retreats towards Cunungeburg. Geoffrey probably had in mind [[Conisbrough]], not far from Hatfield.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Ambrosius leads his army against the new position of the Saxons. The second battle is more evenly fought, and Hengist has a chance to achieve victory. However, Ambrosius receives reinforcements from Brittany and the tide of the battle turns in favor of the Britons. Hengist himself is captured by his old enemy [[Eldol, Consul of Gloucester]] and decapitated. Soon after the battle, the surviving Saxon leaders Octa and Eosa submit themselves to Ambrosius' rule. He pardons them and grants them an area near [[Scotland]]. The area is not named, but Geoffrey could be basing this on [[Bernicia]], a real Ango-Saxon kingdom covering areas in the modern borders of Scotland and England.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

Geoffrey closely connects the deaths of Vortigern and Hengist, which are elsewhere poorly recorded. Vortigern historically died in the 450s, and various dates for the death of Hengist have been proposed, between the 450s and the 480s.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; [[Octa of Kent]], the supposed son and heir of Hengist, was still alive in the 6th century and seems to belong to a later historical era than his father. The ruling family of the [[Kingdom of Kent]] were called the Oiscingas, a term identifying them as descendants of [[Oisc of Kent]], not of Hengist. In effect, none of them was likely a literal son of Hengist and their relation to Hengist may have been a later invention. Geoffrey did not invent the connection, but his sources here were likely legendary  in nature.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

Following his victories and the end of the wars, Ambrosius organizes the burial of killed nobles at Kaercaradduc. Geoffrey identifies this otherwise unknown location with Caer-Caradog ([[Salisbury]]). Ambrosius wants a permanent memorial for the slain and assigns the task to Merlin. The result is the so-called Giants' Ring.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt; Its location in the vicinity of Salisbury has led to its identification with [[Stonehenge]], though Geoffrey never uses that term. Stonehenge is closer to [[Amesbury]] than Salisbury. The ring formation of the monument could equally apply to [[Avebury]], the largest stone circle in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ashley2"/&gt;

==In other texts==

In Welsh legend and texts, Ambrosius appears as ''Emrys Wledig'' (Emperor Ambrose).&lt;ref name="Venning"/&gt; The term "Wledig" is a title used by senior royal and military commanders who have achieved notable success. The term is mostly used for famous figures such as [[Cunedda]], though a few obscure figures have been given the title.&lt;ref name="Venning"/&gt;

In [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''Merlin'' he is called simply ''Pendragon'' and his younger brother is named ''Uter'', which he changes to ''Uterpendragon'' after the death of the elder sibling. This is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]''. Wace usually only refers to ''li roi'' ("the king") without naming him, and someone has taken an early mention of Uther's epithet ''Pendragon'' as the name of his brother.

==Possible identification with other figures==

===Riothamus===
[[Léon Fleuriot]] has suggested Ambrosius is identical to [[Riothamus]], a Brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the Goths in France around the year 470. Fleuriot argues that Ambrosius led the Britons in the battle, in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Fleuriot proposed that he then returned to Britain to continue the war against the Saxons.&lt;ref name="leo"&gt;Léon Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l’émigration'', Paris, Payot, 1980, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Place-name evidence==
It has been suggested that the place-name [[Amesbury]] in [[Wiltshire]] might preserve the name of Ambrosius, and that perhaps Amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Applebaum |first=Shimon |date=1983 |title=A note on Ambrosius Aurelianus |journal=Britannia |volume=14 |pages=245–246 |doi=10.2307/526352}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 May 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars such as Shimon Applebaum have found a number of [[Toponymy|place names]] through the Midland dialect regions of Britain that incorporate the ''ambre-'' element; examples include [[Ombersley]] in [[Worcestershire]], [[Ambrosden]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[Amberley, Herefordshire|Amberley]] in [[Herefordshire]], [[Amberley, Gloucestershire|Amberley]] in Gloucestershire, and [[Amberley, West Sussex|Amberley]] in West Sussex. These scholars have claimed that this element represents an [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''amor'', the name of a woodland bird. However, Amesbury in Wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the Midland dialect place names.

==Modern fictional treatments==
The novel ''[[Coalescent]]'' by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] depicts Aurelianus as a general to Artorius, Briton and basis for the legend of [[King Arthur]].  In Baxter's novel, Aurelianus is a minor character who interacts with the book's main Roman-era protagonist, Regina, founder of a (literally) underground matriarchal society.  In the text, he is credited with winning the battle of [[Mount Badon]].

In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', Aurelianus is depicted as the aging High King of Britain, a "too-ambitious" son of a Western Roman Emperor. His sister's son is [[Uther Pendragon]], but Uther is described as not having any Roman blood. Aurelianus is unable to gather the leadership of the native Celts, who refuse to follow any but their own race.

In [[Alfred Duggan]]'s ''[[Conscience of the King (novel)|Conscience of the King]]'', a [[historical novel]] about [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic]], founder of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]], Ambrosius Aurelianus is a Romano-British general who rose independently to military power, forming alliances with various British kings and setting out to drive the invading Saxons from [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. Cerdic, who is of both [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and British descent and raised as a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]], served in his army as a young man. In the novel Ambrosius is a separate character from Arthur, or Artorius, who appears much later as a foe of Cerdic.

In [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'', Aurelianus (most often referred to as "Aurelius") figures prominently, along with his brother Uther, in the second book of the series, ''Merlin''. He is poisoned soon after becoming [[High King]] of Britain, and Uther succeeds him. Lawhead alters the standard Arthurian story somewhat, in that he has Aurelius marry [[Igraine]] and become the true father of King Arthur (Uther does marry his brother's widow, though).

In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Aurelianus (here called "Aurelianus Ambrosius Ventidius") is a major character and is shown as one of the last loyal Romans, going to enormous lengths for his boy emperor [[Romulus Augustus]], whose power has been wrested by the barbarian [[Odoacer]]. In this story, Romulus Augustus marries [[Igraine]], and [[King Arthur]] is their son, and the sword of [[Julius Caesar]] becomes the legendary [[Excalibur]] in Britain. In the 2007 film version of the novel, he is played by [[Colin Firth]] and his name becomes "Aurelianus Caius Antonius". In both he is called "Aurelius" for short.

[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' follows Geoffrey of Monmouth in calling him Aurelius Ambrosius and portrays him as the father of Merlin, the elder brother of Uther (hence uncle of Arthur), an initiate of [[Mithras]], and generally admired by everyone except the Saxons. Much of the book is set at his court in Brittany or during the campaign to retake his throne from Vortigern. Later books in the series show that Merlin's attitude toward Arthur is influenced by his belief that Arthur is a reincarnation of Ambrosius, who is seen through Merlin's eyes as a model of good kingship.

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s ''[[The Lantern Bearers (Sutcliff novel)|The Lantern Bearers]]'' Prince Ambrosius Aurelianus of Arfon drives out the Saxons by training his British army with Roman techniques and making effective use of cavalry. By the end of the novel, the elite [[cavalry wing]] is led by a dashing young warrior prince named Artos, whom Sutcliff postulates to be the real Arthur.

In [[Parke Godwin]]'s ''[[Firelord (novel)|Firelord]]'', Ambrosius is the elderly tribune of the diminished, dispirited and politically fractured [[Legio VI Victrix]] garrisoning [[Hadrian's Wall]]. Near his death, he names Artorius Pendragon (Arthur) as his successor, encourages him to convert the legion to alae (heavy cavalry) and allows the legionnaires to renounce their loyalty to Rome and take personal oaths of fealty to Artorius in order to help unify Brittania politically and to create a military force with the ability to quickly redeploy to meet differing threats.

In [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[Camulod Chronicles]]'', Ambrosius Aurelianus is the half-brother of Caius Merlyn Britannicus (Merlin) and helps him lead the people of Camulod ([[Camelot]]).

In ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', Ambrosius and Arthur are one and the same. [[Moros (Stargate)|Merlin]] was an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]], fleeing from [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] and later Ascends, then comes back in order to build the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]], or Holy Grail, to defeat the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]]. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] also comments that it would mean that Ambrosius was 74 at the [[Battle of Mount Badon]].

'''Amirdovlat Amasiatsi''' ({{lang-hy|Ամիրդովլաթ Ամասիացի}}; {{Circa|1420}}-1496), also called '''Amirdovlat of Amasia''', was a 15th-century [[Armenians|Armenian]] physician and writer. He wrote several works on medicine and science, some aimed at professional audiences and some at ordinary people. All his works were written in [[Middle Armenian]], making them accessible to ordinary readers and not just to scholars.

Amirdovlat was born in [[Amasya|Amasia]] around 1420. He travelled extensively. He wrote the majority of his works in [[Constantinople]], where he was chief physician to [[Mehmed II]].

He died in [[Amasya|Amasia]] or [[Bursa]] on December 8, 1496.

==Chronology==
In Amirdovlat's biography, Vardanyan &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|author=Vardanyan, Stella
|title=Amirdovlat Amasiatsi, a Fifteenth-Century Armenian Natural Historian and Physician
|location=New York|publisher=Caravan Books
|year=1999
|isbn=0-88206-097-X
|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following chronology of his life:

Between 1420-30: born in [[Amasya|Amasia]]

1450's: Attended Armenian schools in [[Amasya|Amatsia]] and [[Sivas|Sebastia]]. Wandered as a travelling physician in Asia and Iran collecting plant samples

End of 1450s: Moved to Constantinople by sea. Further studies of medicinal arts, natural sciences and philosophy.

1460s: Selected as a chief physician to [[Mehmed II]], and received an honorary title of Chief Physician-Ophthalmologist. Afterwards he had ten years of exile and wanderings around Balkan countries.

1470s: Returned to Constantinople, regained his position of a chief physician to [[Mehmed II]], enjoying his confidence until the ruler's death in 1481.

1480s: Returned to his motherland upon the invitation of the son of [[Mehmed II]], Ahmed, who became a ruler of Armasia.

1490: Journeyed to the city of [[Bursa]] for treatment with mineral waters.

1496, December 8: Died in [[Amasya|Amatsia]] (though other sources suggest [[Bursa]]).

==Main works==
Vardanyan also lists his major works:

1459: ''The Lore of Medicine'' and the first ''Akhrabadin'' (an extensive work on pharmacology), manuscript 8871 in the [[Matenadaran]] in Yerevan, Armenia

1466—1469: His major work on clinical medicine, ''The Benefits of Medicine'', written in the city of Phillipopolis, now [[Plovdiv]], in Bulgaria.

1474: ''Folk Medicine'', with elements of magic medicine and astrology.

1481: The second ''Akhrabadin''.

1478-1492: ''Useless for Ignoramuses'', his major compendium of over 3000 plants and plant names, with their medical uses.

The '''Armstrong limit''' or '''Armstrong's line''' is a measure of [[altitude]] above which [[atmospheric pressure]] is sufficiently low that water [[boiling|boils]] at the [[human body temperature|normal temperature]] of the [[human body]]. [[Human]]s absolutely cannot survive above this limit in an unpressurized environment. Above Earth, this begins at {{cvt|18-19|km|mi ft}} above [[sea level]].&lt;ref name="Landis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070927100528/http://www.nasaexplores.com/glossary_view_9-12.php NASAexplores Glossary] on archive.is&lt;/ref&gt; The term is named after [[United States Air Force]] General [[Harry George Armstrong]], who was the first to recognize this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalaviation.blade6.donet.com/components/content_manager_v02/view_nahf/htdocs/menu_ps.asp?NodeID=1096819117&amp;group_ID=1134656385&amp;Parent_ID=-1 NAHF - Harry Armstrong] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118090408/http://nationalaviation.blade6.donet.com/components/content_manager_v02/view_nahf/htdocs/menu_ps.asp?NodeID=1096819117&amp;group_ID=1134656385&amp;Parent_ID=-1 |date=November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant external pressure on the human body is 0.0618 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], 6.3 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]], 47 [[millimeter of mercury|mmHg]], or about 1 [[pounds per square inch|psi]].

At or above the Armstrong limit, exposed body fluids such as [[saliva]], [[tears]], [[urine]], [[blood]] and the liquids wetting the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] within the lungs—but not [[Vascular|vascular blood]] (blood within the circulatory system)—will boil away without a full-body [[pressure suit]], and no amount of breathable [[oxygen]] delivered by any means will sustain life for more than a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Landis"/&gt; The [[NASA]] technical report ''Rapid (Explosive) Decompression Emergencies in Pressure-Suited Subjects'', which discusses the brief accidental exposure of a human to near [[vacuum]], notes the likely result of exposure to pressure below that associated with the Armstrong limit: "The subject later reported that ... his last conscious memory was of the water on his [[tongue]] beginning to boil."&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014072430/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970603.html Ask an Astrophysicist: Human Body in a Vacuum]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the nominal body temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F), water has a [[vapour pressure]] of {{convert|47|mmHg|kPa|disp=flip}}; which is to say, at an ambient pressure of {{convert|6.3|kPa|mmHg}}, the boiling point of water is 37&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F). A pressure of 6.3 kPa—the Armstrong limit—is about 1/16 of the standard sea-level atmospheric pressure of {{convert|101.3|kPa|mmHg}}. Modern formulas for calculating the standard pressure at a given altitude vary—as do the precise pressures one will actually measure at a given altitude on a given day—but a common formula{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} shows that 6.3 kPa is typically found at an altitude of {{convert|19000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Blood pressure is a [[pressure|''gauge'' pressure]], which means it is measured relative to ambient pressure. To calculate blood pressure, it has to be summed to ambient pressure for calculating when blood will boil. This is similar to a flat automobile tire: even with zero gauge pressure, a flat tire at altitude of the Armstrong limit would still have an absolute pressure (pressure relative to a perfect vacuum) of {{convert|63|hPa|psi}}, that is, it will have the ambient pressure at the altitude where the 6.3 kPA pressure level occurs (about {{convert|18|km|ft|abbr=on|-4}}), both inside and out of it. If one inflates the tire to non-zero gauge pressure, this internal pressure is ''in addition'' to those {{convert|6.3|kPa|psi}} of ambient pressure. This means that for an individual with a [[Diastole|diastolic]] low blood pressure, typically {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, the person's blood pressure would be {{convert|107|mmHg|kPa|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, the sum of the blood pressure and the ambient pressure. This pressure is more than twice the ambient pressure at the Armstrong limit. This extra pressure is more than sufficient to prevent blood from outright boiling at {{convert|18|km|ft|abbr=on|-4}} while the heart is still beating.&lt;ref name="Landis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Geoffrey A.

==Hypoxia below the Armstrong limit==
[[Image:Caproni Ca.161 pilot.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Mario Pezzi (aviator)|Mario Pezzi]] a pilot in 1937 wearing a pressure suit to avoid hypoxia.]]
Well below the Armstrong limit, humans typically require supplemental oxygen in order to avoid [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. For most people, this is typically needed at altitudes above 4,500 m (15,000 ft). Commercial jetliners are required to maintain cabin pressurization at a [[cabin altitude]] of not greater than {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on|-3}}. U.S. regulations on [[general aviation]] aircraft (non-airline, non-government flights) require that the minimum required flight crew, but not the passengers, be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends more than half an hour at a cabin altitude above {{convert|3800|m|abbr=on}}. The minimum required flight crew must be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends ''any'' time above a cabin altitude of {{convert|4300|m|abbr=on|-3}}, and even the passengers must be provided with supplemental oxygen above a cabin altitude of {{convert|4500|m|abbr=on|-3}}.&lt;ref name="FAR supplemental oxygen"&gt;{{cite act |title=Code of Federal Regulations |type=Docket  |number=18334, 54 FR 34304 §91.211 Supplemental oxygen|language=English |date=August 18, 1989 |article=Subpart C—Equipment, Instrument, and Certificate Requirements |articletype=Title 14, Chapter I, Subchapter F, Part 91—General Operating and Flight Rules |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2b854616f1b780d1a92192497b708362&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt14.2.91&amp;rgn=div5#se14.2.91_1211 |accessdate={{date|2016-02-06|mdy}} |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parachuting|Skydivers]], who are at altitude only briefly before jumping, do not normally exceed {{convert|4500|m|abbr=on|-3}}.&lt;ref&gt;United States Parachute Association: [http://www.uspa.org/SIM.aspx “Skydiver's Information Manual”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330053831/http://www.uspa.org/SIM.aspx |date=March 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
The Armstrong limit describes the altitude associated with an objective, precisely defined natural phenomenon: the vapor pressure of body-temperature water. In the late 1940s, it represented a new fundamental, hard limit to altitude that went beyond the somewhat subjective observations of human physiology and the time{{nbhyph}}dependent effects of hypoxia experienced at lower altitudes. Pressure suits had long been worn at altitudes well below the Armstrong limit to avoid hypoxia. In 1936, Francis Swain of the [[Royal Air Force]] reached {{convert|15,230|m|ft|abbr=on}} flying a [[Bristol Type 138]] while wearing a pressure suit.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Two years later Italian military officer [[Mario Pezzi (aviator)|Mario Pezzi]] set an [[Flight altitude record|altitude record]] of {{convert|17,083|m|ft|abbr=on}}, wearing a pressure suit in his open-cockpit [[Caproni Ca.161]] biplane even though he was well below the altitude at which body-temperature water boils.

A pressure suit is normally required at around {{convert|15,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} for a well conditioned and experienced pilot to safely operate an aircraft in unpressurized cabins.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden Research Center: [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/research/AirSci/ER-2/pshis.html “A Brief History of the Pressure Suit”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325173807/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/research/AirSci/ER-2/pshis.html |date=March 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an unpressurized cockpit, at altitudes greater than {{convert|11,900|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the physiological reaction, even when breathing pure oxygen is [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]—inadequate oxygen level causing confusion and eventual loss of consciousness. [[Air]] contains 20.95% oxygen. At {{convert|11,900|m|ft|abbr=on}}, breathing pure oxygen through an unsealed face mask, one is breathing the same [[partial pressure]] of oxygen as one would experience with regular air at around {{convert|3600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. At higher altitudes, oxygen must be delivered through a sealed mask with increased pressure, to maintain a physiologically adequate partial pressure of oxygen. If the user does not wear a pressure suit or a counter-pressure garment that restricts the movement of their chest, the high pressure air can cause damage to the lungs.

For modern military aircraft such as the United States’ [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F{{nbhyph}}22]] and [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F{{nbhyph}}35]], both of which have operational altitudes of {{convert|18000|m|abbr=on}} or more, the pilot wears a "counter-pressure garment", which is a [[G-suit|g{{nbhyph}}suit]]&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Reliable sources of actual g-suits do not italicize the “G”. This article properly follows the RSs. --&gt; with high-altitude capabilities. In the event the cockpit loses pressure, the oxygen system switches to a positive-pressure mode to deliver above-ambient-pressure oxygen to a specially sealing mask as well as to proportionally inflate the counter-pressure garment. The garment counters the outward expansion of the pilot’s chest to prevent pulmonary [[barotrauma]] until the pilot can descend to a safe altitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', July 18/25, 2011, p. 35, “Stealthy Danger: Hypoxia incidents troubling Hornets may be related to F{{nbhyph}}22 crashes”&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|solid-phase DNA synthesis]], it differs from [[molecular cloning]] and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) in that it does not have to begin with preexisting [[DNA]] sequences. Therefore, it is possible to make a completely synthetic double-stranded DNA molecule with no apparent limits on either nucleotide sequence or size 

The method has been used to generate functional bacterial or yeast chromosomes containing approximately one million base pairs. Creating novel [[nucleobase]] pairs in addition to the two base pairs in nature could greatly expand the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimoto | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal   | date = 2013 | title = Generation of high-affinity DNA aptamers using an expanded genetic alphabet | journal = Nat.

Commercial gene synthesis services are now available.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the company DNA 2.0 was established in 2003 in Menlo Park, CA as a "synthetic genomics company" ([https://www.dna20.com/company quotated page]).&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches are most often based on a combination of organic chemistry and molecular biology techniques and entire genes may be synthesized "de novo", without the need for template DNA. Gene synthesis is an important tool in many fields of recombinant DNA technology including [[Heterologous expression|heterologous gene expression]], [[vaccine]] development, [[gene therapy]] and molecular engineering. The synthesis of nucleic acid sequences can be more economical than classical cloning and [[mutagenesis]] procedures. It is also a powerful and flexible engineering tool for creating and designing new DNA sequences and protein functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Kosuri_Church_2014.pdf |title=Large-scale de novo DNA synthesis: technologies and applications |author=Sriram Kosuri |author2=George M Church |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Nature Methods |volume=11|pages= 499–507 |date=2014| doi=10.1038/nmeth.2918 |pmid= 24781323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene optimization==

While the ability to make increasingly long stretches of DNA efficiently and at lower prices is a technological driver of this field, increasingly attention is being focused on improving the design of genes for specific purposes. Early in the genome sequencing era, gene synthesis was used as an (expensive) source of [[cDNA]]s that were predicted by genomic or partial cDNA information but were difficult to clone. As higher quality sources of sequence verified cloned cDNA have become available, this practice has become less urgent.

Producing large amounts of [[protein]] from gene sequences (or at least the protein coding regions of genes, the [[open reading frame]]) found in nature can sometimes prove difficult and is a problem of sufficient impact that scientific conferences have been devoted to the topic. Many of the most interesting proteins sought by molecular biologists are normally regulated to be expressed in very low amounts in [[wild type]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redesigning these genes offers a means to improve gene expression in many cases. Rewriting the open reading frame is possible because of the [[degeneracy of the genetic code]]. Thus it is possible to change up to about a third of the nucleotides in an open reading frame and still produce the same protein. The available number of alternate designs possible for a given protein is astronomical. For a typical [[protein sequence]] of 300 [[amino acids]] there are over 10&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt; [[codon]] combinations that will encode an identical protein. Using optimization methods such as replacing rarely used [[codon]]s with more common codons sometimes have dramatic effects. Further optimizations such as removing [[RNA]] [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structures]] can also be included. At least in the case of ''E. coli'', protein expression is maximized by predominantly using codons corresponding to [[tRNA]] that retain amino acid charging during starvation.&lt;ref name=Welch2009&gt;{{cite journal

==Standard methods==

===Oligonucleotide synthesis===
{{Main article|Oligonucleotide synthesis}}
[[Oligonucleotide]]s are chemically synthesized using building blocks called nucleoside [[phosphoramidite]]s. These can be normal or modified nucleosides which have protecting groups to prevent their amines, hydroxyl groups and phosphate groups from interacting incorrectly. One phosphoramidite is added at a time, the 5' hydroxyl group is deprotected and a new base is added and so on. The chain grows in the 3' to 5' direction, which is backwards relative to biosynthesis. At the end, all the protecting groups are removed. Nevertheless, being a chemical process, several incorrect interactions occur leading to some defective products. The longer the oligonucleotide sequence that is being synthesized, the more defects there are, thus this process is only practical for producing short sequences of [[nucleotides]]. The current practical limit is about 200 bp ([[base pair]]s) for an oligonucleotide with sufficient quality to be used directly for a biological application. [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] can be used to isolate products with the proper sequence. Meanwhile, a large number of oligos can be synthesized in parallel on [[DNA microarrays|gene chips]]. For optimal performance in subsequent gene synthesis procedures they should be prepared individually and in larger scales.

===Annealing based connection of oligonucleotides===

Usually, a set of individually designed oligonucleotides is made on automated solid-phase synthesizers, purified and then connected by specific [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Annealing|annealing]] and standard [[Ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] or [[polymerase]] reactions. To improve specificity of oligonucleotide annealing, the synthesis step relies on a set of thermostable DNA [[ligase]] and [[polymerase]] [[enzyme]]s. To date, several methods for gene synthesis have been described, such as the ligation of phosphorylated overlapping oligonucleotides,&lt;ref name=Khorana72/&gt;&lt;ref name=Itakura77/&gt; the Fok I method&lt;ref name=Edge81&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edge MD |title=Total synthesis of a human leukocyte interferon gene |journal=Nature |volume=292 |issue=5825 |pages=756–62 |date=August 1981 |pmid=6167861 |doi=10.1038/292756a0 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Green AR |author3=Heathcliffe GR |display-authors=3 |last4=Meacock |first4=Peter A. |last5=Schuch |first5=Wolfgang |last6=Scanlon |first6=Denis B. |last7=Atkinson |first7=Thomas C. |last8=Newton |first8=Clive R. |last9=Markham |first9=Alexander F. |bibcode = 1981Natur.292..756E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a modified form of [[ligase chain reaction]] for gene synthesis. Additionally, several [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] assembly approaches have been described.&lt;ref name=Fuhrmann99&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fuhrmann M, Oertel W, Hegemann P |title=A synthetic gene coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a versatile reporter in ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' |journal=Plant J. |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=353–61 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10476082 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0960-7412&amp;date=1999&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=353 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually employ oligonucleotides of 40-50 nucleotides long that overlap each other. These oligonucleotides are designed to cover most of the sequence of both strands, and the full-length molecule is generated progressively by overlap extension (OE) PCR,&lt;ref name=Fuhrmann99/&gt; thermodynamically balanced inside-out (TBIO) PCR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mandecki W, Bolling TJ |title=FokI method of gene synthesis |journal=Gene |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=101–7 |date=August 1988 |pmid=3265397 |doi=10.1016/0378-1119(88)90603-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or combined approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stemmer WP, Crameri A, Ha KD, Brennan TM, Heyneker HL |title=Single-step assembly of a gene and entire plasmid from large numbers of oligodeoxyribonucleotides |journal=Gene |volume=164 |issue=1 |pages=49–53 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7590320 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378111995005114 |doi=10.1016/0378-1119(95)00511-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly synthesized genes range in size from 600 to 1,200 bp although much longer genes have been made by connecting previously assembled fragments of under 1,000 bp. In this size range it is necessary to test several candidate clones confirming the sequence of the cloned synthetic gene by automated sequencing methods.

===Limitations===

Moreover, because the assembly of the full-length gene product relies on the efficient and specific alignment of long single stranded oligonucleotides, critical parameters for synthesis success include extended sequence regions comprising secondary structures caused by inverted repeats, extraordinary high or low GC-content, or repetitive structures. Usually these segments of a particular gene can only be synthesized by splitting the procedure into several consecutive steps and a final assembly of shorter sub-sequences, which in turn leads to a significant increase in time and labor needed for its production.
The result of a gene synthesis experiment depends strongly on the quality of the oligonucleotides used. For these annealing based gene synthesis protocols, the quality of the product is directly and exponentially dependent on the correctness of the employed oligonucleotides. Alternatively, after performing gene synthesis with oligos of lower quality, more effort must be made in downstream quality assurance during clone analysis, which is usually done by time-consuming standard cloning and sequencing procedures.
Another problem associated with all current gene synthesis methods is the high frequency of sequence errors because of the usage of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The error frequency increases with longer oligonucleotides, and as a consequence the percentage of correct product decreases dramatically as more oligonucleotides are used.
The mutation problem could be solved by shorter oligonucleotides used to assemble the gene. However, all annealing based assembly methods require the primers to be mixed together in one tube. In this case, shorter overlaps do not always allow precise and specific annealing of complementary primers, resulting in the inhibition of full length product formation.
Manual design of oligonucleotides is a laborious procedure and does not guarantee the successful synthesis of the desired gene. For optimal performance of almost all annealing based methods, the melting temperatures of the overlapping regions are supposed to be similar for all oligonucleotides. The necessary primer optimization should be performed using specialized oligonucleotide design programs. Several solutions for automated primer design for gene synthesis have been presented so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gao X, Yo P, Keith A, Ragan TJ, Harris TK |title=Thermodynamically balanced inside-out (TBIO) PCR-based gene synthesis: a novel method of primer design for high-fidelity assembly of longer gene sequences |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=31 |issue=22 |pages=e143 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14602936 |pmc=275580 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14602936 |doi=10.1093/nar/gng143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young L, Dong Q |title=Two-step total gene synthesis method |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=e59 |year=2004 |pmid=15087491 |pmc=407838 |doi=10.1093/nar/gnh058 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15087491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hillson NH, Rosengarten RD, Keasling JD | title=j5 DNA Assembly Design Automation Software | journal=ACS Synthetic Biology | volume=1 |issue=1 | pages=14–21 | year = 2012 |doi=10.1021/sb2000116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Error correction procedures===

To overcome problems associated with oligonucleotide quality several elaborate strategies have been developed, employing either separately prepared fishing oligonucleotides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoover DM, Lubkowski J |title=DNAWorks: an automated method for designing oligonucleotides for PCR-based gene synthesis |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=e43 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12000848 |pmc=115297 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12000848 |doi=10.1093/nar/30.10.e43}}&lt;/ref&gt; mismatch binding enzymes of the [[MutS-1|mutS family]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Villalobos A, Ness JE, Gustafsson C, Minshull J, Govindarajan S |title=Gene Designer: a synthetic biology tool for constructing artificial DNA segments |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=7|page=285 |year=2006 |pmid=16756672 |pmc=1523223 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-7-285 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/285}}&lt;/ref&gt; or specific endonucleases from bacteria or phages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tian J |title=Accurate multiplex gene synthesis from programmable DNA microchips |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7020 |pages=1050–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15616567 |doi=10.1038/nature03151 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Gong H |author3=Sheng N |display-authors=3 |last4=Zhou |first4=Xiaochuan |last5=Gulari |first5=Erdogan |last6=Gao |first6=Xiaolian |last7=Church |first7=George|bibcode = 2004Natur.432.1050T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, all these strategies increase time and costs for gene synthesis based on the annealing of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides.

Massively parallel sequencing has also been used as a tool to screen complex oligonucleotide libraries and enable the retrieval of accurate molecules. In one approach, oligonucleotides are sequenced on the 454 pyrosequencing platform and a robotic system images and picks individual beads corresponding to accurate sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matzas M |title=High-fidelity gene synthesis by retrieval of sequence-verified DNA identified using high-throughput pyrosequencing |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=28|pages=1291–1294 |year=2010 |pmid=21113166 |doi=10.1038/nbt.1710 |issue=12 |pmc=3579223|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another approach, a complex oligonucleotide library is modified with unique flanking tags before massively parallel sequencing. Tag-directed primers then enable the retrieval of molecules with desired sequences by dial-out PCR.&lt;ref name="Schwartz et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schwartz JJ, Lee C, Shendure J |title=Accurate gene synthesis with tag-directed retrieval of sequence-verified DNA molecules |journal=Nature Methods |volume=9|pages=913–915 |year=2012|doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2137|pmid=22886093 |pmc=3433648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, genes are ordered in sets including functionally related genes or multiple sequence variants on a single gene. Virtually all of the therapeutic proteins in development, such as monoclonal antibodies, are optimized by testing many gene variants for improved function or expression.

==Applications==
Major applications of synthetic genes include synthesis of DNA sequences identified by high throughput sequencing but never cloned into plasmids and the ability to safely obtain genes for vaccine research without the need to grow the full pathogens. Digital manipulation of digital genetic code before synthesis into DNA can be used to optimize protein expression in a particular host, or remove non-functional segments in order to facilitate further replication of the DNA.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Synthesis of DNA allows [[DNA digital data storage]].

=== DNA synthesis and synthetic biology ===
The significant drop in cost of gene synthesis in recent years due to increasing competition of companies providing this service has led to the ability to produce entire [[Plasmid|bacterial plasmids]] that have never existed in nature. The field of [[synthetic biology]] utilizes the technology to produce [[synthetic biological circuit]]s, which are stretches of DNA manipulated to change gene expression within cells and cause the cell to produce a desired product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Synthetic Biology: An Emerging Engineering Discipline|last = Cheng|first = Allen A.|date = 2012|journal = Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|doi = 10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150118|pmid = 22577777|access-date = |first2 = Timothy K.|last2 = Lu|issue = 1|pages = 155–178|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthia and ''Mycoplasma laboratorium''===
{{main article|Mycoplasma laboratorium}}
On June 28, 2007, a team at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] published an article in ''Science Express'', saying that they had successfully transplanted the natural DNA from a ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' bacterium into a ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'' cell, creating a bacterium which behaved like a ''M. mycoides''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5838/632|title=Genome Transplantation in Bacteria: Changing One Species to Another|journal=Science|date=2007-06-28|accessdate=2010-05-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100524161524/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5838/632| archivedate= 24 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no| doi=10.1126/science.1144622| volume=317| pages=632–638| pmid=17600181 | last1 = Lartigue | first1 = C | last2 = Glass | first2 = JI | last3 = Alperovich | first3 = N | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al| bibcode=2007Sci...317..632L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Oct 6, 2007, [[Craig Venter]] announced in an interview with UK's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that the same team had synthesized a modified version of the single [[chromosome]] of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' using chemicals. The chromosome was modified to eliminate all genes which tests in live bacteria had shown to be unnecessary. The next planned step in this ''minimal genome project'' is to transplant the synthesized minimal genome into a bacterial cell with its old DNA removed; the resulting bacterium will be called ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]''. The next day the Canadian [[bioethics]] group, [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued a statement through their representative, [[Pat Roy Mooney|Pat Mooney]], saying Venter's "creation" was "a chassis on which you could build almost anything". The synthesized genome had not yet been transplanted into a working cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/oct/06/genetics.climatechange|publisher=The Guardian|date=2009-10-06|accessdate=2010-05-22|title=I am creating artificial life, declares US gene pioneer | location=London | first=Ed | last=Pilkington| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528172927/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/06/genetics.climatechange| archivedate= 28 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2010, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] reported that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the bacterium ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' from a computer record, and transplanted the synthesized genome into the existing cell of a ''Mycoplasma capricolum'' bacterium that had its DNA removed. The "synthetic" bacterium was viable, i.e. capable of replicating billions of times. The team had originally planned to use the ''M. genitalium'' bacterium they had previously been working with, but switched to ''M. mycoides'' because the latter bacterium grows much faster, which translated into quicker experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5981/958.pdf |title=Synthetic Genome Brings New Life to Bacterium |accessdate=2010-05-21 | work=Science | date=2010-05-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525181700/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5981/958.pdf| archivedate= 25 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter describes it as "the first species.... to have its parents be a computer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8695992.stm |title=How scientists made 'artificial life' |accessdate=2010-05-21 | work=BBC News | date=2010-05-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130601101628/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8695992.stm| archivedate=June 1, 2013&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformed bacterium is dubbed "[[Synthia]]" by ETC. A Venter spokesperson has declined to confirm any breakthrough at the time of this writing.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Yeast chromosome==
In March 2014, [[Jef Boeke]] of the Langone Medical Centre at New York University, published that his team has synthesized one of the ''[[S. cerevisiae]]'' 16 yeast chromosomes, the chromosome III, that he named synIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shukman | first=David | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26768445 | title=Scientists hail synthetic chromosome advance | work=BBC News | date=27 March 2014 | accessdate=2014-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='SyntIII 2014'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Total Synthesis of a Functional Designer Eukaryotic Chromosome | journal=Science | date=March 27, 2014 | last=Annaluru | first=Narayana | doi=10.1126/science.1249252 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/03/26/science.1249252 | accessdate=2014-03-28 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2014Sci...344...55A | volume=344 | pages=55–58 | pmid=24674868 | pmc=4033833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure involved replacing the genes in the original chromosome with synthetic versions and the finished human made chromosome was then integrated into a yeast cell. It required designing and creating 273,871 base pairs of DNA – fewer than the 316,667 pairs in the original chromosome. In March 2017 6 yeast chromosomes were reported to have been synthesized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6329 Special Issue SYNTHETIC YEAST GENOME] ''Science'' 10 March 2017

==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==
{{Main article|Base pair#Unnatural base pair (UBP)|l1=Unnatural base pair}}
DNA sequences have been described which use newly created [[nucleobases]] to form a third base pair, in addition to the two base pairs found in nature, A-T ([[adenine]] – [[thymine]]) and G-C ([[guanine]] – [[cytosine]]). Multiple research groups have been searching for a third base pair for DNA, including teams led by [[Steven A. Benner]], [[Philippe Marliere]], and [[Ichiro Hirao]].&lt;ref name="Fikes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/ |title=Life engineered with expanded genetic code |last=Fikes |first=Bradley J. |date=May 8, 2014 |work=San Diego Union Tribune |accessdate=8 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001048/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/ |archivedate=9 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some new base pairs have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Zunyi|date=August 15, 2011|title=Amplification, Mutation, and Sequencing of a Six-Letter Synthetic Genetic System|journal=J.

In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP).&lt;ref name="Malyshev PNAS 20120724"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Efficient and sequence-independent replication of DNA containing a third base pair establishes a functional six-letter genetic alphabet |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=24 July 2012 |last=Malyshev |first=Denis A. |last2=Dhami |first2=Kirandeep |last3=Quach |first3=Henry T. |last4=Lavergne |first4=Thomas |last5=Ordoukhanian |first5=Phillip |volume=109 |issue=30 |pages=12005–12010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205176109 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/30/12005 |accessdate=2014-05-11 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10912005M |pmid=22773812 |pmc=3409741}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two new artificial nucleotides or ''Unnatural Base Pair'' (UBP) were named '''[[d5SICS]]''' and '''[[dNaM]]'''.

The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of [[amino acid]]s which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="Fikes"/&gt; The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses.&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html?hpw&amp;rref=business&amp;_r=0| title=Scientists Add Letters to DNA’s Alphabet, Raising Hope and Fear |last=Pollack| first=Andrew| date=May 7, 2014| work=New York Times| accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blagoje Parović''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Благоје Паровић; 1903—1937) was a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia]].

== Early life ==
Parović was born on 25 March 1903 in the village [[Biograd, Nevesinje|Biograd]] near [[Nevesinje]]. His parents Petar and Gospava were poor peasants. Both of his parents died in his early years. His mother died first while his father Petar was killed by soldiers of Austria-Hungary during the [[First World War]].

'''Cell culture''' is the process by which [[cell (biology)|cells]] are grown under controlled conditions, generally outside their natural environment. After the cells of interest have been [[Cell isolation|isolated from living tissue]], they can subsequently be maintained under carefully controlled conditions.  These conditions vary for each cell type, but generally consist of a suitable vessel with a substrate or medium that supplies the essential nutrients ([[amino acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s), [[growth factor]]s, [[hormone]]s, and gases ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and regulates the physio-chemical environment ([[Buffer solution|pH buffer,]] [[osmotic pressure]], [[temperature]]). Most cells require a surface or an artificial substrate (adherent or monolayer culture) whereas others can be grown free floating in culture medium ([[suspension culture]]). The lifespan of most cells is genetically determined, but some cell culturing cells have been “transformed” into immortal cells which will reproduce indefinitely if the optimal conditions are provided.

In practice, the term "cell culture" now refers to the culturing of cells derived from multicellular [[eukaryote]]s, especially [[animal]] cells, in contrast with other types of culture that also grow cells, such as [[plant tissue culture]], [[fungus|fungal]] culture, and [[microbiological culture]] (of [[microbe]]s). The historical development and methods of cell culture are closely interrelated to those of [[tissue culture]] and [[organ culture]]. [[Viral culture]] is also related, with cells as hosts for the viruses.

The [[laboratory]] technique of maintaining live '''[[Immortalised cell line|cell lines]]''' (a population of cells descended from a single cell and containing the same genetic makeup) separated from their original tissue source became more robust in the middle 20th century.&lt;ref name="NIHtimeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?db=Books&amp;rid=mboc4.table.1516|title=Some landmarks in the development of tissue and cell culture|accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioteach.ubc.ca/Bioengineering/CellCulture/index.htm|title=Cell Culture|accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 19th-century English physiologist [[Sydney Ringer]] developed [[Lactated Ringer's solution|salt solutions]] containing the chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium suitable for maintaining the beating of an isolated [[heart (biology)|animal heart]] outside the body.&lt;ref name="whonamedit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2119.html|title=Whonamedit - Ringer's solution|publisher=whonamedit.com|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, [[Wilhelm Roux]] removed a portion of the [[medullary plate]] of an [[embryo]]nic chicken and maintained it in a warm saline solution for several days, establishing the principle of tissue culture.&lt;ref name="Zurlow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caat.jhsph.edu/pubs/animal_alts/appendix_c.htm|title=Animals and alternatives in testing|accessdate=2006-04-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060225204205/http://caat.jhsph.edu/pubs/animal_alts/appendix_c.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ross Granville Harrison]], working at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] and then at [[Yale University]], published results of his experiments from 1907 to 1910, establishing the methodology of [[tissue culture]].&lt;ref name="Schiff"&gt;{{cite web | last = Schiff | first = JudithAnn | name-list-format = vanc | title=An unsung hero of medical research | url = http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_02/old_yale.html|accessdate=2006-04-19 | work = [[Yale Alumni Magazine]] | date = February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell culture techniques were advanced significantly in the 1940s and 1950s to support research in [[virology]]. Growing viruses in cell cultures allowed preparation of purified viruses for the manufacture of [[vaccine]]s. The injectable [[Salk polio vaccine|polio vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk]] was one of the first products mass-produced using cell culture techniques. This vaccine was made possible by the cell culture research of [[John Franklin Enders]], [[Thomas Huckle Weller]], and [[Frederick Chapman Robbins]], who were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for their discovery of a method of growing the virus in monkey [[kidney]] cell cultures.

==Concepts in mammalian cell culture==

===Isolation of cells===
{{Main|Cell isolation}}Cells can be [[Cell isolation|isolated]] from tissues for ''[[ex vivo]]'' culture in several ways. Cells can be easily purified from blood; however, only the [[white blood cell|white cells]] are capable of growth in culture. Cells can be isolated from solid tissues by digesting the extracellular matrix using [[enzyme]]s such as [[Matrix metalloproteinase|collagenase]], [[trypsin]], or [[pronase]], before agitating the tissue to release the cells into suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Voigt N, Pearman CM, Dobrev D, Dibb KM | title = Methods for isolating atrial cells from large mammals and humans | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | volume = 86 | pages = 187–98 | date = September 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.07.006 | pmid = 26186893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Louch WE, Sheehan KA, Wolska BM | title = Methods in cardiomyocyte isolation, culture, and gene transfer | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–98 | date = September 2011 | pmc = 3164875 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.012 | pmid = 21723873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, pieces of tissue can be placed in [[growth medium|growth media]], and the cells that grow out are available for culture. This method is known as [[explant culture]].

Cells that are cultured directly from a subject are known as primary cells. With the exception of some derived from tumors, most [[primary cell culture]]s have limited lifespan.

An established or [[immortalised cell line|immortalized cell line]] has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely either through random mutation or deliberate modification, such as artificial [[Gene expression|expression]] of the [[telomerase]] [[gene]].
Numerous cell lines are well established as representative of particular [[cell type]]s.

===Maintaining cells in culture===
For the majority of isolated primary cells, they undergo the process of [[senescence]] and stop dividing after a certain number of population doublings while generally retaining their viability (described as the [[Hayflick limit]]).

Cells are grown and maintained at an appropriate [[temperature]] and gas mixture (typically, 37&amp;nbsp;°C, 5% [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] for mammalian cells) in a [[cell incubator]]. Culture conditions vary widely for each cell type, and variation of conditions for a particular cell type can result in different [[phenotype]]s.[[File:DMEM cell culture medium.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of DMEM cell culture medium]]Aside from temperature and gas mixture, the most commonly varied factor in culture systems is the cell [[growth medium]]. Recipes for growth media can vary in [[pH]], glucose concentration, [[growth factors]], and the presence of other nutrients. The growth factors used to supplement media are often derived from the serum of animal blood, such as [[fetal bovine serum]] (FBS), bovine calf serum, equine serum, and porcine serum. One complication of these blood-derived ingredients is the potential for contamination of the culture with viruses or [[prion]]s, particularly in medical [[biotechnology]] applications. Current practice is to minimize or eliminate the use of these ingredients wherever possible and use human [[platelet lysate]] (hPL).&lt;ref&gt;Hemeda, H., Giebel, B., Wagner, W. (16Feb2014) Evaluation of human platelet lysate versus fetal bovine serum for culture of mesenchymal stromal cells Cytotherapy p170-180 issue 2 doi.10.1016&lt;/ref&gt; This eliminates the worry of cross-species contamination when using FBS with human cells. hPL has emerged as a safe and reliable alternative as a direct replacement for FBS or other animal serum. In addition, [[chemically defined medium|chemically defined media]] can be used to eliminate any serum trace (human or animal), but this cannot always be accomplished with different cell types. Alternative strategies involve sourcing the animal blood from countries with minimum [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]/[[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|TSE]] risk, such as The United States, Australia and New Zealand,&lt;ref name="bovalco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bovalco.com/blog/post/view/9|title=Post - Blog &amp;#124; Boval BioSolutions, LLC|publisher=bovalco.com|accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using purified nutrient concentrates derived from serum in place of whole animal serum for cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selbornebiological.com/products/lipimax.htm|title=LipiMAX purified lipoprotein solution from bovine serum|year=2006|work=Selborne Biological Services|accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plating density''' (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a critical role for some cell types. For example, a lower plating density makes [[granulosa cell]]s exhibit estrogen production, while a higher plating density makes them appear as [[progesterone]]-producing [[theca lutein cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Portela VM, Zamberlam G, Price CA | title = Cell plating density alters the ratio of estrogenic to progestagenic enzyme gene expression in cultured granulosa cells | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 2050–5 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19324349 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells can be grown either in suspension or adherent cultures. Some cells naturally live in suspension, without being attached to a surface, such as cells that exist in the bloodstream. There are also cell lines that have been modified to be able to survive in suspension cultures so they can be grown to a higher density than adherent conditions would allow. Adherent cells require a surface, such as tissue culture plastic or [[microcarrier]], which may be coated with extracellular matrix (such as collagen and laminin) components to increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are adherent. Another type of adherent culture is organotypic culture, which involves growing cells in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment as opposed to two-dimensional culture dishes. This 3D culture system is biochemically and physiologically more similar to ''in vivo'' tissue, but is technically challenging to maintain because of many factors (e.g. diffusion).

===Cell line cross-contamination===
{{Main|List of contaminated cell lines}}
Cell line cross-contamination can be a problem for scientists working with cultured cells.&lt;ref name="Neimark"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neimark J | title = Line of attack | journal = Science | volume = 347 | issue = 6225 | pages = 938–40 | date = February 2015 | pmid =  25722392| pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.347.6225.938 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6225/938.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest anywhere from 15–20% of the time, cells used in experiments have been misidentified or contaminated with another cell line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drexler HG, Dirks WG, MacLeod RA | title = False human hematopoietic cell lines: cross-contaminations and misinterpretations | journal = Leukemia | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1601–7 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10516762 | doi = 10.1038/sj/leu/2401510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drexler HG, MacLeod RA, Dirks WG | title = Cross-contamination: HS-Sultan is not a myeloma but a Burkitt lymphoma cell line | journal = Blood | volume = 98 | issue = 12 | pages = 3495–6 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11732505 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V98.12.3495 | url = http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11732505 | format = Free full text }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cabrera CM, Cobo F, Nieto A, Cortés JL, Montes RM, Catalina P, Concha A | title = Identity tests: determination of cell line cross-contamination | journal = Cytotechnology | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 45–50 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 19002894 | pmc = 3449683 | doi = 10.1007/s10616-006-9013-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with cell line cross-contamination have even been detected in lines from the [[NCI-60 panel]], which are used routinely for drug-screening studies.&lt;ref name=chatterjee&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatterjee R | title = Cell biology. Cases of mistaken identity | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5814 | pages = 928–31 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17303729 | doi = 10.1126/science.315.5814.928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liscovitch M, Ravid D | title = A case study in misidentification of cancer cell lines: MCF-7/AdrR cells (re-designated NCI/ADR-RES) are derived from OVCAR-8 human ovarian carcinoma cells | journal = Cancer Letters | volume = 245 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 350–2 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16504380 | doi = 10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major cell line repositories, including the [[ATCC (company)|American Type Culture Collection]] (ATCC), the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) and the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), have received cell line submissions from researchers that were misidentified by them.&lt;ref name=chatterjee/&gt;&lt;ref name=macleod&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod RA, Dirks WG, Matsuo Y, Kaufmann M, Milch H, Drexler HG | title = Widespread intraspecies cross-contamination of human tumor cell lines arising at source | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 555–63 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10508494 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19991112)83:4&lt;555::AID-IJC19&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such contamination poses a problem for the quality of research produced using cell culture lines, and the major repositories are now authenticating all cell line submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masters JR | title = HeLa cells 50 years on: the good, the bad and the ugly | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–9 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 12001993 | doi = 10.1038/nrc775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ATCC uses [[short tandem repeat]] (STR) [[DNA profiling|DNA fingerprinting]] to authenticate its cell lines.&lt;ref name=dunham&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunham | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Guthmiller | first2 = P. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2008 | title = Doing good science: Authenticating cell line identity | url = http://www.promega.com/cnotes/cn022/cn022_15.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Cell Notes | volume = 22 | issue =  | pages = 15–17 | access-date = 2008-10-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081028200822/http://www.promega.com/cnotes/cn022/cn022_15.pdf# | archive-date = 2008-10-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address this problem of cell line cross-contamination, researchers are encouraged to authenticate their cell lines at an early passage to establish the identity of the cell line. Authentication should be repeated before freezing cell line stocks, every two months during active culturing and before any publication of research data generated using the cell lines. Many methods are used to identify cell lines, including [[isoenzyme]] analysis, [[human lymphocyte antigen]] (HLA) typing, chromosomal analysis, karyotyping, morphology and [[STR analysis]].&lt;ref name=dunham/&gt;

One significant cell-line cross contaminant is the immortal [[HeLa]] cell line.

===Other technical issues===
As cells generally continue to divide in culture, they generally grow to fill the available area or volume. This can generate several issues:

*Nutrient depletion in the growth media
*Changes in pH of the growth media
*Accumulation of [[apoptosis|apoptotic]]/[[necrosis|necrotic]] (dead) cells
*Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate cell cycle arrest, causing cells to stop dividing, known as [[contact inhibition]].
*Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate [[cellular differentiation]].
*[[Heredity|Genetic]] and [[epigenetic]] alterations, with a [[natural selection]] of the altered cells potentially leading to overgrowth of abnormal, culture-adapted cells with decreased differentiation and increased proliferative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen HT, Geens M, Spits C | title = Genetic and epigenetic instability in human pluripotent stem cells | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–205 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23223511 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulation of cultured cells===
Among the common manipulations carried out on culture cells are media changes, passaging cells, and transfecting cells.
These are generally performed using tissue culture methods that rely on [[aseptic technique]]. Aseptic technique aims to avoid contamination with bacteria, yeast, or other cell lines. Manipulations are typically carried out in a [[biosafety hood]] or [[laminar flow cabinet]] to exclude contaminating micro-organisms. [[Antibiotics]] (e.g. [[penicillin]] and [[streptomycin]]) and antifungals (e.g.[[amphotericin B]]) can also be added to the growth media.

As cells undergo metabolic processes, acid is produced and the pH decreases. Often, a [[pH indicator]] is added to the medium to measure nutrient depletion.

====Media changes====
In the case of adherent cultures, the media can be removed directly by aspiration, and then is replaced. Media changes in non-adherent cultures involve centrifuging the culture and resuspending the cells in fresh media.

====Passaging cells====
{{main|Passaging}}
Passaging (also known as subculture or splitting cells) involves transferring a small number of cells into a new vessel. Cells can be cultured for a longer time if they are split regularly, as it avoids the senescence associated with prolonged high cell density. Suspension cultures are easily passaged with a small amount of culture containing a few cells diluted in a larger volume of fresh media. For adherent cultures, cells first need to be detached; this is commonly done with a mixture of [[trypsin]]-[[EDTA]]; however, other enzyme mixes are now available for this purpose. A small number of detached cells can then be used to seed a new culture. Some cell cultures, such as [[RAW cells]] are mechanically scraped from the surface of their vessel with rubber scrapers.

====Transfection and transduction====
{{main|Transfection|Transformation (genetics)}}
Another common method for manipulating cells involves the introduction of foreign DNA by [[transfection]]. This is often performed to cause cells to [[gene expression|express a gene]] of interest. More recently, the transfection of [[RNAi]] constructs have been realized as a convenient mechanism for suppressing the expression of a particular gene/protein. DNA can also be inserted into cells using viruses, in methods referred to as [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], [[infection]] or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Viruses, as parasitic agents, are well suited to introducing DNA into cells, as this is a part of their normal course of reproduction.

===Established human cell lines===
[[File:HeLa Hoechst 33258.jpg|thumb|right|Cultured [[HeLa]] cells have been stained with [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] turning their [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] blue, and are one of the earliest human cell lines descended from [[Henrietta Lacks]], who died of cervical cancer from which these cells originated.]]
Cell lines that originate with humans have been somewhat controversial in [[bioethics]], as they may outlive their parent organism and later be used in the discovery of lucrative medical treatments. In the pioneering decision in this area, the [[Supreme Court of California]] held in ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]'' that human patients have no property rights in cell lines derived from organs removed with their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/51C3d120.htm |title=Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 C3d 120 |publisher=Online.ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Hybridoma}}
It is possible to fuse normal cells with an [[immortalised cell line]]. This method is used to produce [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]]. In brief, lymphocytes isolated from the [[spleen]] (or possibly blood) of an [[immunization|immunised]] animal are combined with an immortal myeloma cell line (B cell lineage) to produce a [[hybridoma]] which has the antibody specificity of the primary lymphocyte and the immortality of the myeloma. [[Selective growth medium]] (HA or HAT) is used to select against unfused myeloma cells; primary lymphoctyes die quickly in culture and only the fused cells survive. These are screened for production of the required antibody, generally in pools to start with and then after single cloning.

===Cell strains===
A cell strain is derived either from a primary culture or a cell line by the selection or cloning of cells having specific properties or characteristics which must be defined. Cell strains are cells that have been adapted to culture but, unlike cell lines, have a finite division potential. Non-immortalized cells stop dividing after 40 to 60 population doublings&lt;ref name=Hayflick&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayflick L | title = A brief history of the mortality and immortality of cultured cells | journal = The Keio Journal of Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–82 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9785764 | doi = 10.2302/kjm.47.174 | series = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after this, they lose their ability to proliferate (a genetically determined event known as senescence).&lt;ref name=Worthington&gt;{{cite web|title=Worthington tissue guide|url=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/tissuedissociation/glossary.html|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of cell culture==
Mass culture of animal cell lines is fundamental to the manufacture of viral [[vaccines]] and other products of biotechnology. Culture of human stem cells is used to expand the number of cells and differentiate the cells into various somatic cell types for transplantation.&lt;ref name="pmid14643607"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qian L, Saltzman WM | title = Improving the expansion and neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through culture surface modification | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 25 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 1331–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14643607 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stem cell culture is also used to harvest the molecules and exosomes that the stem cells release for the purposes of therapeutic development.&lt;ref name="pmid27190588"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maguire G | title = Therapeutics from Adult Stem Cells and the Hype Curve | journal = ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–3 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27190588 | pmc = 4867479 | doi = 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.6b00125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological products produced by [[recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) technology in animal cell cultures include [[enzymes]], synthetic [[hormones]], immunobiologicals ([[monoclonal antibodies]], [[interleukins]], [[lymphokines]]), and [[anticancer agents]]. Although many simpler proteins can be produced using rDNA in bacterial cultures, more complex proteins that are [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] (carbohydrate-modified) currently must be made in animal cells. An important example of such a complex protein is the hormone [[erythropoietin]]. The cost of growing mammalian cell cultures is high, so research is underway to produce such complex proteins in insect cells or in higher plants, use of single embryonic cell and [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] embryos as a source for direct gene transfer via particle bombardment, transit [[gene expression]] and [[confocal microscopy]] observation is one of its applications. It also offers to confirm single cell origin of somatic embryos and the asymmetry of the first cell division, which starts the process.

Cell culture is also a key technique for [[cellular agriculture]], which aims to provide both new products and new ways of producing existing agricultural products like milk, [[Cultured meat|(cultured) meat]], fragrances, and rhino horn from cells and microorganisms. It is therefore considered one means of achieving [[animal-free agriculture]]. It is also a central tool for teaching cell biology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieto D, Aparicio G, Sotelo-Silveira JR | title = Cell migration analysis: A low-cost laboratory experiment for cell and developmental biology courses using keratocytes from fish scales | journal = Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 475–482 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28627731 | doi = 10.1002/bmb.21071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell culture in two dimensions===
Research in [[tissue engineering]], [[stem cells]] and [[molecular biology]] primarily involves cultures of cells on flat plastic dishes. This technique is known as two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, and was first developed by [[Wilhelm Roux]] who, in 1885, removed a portion of the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in warm saline for several days on a flat glass plate. From the advance of [[polymer]] technology arose today's standard plastic dish for 2D cell culture, commonly known as the [[Petri dish]]. [[Julius Richard Petri]], a German [[bacteriologist]], is generally credited with this invention while working as an assistant to [[Robert Koch]]. Various researchers today also utilize culturing [[laboratory flasks]], conicals, and even disposable bags like those used in [[single-use bioreactor]]s.

Aside from Petri dishes, scientists have long been growing cells within biologically derived matrices such as collagen or fibrin, and more recently, on synthetic hydrogels such as polyacrylamide or PEG. They do this in order to elicit phenotypes that are not expressed on conventionally rigid substrates. There is growing interest in controlling [[matrix stiffness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Discher DE, Janmey P, Wang YL | title = Tissue cells feel and respond to the stiffness of their substrate | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5751 | pages = 1139–43 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16293750 | doi = 10.1126/science.1116995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that has led to discoveries in fields such as:

'''3D cell culture in scaffolds'''

Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as ''in vitro'' cell substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types including Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF), transformed Human Carcinoma (HEp-2), and Mink Lung Epithelium (MLE) would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that, as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more histotypic rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317053872_NIH_PHASE_I_FINAL_REPORT_FIBROUS_SUBSTRATES_FOR_CELL_CULTURE_R3RR03544A|title=NIH Phase I Final Report: Fibrous Substrates for Cell Culture (R3RR03544A) (PDF Download Available)|last=Simon|first=Eric M. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1988 | website=ResearchGate|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 3D cell culture in hydrogels ====
As the natural [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) is important in the survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cells, different hydrogel culture matrices mimicking natural ECM structure are seen as potential approaches to in vivo –like cell culturing.&lt;ref name="pmid19472329"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tibbitt MW, Anseth KS | title = Hydrogels as extracellular matrix mimics for 3D cell culture | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 103 | issue = 4 | pages = 655–63 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19472329 | pmc = 2997742 | doi = 10.1002/bit.22361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogels are composed of interconnected pores with high water retention, which enables efficient transport of substances such as nutrients and gases. Several different types of hydrogels from natural and synthetic materials are available for 3D cell culture, including animal ECM extract hydrogels, protein hydrogels, peptide hydrogels, polymer hydrogels, and [[3D cell culture in wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel|wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel]].

==== 3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation ====
The [[3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation|3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation]] method (MLM) is the application of growing 3D tissue by inducing cells treated with magnetic nanoparticle assemblies in spatially varying magnetic fields using neodymium magnetic drivers and promoting cell to cell interactions by levitating the cells up to the air/liquid interface of a standard petri dish. The magnetic nanoparticle assemblies consist of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and the polymer polylysine. [[3D cell culture|3D cell culturing]] is scalable, with the capability for culturing 500 cells to millions of cells or from single dish to high-throughput low volume systems.

===Tissue culture and engineering===
Cell culture is a fundamental component of [[tissue culture]] and [[tissue engineering]], as it establishes the basics of growing and maintaining cells ''in vitro''.
The major application of human cell culture is in stem cell industry, where [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s can be cultured and cryopreserved for future use. Tissue engineering potentially offers dramatic improvements in low cost medical care for hundreds of thousands of patients annually.

===Vaccines===
[[Vaccine]]s for [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], and [[chickenpox]] are currently made in cell cultures. Due to the [[H5N1]] [[pandemic]] threat, research into using cell culture for [[influenza vaccine]]s is being funded by the [[United States]] government. Novel ideas in the field include [[recombinant DNA]]-based vaccines, such as one made using human [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] (a common cold virus) as a vector,&lt;ref name=quickie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/news/wireservice/0,70102-0.html?tw=wn_index_7 |publisher=Wired.com|title=Quickie Bird Flu Vaccine Created|date=2006-01-26|author=Reuters|work=Wired|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao W, Soloff AC, Lu X, Montecalvo A, Nguyen DC, Matsuoka Y, Robbins PD, Swayne DE, Donis RO, Katz JM, Barratt-Boyes SM, Gambotto A | title = Protection of mice and poultry from lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus through adenovirus-based immunization | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 1959–64 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16439551 | pmc = 1367171 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.80.4.1959-1964.2006 | url = http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/4/1959 | publisher = American Society for Microbiology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of non-mammalian cells==
Besides the culture of well-established immortalised cell lines, cells from primary explants of a plethora of organisms can be cultured for a limited period of time before sensecence occurs (see Hayflick's limit). Cultured primary cells have been extensively used in research, as is the case of fish keratocytes in cell migration studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapanan JL, Cooper KE, Leyva KJ, Hull EE | title = Collective cell migration of primary zebrafish keratocytes | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 326 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–65 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24973510 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.06.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee J, Jacobson K | title = The composition and dynamics of cell-substratum adhesions in locomoting fish keratocytes | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 110 ( Pt 22) | pages = 2833–44 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9427291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant cell culture methods===
{{main|Plant tissue culture}}
{{see also|Tobacco BY-2 cells}}
Plant cell cultures are typically grown as cell suspension cultures in a liquid medium or as [[Callus (cell biology)|callus cultures]] on a solid medium. The culturing of undifferentiated plant cells and calli requires the proper balance of the plant growth hormones [[auxin]] and [[cytokinin]].

===Insect cell culture===

Cells derived from [[Drosophila melanogaster]] (most prominently, [[Schneider 2 cells]]) can be used for experiments which may be hard to do on live flies or larvae, such as [[biochemistry|biochemical studies]] or studies using [[siRNA]]. Cell lines derived from the army worm ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', including [[Sf9 (cells)|Sf9]] and [[Sf21]], and from the cabbage looper ''[[Trichoplusia ni]]'', [[High Five cells]], are commonly used for expression of recombinant proteins using [[baculovirus]].

===Bacterial and yeast culture methods===
{{main|Microbiological culture}}
For bacteria and yeasts, small quantities of cells are usually grown on a solid support that contains nutrients embedded in it, usually a gel such as agar, while large-scale cultures are grown with the cells suspended in a nutrient broth.

===Viral culture methods===
{{main|Viral culture}}
The culture of viruses requires the culture of cells of mammalian, plant, fungal or bacterial origin as hosts for the growth and replication of the virus. Whole [[wild type]] viruses, [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] viruses or viral products may be generated in cell types other than their natural hosts under the right conditions. Depending on the species of the virus, infection and [[viral replication]] may result in host cell lysis and formation of a [[viral plaque]].

'''Christina Sverresdatter''' (Norwegian: ''Kristin Sverresdatter''; died 1213) was a medieval Norwegian [[princess]] and titular [[queen consort]], spouse of co-regent [[Philip Simonsson]], the Bagler party pretender to the throne of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Helle [http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Kristin_Sverresdatter/utdypning Kristin Sverresdatter] Store norske leksikon. Retrieved May 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://nbl.snl.no/Filippus_Simonsson
|title=   Filippus Simonsson, Baglerkonge|publisher=    Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=   Narve Bjørgo  |accessdate= May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Christina was the daughter of King [[Sverre of Norway|Sverre Sigurdsson]] of [[Norway]] and his queen consort, [[Margaret of Sweden, Queen of Norway|Margaret of Sweden]]. Her father died in 1202 and her mother returned to Sweden, forced to leave Christina behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=  https://nbl.snl.no/Sverre_Sigurdsson|title=  Sverre Sigurdsson, Konge|publisher=    Norsk biografisk leksikon |author=    Knut Helle
|accessdate= May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1209, she married Norwegian aristocrat [[Philip Simonsson]]. She died in labour giving birth to their first child, a son, who also died soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Filippus_Simonsson|title=   Filippus Simonsson|publisher=     Lokalhistoriewiki  |accessdate= May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her marriage was arranged as a part of reconciliation between the [[Bagler]] and [[Birkebeiner]] factions during the period of the [[Civil war era in Norway]]. In 1208, with no side looking able to achieve victory, Bishop [[Nikolas Arnesson]] together with other bishops of the Church,  brokered a peace deal between the Baglers and the Birkebeiners. At the settlement of [[Kvitsøy]], the Birkebeiner candidate for king, [[Inge II of Norway]], recognized Philip's rule over the eastern third of the country in return for Philip giving up any claim to the title of king and recognizing King Inge as his overlord. To seal the agreement, Philip was to marry King Sverre's daughter, Christina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Nikolas_Arnesson|title=    Nikolas Arnesson|publisher=     Lokalhistoriewiki  |accessdate= May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic context==
In Norwegian civil war era it was usual that several royal sons fought against each other over power in Norway. The civil war period of Norwegian history lasted from 1130 to 1240. During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between Church and King. There were then two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into parties of Bagler and Birkebeiner. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the head figure of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party.

==Olympic Mascot==
[[Håkon and Kristin]] are the mascots of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. Håkon is named after [[Haakon IV of Norway]] and Kristin after Christina of Norway.&lt;ref name=olympic.org&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Assets/OSC%20Section/pdf/QR_4F.pdf Les mascottes des Jeux Olympiques d’hiver d’Innsbruck 1976 à Sotchi 2014] Olympic.org {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Freedman''' (April 26, 1898 – December 8, 1936) (aged 38) was a Romanian-born American playwright and biographer who became known as the "King of the Gag-writers" in the early days of radio.

==Biography==
David Freedman was born in [[Botoşani]], Romania, as the first child and only son of Sara and Israel Freedman. Israel, a political refugee, immigrated with his young family to the United States in 1900, where four years later, David's sister Sophie became the first Freedman born in the U.S.

Freedman graduated from the [[City College of New York]] in 1918, the first in his family to complete a formal education beyond high school. In September 1918, he married Beatrice (née Rebecca Goodman), a fellow New Yorker, who was born in the city on September 27, 1899 (her parents had fled from [[Chişinău|Kishinev]], [[Russian Empire]]). Within five years they had three sons, [[Benedict Freedman|Benedict]] (1919–2012), [[David Noel Freedman|David Noel]] (1922–2008), and [[Toby Freedman|Toby]] (1924–2011). A decade later their only daughter, who is now known as Laurie Hayden, arrived.

From 1924 on, Freedman was a self-employed writer. He created [[Sketch comedy|sketch]]es for musicals and had shows on Broadway almost every year from 1926 through 1937. His novel ''Mendel Marantz'' (1925) featured a Jewish father who frequently made witty remarks. His first play, ''Mendel, Inc.'', debuted in 1929. When radio replaced [[vaudeville]], Freedman—who already enjoyed a reputation as a popular, versatile writer—was ready for the new medium. He was prolific, creating as many as six entertainment programs a week for several years, and eventually worked in movies as well.

Freedman was also a biographer and wrote about industry insiders. His first biography, the [[Eddie Cantor]] memoir ''My Life Is in Your Hands'' (1928, "as told to" Freedman by Cantor), became a bestseller and was nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Freedman and Cantor collaborated on a biography of showman [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]; ''Ziegfeld: the Great Glorifier'' (1934) was used for the film ''Ziegfeld Follies'' (1945). Similarly, ''Phantom Fame'' which he co-authored with the impresario [[Harry Reichenbach]] (1931) became the basis for the movie ''[[The Half-Naked Truth]]'' (1932).

In the mid-1930s Freedman contributed scripts for short comedies produced by [[Educational Pictures]] in New York. The best known is probably ''[[Blue Blazes]]'' (1936), starring [[Buster Keaton]] as an inept fireman.

Freedman suffered a massive heart attack on the evening of Monday, December 7, 1936. By the morning of the 8th, he was dead, leaving Beatrice, his partner of 18 years, and their four children, who ranged in age from just under 17 to just under 2 years.

==Legacy==

According to his son, David Noel Freedman, it is unlikely that contemporary audiences would appreciate most of David Freedman's work (though his jokes about the stock market still ring true), because most of his jokes played on the peculiarities and sensitivities of his era. Freedman's stories, however, have a timeless quality. As the years passed, his family honored his memory with the [[posthumous work|posthumous]] publication of ''The Intellectual Lover'' (1940, repr. 2007), a collection of short stories that were originally published individually between 1922 and 1928.

Of the countless pieces Freedman wrote between 1920 and 1936, ''Mendel, Inc.'' (1929) is the only fully realized play. A product of the beginning of his brief career, it embodies the mature thoughts of a humorist/playwright. On June 2, 2004, this classic comedy about an immigrant Jewish family living in the uncertain times of 1929 of the Lower East Side was read to a packed house at the North Coast Repertory Theatre in [[Solana Beach, California]]. ''Mendel, Inc.'' was also used as the basis for the 1932 [[Warner Brothers]] film ''The Heart of New York.'' a vehicle for Jewish-dialect comedians [[Smith and Dale]], with comedian George Sidney as the pivotal character, Mendel Marantz.

Four books by Freedman were translated into Russian and published by Ogonyok in 1926; they enjoyed tremendous popularity for a short while, and Mendel's witty "definitions" were quoted everywhere, but within a year they were eclipsed by the comic writings of [[Ilf and Petrov]] and [[Mikhail Zoshchenko]], and were soon forgotten, although [[Anatoly Rybakov]] has a character quote Mendel in ''[[Children of the Arbat]]'' (set in 1933).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Lazarovich, "[http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2001/0522/win/leyzerovich.htm Забытый писатель – Давид Фридман]" (A forgotten writer – David Freedman), ''Vestnik'', May 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His novel "Mendel Marantz" was republished as an audiobook in Russian in 2011, narrated by noted actors Klara Novikova, Leonid Kanevsky and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lechaim.ru/ARHIV/238/mokrousov.htm A. Mokrousov, Review of D. Freedman's Mendel Marantz]&lt;/ref&gt;

A fictionalized version of David Freedman appears as "Harry Goldhandler" in the novel ''[[Inside, Outside]]'' by [[Herman Wouk]].

[[File:Omar Bongo crop.jpg|right|thumb|The state funeral of [[Omar Bongo]] was attended by representatives from at least forty nations.]]
The second [[List of heads of state of Gabon|President of Gabon]], '''[[Omar Bongo]]''', died in [[Spain]] on June 8, 2009, after having suffered from [[colorectal cancer]]. A month of mourning&lt;ref name="Gabon qualifier postponed after Bongo death"/&gt; and [[state funeral]], spanning June 11 to 18th, followed.

After Bongo's [[death]] his coffin was flown from [[Barcelona]] to [[Libreville]] on June 11. It was driven to his presidential palace beside the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and displayed until June 16. A state funeral service was conducted on June 16, the day that interim President [[Rose Francine Rogombé]] declared a [[national day of mourning]]. The service was attended by dignitaries from at least forty nations. After the service, Bongo's coffin was transported to his home village for burial on June 18.

At the time of his death, Bongo had been [[Africa]]'s longest serving leader.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt;

==[[Death]]==
On 7 May 2009, the Gabonese Government announced that Bongo had temporarily suspended his official duties and taken time off to mourn his wife and rest in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/gabonNews/idAFL7100180820090507 Gabon's Bongo suspends activities to mourn wife] ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported by the international media that he was seriously ill, and undergoing treatment for cancer in hospital in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/21/bongo-gabon-president-seriously-ill Gabon's President Bongo 'seriously ill' in Spanish hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gabonese government maintained that he was in Spain for a few days of rest following the "intense emotional shock" of his wife's death, but eventually admitted that he was in a Spanish clinic "undergoing a medical check up".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.bibalex.org:80/web/20110216164131/http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-05-22-voa32.cfm?rss=politics Gabonese President Is In Spanish Clinic]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] eventually released a report stating among other things that "While Gabon's government has insisted he was undergoing a medical check-up, several sources said he was being treated for intestinal cancer, which they said had reached an advanced stage".&lt;ref name="zimbio"&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/President+Omar+Bongo/articles/43/Gabon+summons+French+ambassador+over+death Gabon summons French ambassador over death reports]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2009, unconfirmed reports quoting French media and citing sources "close to the French government" reported that Bongo had died in Spain.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/5478816/Omar-Bongo.html Omar Bongo Obituary] ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8088382.stm Gabon leader Bongo's death denied]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Gabon denied the report. The same day, Gabon's prime minister released a statement saying that he went to visit Bongo in the Quiron clinic in Barcelona: "This morning I visited the President, accompanied by the President of the National Assembly, the Foreign Minister, the head of the President's cabinet and senior members of the presidential family and after a meeting with the medical team we can confirm that the President is alive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=97434&amp;sectionid=351020506 "Longest-serving African leader still rules"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister made no comment on Bongo's state of health after reading the statement to reporters.&lt;ref name="zimbio"/&gt;

On 8 June 2009, the [[BBC]] released a report stating that: "The Spanish foreign affairs ministry backed [Prime Minister] Ndong's assertion, saying: "We have confirmed that he [President Bongo] is alive. We have no further information about him". But later on Monday, reports in the Spanish media said Bongo had died shortly after Ndong's news conference. They quoted members of Bongo's entourage as saying the African leader had died at 12:00 GMT. The clinic and the Spanish government refused to comment on the latest reports".&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

The Gabonese government maintained its position. [[Sky News]] reported that a Gabonese government spokesman had stated: "The presidency of the Gabonese Republic would like to stress that the President of the Republic, the Head of State, His Excellency Omar Bongo is not dead ... He is continuing his holiday in Spain following his checkup at the Quiron Clinic in Barcelona". Speaking on French radio, spokesman Raphael N'Toutoume added that the latest update he had heard was good news – and that Bongo was preparing to leave the clinic. "We are getting ready to welcome the head of state. No date for his return has been set", the spokesman said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Gabon-Denies-Omar-Bongo-Death-Report-African-Ruler-In-Barcelonas-Quiron-Clinic/Article/200906215298407?lpos=World_News_First_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15298407_Gabon_Denies_Omar_Bongo_Death_Report%3A_African_Ruler_In_Barcelonas_Quiron_Clinic Gabon Denies Omar Bongo Clinic Death Report], [[Sky News]].&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, Gabonese officials were furious with the premature announcement by France, questioning how Germany would react if France announced the death of [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref name="Après la mort d'Omar Bongo, la bataille de la succession est ouverte au Gabon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2009/06/09/apres-la-mort-d-omar-bongo-la-bataille-de-la-succession-est-ouverte-au-gabon_1204639_3212.html|title=Après la mort d'Omar Bongo, la bataille de la succession est ouverte au Gabon|date=2009-06-09|accessdate=2009-06-15|publisher=''[[Le Monde]]'' (French)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bongo's death was confirmed by Prime Minister [[Jean Eyeghe Ndong]] in a written statement on June 8, 2009.

==Funeral events==
===Period of mourning===
[[Rose Francine Rogombé]] was sworn in as interim president on June 10, 2009, immediately declaring a period of mourning lasting thirty days.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; A government statement issued in the daily ''[[L'Union]]'' newspaper on June 11, declared that day and the day of the funeral a public holiday.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; Businesses and offices were shut down in Libreville, with the city's mayor ordering all bars and night clubs be closed until after the funeral.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt;

===Arrival at Libreville airport===
Bongo's corpse was flown by aircraft from his deathplace in Barcelona and arrived at Libreville's airport on 11 June at approximately 16:15 pm (01:15 AEST).&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; A crowd of around 10,000 people, including diplomats, politicians and members of the country's security forces were waiting at the airport for the dead President's arrival.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; Several people were tearful, including cabinet chief Pascaline, also known as Bongo's daughter, who lay emotional in the arms of President Denis Sassou Nguesso.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; Young people in the crowd were seen to wear T-shirts decorated with Bongo photos and slogans which read: "I love and admire my president".&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; Officials were also emotional as they left the plane, Bongo's coffin in tow, draped in Gabon's national flag.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt;

The coffin was lifted into a military vehicle and it drove off.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; It arrived at Bongo's oceanside presidential palace overlooking the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"/&gt; There it lay in state until the President's state funeral on June 16, 2009.&lt;ref name="Bongo's body arrives in Gabon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/bongos-body-arrives-in-gabon-20090612-c55o.html|title=Bongo's body arrives in Gabon|date=2009-06-12|accessdate=2009-06-15|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' | first=Patrick | last=Fort}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on hand were [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Jacques Chirac]] — the current and former French presidents and the only Western heads of state to attend. The pair arrived in a stretch limousine and were quickly escorted inside the palace as a group of people outside yelled, "No to France!" Sarkozy and Chirac later approached the coffin together and stood before it with their eyes lowered. They laid down a wreath of roses. Then, each signed a condolence book. [[Chad]]'s President [[Idriss Deby]], bowed his head before the coffin. Cameroon's [[Paul Biya]], placed a wreath of flowers at the foot of the coffin, as did [[Burkina Faso]]'s [[Blaise Compaore]].&lt;ref name="presstv.ir"&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=98324&amp;sectionid=351020506]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and death==
At approximately 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 24, 2016, police were called to the Hintonburg [[Bridgehead Coffee|Bridgehead]] coffee shop on the corner of Fairmont Avenue and Wellington Street West over allegations that Abdi was groping women there.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/funeral-held-for-somali-canadian-man-who-died-after-altercation-with-police/article31199886/ |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Laura |last=Stone |date=29 July 2016 |title=Witnesses recount Abdirahman Abdi's 'gruesome' encounter with Ottawa police before his death |quote=last Sunday morning police were called to a coffee shop to investigate a disturbance, which allegedly involved Mr. Abdi groping women}} (updated July 30)&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Duval, a witness who was present at the coffee shop since 9:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., says he saw a commotion and that the front doors were locked as a group outside restrained Abdi. Duval says it looked like Abdi was trying to either flee or get back into the shop. Duval says he asked the allegedly assaulted woman (who had been taken to the back of the shop) in [[French language|French]] what had happened and he says she said (translated) "He groped me." repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2016/07/28/he-groped-me-witness-describes-coffee-shop-confrontation-before-abdi-arrest |title='He groped me': Witness describes coffee shop confrontation before Abdi arrest |first=Shaamini |last=Yogaretnam |date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracey Clark, the owner of Bridgehead who was not present during the incident, gave a statement on August 5 after speaking with staff and customers, describing Abdi as having harassed and assaulted multiple people in the shop.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/bridgehead-owner-speaks-abdirahman-abdi-1.3708589?cmp=rss |title=Abdirahman Abdi worried Bridgehead customers on previous occasions before fatal arrest, owner says |work=[[CBC News]] |date=5 August 2016 |quote=Clark wasn't at the Bridgehead shop on the corner of Wellington Street West and Fairmont Avenue on the Sunday morning when the incident began, but said she has spoken with staff and customers who were there. She would not go into great detail about what happened, in part due to ongoing investigations, describing Abdi's actions only as an "assault" and "harassment" of more than one person inside. "It was a rapidly escalating situation where Mr. Abdi did harass a customer, and more than one, and several customers [sought] to move him out of the store to restrain him until police could arrive," Clark said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark mentioned this was not the first incident with him and that he would sometimes stare at customers and get too close to them. Clark said that they had previously intervened by asking Abdi if he was aware of what he was doing and if he could stop.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;

After the Bridgehead confrontation, police pursued Abdi 250 metres (three blocks) and arrested him outside his apartment building at 55 Hilda Street.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/abdirahman-abdi-s-fatal-encounter-with-ottawa-police-1.3697454 |title=Timeline – Abdirahman Abdi's fatal encounter with Ottawa Police |date=28 July 2016 |first=Kate |last=Porter |quote=Police pursue 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi on foot for some 250 metres, and arrest him outside his apartment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; During that encounter, Abdi began to suffer "medical distress". Dispatchers sent an ambulance at 9:52&amp;nbsp;a.m., and a paramedic reported "vital signs absent" at 9:59&amp;nbsp;a.m.

Abdi was later taken to the [[Ottawa Civic Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siu.on.ca/en/news_template.php?nrid=2700 |title=SIU Started an Investigation into Arrest of an Ottawa Man, Appealing for Witnesses Case Number: 16-OCD-193 |quote=He was transported to Ottawa Civic Hospital. |date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a doctor informed the family he had died 45 minutes prior to arrival.&lt;ref name=CitizenJuly26/&gt; His death was announced to the public at 3:17&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Monday, July 25.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

==SIU investigation==
As required under the [[Police Services Act of Ontario|Police Services Act]], the provincial [[Special Investigations Unit|Special Investigations Unit (SIU)]] conducted an investigation into the incident. The SIU is required to investigate all reports of deaths, serious injuries, or sexual assaults in relation to provincial or municipal police officers.

Two [[Ottawa Police Service]] officers who were involved in the arrest – Constable David Weir and Constable Daniel Montsion – were designated as subject officers during the course of the investigation.&lt;ref name="CBCID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/police-officer-in-abdi-death-identified-1.3695996|title=2 officers under investigation in death of Ottawa man identified|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=July 26, 2016|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constable Weir was later re-classified as a witness officer, while Constable Montsion would be charged with manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/abdirahman-abdi-ottawa-police-siu-findings-1.4008142 |work=[[CBC News]] |first=Kristy |last=Nease |date=6 March 2017 |title=Ottawa police officer charged with manslaughter in man's 2016 death}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2017, the SIU laid charges against Constable Daniel Montsion for manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in relation to the death of Abdi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.siu.on.ca/en/news_template.php?nrid=2979 |title=SIU Lays Charges against Officer in Relation to Death of Abdirahman Abdi |publisher=Special Investigations Unit |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Abdi family retained lawyer [[Lawrence Greenspon]] two days after his death on Wednesday July 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/abdirahman-abdis-family-retains-lawyer |title=Abdirahman Abdi's family retains lawyer Lawrence Greenspon |first=Evelyn |last=Harford |date=2 August 2016 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdi's funeral was held on Friday, July 29 at the Ottawa (Main) Mosque, with 800 inside&lt;ref name=8hundred/&gt; and more outside.

'''Delara Darabi''' ({{lang-fa|دلارا دارابى}}) (29 September 1986{{spaced ndash}}1 May 2009) was an [[Iran]]ian [[Gilaks|Gilaki]] woman who was sentenced to death after having been convicted of murdering her father's female cousin in 2003. Although Delara initially claimed that she had committed the crime, she subsequently recanted and explained that her older boyfriend, Amir Hossein, had persuaded her to lie about the incident to protect him.&lt;ref name=VOAreport&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Iran|url=http://morigin.voapnn.eu/a/a-31-2007-02-26-voa17-61711472/587697.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522215441/http://morigin.voapnn.eu/a/a-31-2007-02-26-voa17-61711472/587697.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 May 2014|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Delara and other sources familiar with the case, Amir Hossein was the person who had committed the murder in an attempt to steal from a wealthy member of the Darabi family.&lt;ref name=SalemNews/&gt;

Darabi served five years of a prison sentence for theft on death row after her conviction (In Iran, prisoners often have to serve time in prison before execution). She initially confessed, but later recanted, claiming her boyfriend, Amir Hossein, persuaded her to confess by convincing her that he would be executed (as she would not have been in most places, being a minor; but this was not the case in Iran).

While on [[death row]], Darabi, having developed a love of painting at an early age, completed several works that depicted her incarceration. In confinement, she also wrote poetry. Among her work is the poem entitled "Prison", a psychological and philosophical work on life in prison.&lt;ref name=Saraf&gt;{{cite web|title=Delara's Father:  "Painters do not destroy.  They love to create beauty instead.  Delara could in no way destroy life.  She could not murder anyone."|url=http://www.sarafrazan.net/delaradarabi1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522214923/http://www.sarafrazan.net/delaradarabi1.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 May 2014|publisher=sarafrazan|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of her art was displayed at an exhibition in [[Tehran]] by supporters campaigning her release. Darabi's lawyer, Abdolsamad Khoramshahi, had appealed against the sentence, arguing that her conviction had been based solely on her confession and that her trial had failed to consider vital evidence.

==Biography==
Darabi was born in the northern city of [[Rasht]], in the province of [[Gilan]]. Darabi was hanged in the morning of 1 May 2009. The news of her hanging was announced to the world by Iranian-American lawyer, [[Lily Mazahery]], who posted the information on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=QuoteURL&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazahery|first=Lily|title=DelaraDarabi was hanged to death by the terrorist government of Iran today|url=http://www.quoteurl.com/q3pq6|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020057/http://www.quoteurl.com/q3pq6|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 October 2011|publisher=QuoteURL|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and sentence==
Darabi was tried by a lower court in Rasht, found guilty and sentenced to death. Her lawyer was [[Abdolsamad Khorramshahi]]. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court. She maintained her innocence, and claimed that she was under the influence of drugs during the burglary, despite making a confession and pleading guilty earlier. At this stage the Head of the Judiciary had the power to order a stay of execution and a review of the case. The boyfriend Amir Hossein has reportedly received a prison sentence of 10 years as an accessory to the crime.&lt;ref name="AmnestyMar07"&gt;{{Cite news|publication-date=2007-03-01 |title=Child offender at risk of execution |periodical=The Wire |publication-place=London |publisher=Amnesty International |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=4 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/nws21/002/2007/en/ |issn=1472-443X |accessdate=2009-05-03 |postscript= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] has made several public statements about Darabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/001/2006/en/ |title=Iran: Death penalty/ legal concern: Delara Darabi (f) |publisher=Amnesty International |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/youth/nazanin.html|title=Teen Gets Death Sentence for Resisting Rape|date=February 2006|accessdate=2009-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717222908/http://www.amnestyusa.org/youth/nazanin.html|archivedate=2012-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/084/2006/en/ |title=Iran: Further information on death penalty / legal concern: Delara Darabi |publisher=Amnesty International |date=31 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/002/2007/en/ |title=Iran: Quashing of child offender's death sentence highlights need for urgent legal reform |publisher=Amnesty International |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/047/2007/en/ |title=Iran: Further information on death penalty / legal concern: Delara Darabi (f) |publisher=Amnesty International |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darabi was a [[Painting|painter]] and wrote a few poems during her lifetime. She had used her paintings and poems to express her feelings. In 2008 there was an exhibition of her paintings in Tehran; a similar exhibition was held in Stockholm in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.womeniniran.net/EG/delara/delarasiteEn.html |title=Delara Darabi paintings presentation |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707231634/http://www.womeniniran.net/EG/delara/delarasiteEn.html |archivedate=July 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/Delara_Photo_Gallery.aspx|title=STOP Child Executions in Iran|accessdate=2009-05-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023232425/http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/Delara_Photo_Gallery.aspx |archivedate = October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://scenews.blog.com/1662278 |title=Delara's painting exhibition: April 28, 2007 Amsterdam |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312011942/http://scenews.blog.com/1662278/ |archivedate=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://scenews.blog.com/1728547/ |date=30 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-03 |title=Prison by Delara Darabiدلارا دارابى.... زندان |last=Darabi |first=Delara |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314075123/http://scenews.blog.com/1728547/ |archivedate=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://scenews.blog.com/1734550/ |title=While Free: by Delara Derabi |date=2 May 2007 |first=Delara |last=Darabi |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312011948/http://scenews.blog.com/1734550/ |archivedate=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darabi attempted [[suicide]] by cutting her wrists on 20 January 2007. However, her cellmate noticed and called for help. She was rushed to hospital, where she was revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etemaad.com/Released/85-11-25/97.htm|script-title=fa:پدر دل آرا در گفت وگو با "اعتماد"؛ براي اثبات بي گناهي دخترم تلاش مي کنم

==Petitions for clemency==
An online petition to save Delara from execution was drafted and circulated around the world. The petition appealed to Iranian authorities, particularly the country's head of judiciary, to observe international treaties and standards and to commute Delara's sentence.&lt;ref name="SalemNews"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/july042007/delara_darabi_7407.php | title=Teenage Artist on Death Row in Iran Asks World for Help | date=4 July 2007 | accessdate=30 May 2014 | author=King, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was no way the judiciary could do so, since the victim's family demanded [[qisas]], or retribution (the death penalty) rather than [[diyya]], which is blood money. [[Amnesty International]] arranged for letters in support of Darabi to be sent to Iranian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions_details.asp?ActionID=9|title=Stop child executions: Delara Darabi|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2009-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422155714/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions_details.asp?ActionID=9|archivedate=22 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background information==
As a party to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), Iran has entered into diplomatic commitments not to execute persons for offences committed when they were under 18. Nevertheless, since 1990, Iran has executed at least 18 people for crimes committed when they were juveniles. In 2005 alone, despite being urged in the January by the UN [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] to suspend the practice immediately, at least eight juvenile offenders were executed, including two who were still under 18 at the time of their execution. Before Darabi's, the last recorded execution of a juvenile offender, Rostam Tajik, was on 10 December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=UA 306/05, MDE 13/075/2005|date=6 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December,{{When|date=January 2011}} [[Philip Alston]], the [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, stated: "At a time when virtually every other country in the world has firmly and clearly renounced the execution of people for crimes they committed as children, the Iranian approach is particularly unacceptable... it is all the more surprising because the obligation to refrain from such executions is not only clear and incontrovertible, but the Government of Iran has itself stated that it will cease this practice." {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

According to the penal code of the Islamic Republic of Iran, children are considered criminally responsible for their actions as adults at the age of puberty. Pursuant to Article 1210, Addendum 1, girls reach the age of puberty 6 years before their male counterparts, at age of 9. Boys, on the other hand, are not legally considered to have reached the maturity that would make them responsible for their actions, such as murder, until the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Republic of Iran and Penal Codes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch and [[Amnesty International]] say Iran executes the most juvenile offenders of any country, in breach of the UN Convention, which forbids the death penalty for crimes committed under the age of 18. Lawyers{{Who|date=January 2011}} estimate 130 prisoners are on death row in Iran for murders committed as minors.

==Execution==
{{wikinews|Iran executes woman despite a stay of execution}}
The head of the judiciary officially granted a two-month stay of execution, yet the go-ahead for her execution was given to Rasht prison authorities.&lt;ref name="AmnestyMayday2009"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/delara-darabi-executed-iran-20090501|date=1 May 2009|title=Delara Darabi executed in Iran|accessdate=2009-05-03|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Delara Darabi was executed at 5:00 AM local time on 1 May 2009 at Rasht Central Prison, without prior notification to her attorney and family.&lt;ref name=INDArt&gt;{{cite news|last=Soares|first=Claire|title=Delara Darabi: 'Oh mother, I can see the noose'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/delara-darabi-oh-mother-i-can-see-the-noose-1678543.html|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just minutes before being hanged she was allowed to make a desperate last phone call to her parents, and she pleaded for them to save her, followed by the prison warden's voice informing her parents she was to be executed for her crimes immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/02/iran-artist-darabi-execution-juvenile |title=Outcry as Iran executes artist over juvenile conviction |publisher=The Guardian |last=Tait |first=Robert |date=2 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-03 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gVGdJ4qA?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/02/iran-artist-darabi-execution-juvenile |archivedate=2009-05-03 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/02/iran-artist-darabi-execution-juvenile | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Outcry as Iran executes artist over juvenile conviction | first=Robert | last=Tait | date=2009-05-02 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] '''Henry Douglas King''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Volunteer Decoration|VD]] (1 June 1877 – 20 August 1930), known as '''Douglas King''', was a British naval commander and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician. He served under [[Stanley Baldwin]] as [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]] between 1924 and 1928 and as [[Secretary for Mines]] between 1928 and 1929.

==Early life==
King trained as a Merchant Navy officer in HMS Conway from 1891 to 1893. After Conway he served initially in the mercantile navy, then served in the [[Royal Navy]] before joining [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P &amp; O]]. He left the sea in 1899 and took up farming for a short while. However, he soon turned to studying law and was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]], [[Middle Temple]], in 1905. He stood as the Conservative candidate for [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|Norfolk North]] in the two general elections of 1910, but was defeated on both occasions. At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 he obtained a commission in the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] and served at the [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|Siege of Antwerp]] and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].&lt;ref name="eveningpost"&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19290706.2.175 ''Evening Post'', 6 July 1929]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in recognition of his services at Gallipoli in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29358 |date=5 November 1915 |page=11929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given the French [[Croix de Guerre]]&lt;ref name="eveningpost"/&gt; and was appointed a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31118 |date=10 January 1919 |page=512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
At the 1918 general election King once again stood for [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|Norfolk North]] and was this time elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Rayment-hc|n|2|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parliament he initially served as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Leslie Orme Wilson|Sir Leslie Wilson]], Chairman of the National Maritime Board, and then to [[Hamar Greenwood, 1st Viscount Greenwood|Sir Hamar Greenwood]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]. In 1921 he was appointed a Conservative [[whip (politics)|whip]]. The following year he was returned to parliament for [[Paddington South (UK Parliament constituency)|Paddington South]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Rayment-hc|p|1|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the government under [[Bonar Law]] as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] (government whip),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32776 |date=12 December 1922 |page=8793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a position he held until January 1924, the last year under the premiership of [[Stanley Baldwin]]. When the Conservatives returned to office in November 1924, King was made [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]] and a member of the Army Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33001 |date=12 December 1924 |page=9057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held this post until 1928, and was then [[Secretary for Mines]] until the Baldwin administration fell in 1929. The latter year he was also sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] following the [[1929 Dissolution Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33512 |date=29 June 1929 |page=4354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been made a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33280 |date=31 May 1927 |page=3605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
King married the only daughter of W. R. Swan, of [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="eveningpost"/&gt; On 20 August 1930 King's cutter yacht ''Islander'' sank in a gale off [[Fowey]], [[Cornwall]]. All six aboard, including King himself, were lost. His memorial is at All Saints Church, Upper Sheringham, Norfolk. The memorial states that the yacht Islander was 'smashed to pieces' on the rocky coast of Lantivet Bay, Cornwall during a 'fierce summer storm'.
It goes on: "At sunset in the calm stillness of a beautiful summer evening, his ashes were, by his own wish, taken out to sea by the Sheringham lifeboat and within sight of his old home scattered over the face of the waters".

'''Eutonology''' is a word that [[Henri Laborit]] used for referring to his study of the state of tension or responsiveness of the organs or tissues of the body under a condition of [[Stress (biology)|stress]]. "Laboratoire d'eutonologie" was the name of Laborit's laboratory at the Boucicaut Hospital in Paris in the late 1950s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2320">In '''''Ex Parte Steenkamp and Steenkamp''''', an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], Mr. and Mrs. K. bequeathed a [[farm]] and certain [[personal property|movable property]] to their children born and to be born of their daughter. Their son-in-law subsequently [[murder]]ed Mr. and Mrs. K. At the time of their deaths, Mr. and Mrs. K’s daughter and son-in-law had two children, and the daughter was [[pregnant]] with a third child. The ''nasciturus'' was born alive, but died when it was six months old. In terms of the [[Intestate succession|Intestate Succession]] Act, Mr. and Mrs. K.’s daughter and son-in-law would inherit from their infant child.

The question before the court was whether this was permissible, as the son-in-law would indirectly benefit from the murders he committed. Three main issues were dealt with in Steyn J.’s judgment:

# Can a [[murderer]] [[inheritance|inherit]] form the heir of his victim? The court looked into the old authorities and concluded that this is possible, and what [[law]] principles the dispute featured.

# Did the child’s relationship to the [[grandparent]]s bring them within the category of ''conjunctissima''? Upon the facts, the relationship did not bring them within the category of conjunctissima, but under different circumstances it may be brought under this category, as would be the case, for example, if the grandparents had raised the child as their own.

# Was there a [[Causation (law)|causal]] nexus between the murder and the enrichment? The court held that a causal nexus must be shown and that in this case, although there was factual causation, the legal cause of the enrichment was not the murders but rather the birth and death of the child.

Accordingly, the court held that the son-in-law could inherit from the child.

This [[judgment (law)|judgment]] has been severely criticized. Writers believe that there was no ''[[novus actus interveniens]]'', and therefore that there was legal causation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4005">The '''explosive rat''',&lt;ref name="Bull2009"/&gt; also known as a '''rat bomb''',&lt;ref name="milhist"/&gt; was a weapon developed by the British [[Special Operations Executive]] in [[World War II]] for use against [[Germany]]. [[Rat]] carcasses were filled with [[plastic explosive]]s, and were to be distributed near German boiler rooms, where it was expected they would be disposed of by burning, with the subsequent explosion having a chance of causing a [[boiler explosion]].

The explosive rats never saw use, as the first shipment was intercepted by the Germans; however, the resulting search for more booby trapped rats consumed enough German resources for the SOE to conclude that the operation was a success.

==Development==
During World War II, the British [[Special Operations Executive]] procured about a hundred rodents for medical experiments.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The rodents were killed and plastic explosives sewn inside them.&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;

The idea, developed in 1941,&lt;ref name="History - World Wars: British Special Operations Executive (SOE): Tools and Gadgets Gallery"/&gt; was that when the dead rat was discovered in the [[Mechanical room|boiler room]] of a locomotive, factory, power station, or similar installation, the [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]] tending the boiler would dispose of the unpleasant discovery by shoveling it into the furnace, causing the booby trapped rat to explode.&lt;ref name="Bull2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter2002"/&gt; A rat could contain only a small amount of explosive; however, a penetration of a highly pressurized steam boiler could trigger a devastating [[boiler explosion]].&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; A rat bomb could also be set with a [[Fuse (explosives)|delayed fuse]].&lt;ref name=milhist/&gt;

==Operational history==
The first shipment of carcasses was intercepted by the Germans, and the SOE plan was dropped.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The Germans exhibited the rats at top military schools and conducted searches for further exploding rats.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The SOE concluded: "The trouble caused to them was a much greater success to us than if the rats had actually been used."&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

In November 2015, Grindhouse members Tim Cannon, Shawn Sarver, Justin Worst, Jessica Waldrip, Michael Seeler, and Marlo Webber had prototypes of Grindhouse's Northstar device implanted into during simultaneous procedures occurring at the "Cyborg Fair" in [[Düsseldorf, Germany]] and at a studio in Pittsburgh. The implantation procedure was featured in an episode of the [[MTV]] documentary series ''[[True Life]]''. Also featured in the episode was the public debut of the [[morse code]] functionality of Grindhouse's Bottlenose device at the first Pittsburgh [[Maker Faire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/episodes/6x2809/true-life-i-m-a-cyborg-season-2016-ep-6|title=True Life season 2016, ep 6 I'm a cyborg|accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

''Ice People'' brings [[Anne Aghion]] and her crew to [[Antarctica]] where they spent four months following the lives of [[North Dakota State University]] [[geologist]] professors Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis, as well as the [[McMurdo Station]] staff over four months. The film crew then followed the professors and two undergraduate students into the field where they camped out and shot in conditions of extreme cold and winds that ranged from -50°C/-60°F to 0°C/32°F.  The film shows the scientific team scouring ancient emptied lakebeds in the hope of finding evidence of [[plant]]s and [[insect]]s that would prove that the world's coldest continent was once warm and verdant roughly 14 to 20 million years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">'''Ideal observer theory''' is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:
# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are about the attitudes of a hypothetical ''ideal observer''.

In other words, ideal observer theory states that ethical judgments should be interpreted as statements about the judgments that a neutral and fully informed observer would make; "''x'' is good" means "an ideal observer would approve of ''x''".

{{cquote|The main idea [of the ideal observer theory] is that ethical terms should be defined after the pattern of the following example: "''x'' is better than ''y''" means "If anyone were, in respect of ''x'' and ''y'', fully informed and vividly imaginative, impartial, in a calm frame of mind and otherwise normal, he would ''prefer x'' to ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brandt |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brandt |title=[[Ethical Theory]] |year=1959 |location=[[Englewood Cliffs]] |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |chapter=Ethical Naturalism |pages=173 |lccn=59010075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This makes ideal observer theory arguably a [[ethical subjectivism|subjectivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Brandt 1959, p. 153: "[Objectivism and subjectivism] have been used more vaguely, confusedly, and in more different senses than the others we are considering. We suggest as a convenient usage, however, that a theory be called subjectivist [[if and only if]], according to it, any ethical assertion implies that somebody does, or somebody of a certain sort under certain conditions would, take ''some specified attitude'' toward something."&lt;/ref&gt; yet [[moral universalism|universalist]] form of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]], though arguably the abstract "ideal observer" may be seen as an objective reference point, thus making ideal observer theory a form of ethical objectivism. Ideal observer theory stands in opposition to other forms of ethical subjectivism (e.g.[[moral relativism]], and [[individualist ethical subjectivism]]), as well as to [[moral realism]] (which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of anyone's attitudes or opinions), [[error theory]] (which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense), and [[non-cognitivism]] (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all).

While [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] are recognized to have espoused early versions of the ideal observer theory, [[Roderick Firth]] is responsible for starting a more sophisticated modern version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ethical Absolutism and the Ideal Observer |first=Roderick |last=Firth |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=12 |issue=3 |date=March 1952 |pages=317–345 |jstor=2103988}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Firth, an ideal observer has the following specific characteristics: omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts, omnipercipience, disinterestedness, dispassionateness, consistency, and normalcy in all other respects. Notice that, by defining an Ideal Observer as omniscient with respect to nonmoral facts, Firth avoids [[Begging the question|circular logic]] that would arise from defining an ideal observer as omniscient in both nonmoral and moral facts. A complete knowledge of morality is not born of itself but is an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of Firth's minimal requirements. There are also sensible restrictions to the trait of omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts. For instance, a geological event in another [[Solar System|solar system]] is hardly something necessary to know to make a moral judgment about a case of theft or murder on [[Earth]].

Those proposing the ideal observer theory do not necessarily assert that any real ideal observers actually exist.

Four induced vortices are shown using fluorescent particles with a diameter of 1.90&amp;nbsp;µm. The DC electric field is applied from left to right and equals 40V/cm. The dashed line represents the particle boundary. The image is captured by TE2000-E Nikon microscope at t=2s.&lt;ref name="DaghighiSinn2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daghighi|first1=Yasaman|last2=Sinn|first2=Irene|last3=Kopelman|first3=Raoul|last4=Li|first4=Dongqing|title=Experimental validation of induced-charge electrokinetic motion of electrically conducting particles|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=87|year=2013|pages=270–276|issn=0013-4686|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2012.09.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Induced-charge electrokinetics''' in [[physics]] is the [[electricity|electrically]] driven [[fluid flow]] and [[particle]] motion in a liquid [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref name="G. Levich, Physicochemical Hydrodynamics 1962"&gt;V. G. Levich, Physicochemical Hydrodynamics. Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a metal particle (which is neutrally charged but electrically conducting) in contact with an aqueous solution in a chamber/channel. If different [[voltage]]s apply to the end of this chamber/channel, [[electric field]] will generate in this chamber/channel. This applied electric field passes through this metal particle and causes the free charges inside the particle migrate under the skin of particle. As a result of this migration, the negative charges moves to the side which is close to the positive (or higher) voltage while the positive charges moves to the opposite side of the particle. These charges under the skin of conducting particle attract the counter-ions of the aqueous solution; thus, the [[Double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]] (EDL) forms around the particle. The EDL sing on the surface of the conducting particle changes from positive to negative and the distribution of the charges varies along the particle geometry. Due to these variations, the EDL is non-uniform and has different sings. Thus, the induced [[zeta potential]] around the particle, and consequently [[slip velocity]] on the surface of the particle, vary as a function of local electric field. Differences in magnitude and direction of slip velocity on the surface of the conducting particle effects the flow pattern around this particle and causes micro vortices. Yasaman Daghighi and Dongqing Li, for the first time, experimentally illustrated these induced vortices around a 1.2mm diameter carbon-steel sphere under the 40V/cm direct current (DC) external electric filed.&lt;ref name="DaghighiSinn2013" /&gt;
Chenhui Peng et al.&lt;ref&gt;C. Peng, I. Lazo, S. V. Shiyanovskii, O. D. Lavrentovich , Induced-charge electro-osmosis around metal and Janus spheres in water: Patterns of flow and breaking symmetries, arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.1478, (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; also experimentally showed the patterns of [[Electro-osmosis|electro-osmotic]] flow around an Au sphere when alternating current (AC) is involved (E=10mV/μm, f=1&amp;nbsp;kHz).
[[Electrokinetic phenomena|Electrokinetics]] here refers to a branch of science related to the motion and reaction of charged particles to the applied electric filed and its effects on its environment. It is sometimes referred as non-linear electrokinetic phenomena as well.

== History ==
Levich is one of the pioneers in induced-charge electrokinetic field.&lt;ref name="G. Levich, Physicochemical Hydrodynamics 1962"/&gt;   He calculated the perturbed slip profile around a conducting particle in contact with electrolyte. He also theoretically predicted that vortices induced around this particle once the electric filed is applied.

== Induced vortices around a conducting particle ==
The size and strength of the induced vortices around a conducting particle have direct relationship with the applied electric filed and also the size of the conducted surface. This phenomenon is experimentally and numerically proven by several studies,&lt;ref&gt;N. I. Gamayunov, G. I. Mantrov and V. A. Murtsovkin, Investigation of the flows induced by an external electric field in the vicinity of conducting particles, Kolloidn. Zh., 54, (1992) 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Dukhin, Biospecific mechanism of double layer formation and peculiarities of cell electrophoresis, Colloids Surf. Physicochem. Eng. Aspects, 73, (1993) 29-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Electrokinetics and Electrohydrodynamics in Microsystems'' CISM Courses and Lectures Volume 530, 2011, pp 221-297 Induced-Charge Electrokinetic Phenomena Martin Z. Bazant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Daghighi, Y. Gao and D. Li, 3D Numerical Study of Electrokinetic Motion of Heterogeneous Particle, Electrochimica Acta, 56 (11), (2011) 4254-4262&lt;/ref&gt; The vortices grow as the external electric field increases and generate "sinkhole" &lt;ref name="DaghighiSinn2013" /&gt; at the center of the each vortex while circulates the fluid faster. It is demonstrated that increasing the size of the conducting surface forms bigger induced vortices to the point that geometry does not limits this grows.

== Applications ==
The induced vortices have many applications in various aspects of [[Electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetic]] microfluidics. There are many micro-mixers that are designed and fabricated based on the existence of their induced vortices in the [[microfluidic]]s devices. Such micro-mixers which are used for biochemical, medicine, biology applications has no mechanical parts and only use conducting surfaces to generate induced vortices to mix the different fluid streams,&lt;ref&gt;M. Campisi, D. Accoto, F. Damiani and P. Dario, A soft-lithographed chaotic electrokinetic micromixer for efficient chemical reactions in lab-on-chips, J. of Micro-Nano Mechatronics, 5, (2009) 69-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Stroock, S. K. W. Dertinger, A. Ajdari, I. Mezić, H. A. Stone and G. M. Whitesides, "Chaotic mixer for microchannels," Science, 295, (2002) 647-651&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Daghighi, and D. Li, A Novel Design of an Induced-Charge Electrokinetic Micro-Mixer, Analytica Chimica Acta, 763 (2013) 28–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. K. Harnett, J. Templeton, K. A. Dunphy-Guzman, Y. M. Senousy and M. P. Kanouff, Model based design of a microfluidic mixer driven by induced charge electroosmosis, Lab on a Chip - Miniaturisation for Chemistry and Biology, 8 (2008) pp. 565-572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Jain, A. Yeung and K. Nandakumar, Induced charge electro osmotic mixer: Obstacle shape optimization, Biomicrofluidics, 3 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon even is used to trap the micron and submicron particles floating in flow inside a microchannel. This method can be used to manipulate, detect, handle, and concentrate cells and virus in biomedical field; or, for colloidal particle assembly.

In addition the induced vortices around the conducting surfaces in a microfluidic system can be used as a micro-valve, micro-actuator, micro-motor and micro-regulator to control the direction and  manipulation.

'''Juan Antonio Marichal Sánchez''' (born October 20, 1937&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maricju01.shtml Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] former professional [[baseball]] player. He played as a right-handed [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]], most notably for the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Marichal was known for his high leg kick, pinpoint control and intimidation tactics, which included aiming pitches directly at the opposing batters' helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/aug/23/20040823-011141-7243r/ |title=Juan Marichal took a bat to Roseboro in 1965 fracas |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=August 23, 2004 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marichal also played for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for the final two seasons of his career.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Although he won more games than any other pitcher during the 1960s, he appeared in only one [[World Series]] game and he was often overshadowed by his contemporaries [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Bob Gibson]] in post-season awards.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zioDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=juan+marichal+baseball+digest&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20marichal%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s'', by John Lowe, Baseball Digest, August 1998, Vol. 57, No. 8, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dzIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=juan+marichal+baseball+digest&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20marichal%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Juan Marichal-A Man In Many Shadows'', by Michael R.

==Early life==
Juan Marichal was born on October 20, 1937, in the small farming village of Laguna Verde, [[Dominican Republic]], the youngest of Francisco and Natividad Marichal's four children.&lt;ref name="Marichal13"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  He has two brothers, Gonzalo and Rafael, and a sister, Maria. His father died of an unknown illness when Marichal was three years old.&lt;ref name="Marichal13"/&gt;  His house did not have electricity, but food was plentiful since his family owned a farm.&lt;ref name="Marichal14"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, Marichal worked on the farm daily and was responsible for taking care of his family's horses, donkeys, and goats.&lt;ref name="Marichal14"/&gt; He lived near the [[Yaque del Norte River]] and often spent time swimming and fishing.&lt;ref name="Marichal20"&gt;Marichal, Freeman, 2011. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  One day while Marichal was playing by the river, he fell unconscious owing to poor digestion and was in a [[coma]] for nine days.&lt;ref name="Marichal21"&gt;Marichal, Freeman, 2011. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors did not expect him to survive, but he slowly regained consciousness after his family gave him steam baths by doctor's orders.&lt;ref name="Marichal21"/&gt;

His older brother Gonzalo instilled a love of baseball in young Marichal and taught him the fundamentals of pitching, fielding, and batting.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Every weekend, Marichal played the sport with his brother and friends.  For their games, they found [[golf ball]]s and paid the local shoemaker one [[Dominican peso|peso]] to sew thick cloth around the ball to make it the proper size.&lt;ref name="Marichal16"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  They employed branches from a wassama tree for [[Baseball bat|bats]] and canvas tarps for [[Baseball glove|gloves]].&lt;ref name="Marichal16"/&gt;  Among his childhood playmates were the Alou brothers, [[Felipe Alou|Felipe]], [[Jesús Alou|Jesús]], and [[Matty Alou|Matty]], who all later played with Marichal on the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref name="Marichal16"/&gt; From the age of six, Marichal aspired to become a professional baseball player, but his mother discouraged this, instead urging him to get an education.&lt;ref name="Marichal17"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, there were no players from the Dominican Republic in [[Major League Baseball]], and his goal was viewed to be unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Marichal17"/&gt; At age 11, he briefly held a job cutting sugar cane for the J.W. Tatem Shipping conglomerate.

In 1954, sixteen-year-old Marichal joined a summer league in [[Monte Cristi (Dominican Republic)|Monte Cristi]], playing for a team called Las Flores.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"/&gt; Although he began at shortstop, Marichal switched to pitcher after taking inspiration from Bombo Ramos of the Dominican national team.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"/&gt;  He left high school after being recruited to play for the [[United Fruit Company]] team in 1956.&lt;ref name="Marichal23"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
Marichal's delivery was renowned for one of the fullest windups in modern baseball, with a high kick of his left leg that went nearly vertical (even more so than [[Warren Spahn]]'s delivery).&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"/&gt; Marichal maintained this delivery his entire career, and photographs taken near his retirement show the vertical kick only diminished. The windup was the key to his delivery in that he was consistently able to conceal the type of pitch until it was on its way.

Marichal was discovered by [[Ramfis Trujillo]], the son of late Dominican dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]]. Ramfis was the primary sponsor of the [[Dominican Air Force]] Baseball Team (Aviación Dominicana), against which Marichal pitched a 2–1 victory game in his native Monte Cristi. From the very moment the game ended, Marichal was a member of Aviación Dominicana team, enlisted to the Air Force right on the spot by Ramfis's orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942040-1,00.html "The Dandy Dominican", ''Time'' magazine, June 10, 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Juan Marichal 1962.png|thumb|180px|left|Marichal in 1962]]

Marichal entered the major leagues on July 19, {{Baseball year|1960}} with the [[San Francisco Giants]] as the second native pitcher to come from the Dominican Republic. He made an immediate impression: in his debut, on July 19, [[1960 San Francisco Giants season|1960]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], he  took a [[no hitter]] into the eighth [[inning]] only to surrender a two-[[Out (baseball)|out]] [[Single (baseball)|single]] to [[Clay Dalrymple]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y7EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=clay+dalrymple+baseball+digest&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Baseball Digest, June 1990, Vol. 49, No. 6, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up with a one-hit shutout, walking one and striking out 12.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196007190.shtml July 19, 1960 Phillies-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He started 10 more games that season, finishing at 6–2 with a 2.66 [[earned run average|ERA]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He improved his victory totals to 13 and 18 over the following two seasons, respectively, before finally cracking the 20-victory plateau in [[1963 San Francisco Giants season|1963]], when he went 25–8 with 248 [[strikeout]]s and a 2.41 ERA.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He appeared in every All-Star game of the 1960s beginning in 1962.  In May [[1966 in baseball|1966]], he was named [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award|NL Player of the Month]] with a 6-0 record, a 0.97 ERA, and 42 SO. On July 14, 1967, he surrendered the 500th Home Run of [[Eddie Mathews]]' career.

Marichal enjoyed similar success through the [[1969 San Francisco Giants season|1969]] season, posting more than 20 victories in every season except [[1967 San Francisco Giants season|1967]], and never posting an ERA higher than 2.76.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He led the league in victories in [[1963 San Francisco Giants season|1963]] and [[1968 San Francisco Giants season|1968]] when he won 26 games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963-pitching-leaders.shtml 1963 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1968-pitching-leaders.shtml 1968 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he also finished in the highest rank of his career in [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|MVP]] voting, finishing fifth behind [[Bob Gibson]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Willie McCovey]], and [[Curt Flood]].  He and [[Sandy Koufax]] were the only two Major League pitchers in the post-war era (1946–present) to have more than one season of 25 or more wins; both pitchers had three such seasons in their careers.

Marichal won more games during the decade of the 1960s (191) than any other major league pitcher,&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"/&gt; but did not receive any votes for the [[Cy Young Award]] until 1970, when baseball writers started voting for the top three pitchers in each league rather than one per league (or, until 1967, only the top pitcher in MLB). Marichal finished in the top 10 in ERA seven consecutive years, starting in 1963 and culminating in 1969, in which year he led the league.&lt;ref name="1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1969-pitching-leaders.shtml 1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, he also finished in the top 10 in strikeouts six times, top 10 in innings pitched eight times (leading the league twice), and top 10 in [[complete game]]s 10 times, with a career total of 244.&lt;ref name="haft"/&gt; He led the league twice in shutouts, throwing 10 of them in 1965.&lt;ref name="1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1965-pitching-leaders.shtml 1965 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marichal exhibited exceptional control. He had 2,303 strikeouts with only 709 walks,&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; a [[strikeout]]-to-walk ratio of 3.25 to 1. This ranks among the top 20 pitchers of all time, ahead of such notables as [[Bob Gibson]], [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Steve Carlton]], [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Don Drysdale]], [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Roger Clemens]], who each have strikeout-to-walk ratios of less than 3:1. Over his career, he led the league in the fewest walks per nine innings four times, and finished second three times – totaling eleven years in which he finished in the top 10, all while also finishing in the top 10 for strikeouts six years.

===The Greatest Game Ever Pitched===
One regular-season game in Marichal's career deserves mention, involving him and [[1963 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves']] Hall of Famer [[Warren Spahn]] in a night contest played July 2, 1963, before almost 16,000 at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco. The two great pitchers matched scoreless innings until Giants [[outfielder]] [[Willie Mays]] homered off Spahn to win the game 1–0 in the 16th inning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138463/index.htm ''July 2, 1963'', by Ron Fimrite, Sports Illustrated, July 19, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196307020.shtml July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Spahn and Marichal tossed 15-plus inning complete games,&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; something that had not happened before or since in the big leagues. Marichal allowed eight hits (all singles except for a double hit by Spahn) in the 16 innings, striking out 10, and saddling eventual career home run king [[Hank Aaron]] with an 0-for-6 collar.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Spahn permitted nine hits in 15{{frac|1|3}} innings, walking just one (Mays intentionally, in the 14th, after [[Harvey Kuenn]]'s leadoff double) and striking out two.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; The game, almost the innings-duration of two contests, lasted only 4 hours, 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; By coincidence, future Major League Baseball commissioner [[Bud Selig]] attended the game as a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2013/07/01/marichal-spahn-epic-duel-was-50-years-ago/ |title=Marichal-Spahn epic duel was 50 years ago |work=[[The Mercury News]] |last=Brown |first=Daniel |date=August 12, 2016 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roseboro incident===
Marichal is also remembered for a notorious incident that occurred with [[John Roseboro]] during a game between the Giants and [[1965 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[Candlestick Park]] on August 22, {{Baseball year|1965}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard|title=John Roseboro, a Dodgers Star, Dies at 69|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/20/sports/john-roseboro-a-dodgers-star-dies-at-69.html|accessdate=26 December 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Jack |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1965/08/30/605969/the-battle-of-san-francisco |title=The Battle Of San Francisco |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 30, 1965 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giant-Dodger rivalry was, at the time, the fiercest in baseball - a rivalry which began when both teams played in the New York City market.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball |agency=Associated Press |work=The Times-News |page=18 |date=22 August 1990 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19900822&amp;id=llYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6791,5769085&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Giants were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game trailing the Dodgers by a game and a half while the [[1965 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] were one game behind the Dodgers.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=John |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/04/21/juan-marichal-johnny-roseboro-brawl-excerpt |title=Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=2014 |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maury Wills]] led off the game with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single off Marichal and scored when [[Ron Fairly]] hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196508220.shtml |title=August 22, 1965 Dodgers-Giants box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; When Wills came up to bat in the second [[inning]], Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; [[Willie Mays]] then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; In the top of the third inning with two [[Out (baseball)|outs]], Marichal threw a [[fastball]] that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; Marichal's act angered the Dodgers and home plate umpire [[Shag Crawford]] warned both teams any further retaliations would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt;

Marichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to throw at him. Instead, Marichal was startled when, after the second pitch, Roseboro's return throw to Koufax either brushed his ear or came close enough for Marichal to feel the breeze off the ball.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; When Marichal confronted Roseboro, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal later said he thought Roseboro was about to attack him. Marichal raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice on the head, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face. Roseboro later required 14 stitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |publisher=espn.go.com |accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president [[Warren Giles]] suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MLBN Remembers ("Incident at Candlestick") |publisher=[[MLB Network|MLBN-tv]] |date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1750|1965|r=-1|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} and also forbade him from traveling to [[Dodger Stadium]] for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident but, eventually settled out of court for $7,500.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

Many people protested the apparently light punishment meted out, since it would cost Marichal only two starts.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; The Giants were in a tight pennant race with the Dodgers (as well as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves) and the race was decided with only two games to play. The Giants, who ended up winning the August 22 game and were down only {{frac|1|2}} game afterward, eventually lost the pennant to the Dodgers by 2 games. Ironically, the Giants went on a 14-game win streak that started during Marichal's absence and by then it was a two-team race as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves fell further behind. But then the Dodgers won 15 of their final 16 games (after Marichal had returned) to win the pennant. Marichal won in his first game back, 2–1 vs. the Astros on September 9 (the same day Koufax pitched his perfect game vs. the Cubs), but lost his last three decisions as the Giants slumped in the season's final week.

Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until [[spring training]] in April 3, {{Baseball year|1966}}. In his first at bat against Marichal since the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal |agency=Associated Press |work=The Day |page=25 |date=4 April 1966 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19660404&amp;id=yuwgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=873,438492&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco General Manager [[Chub Feeney]] approached Dodgers General Manager [[Buzzy Bavasi]] to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro however, Roseboro declined the offer.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"/&gt;

Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal having thrown at Wills.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, "standard operating procedure", as a form of retribution.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; After years of bitterness, Roseboro and Marichal became close friends in the 1980s, getting together occasionally at Old-Timers games, golf tournaments and charity events.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

===1970–75===
In [[1970 San Francisco Giants season|1970]], Marichal experienced a severe reaction to penicillin which led to back pain and chronic arthritis. Marichal's career stumbled in {{Baseball year|1970}}, when he only posted 12 wins and his ERA shot up to 4.12, before straightening itself out with a stellar [[1971 San Francisco Giants season|1971]] season in which he won 18 games and his ERA dropped below 3.00.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; It was the only season in which Marichal earned any consideration for the [[Cy Young Award]], finishing in 8th place.  It was his final great season (and his final of nine All-Star appearances), however, as he posted 6–16 and 11–15 records in [[1972 San Francisco Giants season|1972]] and [[1973 San Francisco Giants season|1973]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt;

After the 1973 season, the Giants sold Marichal to the [[Boston Red Sox]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=maricju01 Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a fairly solid [[1974 Boston Red Sox season|1974]], going 5–1 in 11 starts, but was released after the season.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He then signed with the Dodgers as a [[free agent]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"/&gt; Dodger fans had never forgiven Marichal for his attack on Roseboro 10 years earlier, and it took a personal appeal from Roseboro to calm them down.  However, Marichal's [[1975 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1975]] didn't last long; he was lit up for nine runs, 11 hits and a 13.50 ERA in only two starts before retiring.&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his career with 243 victories, 142 losses, 244 complete games, 2,303 strikeouts and a 2.89 ERA over 3,507 innings pitched.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He played in the [[1962 World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]] (one start, a [[Win–loss record (pitching)|no decision]]) and the [[1971 National League Championship Series]] against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (losing his only start).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maricju01.shtml#pitching_postseason Juan Marichal postseason pitching statistics at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1971, the Giants averaged 90 wins a season, and Marichal averaged 20 wins a year.

===No-hitter and All-Star performances===
Marichal pitched a [[no-hitter]] on June 15, {{Baseball year|1963}}, and was named to nine [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196306150.shtml June 15, 1963 Colt 45s-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected the [[Most Valuable Player]] of the [[1965 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1965 game in Minneapolis]], in which he pitched three shutout innings and faced the minimum nine batters, giving up one hit. His overall All-Star Game record was 2–0 with a 0.50 ERA in eight appearances facing 62 batters in 18 total innings, second-most in innings pitched only to [[Don Drysdale]] (19.1 innings; 2-1, 1.40 ERA and 69 batters faced).&lt;ref name="haft"&gt;Haft, Chris.

Marichal was passed over for election to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] during his first two years of eligibility, by all accounts because the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] voters still held his attack on Roseboro against him. However, after a personal appeal by Roseboro, Marichal was elected in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], and thanked Roseboro in his induction speech.&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TBT"/&gt; When Roseboro died in 2002, Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral and told the gathered, "Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life. I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-roseboro-marichal-plaschke-20150823-column.html|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|title=Fifty years after Giants' Juan Marichal hit Dodgers' John Roseboro with a bat, all is forgiven|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{Baseball year|1999}}, he ranked #71 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the [[The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players|100 Greatest Baseball Players]], and was a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ Juan Marichal at The Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball Players] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227144518/http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp Juan Marichal at The Major League Baseball All-Century Team]&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored before a game between the Giants and [[Oakland Athletics]] with a statue outside [[AT&amp;T Park]] in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], and was named one of the three starting pitchers on Major League Baseball's [[Latino Legends Team]]. In 1976, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Marichal was the right-handed pitcher on Stein's Latin team. The Giants also honored him by wearing jerseys that said "Gigantes."

==Controversy==
In 2008, Marichal was filmed at a [[cockfighting|cockfight]] in the Dominican Republic along with [[New York Mets]] pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]]. The incident caused controversy in the United States, but Martinez defended their attendance at the cockfight by saying, "I understand that people are upset, but that is part of our Dominican culture and is legal in the Dominican Republic". He added, "I was invited by my idol, Juan Marichal, to attend the event as a spectator, not as a participant."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3234767 "Video showed Pedro, Marichal at cockfight"] ESPN&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lorentz Creutz the elder.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Contemporary portrait of Lorentz Creutz]]

'''Lorentz Creutz''' ({{IPA-sv|loːrəns krøɪts}}; 1615–1 June 1676) was a [[Swedish empire|Swedish]] ''[[freiherr|friherre]]'' (roughly equivalent to a [[baron]]), government administrator, county governor (''landshövding'') of [[Dalarna County|Kopparberg County]] (1655–62), member of the Privy Council and supreme commander of the [[Swedish navy]] for a few months in 1676.

He successfully served as an administrator in the Treasury in later years and was appointed as navy commander in early 1676 during the [[Scanian War]]. However, his complete lack of naval military experience combined with the generally poor state of the Swedish fleet led to his death on ''[[Kronan (ship)|Kronan]]'', the flagship of the navy, at the [[battle of Öland]] on 1 June 1676.

Creutz married the ''friherrinna'' (roughly baroness) Elsa Duwall (1620–1675), daughter of general Jakob MacDougall (ennobled as "Duvall") and Anna von der Berge.

'''Lycurgus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɝː|g|ə|s|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Λυκοῦργος}}, ''Lykoûrgos'', {{IPA-el|lykôrɡos|anc}}; {{fl.}} {{circa}} 820 BC) was the quasi-legendary lawgiver of [[Sparta]] who established the military-oriented reformation of Spartan society in accordance with the [[Pythia|Oracle of Apollo at Delphi]]. All his reforms promoted the three Spartan virtues: equality (among citizens), military fitness, and austerity.&lt;ref name="Forrest, W.G. 1963 pg 50"&gt;Forrest, W.G. ''A History of Sparta 950-192 B.C'' Norton. New York. (1963)pg 50&lt;/ref&gt;

He is referred to by ancient historians and philosophers [[Herodotus]], [[Xenophon]], [[Plato]], [[Polybius]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Epictetus]]. It is not clear if Lycurgus was an actual historical figure; however, many ancient historians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|
last= Plutarchus|
first= Mestrius
| authorlink= Plutarch
| title= Parallel Lives
| pages= Chs. Lycurgus and Lycurgus and Numa Compared
| nopp= true}} Plutarch lists [[Eratosthenes]], [[Apollodorus of Athens]], Timæus, and [[Xenophon]], among others as sources.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that he instituted the [[communalism | communalistic]] and militaristic reforms - most notably the [[Great Rhetra]] - which transformed Spartan society.

== Biography ==
[[Image:Lycurgus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lycurgus]]

=== Early life ===
Most information about Lycurgus comes from [[Plutarch|Plutarch's]]  "Life of Lycurgus" (part of ''[[Parallel Lives]]''), which is more of an anecdotal collection than a real biography.  Plutarch himself remarks that nothing can be known for certain about Lycurgus, since different authors give different accounts of almost everything about him.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lycurugus,'' 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; The actual person Lycurgus may or may not have existed, -- it is possible that "Lycourgos" was an epithet of the god Apollo as he was worshiped in very early Sparta, and that later legend transformed this aspect of the god into a wise human lawgiver&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pelican History of Greece|last=Burn|first=A. R.|publisher=Penguin|year=1982|isbn=|location=London|pages=116-117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great|last=Bury|first=J. B.|last2=Meiggs|first2=Russell|publisher=Macmillan|year=1956|isbn=|edition=3|location=London|pages=135-136}}&lt;/ref&gt; --but as a symbolic founder of the Spartan state he was looked to as the initiator of many of its social and political institutions; much, therefore, of Plutarch's account is concerned with finding the "origin" of contemporary Spartan practices.  The dates of Lycurgus have been given by ancient and modern authorities as being as early as the tenth century BC and as late as the sixth century BC. Some scholars think the most plausible date is indicated by Thucydides, who said that in his time the Spartan constitution was over four hundred years old; this would imply a date for Lycurgus, or at least for the reforms attributed to him, of the last quarter of the ninth century BC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides 1.18.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history of Greece|last=Hammond|first=N. G. L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that Lycurgus had risen to power when his older brother, the king, had died. With his father deceased, he was offered the throne. Lycurgus' brother, however, had died with a pregnant wife. When this child was born, Lycurgus named the child, ''[[Charilaus]]'' ("joy of the people") and transferred his kingship to the baby. After that, Lycurgus was said to be a man who could lay down the supreme power easily out of respect for justice, so it was easy for Lycurgus to rule the Spartans in his capacity as the guardian of his nephew [[Charilaus]]. However, the young king's mother and her relatives envied and hated Lycurgus. Among other slanders, they accused Lycurgus of plotting the death of Charilaus.

=== Travels ===
Lycurgus finally decided that the only way that he might avoid blame in case something should happen to the child would be to go travelling until [[Charilaus]] had grown up and fathered a son to secure the succession. Therefore, Lycurgus gave up all of his authority set out on a celebrated, though no doubt legendary, journey.  His first destination was [[Crete]], like Sparta a [[Dorians|Dorian]] land, where he studied the laws of [[Minos]]. Spartan and Cretan institutions did indeed have common characteristics, but, though some direct borrowing may have occurred,  such similarities are in general more likely to be because of the common Dorian inheritance of Sparta and Crete rather than because some individual such as Lycurgus imported Cretan customs to Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rise of the Greeks|last=Grant|first=Michael|publisher=Scribners|year=1987|isbn=|edition=1st American|location=New York|pages=96,  195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling after that to Asia Minor, homeland of the [[Ionians|Ionian]] Greeks, he found it instructive to compare the refined and luxurious life style of the Ionians with the stern and disciplined culture of the Dorians. Some say that Lycurgus subsequently traveled as far as Egypt, Spain, and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|last=Smith|first=William|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1857|isbn=|volume=2|location=Boston|pages=850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ionia, Lycurgus discovered the works of Homer. Lycurgus compiled the scattered fragments of Homer and made sure that the lessons of statecraft and morality in Homer's epics became widely known. According to Plutarch, the Egyptians claim that Lycurgus visited them too,{{efn|name=EgyptPlutarch| "The Egyptians say that he took a voyage into Egypt, and that, being much taken with their way of separating the soldiery from the rest of the nation, he transferred it from them to Sparta, a removal from contact with those employed in low and mechanical occupations giving high refinement and beauty to the state. Some Greek writers also record this." Source: [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Plutarch]}} and that he got from the Egyptians the idea of separating the military from the menial workers, thus refining later Spartan society, in which Spartans were not allowed to practice manual crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Lycurgus, in Plutarch on Sparta, Penguin Classics, 1988, p12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Sparta===

After Lycurgus had been absent for a while, the Spartans wrote and begged Lycurgus to come back. As they admitted, only Lycurgus was really a king in their heart, although others wore a crown and claimed the title. He had the true foundation of sovereignty: a nature born to rule, and a talent for inspiring obedience. Even the Spartan kings wanted Lycurgus to return because they saw him as one who could protect them from the people.

Lycurgus had already decided that some fundamental changes would have to be made in Sparta. When he returned, he did not merely tinker with the laws, but instead followed the example of the wisest [[ephors]] to implement incremental change.

First, however, Lycurgus went to the Oracle at Delphi to ask for guidance. The Oracle told Lycurgus that his prayers had been heard and that the state which observed the laws of Lycurgus would become the most famous in the world. With such an endorsement, Lycurgus went to the leading men of Sparta and enlisted their support.

He began with his closest friends, then these friends widened the conspiracy by bringing in their own friends. When things were ripe for action, thirty of them appeared at dawn in the marketplace, fully armed for battle. At first, Charilaus thought they meant to kill him, and he ran for sanctuary in a temple, but eventually he joined the conspirators when he found out that all they wanted was to make sure there would be no opposition to the reforms Lycurgus had in mind.

=== Death ===
According to the legend found in Plutarch's ''Lives'' and other sources, when Lycurgus became confident in his reforms, he announced that he would go to the [[oracle at Delphi]] to [[sacrifice]] to [[Apollo]]. However, before leaving for [[Delphi]] he called an assembly of the people of [[Sparta]] and made everyone, including the kings and Gerousia, take an oath binding them to observe his laws until he returned. He made the journey to Delphi and consulted the oracle, which told him that his laws were excellent and would make his people famous. He then disappeared from history. One explanation was that being satisfied by this he starved himself to death instead of returning home, forcing the citizens of Sparta by oath to keep his laws indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;see the [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html biography of Lycurgus] in Plutarch's ''Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans''&lt;/ref&gt; He later enjoyed a [[Greek hero cult|hero-cult]] in Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;A commentary on Herodotus books I-IV By David Asheri, Alan B. Lloyd, Aldo Corcella, Oswyn Murray, Alfonso Moreno Page 127 {{ISBN|0-19-814956-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html Pausanias 3.16.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
Lycurgus is credited with the formation of many Spartan institutions integral to the country's rise to power, but more importantly the complete and undivided allegiance to Sparta from its citizens, which was implemented under his form of government.

Lycurgus is said to have been the originator of the Spartan "Homoioi," the "Equals," citizens who had no wealth differentiation among them, an early example of [[distributism]], insofar as the citizens (not the Helots) were concerned. This radical lifestyle differentiated the Spartans once again from other Greeks of their time.

=== A new council between the people and the kings ===
The first reform instituted by Lycurgus involved establishing a [[Gerousia]] of twenty-eight men, who would have a power equal to the two royal houses of Sparta. The people had the right to vote on important questions, but the Gerousia decided when a vote would be taken. As Plutarch puts it, a Gerousia "allays and qualifies the fiery genius of the royal office" and gives some stability and safety to the commonwealth, like the ballast in a ship. Before, Sparta had oscillated between the extremes of democracy and tyranny: anarchy and dictatorship. With the addition of the Gerousia, which resisted both extremes, the government became stable and the people and their rulers respected each other.

===Land reforms===
To accomplish this equality, Plutarch, in his ''Life of Lycurgus'', attributes to Lycurgus a thoroughgoing land reform, a reassignment and equalizing of landholdings and wealth among the population, {{Quote|text=For there was an extreme inequality among them, and their state was overloaded with a multitude of indigent and necessitous persons, while its whole wealth had centered upon a very few. To the end, therefore, that he might expel from the state arrogance and envy, luxury and crime, and those yet more inveterate diseases of want and superfluity, he obtained of them to renounce their properties, and to consent to a new division of the land, and that they should all live together on an equal footing; merit to be their only road to eminence... |author=Plutarch|source=Lycurgus&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;Plutarch, ''The Life of Lycurgus'' (written 75, trans. [[John Dryden]] 1683), [http://classics.mit.edu/index.html The Internet Classics Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}} To support this new land division, Lycurgus was said to have divided the country all around Laconia into 30,000 equal shares, and the part attached to the city of Sparta in particular into 9,000; all shares were distributed among the Spartans. Helots (the population of the territories the Spartans had captured in their wars in Laconia) were attached to the land, not to individual owners; hence, all slaves were property of the state.
 
===Currency===
To further support equality, Lycurgus, according to Plutarch, forbade the use of gold and silver, using the strategy of introducing money called [[pelanors]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2013/01/spartan-iron-currency.html The Spartan Iron Currency] Encyclopaedia of Money&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchel, Humfrey ''The Phoenix'' Classical Association of Canada (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; made of iron which had been weakened by it being cooled in a vinegar bath after being turned red-hot, and calling in all gold and silver, in order to defeat greed and dependence on money.&lt;ref name="Plutarch"/&gt; The new money, besides being almost intrinsically worthless, was bulky, and hence hard to transport. This move was seen by Plutarch also as a way of isolating Sparta from outside trade, and developing its internal arts and crafts, so as to prevent foreign influences and the decadence of markets.

===Common mess halls===
Another way to create equality was the Spartan institution of the sussita/syssitia, the practice that required all Spartan men to eat together in common mess halls.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, W.G. ''A History of Sparta 950-192 B.C'' Norton. New York. (1963) pg 45&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch describes the institution as consisting of companies ("syssitia", or "eating-together" groups) of about fifteen men, each bound to bring in and contribute each month a bushel of meal, 8 gallons of wine, 5 pounds of cheese, 2 and a half pounds of figs, and a small amount of money to buy meat or fish with. When any member made a personal sacrifice to the gods, he would send some portion to the syssition, and when any member hunted, he sent part of the animal he had killed, to share with his messmates. Personal sacrifices of this sort and hunting were the only excuses that allowed a man to justify eating at his own home, instead of with the mess hall (syssition): otherwise, men were expected to eat daily with their syssition comrades. Even kings were apparently expected to take part in a mess hall, and were not to eat privately at home with their wives. Spartan women apparently ate together with and spent most of their time with each other, and not their husbands or sons older than seven (see below on the "agoge").

===Education of children===
He was also credited with the development of the ''[[agoge]]''. The practice took all seven-year-old boys from the care of their fathers and placed them in a rigorous military regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, W.G. ''A History of Sparta 950-192 B.C'' Norton. New York. (1963)pg 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other measures===

Lycurgus himself was said to be mild, gentle, forgiving, and calm in temper, even when attacked; he was thought to have been extraordinarily sober and an extremely hard worker, all qualities that other Greeks admired in the Spartans; in this sense he was also the "founder" of the admirable qualities displayed by contemporary Spartans of later ages.

== Later changes to the institutions ==
Some further refinements of the Spartan constitution came after Lycurgus. It turned out that sometimes the public speakers would pervert the sense of propositions and thus cause the people to vote foolishly, so the Gerousia reserved the right to dissolve the assembly if they saw this happening.

A hundred and thirty years after the death of Lycurgus, a council of five ephors took executive power from the kings. When King [[Theopompus of Sparta|Theopompus]], in whose reign the ephors were established, was scolded by his wife for leaving his son less royal power than he had inherited, he replied: "No, it is greater, because it will last longer." With their decision-making power reduced, the Spartan kings were freed of the jealousy of the people. They never went through what happened in nearby [[Messene]] and [[Argos]], where the kings held on so tight to every last bit of power that in the end they wound end up losing it all.

== Influences ==
According to Plutarch, Lycurgus traveled to Crete, Asia Minor and possibly to Egypt before he drew up his constitution.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Biography of Lycurgus"&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Plutarch, Biography of Lycurgus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cretan constitution was said to have influenced that of Lycurgus for Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3. 2, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|text=(...) he first arrived at Crete, where, having considered their several forms of government, and got an acquaintance with the principal men among them, some of their laws he very much approved of, and resolved to make use of them in his own country; a good part he rejected as useless. |author=Plutarch|source=Lycurgus&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Biography of Lycurgus"&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Plutarch, Biography of Lycurgus]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another inspiration for his constitution was the Ionian way of life, that attached more importance to pleasurable life. {{efn|"From Crete he sailed to Asia, with design, as is said, to examine the difference betwixt the manners and rules of life of the Cretans, which were very sober and temperate, and those of the Ionians, a people of sumptuous and delicate habits, and so to form a judgment; just as physicians do by comparing healthy and diseased bodies." Source: [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Plutarch]}}
Plutarch also gives some credence to the idea Lycurgus visited Egypt and was influenced by their way of separating the soldiers from those who did manual labor. {{efn|name=EgyptPlutarch}}

'''Te Maputeoa''' (baptized '''Gregorio Stanislas'''; reigned as '''Gregorio I'''; born c. 1814 – 20 June 1857) was a monarch of the Polynesian island of [[Mangareva]] and the other [[Gambier Islands]]. He was the [[List of monarchs of Mangareva|King]] or ''[[ʻAkariki]]'' (paramount chief),{{Sfn|Kjellgren|2007|page=294}}{{sfn|Smith|1918|pages=130–131}} as well as the penultimate king of the island of [[Mangareva]], and other Gambier Islands including [[Akamaru Island|Akamaru]], [[Aukena]], [[Taravai]] and [[Temoe]].  He reigned from 1830 until his death in 1857.&lt;ref name=worldstatesmen&gt;{{cite web|last=Cahoon|first=Ben|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_Polynesia.html|title=French Polynesia|year=2000|work=WorldStatesman.org|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=Worldstatesman organization|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723105812/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_Polynesia.html|archive-date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|The Dublin Review, Vol. IV|1838|pages=372–73}}

During Maputeoa's reign, the country, which was deeply rooted in [[idolatry]] and even [[cannibalism]], became a Roman Catholic community. This was accomplished by removing all vestiges of idolatry, such as destroying the traditional wooden images of their indigenous faith deified in ''[[marae]]s'' and replacing them with churches. The king was baptized into [[Catholicism]] on 25 August 1836.{{Sfn|Kerchache|2001|page=309}} He learned about [[Christianity]] from the island's missionaries, headed by the French [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|Picpus]] priests, [[Honoré Laval]] and [[François Caret]]. His uncle [[Matua (priest)|Matua]], the High Priest of the local temple, also played a pivotal role in this activity.{{sfn|The Dublin Review, Vol. IV|1838|pages=372–73}}{{Sfn|Garrett|1982|page=94}}

==Biography==
Maputeoa was the grandson of Mapurure (also known as Te Mateoa), who was known to be alive in 1825 and said to have died in 1830 or 1832.{{sfn|Scarr|2013|page=125}}{{sfn|Laval|Newbury|O'Reilly|1968|page=9}} As Mapurure's son Te Ikatohara was killed by sharks in about 1824, Maputeoa, the grandson, became king after Mapurure's death. Because he was a minor, Maputeoa's uncle, [[Matua (priest)|Matua]], the High Priest (''taura tupua''), became the regent; Matua enjoyed the full trust of his people and may have had intentions of usurping power.{{sfn|Laval|1842|page=164}}{{sfn|Laval|Newbury|O'Reilly|1968|page=cxli}} Maputeoa had complete authority over the kingdom, excepting his four uncles, who jointly owned the land with the king; the uncles' allegiance to the king was only formal.{{Sfn|Williamson|2013|page=331}} Mangareva also had nominal control over the other Gambier Islands including [[Akamaru Island|Akamaru]], [[Aukena]], and [[Taravai]], which had their own kings who were vassals to the monarch at [[Rikitea]].{{sfn|Williamson|2013|page=334}}

Christian missionaries headed by Father Honoré Laval and Father François Caret from Chile of the order of the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]], landed in August 1834,{{Sfn|Kerchache|2001|page=309}} at Mangareva, which was then an independent kingdom under King Maputeoa. The king refused them access to the main island of Mangareva. However, the missionaries managed to land on a small island where the local chief gave them support to learn the Mangareva language and the islanders learned about Christianity. Within one of year of their arrival, the missionaries converted the islanders at Taravai, Aukena and Akamuru to Christianity, established churches, and even convinced the islanders to wear [[tunics]].{{Sfn|Hordern|2014|page=185}}

Initially, Matua accepted the Catholic religious practices. He donated the ''maraes'' to the missionaries to build churches and advised them on how to overthrow the king.{{Sfn|Garrett|1982|page=91}} As Maputeoa recognized what Matua was trying to do, the king began appearing in churches during mass. Two years after the missionaries' arrival in Gambier, Maputeoa consented to dismantle the Te Keika ''marae'', which was the largest of its kind on [[Rikitea]], and in its place, [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Rikitea]] was built, which became the largest church in the [[South Pacific islands]].{{Sfn|Hordern|2014|page=185}} Maputeoa was baptized at Church of Saint-Joseph-de-Taku on Mangareva along with 160 other people of the kingdom. He took the name  Gregorio after baptism in honor of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] who had deputed the missionaries to eastern Oceania, and solemnly placed his islands under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary.{{Sfn|Wiltgen|2010|page=151}}

Maputeoa died on 20 June 1857 of acute [[pleurisy]] or "the disease of the chest."{{sfn|Laval|1859|pages=288–289}}{{sfn|Laval|Newbury|O'Reilly|1968|page=19}}{{sfn|Cuzent|1872|pages=117–118}} He was succeeded as [[List of monarchs of Mangareva|King of Mangareva]] by his young son, [[Joseph Gregorio II]], with his widow Queen Maria Eutokia Toaputeitou as regent.

'''Mehmet Altınsoy''' (1924 in [[Aksaray]] – 17 February 2007 in [[Ankara]]) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] politician, co-founder of the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] ({{lang-tr|Anavatan Partisi}}), [[List of mayors of Ankara|Mayor of Ankara]] and minister of state.&lt;ref&gt;Biyografi.net - [http://www.biyografi.net/kisiayrinti.asp?kisiid=279 ''Biography of Mehmet Altınsoy''] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mehmet Altınsoy became a lawyer after graduating from the [[Ankara University, Law School|Law School at Ankara University]]. He entered politics after the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|military coup of 1960]]. By keeping his nationalist-conservative line in the last 50 years of the history of Turkish politics, he was a member of several political parties like  [[Nationalist Movement Party]],  [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] and finally [[Welfare Party]].

He was appointed a founding member of the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly|parliament]] in 1961. He was appointed minister in the cabinet of [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister]] [[Suat Hayri Ürgüplü]] in 1965. Mehmet Altınsoy served until 1969 in the parliament. In 1983, he was among the founders of [[Turgut Özal]]'s Motherland Party. Between 1984 and 1989, he served as the mayor of Greater Ankara and realized major [[infrastructure]] projects with the support of Prime Minister Turgut Özal, whom Altınsoy was considered to be a confidant. He became a minister for the second time, in the Welfare Party and [[True Path Party]] coalition cabinet in 1996-1997.

After lying three days in a [[coma]] at the [[Atatürk Hospital]] in [[Ankara]], where he was brought in following an [[intracranial hemorrhage]] caused by [[hypertension]], he died on 17 February 2007. Mehmet Altınsoy was first married with Necla (1928-2001), the daughter of former [[Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı|President of Religious Affairs]] Ahmet Hamdi Akseki, with whom he had two daughters Yasemin and Sedef.  He was buried at [[Karşıyaka Cemetery]] after the funeral service in [[Kocatepe Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;Haberler.com - [http://www.haberler.com/eski-bakanlardan-mehmet-altinsoy-un-cenazesi-haberi/ ''News - Funeral of Mehmet Altınsoy''] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7156">'''Mi Gao Huang Chen''' was a [[British Chinese]] man who was attacked on 23 April 2005 by a large group of youths outside the [[Chinese takeaway]] he ran in [[Scholes, Greater Manchester|Scholes]], [[Wigan]], [[Greater Manchester]]. He died of his injuries on 28 April at the age of 41.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4496359.stm "Shopkeeper killed by teenage gang"]. [[BBC News]]. 29 April 2005. Accessed 18 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The police arrested 23 people in connection with the attack,&lt;ref name=MG&gt;"Hidden from public view?".&lt;/ref&gt; four of whom were eventually convicted of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4421946.stm "Four boys killed takeaway owner"]. [[BBC News]]. 9 November 2005. Accessed 18 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Born in China, Chen moved to the UK several years before his death.&lt;ref name=TDG&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1489030/Teenage-gang-murder-Four-released-on-bail.html "Teenage gang murder: Four released on bail"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. 30 April 2005. Accessed 18 August 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/615gnb79B Archived] 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004 he and his girlfriend, Jia Ming Yah, who was known as Eileen Jia, bought the Superb Hut takeaway after the previous owner had abandoned it because of the harassment they suffered. In the months before the attack, the couple reported  several incidents of [[antisocial behaviour]] to the police, including [[racial abuse]] and attacks on 22{{nbsp}}April that smashed a window; Jia later said the police response to these incidents was lacking.&lt;ref name=Pai&gt;Pai, Hsiao-Hung; Lewis, Paul. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/17/ukcrime.race "Girlfriend blames police as 'racist' killers jailed"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 17 December 2005. Accessed 18 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder ==

On the night of the attack, Chen, Jia, and their chef, wielding weapons, confronted a group of youths who had gathered outside the takeaway, chasing them onto a nearby housing estate. At some point, a teenage girl was allegedly assaulted. The trio retreated, and Huang Chen was attacked by the youths, who by then had obtained their own weapons. During the attack—which lasted 15 minutes, was captured on camera, and was described by the prosecution as "forceful, deliberate and plain to see"—Chen was punched, kicked, had his head stamped on, and was attacked with the weapons. The coverage shows a girl throwing a branch at Jia, and Jia's attempts to protect Chen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4375374.stm "Shop owner was 'beaten to death'"].

Accessed 18 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Huang Chen fell into a coma, and was taken to [[Hope Hospital]] (now Salford Royal), where he died on 28 April.&lt;ref name=TDG/&gt; The pathologist who examined the body found that it had a fractured skull, a broken jaw, and a partly crushed brain; and said the cause of death was [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] to the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4386948.stm "Head injuries 'killed shop owner'"]. [[BBC News]]. 28 October 2005. Accessed 18 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The death contributed to the development of a number of schemes and groups designed to address crime in the local area.&lt;ref name=WCC&gt;[http://www.wigan.gov.uk/pub/council/agendas/2005-06/cabinet/061005/report11.htm "Committee Report: Anti-social behaviour – Scholes area"].

[https://www.webcitation.org/615gGhNeA Archived] 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hsiao-Hung of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the attack was part of a trend of increasing anti-Chinese violence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Pai, Hsiao-Hung. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/31/race.world?INTCMP=SRCH "Alarm over surge in anti-Chinese violence"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 31 May 2005. Accessed 19 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Jia and some in the Chinese community saw the attack as [[hate crime|racially motivated]], saying that the youths were white.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;&lt;ref name=DS18Aug&gt;[http://www.dimsum.co.uk/community/call-for-national-inquiry-into-treatment-of-chinese-victims-of-race-hatred.html "Call for National Inquiry into Treatment of Chinese Victims of Race Hatred"].

[https://www.webcitation.org/615giAdj7 Archived] 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby Chan, chairperson of Min Quan, and Suresh Grover, director of the Monitoring Group, said the police had a tendency to fail to support Chinese victims such as Jia: "it seemed that most criminal justice agencies froze when it came applying the most basic of the Lawrence Inquiry recommendations to Chinese victims".&lt;ref&gt;"Hidden from public view?".
*The Macpherson report into the [[death of Stephen Lawrence]] found that the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] was [[institutionally racist]], and made recommendations to address the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Detective chief inspector Steve Crimins of [[Greater Manchester Police]] said the attack was not racially motivated, and that "[t]o say that any failure to deal with previous incidents led directly to the death of Mr Chen is ludicrous".&lt;ref name=Pai/&gt; The [[Institute of Race Relations]] considers the death to have a "(known or suspected) racial element".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irr.org.uk/2002/november/ak000008.html "Deaths with a (known or suspected) racial element 2000 onwards"].

The '''murder of Mona Tinsley''' is a British [[child murder]] case from 1937. On 5 January 1937, 10-year-old Mona Lilian Tinsley disappeared after leaving her [[Newark-on-Trent]] school. A former lodger of Mona's parents, Frederick Nodder, became the [[prime suspect]] in her [[Child abduction|abduction]]. However, despite the fact both strong [[physical evidence|physical]] and [[circumstantial evidence]] existed attesting to his guilt, because no body could be found, Nodder could not be tried for her [[murder]], but was instead convicted of Mona's abduction and sentenced to seven years in [[prison|gaol]].&lt;ref name=lincolnshirelive&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/the-retford-murder-that-changed-british-law-forever/story-30036215-detail/story.html|title=The Grisly Retford Murder that Changed British Law Forever|access-date=9 January 2017|newspaper=Lincolnshire Live|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June, Mona's [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|strangled]] body was recovered from the [[River Idle]], and Nodder was subsequently charged with her murder. He was found guilty of Mona's murder and hanged at [[HM Prison Lincoln|Lincoln Prison]] on 30 December 1937.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37577247| title= The mother, the medium and the murder that changed the law| date= 5 January 2017| author= Greig Watson| website= BBC| accessdate= 6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder of Mona Tinsley was a prime case study cited in [[English law]] as leading to the abolition of the [[Murder conviction without a body#abolition of "no body, no murder"|''no body, no murder'']] principle. This principle was abolished in 1954. As such, a murder conviction can now be obtained based on circumstantial evidence, should this evidence be sufficiently [[Burden of proof (law)#Clear and convincing evidence|compelling and convincing]].&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;

==Disappearance and investigation==
On the afternoon of 5 January 1937,&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; 10-year-old Mona Tinsley disappeared after leaving her school in [[Newark-on-Trent]]. Her distraught parents reported her missing to the police that same evening. The police immediately launched an intense manhunt for the child. This search involved canals and rivers being [[dredging|dragged]], and empty properties being searched. The police search was assisted by hundreds of local volunteers.&lt;ref name=lincolnshirelive/&gt;

In response to extensive police appeals, two [[Witness|eyewitnesses]] came forward on 6 January to say they had seen the girl at a bus station in the company of a middle-aged man.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; One of these individuals was able to identify this man as a former lodger of the Tinsleys.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; A neighbour of the Tinsley family also informed the police that she had seen this former lodger of the theirs standing alone, loitering on a street corner close to Mona's school, staring in the direction of the entrance to the premises&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; on the afternoon of her abduction. Later that day, a bus conductor named Charles Reville confirmed to police that the previous day, a young girl matching Mona's description had indeed boarded his 4:45 p.m. bus from Newark to [[Retford]] in the company of a middle-aged man, and the pair had alighted his bus at Grove Street, Retford.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Reville ominously added that this man had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Murder: A Year by Year Account of the World's Most Pitiless Crimes'' {{ISBN|978-0-140-01775-5}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Reville's claims were independently substantiated by a passenger on the bus named Stanley Betts, who also claimed to have seen a middle-aged man travelling between Newark and Retford with a girl matching Mona's description.&lt;ref name=monster10&gt;''True Detective: The Monster with Staring Eyes'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mona's parents, Wilfred and Lilian Tinsley, were questioned by the police. They gave this former lodger's name as Frederick Hudson, adding that they had been introduced to Hudson by Lilian's sister, Edith Grimes, with whom Hudson lodged in [[Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The Tinsleys explained that after Hudson left the Grimes household in October 1935, he had briefly lodged with them, but that they had evicted him from their home after just three weeks for non-payment of rent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Tinsleys emphasised that his departure from their household had been upon amicable terms, and also confirmed that in the short space of time Hudson had lodged in their household, he had been popular with their seven children, who had all come to know him as "Uncle Fred".&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Police interviewed Edith Grimes, who stated the man her sister knew as Frederick Hudson was actually named Frederick Nodder, who had adopted the surname Hudson as an [[Pseudonym|alias]], since becoming the subject of an [[Affiliation (family law)|affiliation order]]. Grimes described Nodder as being a brutish and squalid drunkard with poor personal hygiene and few friends,&lt;ref name=monster10/&gt; who worked primarily as a motor mechanic and lorry driver in Retford. Nodder had, Grimes stated, deserted his wife many years before he had lodged with them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; However, she claimed and to be unaware of his current address, and to have not seen him for several months&lt;ref name=lincolnshirelive/&gt; (this was contradicted by a neighbour of the Grimes family, who recalled seeing a lorry driver fitting Nodder's description at their home shortly after Christmas 1936).&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Enquiries in public houses and garages in Retford quickly led officers to the Retford haulage firm with which Nodder was employed; this firm was able to provide police with Nodder's current address on Smeath Road in the [[Nottinghamshire]] village of [[Hayton, Nottinghamshire|Hayton]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;
==Formal questioning==
In the late evening of 6 January, police questioned Frederick Nodder at his rented home. Producing a photograph of Mona and asking if he knew the child, Nodder confirmed he did indeed "used to" know her, but claimed not to have seen the child for approximately 15 months.&lt;ref name=glasgowherald&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19371124&amp;id=Kj5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3994,4285305&amp;hl=en|title=Death Sentence on Nodder|access-date=9 January 2017|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=24 November 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioned as to his movements the previous day, Nodder confirmed he had indeed been in Newark the previous day, but that he had simply been looking for work.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; He had returned to Retford alone on the 3.45 p.m. bus (approximately 10 minutes before Mona is believed to have been abducted).&lt;ref name=monster10/&gt;

As police questioned Nodder, other officers began interviewing his neighbours. One of these neighbours claimed to police she had seen a young girl matching Mona's description at Nodder's premises earlier that day; another neighbour was able to confirm to police that at midday on 6 January, a young brunette girl wearing a blue dress had been standing in the back doorway of his house, watching Nodder digging in his garden.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of eyewitness testimony was enough to detain Nodder, and at 11 p.m. that evening, he was arrested on a [[bastardy]] warrant&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; (police having learned from Edith Grimes that Nodder had been the subject of an affiliation order),&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and both his home (known as "Peacehaven") and garden extensively searched. Every house, drain, ditch and [[cesspit]] within a three mile radius of his property was also searched,&lt;ref name=monster11&gt;''True Detective: The Monster with Staring Eyes'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and a five-mile stretch of the [[Chesterfield Canal]] was drained.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Although the search outside the grounds of Peacehaven proved fruitless insofar as discovering Mona either alive or dead, the search of his property revealed a handkerchief later determined to belong to Mona near a water tank at the rear of the premises. Also discovered inside the house were scraps of paper depicting a child's drawings and writings,&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fingerprint]]s upon crockery in the kitchen were quickly matched to those taken from materials Mona was known to have handled at her home. Ominously, an opened packet of sweets and a tin of [[Vaseline]] were discovered beneath a pillow in the front bedroom of these premises, indicating a likely sexual motive for Mona's abduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, Nodder was placed in an [[police lineup|identity parade]], and each of the witnesses who had seen Mona on 5 and 6 January did not hesitate to pick him out as the man they had seen in her company. Confronted with both these positive identifications and the successive pieces of evidence being discovered at his home, Nodder changed his story as to his actions on 5 January. In his initial statement, given on the evening of 8 January, Nodder claimed he had encountered Mona by chance outside her school, and that the child had asked him to take her to visit her aunt (Edith Grimes) in Sheffield in order that she could see her newborn cousin, whom she had not yet seen. Reluctantly, he had agreed to Mona's request, as he had expected to see Mrs. Grimes the following day (the pair having an agreement to meet once a week in their affair).&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} pp. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; He had therefore persuaded Mona to spend the evening at his home, before giving the child two [[shilling]]s and placing her on a bus to Sheffield the following evening, with instructions—both verbal and written—as to how to reach her aunt's home. This arrangement would therefore ensure Nodder's home was empty when Mrs. Grimes visited him at their pre-scheduled meeting time. Nodder further stated Edith Grimes could assist with the case, adding she had known his address but [[allegation|alleging]] she had withheld this information from the police. (Edith Grimes admitted to police she and Nodder had engaged in an affair, but indignantly denied his other claims and accusations.)&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive searches conducted in and around Newark, Sheffield and Hayton failed to find any trace of Mona and on 10 January 1937, Nodder was charged with Mona's abduction (the lack of a body precluding a charge of murder).&lt;ref&gt;''On Trial for Murder'' {{ISBN|0-09472-990-5}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Nodder proclaimed, "I didn't take her away by force!"&lt;ref name=monster10/&gt;

===Medium assistance===
Just days after the disappearance of Mona Tinsley, a renowned [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[mediumship|medium]] named [[Estelle Roberts]] contacted the [[Chief Constable]] of Newark, offering her assistance in locating the child&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; and adding that if he accepted her services, to mail her some clothing the child had worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychicsdirectory.com/articles/life-and-times-estelle-roberts/ |title= The Life and Times of Estelle Roberts|publisher=psychicsdirectory.com |date=9 February 2013 |accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the agreement of Mona's parents, police sought Roberts' assistance. Upon handling a silk dress the child had worn shortly before her disappearance, Roberts immediately knew the child was dead. She later informed police Mona had been murdered, adding that she had taken to a house with a water-filled ditch on one side, and that she had spent much of her time within this household copying "something out of a book" (police had not informed Roberts of the scraps of children's drawings or writings discovered at Peacehaven). Roberts stated the child had been strangled to death in an upstairs bedroom of these premises, before her murderer had placed her body in a sack and transported her remains to a river beyond the field which existed behind this house. Roberts then informed informed the police, "You will find the child's body there".&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistance of Scotland Yard==
Although Nodder refused to divulge the whereabouts of Mona's body, police were certain the child was dead. Following the completion of the search of Peacehaven and the vicinity of the premises, police—assisted by hundreds of volunteers and several [[search and rescue dog|search dogs]]—expanded the search for Mona's body to the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref name=monster11/&gt; After three weeks, the Chief Constable of Newark, Harry Barnes, decided to seek the assistance of [[Scotland Yard]]. A decision was made to extensively search every house, drain, ditch and pond within three miles of Peacehaven. This search was at the time one of the most extensive in British police history, although it would ultimately prove fruitless. Before the Scotland Yard officers left Hayton, they informed their counterparts of their conviction Mona's body had been thrown into the [[River Idle]], and of their fears the child's body had been swept into the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name=monster11/&gt;

==First trial==
On 9 and 10 March 1937, Nodder appeared at Birmingham [[Assizes]]. He was tried before [[Rigby Swift|Mr. Justice Swift]], charged with Mona's abduction; the taking of the girl by [[fraud]] with the intent of depriving her father of possession of her; of detaining her by fraud; of decoying and enticing her into his possession; and of unlawfully stealing and carrying away the child and secreting her against the wishes of her father.&lt;ref name=monster11/&gt;

The prosecution was conducted by [[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Norman Birkett]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]], who could only argue that Nodder had abducted the child. Nodder chose not to testify at this hearing,&lt;ref name=glasgowherald/&gt; leaving his defence counsel, led by [[Maurice Healy (writer)|Maurice Healy]], to reiterate Nodder's claims that the girl had spent one night at his Peacehaven home before he had given the child two shillings and instructions as to how to travel to her aunt's Sheffield home, and that he had not seen her since. Healy further argued that Mona may still be found alive and well, and that and no-one should speculate as to her fate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury took just 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid reference to Nodder's refusal to testify at this trial, stating: "Nobody knows what has become of that little girl{{nbsp}}... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent{{nbsp}}... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all{{nbsp}}... He sits there and never tells you a word." In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: "What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;''Death on the Waterways'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-47267-6}} p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; to be served at Lincoln Prison.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body discovery===
On 6 June 1937, a family boating on the River Idle in [[Bawtry]] spotted an object in the water, close to the bank. Upon closer inspection, this family discovered that the object was the partially decomposed body of a child, with the head and upper torso embedded in [[silt]] and trapped in a drain below water level.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Her body had been weighted down with wood and metal. On the banks of the river was a torn and rotting sack which had evidently been used to transport the child's body.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The location was approximately 8 miles from where Nodder had lived.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; The body was initially moved to a nearby inn, where the clothing present with the body was identified by Wilfred Tinsley as belonging to his daughter. A subsequent autopsy at the Retford Mortuary confirmed Mona had been strangled—most likely with a [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|ligature]]—and that she had been dead before entering the water. Due to the extensive period of time the body had been in the river, the extensive [[adipocere]] formation&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; upon the corpse prevented the [[pathology|pathologist]] from being able to determine whether Mona had been sexually assaulted before her murder.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in the 1930s'' {{ISBN|978-0-881-84855-7}} p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral of Mona Tinsley took place on 10 June 1937 at her local [[Methodism|Methodist Church]], where Mona had attended Sunday School. Several hundred people lined the streets as her coffin was led from the Methodist Church to [[Newark Cemetery]], where her body was interred. On 28 June, Frederick Nodder was formally charged with Mona's murder.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second trial==
Five months after Nodder had been formally charged with the murder of Mona Tinsley, he appeared at Nottingham Assizes to be tried for her murder.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' {{ISBN|1-85227-436-0}} p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His second trial began on 22 November 1937, and again saw Norman Birkett appear on behalf of the prosecution, and Maurice Healy on behalf of the defence. Healy again argued his client had no motive to commit the murder. Nodder himself testified at this second trial, claiming that he had not seen Mona after he had placed her on a bus at [[Worksop]], with view to her visiting her aunt in Sheffield. In response to questioning from both the prosecution and defence, Nodder denied killing the child, and alleged she had been murdered by an unknown individual after he had last seen her.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many prosecution witnesses to testify was the bus conductor, Charles Reville, who testified that a young girl matching Mona's description had boarded his bus in the company of a man whom he positively identified as Frederick Nodder, and that Nodder had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Also to testify at this second trial was [[Sir Bernard Spilsbury]], who testified that Mona had been strangled from behind with a bootlace or a cord of similar diameter.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

This second trial lasted just two days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4166452 |title=Criminal Cases: Nodder, Frederick: Convicted at Nottingham on 23 November 1937 for Murder |publisher=nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the jury took just 75 minutes to find Nodder guilty. When given the opportunity to speak after hearing the jury's verdict, Nodder stood before the judge, before declaring in a low but firm tone: "I shall go out of this court with a clear conscience."&lt;ref name=glasgowherald/&gt; In passing sentence, the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Macnaghten, informed Nodder: "Justice has slowly, but surely, overtaken you."&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' {{ISBN|1-85487-083-1}} p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===
Nodder did launch an [[appeal]] against his sentence,&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts &amp; Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-46339-1}} p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; contending that the evidence presented against him at his trial was purely [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]], but this appeal was dismissed on 13 December. He was hanged at Lincoln Prison at 8 a.m. on the morning of 30 December 1937. His executioners were [[Tom Pierrepoint]] and [[Stanley Cross (executioner)|Stanley Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britishexecutions.co.uk/execution-content.php?key=581| title= British Executions - Frederick Nodder| date= | author= | website= britishexecutions.co.uk| accessdate= 6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoyt, and Eastwood. It is the first film on which Eastwood was credited as composer of the [[Film score|score]].

==Plot==
Three boys, Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle, play hockey in a [[Boston]] street in 1975.&lt;!--Do not change 1975 to 1977, even though the 25 years do not add up to 2002. The film's credits indicate a character as being a '75 Reporter"--&gt; Spotting wet concrete, they start writing their names into it when a car pulls up with two men, one pretending to be a police officer and the other a priest. One gets out and berates the boys for their actions, and tells Dave to get into the car. The men hold Dave captive and [[child sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] him for four days, until he escapes.

Twenty-five years later, the boys are grown and, while they still live in Boston, have drifted apart. Jimmy is an ex-con running a neighborhood store, while Dave is a [[blue-collar]] worker, still haunted by his abduction. The two are still neighbors and related by marriage. Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie is secretly dating Brendan Harris, a boy Jimmy despises. She and Brendan are planning to run away together to Las Vegas.

Katie goes out for the night with her girlfriends and Dave sees her at a local bar. That night, Katie is murdered, and Dave comes home with an injured hand and blood on his clothes, which his wife Celeste helps him clean up. Dave claims he fought off a mugger, "bashed his head on the parking lot", and possibly killed him. Sean, now a detective with the [[Massachusetts State Police]], investigates Katie's murder. His pregnant wife, Lauren, has recently left him.

Over the course of the film, Sean and his partner, Sergeant Whitey Powers, track down leads while Jimmy conducts his own investigation using his neighborhood connections. Sean discovers that the gun used to kill Katie was also used in a liquor store robbery during the 1980s by "Just Ray" Harris, the father of Katie's boyfriend. Harris has been missing since 1989, but Brendan claims he still sends his family $500 every month. Brendan also feigns ignorance about Ray's gun but Sean believes it was still in the house. Sergeant Powers suspects Dave as a possible perpetrator because he was one of the last people to see Katie alive. He also has a wounded hand and, although he continues to tell his wife he got it while being mugged, he tells the police a different story—soon Jimmy becomes suspicious of it. Dave continues to behave strangely, which upsets his wife to the point she is afraid he will hurt her. While Jimmy and his associates conduct their investigation, Dave's wife eventually tells Jimmy about Dave's behavior, the bloody clothing, and her suspicions.

Jimmy and his friends get Dave drunk at a local bar. When Dave leaves the bar, the men follow him out. Jimmy tells Dave that he shot "Just Ray" Harris at that same location for ratting him out and sending him to jail. Jimmy informs Dave that his wife thinks he murdered Katie and tells Dave he will let him live if he confesses. Dave repeatedly tells Jimmy that he did kill someone but it was not Katie: he beat a child molester to death after finding him having sex with a child prostitute in a car. Jimmy does not believe Dave's claim and threatens him with a knife. When Dave falsely admits to killing Katie thinking he can escape with his life, Jimmy kills him and disposes of his body in the adjacent Mystic River.

While Dave is being killed, Brendan (having found out about his father's gun during questioning) confronts his younger brother Ray Jr. and his brother's friend John about Katie's murder. He beats the two boys and threatens to kill them if they do not admit their guilt, but when John takes the gun and is about to shoot him, Sean and Powers arrive just in time to stop it.

The next morning, Sean tells Jimmy the police have Katie's murderers—who have confessed. She was killed by Brendan's brother, "Silent Ray" Harris, and his friend John O'Shea in a violent prank gone wrong: The kids got hold of Just Ray's gun and saw a car coming which happened to be Katie's. John aimed the gun just to scare her but the gun went off by accident. The car veered onto the curb and Katie got out and ran into the park. Silent Ray and John pursued her so she wouldn't tell anyone. The beating Katie received was from Silent Ray, who had a hockey stick. Once she was beaten, John shot her again, killing her. Sean asks Jimmy if he has seen Dave, because he is wanted for questioning in another case, the murder of a known child molester. A distraught Jimmy thanks Sean for finding his daughter's killers, but says, "if only you had been a little faster." Sean asks Jimmy if he's going to "send Celeste Boyle $500 a month too?"

Sean reunites with his wife and his daughter Nora, after apologizing for "pushing her away". Jimmy goes to his wife, Annabeth, and confesses. She comforts him and tells him he is a king and kings always make the right decision. At a town parade, Sean sees Jimmy, and mimics shooting him, to let Jimmy know he is watching.

''nanobacteria'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|æ|n|oʊ|b|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|ə}} {{respell|NAN|oh|bak|TEER|ee|ə}}) is the unit or member name of a proposed class of living [[organism]]s, specifically [[cell wall|cell-walled]] [[microorganisms]] with a size much smaller than the generally accepted lower limit for life (about 200 [[nanometer|nm]] for [[Bacteria#Morphology|bacteria]], like [[Mycoplasma pneumoniae#Cell biology|mycoplasma]]). Originally based on observed nano-scale structures in geological formations ([[Allan Hills 84001|including one meteorite]]), the status of nanobacteria has been controversial, with some researchers suggesting they are a new class of living organism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kajander E |title=Nanobacteria—propagating calcifying nanoparticles |journal=Lett Appl Microbiol |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=549–52 |year=2006 |pmid=16706890 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.01945.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciftcioglu N, McKay D, Mathew G, Kajander E |title=Nanobacteria: fact or fiction?

In 1981 Torella and Morita described very small cells called [[ultramicrobacteria]]. Defined as being smaller than 300&amp;nbsp;nm, by 1982 MacDonell and Hood found that some could pass through a 200&amp;nbsp;nm membrane. Early in 1989, geologist Robert L. Folk found what he later identified as ''nannobacteria'' (written with double "n"), that is, nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens&lt;ref&gt;A convention has been adopted between researchers to name -or spell- the nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens as ''nannobacteria'', and those from biological specimens as ''nanobacteria''.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[travertine]] from hot springs of [[Viterbo]], Italy.  Initially searching for a bacterial cause for travertine deposition, [[scanning electron microscope]] examination of the mineral where no bacteria were detectable revealed extremely small objects which appeared to be biological.&lt;!-- 1989 find: Dark Life, pg 44 --&gt;  His first oral presentation elicited what he called "mostly a stony silence", at the 1992 [[Geological Society of America]]'s annual convention.&lt;ref name="Folk1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-03/ns_folk.html|title=Nanobacteria: surely not figments, but what under heaven are they?|last=Folk|first=Robert L.|date=March 4, 1997|publisher=naturalSCIENCE|accessdate=2008-12-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209035746/http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-03/ns_folk.html|archivedate=December 9, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that nanobacteria are the principal agents of precipitation of all minerals and crystals on Earth formed in liquid water, that they also cause all oxidation of metals, and that they are abundant in many biological specimens.&lt;ref name="Folk1997" /&gt;

''Nanobacterium sanguineum'' was proposed in 1998 as an explanation of certain kinds of pathologic [[calcification]] ([[apatite]] in [[kidney stone]]s) by [[Finland|Finnish]] researcher [[Olavi Kajander]] and [[Turkey (country)|Turkish]] researcher [[Neva Ciftcioglu]], working at the [[University of Kuopio]] in Finland. According to the researchers the particles [[Self-replication|self-replicated]] in [[microbiological culture]], and the researchers further reported having identified [[DNA]] in these structures by staining.&lt;ref name=Kajander&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kajander E, Ciftçioglu N |title=Nanobacteria: An alternative mechanism for pathogenic intra- and extracellular calcification and stone formation |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/14/8274 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=14 |pages=8274–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9653177 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.14.8274 |pmc=20966|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.8274K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in 2000 by a team led by an [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] scientist [[John Cisar]] further tested these ideas. It stated that what had previously been described as "self-replication" was a form of [[Crystal structure|crystalline]] growth. The only DNA detected in his specimens was identified as coming from the bacteria ''[[Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum]]'', which is a common contaminant in PCR reactions.&lt;ref name=Cisar &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cisar J, Xu D, Thompson J, Swaim W, Hu L, Kopecko D |title=An alternative interpretation of nanobacteria-induced biomineralization |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/21/11511 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=97 |issue=21 |pages=11511–5 |year=2000 |pmid=11027350 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.21.11511 |pmc=17231 |bibcode=2000PNAS...9711511C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001–present==
In 2004 a [[Mayo Clinic]] team led by Franklin Cockerill, John Lieske, and Virginia M. Miller, reported to have isolated nanobacteria from diseased human [[artery|arteries]] and [[kidney stone]]s. Their results were published in 2004 and 2006 respectively.&lt;ref name=mayo1 &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller V, Rodgers G, Charlesworth J, Kirkland B, Severson S, Rasmussen T, Yagubyan M, Rodgers J, Cockerill F, Folk R, Rzewuska-Lech E, Kumar V, Farell-Baril G, Lieske J |title=Evidence of nanobacterial-like structures in calcified human arteries and cardiac valves |url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/287/3/H1115 |journal=Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol |volume=287 |issue=3 |pages=H1115–24 |year=2004 |pmid=15142839 |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00075.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo2 &gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kumar V, Farell G, Yu S, etal |title=Cell biology of pathologic renal calcification: contribution of crystal transcytosis, cell-mediated calcification, and nanoparticles |journal=J.

Dr. Puskás identified these particles in cultures obtained from human atherosclerotic aortic walls and blood samples of atherosclerotic patients but the group was unable to detect DNA in these samples.&lt;ref name=puskas &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Puskás L, Tiszlavicz L, Rázga Z, Torday L, Krenács T, Papp J |title=Detection of nanobacteria-like particles in human atherosclerotic plaques |journal=Acta Biol Hung |volume=56 |issue=3–4 |pages=233–45 |year=2005 |pmid=16196199 |doi=10.1556/ABiol.56.2005.3-4.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ciftcioglu and her research team at [[NASA]] used a rotating [[cell culture]] flask, which simulates some aspects of low-gravity conditions, to culture nanobacteria suspected of rapidly forming kidney stones in astronauts. In this environment, they were found to multiply five times faster than in normal Earth gravity. The study concluded that nanobacteria might have a potential role in forming kidney stones and may need to be screened for in crews pre-flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciftçioglu N, Haddad R, Golden D, Morrison D, McKay D |title=A potential cause for kidney stone formation during space flights: enhanced growth of nanobacteria in microgravity |journal=Kidney Int |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=483–91 |year=2005 |pmid=15673296 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.67105.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The February 2008 ''Public Library of Science (PLoS) Pathogens'' article focused on the comprehensive characterization of nanobacteria. The authors say that their results rule out the existence of nanobacteria as [[Life|living]] entities and that they are instead a unique [[Plant propagation|self-propagating]] entity, namely self-propagating mineral-[[fetuin]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Raoult D, Drancourt M, Azza S, etal |title=Nanobacteria Are Mineralo Fetuin Complexes |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e41 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18282102 |pmc=2242841 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0040041 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2008 ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)'' article also reported that blood nanobacteria are not living organisms and stated that "CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; precipitates prepared ''in vitro'' are remarkably similar to purported nanobacteria in terms of their uniformly sized, membrane-delineated vesicular shapes, with cellular division-like formations and aggregations in the form of colonies."&lt;ref name="Martel J, Young JD 2008 5549–54"/&gt; The growth of such "biomorphic" inorganic precipitates was studied in detail in a 2009 ''Science'' paper, which showed that unusual crystal growth mechanisms can produce [[witherite]] precipitates from barium chloride and silica solutions that closely resemble primitive organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=García-Ruiz JM, Melero-García E, Hyde ST |title=Morphogenesis of self-assembled nanocrystalline materials of barium carbonate and silica |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5912 |pages=362–5 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19150841 |doi=10.1126/science.1165349 |url=http://garciaruiz.com/biomorphs/Science_2009_files/Morphogenesis%20of%20Self-Assembled%20Nanocrystalline_JM_science_2009_1.pdf|bibcode = 2009Sci...323..362G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors commented on the close resemblance of these crystals to putative nanobacteria, stating that their results showed that evidence for life cannot rest on morphology alone.

Further work on the importance of nanobacteria in geology by R. L. Folk and co-workers includes study of calcium carbonate Bahama ooids,&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Lynch. FL (2001) Organic matter, putative nanobacteria and the formation of oolites and hard grounds, Sedimentology, 48:215-229.&lt;/ref&gt; silicate clay minerals,&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Lynch, FL, (1997) The possible role of nanobacteria (dwarf bacteria) in clay-mineral diagenesis, Journal of Sedimentary Research, 67:583-589.&lt;/ref&gt; metal sulfides,&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL (2005) nanobacteria and the formation of framboidal pyrite, Journal Earth System Science, 114:369-374&lt;/ref&gt; and iron oxides.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Carlin J (2006) Adventures in an iron birdbath: nanostructure of iron oxide and the nanobacteria connection, Geological Society of America, Abstracts with programs, v. 38 (3), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In all these chemically diverse minerals, the putative nanobacteria are approximately the same size, mainly 0.05 to 0.2&amp;nbsp;μm. This suggests a commonality of origin. At least for the type locality at Viterbo, Italy, the biogenicity of these minute cells has been supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, B and Lynch, FL (2005) nanobacteria, Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster—what are you supposed to believe?, Geological Society of America, abs. with progr., v. 37:253.&lt;/ref&gt; Slices through a green bioslime showed entities from 0.4 down to as small as 0.09&amp;nbsp;μm with definite cell walls and interior dots resembling ribosomes; and even smaller objects with cell walls and lucent interiors with diameters of 0.05&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Kirkland, B, (2007) On the smallness of life: new TEM evidence from biofilm in hot springs, Viterbo, Italy, Geological Society of America, abs. with proper., v. 39 (6) 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Culturable organisms on earth are the same 0.05&amp;nbsp;μm size as the supposed nanobacteria on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Taylor, L (2002) nanobacterial alteration of pyroxenes in Martian meteorite ALH84001, Meteorology and Planetary Science, v. 37:1057-1070.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although smaller than other [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|tyrant]] models, the creature dwarfs a typical human, and possesses vastly superior intelligence and physical dexterity than its [[undead]] peers. It features in ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' as a titular main villain before later emerging in other titles and [[cameo appearance|cameo]] roles. It is also featured on various merchandise and in the 2004 film ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''. The character is voiced by [[Tony Rosato]] in the original game and [[Gregg Berger]] in ''Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City'', and portrayed by [[Matthew G. Taylor]] in the film.

Since the Nemesis' introduction, the character has received a positive reception, and has come to be regarded as one of the series' most popular characters. Some publications have praised its role as an intimidating villain, while others have noted it as one of their favourite and most terrifying monsters in video games.

==Conception and design==
Introduced in ''Resident Evil 3'', the Nemesis was designed under the concept of a "huge, overpowering monster that could use weapons and intelligently track you anywhere." During development, many different designs were considered. Although some elements remained constant among them, the early designs featured several different degrees of surface damage, as well as different options for clothing such as a [[Ballistic vest|protective vest]] instead of a coat or a nude design similar to the original [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]] from ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil Archives |last=Capcom Staff |authorlink=Capcom |year=2005 |publisher=[[BradyGames]]/[[Capcom]] |isbn=0-7440-0655-4 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series' story, the Nemesis is the result of infecting a Tyrant — a humanoid [[bio-weapon]] created to be the ultimate lifeform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil Archives |last=Capcom Staff |authorlink=Capcom |year=2005 |publisher=[[BradyGames]]/[[Capcom]] |isbn=0-7440-0655-4 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;—with a parasitic organism designed to increase its intelligence. Upon infection, the parasite takes control of the Tyrant's nervous system, forming its own brain and enabling it to follow precise instructions and make decisions without a need for constant direction. Clothed in black trousers, an overcoat, boots, and gloves, the Nemesis is armed with a [[FIM-92 Stinger|rocket launcher]] mounted on its left arm.&lt;ref name="nemesis-overview" /&gt; To emphasize its design as a [[prototype]], the game developers left exposed muscles on its body and added stitches to cover the right eye.&lt;ref name="guidebook-bh3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biohazard 3 Last Escape Official Guide Book |last=''Resident Evil 3'' development team |authorlink=Capcom |date=1999-11-13 |publisher=[[Aspect Co., Ltd.]]/[[Capcom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon spotting its target, it says the target's name out loud and attacks.&lt;ref name="nemesis-overview"&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil Archives |last=Capcom Staff |authorlink=Capcom |year=2005 |publisher=[[BradyGames]]/[[Capcom]] |isbn=0-7440-0655-4 |pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secretions from the parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which result in the creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it ''will'' repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin and the emergence of additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable [[mutations]] caused by further attacks.&lt;ref name=nemREUC&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]|developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=2007-11-13 |platform=Nintendo Wii |version= |level=Nemesis T-Type (Pursuer) Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Resident Evil 3'', the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence.&lt;ref name="nemesis-overview" /&gt; This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked to try to make it appear as unique as possible.&lt;ref name="guidebook-bh3" /&gt;

==Appearances==

===In video games===
The Nemesis, named after the [[Nemesis (mythology)|Goddess of Vengeance]] from [[Greek mythology]], first appears in the 1999 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' as the game's title character and primary antagonist. The product of years of research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=The Wesker Report |developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=[[Capcom]] |date=2001-03-22|platform=[[Dreamcast]] |quote=Albert Wesker: It was our 11th summer since we arrived at the Arklay Laboratory. A few days later, in the middle of the night, a parcel arrived from Europe via various transit points. It arrived to our heliport in a small box. "Nemesis Prototype"...}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prototype is deployed by the Umbrella Corporation as a field test to hunt and kill the STARS police team before they can expose Umbrella's activity in the Arklay mountains.&lt;ref name="guidebook-bh3" /&gt; The game’s protagonist, [[Jill Valentine]], first encounters the Nemesis outside Raccoon City’s police station where it kills [[Brad Vickers]] and then pursues her, uttering "''STARS...''" on sight. The Nemesis continues to stalk Valentine throughout the game, attacking with physical blows and grabs, and later, armed with a rocket launcher. After losing its overcoat as a result of heavy damage, the Nemesis mutates, and gains the ability to attack with long, extendable tentacles. Despite later being doused in acid, the Nemesis continues its pursuit, and mutates into a much larger monster after absorbing a dead Tyrant, gaining the ability to spew poison. Jill finally defeats the Nemesis using a [[Railgun|rail cannon]], and then depending on the choice of the player, she either kills it once and for all by unloading her weapons into it, or leaves it to die in the nuclear explosion that destroys Raccoon City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil Archives |last=Capcom Staff |authorlink=Capcom |year=2005 |publisher=[[BradyGames]]/[[Capcom]] |isbn=0-7440-0655-4 |pages=61–69, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nemesis also appears in ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica#Survivor 2|Resident Evil Survivor 2 Code: Veronica]]'', chasing the player if they fail to complete a level before the time limit expires and killing them instantly if it hits them; it can also be fought as a secret [[boss (video game)|boss]] armed with a rocket launcher if the player has met the proper conditions upon completing the game.&lt;ref name="flyer"&gt;{{cite manual|url=http://arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyer&amp;db=videodb&amp;id=2424&amp;image=1 |location=[[United Kingdom]] |year=2001 |title=Gun Survivor 2 - Biohazard Code: Veronica |publisher=[[Capcom]] |accessdate=2009-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024115855/http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyer |archivedate=24 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nemesis returns for the ''Resident Evil 3'' chapter of ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]'', in which it pursues Jill in the same manner as the original game and mutates into its secondary form as a boss.&lt;ref name=REUC&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]|developer=[[Capcom]] |publisher=Capcom |date=2007-11-13 |platform=Nintendo Wii |version= |level= |isolang= |quote=Resident Evil 3 Digest 1 (Archive): A black-coated monster stood between them and their freedom.

However, despite the initial concerns about his inclusion, the Nemesis appears as a playable character in ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'', an updated version of ''Marvel vs. Capcom 3''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324583/ultimate-marvel-vs-capcom-3-roster-leaked GameSpot - Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 roster leaked] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722101943/http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324583/ultimate-marvel-vs-capcom-3-roster-leaked |date=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nemesis returns as a playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''. In the game's story, following the Convergence, it is captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.brella]] leader [[M.O.D.O.K.]] and reprogrammed as his enforcer; it later battles and is defeated by [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Mike Haggar]]. The Nemesis also appears in ''[[Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City]]''. In the game, the Nemesis' programming is damaged and the USS is tasked with finding a parasite to repair it. Once the parasite is found, the players must defeat the Nemesis and inject it with the parasite. The Nemesis in the game uses a gatling gun for the fight and is mainly based on his film counterpart; however once the mission is completed, the Nemesis awakes to find his rocket launcher and utters his famous line, "STARS..." The Nemesis also appears in the tactical role-playing game ''[[Project X Zone]]'' as a rival unit.

===In film===
The Nemesis is featured in the 2004 film, ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'', portrayed by [[Matthew G. Taylor]]. The character's design was left relatively unchanged, brandishing a rocket launcher and similar attire, but with the addition of a forearm-mounted rail gun,&lt;ref name="jeremy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Downey, Ryan J. |date=2004-02-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124080906/http://mtvasia.com/News/200402/17007720.html |archivedate=2005-11-24 |url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200402/17007720.html |title=Milla Jovovich Battles Zombies, Bloody Hands On 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' Set |publisher=[[MTV|MTV Asia]] |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; modeled after a heavily modified [[minigun]].

Anderson]] noted that the gun's addition was inspired by the idea of the Nemesis "walking around with a gigantic, powerful weapon in each hand and almost indecisive as to which one to use".&lt;ref name="jeremy"&gt;{{cite web |author=Walker, Jeremy |url=http://www.jeremywalker.com/pages/films/imagesnote/Resident_Evil_Apocalypse_notes.doc |title=Resident Evil: Apocalypse - Production Notes |format=[[DOC (computing)|DOC]] |publisher=Jeremy Walker &amp; Associates |accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costume for Nemesis was created by Kropserkel Inc. and PJFX Studios, and stands roughly {{height|ft=7|in=3|abbr=mos}} tall,&lt;ref name="krop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kropserkel.com/Nemesis.htm |title=Resident Evil: Apocalypse Nemesis costume |publisher=Kropserkel |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; weighing nearly {{convert|100|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="spina" /&gt; After production of ''Apocalypse'' was completed, the costume was restored and put on display at Kropserkel's offices.&lt;ref name="spina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomspinadesigns.com/Displays.html |title=Custom Display Services |publisher=Tom Spina Designs |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While The Nemesis' design remained similar, the character itself was expanded upon, now portrayed as a [[tragic villain]]. Formerly '''Matt Addison''' (portrayed by [[Eric Mabius]]), a survivor of the events of the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]], he was infected with the T-virus after being scratched by a Licker and later captured and experimented upon by the Umbrella Corporation. Transformed into the Nemesis, it is sent to kill the surviving members of STARS, but remembers its humanity after fighting [[List of Resident Evil characters#Alice|Alice]], and fights alongside the protagonists towards the film's conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Collura, Scott |date=2007-09-21 |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/822/822250p2.html |title=Resident Evil Movies Character Rundown |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nemesis is eventually crushed beneath a crashing helicopter, and is later killed by the nuclear explosion that destroys Raccoon City.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===In printed adaptations===
[[File:Biohazard3-comic-Nemesis.jpg|thumb|In contrast to [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|the film]], literary depictions of the character have retained its role as an imposing [[antagonist]]]]

The Nemesis appears in a 1999 [[Hong Kong]] [[manhua]] adaptation of ''Resident Evil 3'' by Lee Chung Hing, ''Biohazard 3: Last Escape'', which is named after the game's Japanese title. The 27-issue series adds to the Nemesis' backstory, detailing its origin by showing the infection and transformation of the original Tyrant by the Nemesis parasite. Some elements are changed for its design, such as the Nemesis retaining both eyes initially, and then losing the right eye and gaining cranial staples only after an encounter with Jill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| title = BioHazard 3: Last Escape| volume = 1| date = 1999| publisher = Lee Chung Hing| location = [[Hong Kong]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic also introduces characters from ''Resident Evil 2'' into the storyline, which results in a face-off between the Nemesis and the mutated [[William Birkin]] towards the end of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| title = BioHazard 3: Last Escape| volume = 21| date = 1999| publisher = Lee Chung Hing| location = [[Hong Kong]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] published a [[novelization]] of ''Resident Evil 3'', written by [[S. D. Perry]]. Though left unchanged for the most part, the Nemesis is immediately recognized as a modified Tyrant in the novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil: Nemesis |last=Perry |first=S. D. |authorlink=S. D. Perry|year=2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-78496-X |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Jill Valentine dubs the "Nemesis" after thinking about why it hunts her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil: Nemesis |last=Perry |first=S.

Perry|year=2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-78496-X |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of mutating due to having taken damage, the Nemesis transforms voluntarily towards the conclusion of the story in its pursuit of Jill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil: Nemesis |last=Perry |first=S. D. |authorlink=S. D. Perry|year=2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-78496-X |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its second form from the game being its actual appearance beneath the coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resident Evil: Nemesis |last=Perry |first=S. D. |authorlink=S. D. Perry|year=2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-78496-X |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novelization of ''Apocalypse'' was released in 2004, written by [[Keith R. A. DeCandido]]. In the book, Matt and the Nemesis act as separate personalities in the same body, both aware, but with the Nemesis dominant. Matt eventually regains control after his body is impaled on a metal shard while fighting Alice, by showing the Nemesis his memories of Umbrella's experimentation upon "them".&lt;ref name="book"&gt;[[Keith R.

[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. {{ISBN|0-7434-9937-9}}. pp. 148-149, 247, 257&lt;/ref&gt; The Nemesis is later mentioned in the 2007 novelization of ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'', in which antagonist Doctor Isaacs considers the Nemesis both his greatest success and his greatest failure, hating mention of it and blaming its defection and destruction upon Umbrella's desire to immediately field test it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith R. A. DeCandido|DeCandido, By Keith R. A.]] and [[Paul W. S. Anderson]] (2007), ''Resident Evil: Extinction''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. {{ISBN|1-4165-4498-4}}. pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Otakon 2006 Nemesis.jpg|thumb|Cosplay Nemesis in 2006.]]
Following the game's debut in 1999, the Nemesis became one of the most recognizable and popular characters in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series. [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4's]] ''[[Filter (TV series)|Filter]]'' named the Nemesis one of the top ten videogame villains of all time as selected by viewers, placing fifth on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Mizota, Diane |date=2002-06-25 |title=[[Filter (TV series)|Filter]] |type=video |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]|time=Top 10 Villains list }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN noted it as their favorite aspect of ''Resident Evil 3'', stating, "The point is, he's a bad-ass, and he's got plenty of surprises in store for you besides just fast feet and a big gun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Perry, Doug |date=1999-11-11 |url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161482p1.html |title=Resident Evil 3 Review |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another article, IGN noted the Nemesis as one of their favorite video game monsters of all time, but felt disdain for its presentation in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schedeen, Jesse |date=2008-10-31 |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/925/925158p7.html |title=The Monsters of Gaming |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also named him one of the series' best bosses, calling it "what may be Umbrella's most fearsome creation ever" and comparing it to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''{{'}}s [[T-1000]], and later one of the top 100 video game villains of all time, placing 59th and described as horrific not for its appearance or attacks but its persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/961/961553p10.html |title=Best Resident Evil Bosses |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-11-02 |author=Schedeen, Jesse |date=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=IGN |title=Big Boss of the Day: Resident Evil's Nemesis |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/105/1050309p1.html |author=Schedeen, Jesse |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/59.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410050624/http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/59.html | archivedate=10 April 2012 |title=Nemesis is number 59 |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-05-20 |date=2010-05-03 |author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]] named the battle against the Nemesis one of the "25 of the Most Badass Boss Fights of All Time", saying "There are plenty of bosses worth mentioning from the ''Resident Evil'' series... but the one that to this day most people point to as the biggest badass of the bunch is Nemesis{{sic}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |date=2009-03-17 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3173294 |title=25 of the Most Badass Boss Fights of All Time |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325100022/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3173294 |archivedate=25 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}

'''Nihilism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|(|h|)|ᵻ|l|ɪ|z|əm|,_|ˈ|n|iː|-}}; {{ety|la|nihil|nothing}}) is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]] that suggests the denial or lack of belief towards the reputedly meaningful aspects of life.  Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of [[existential nihilism]], which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Pratt]] defines existential nihilism as "the notion that life has no intrinsic meaning or value, and it is, no doubt, the most commonly used and understood sense of the word today." [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/n/nihilism.htm Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moral nihilism|Moral nihilists]] assert that there is no inherent [[morality]], and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[ontology|ontological]], or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.

The term is sometimes used in association with [[anomie]] to explain the general mood of [[despair]] at a perceived pointlessness of existence that one may develop upon realising there are no necessary norms, rules, or laws.&lt;ref&gt;Bazarov, the protagonist in the classic work ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' written in the early 1860s by [[Ivan Turgenev]], is quoted as saying nihilism is "just cursing", cited in ''Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967) Vol. 5, "Nihilism", 514 ''ff''. This source states as follows: "On the one hand, the term is widely used to denote the doctrine that moral norms or standards cannot be justified by rational argument. On the other hand, it is widely used to denote a mood of despair over the emptiness or triviality of human existence. This double meaning appears to derive from the fact that the term was often employed in the nineteenth century by the religiously oriented as a club against atheists, atheists being regarded as ''ipso facto'' nihilists in both senses. The [[atheist]], it was held [by the religiously oriented], would not feel bound by moral norms; consequently, he would tend to be callous or selfish, even criminal" (at p. 515).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nihilism has also been described as conspicuous in or constitutive of certain historical periods. For example, [[Jean Baudrillard]] and others have called [[postmodernity]] a nihilistic epoch&lt;ref&gt;For some examples of the view that postmodernity is a nihilistic epoch see Toynbee, Arnold (1963) ''A Study of History'' vols. VIII and IX; Mills, C. Wright (1959) ''[[The Sociological Imagination]]''; Bell, Daniel (1976) ''The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism''; and Baudrillard, Jean (1993) "Game with Vestiges" in ''Baudrillard Live'', ed. Mike Gane and (1994) "On Nihilism" in ''Simulacra and Simulation'', trans. Sheila Faria Glasser. For examples of the view that postmodernism is a nihilistic mode of thought, see Rose, Gillian (1984) ''Dialectic of Nihilism''; Carr, Karen L. (1988) ''The Banalization of Nihilism''; and Pope John-Paul II (1995), ''Evangelium vitae: Il valore e l'inviolabilita delta vita umana''.

{{nihilism}}
Nihilism has many definitions, and thus can describe multiple arguably independent philosophical positions.

=== Metaphysical ===
{{Main|Metaphysical nihilism}} 
Metaphysical nihilism is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory that posits that concrete objects and physical constructs might not exist in the [[possible world]], or that even if there exist possible worlds that contain some concrete objects, there is at least one that contains only [[abstract object]]s.

Extreme metaphysical nihilism is commonly defined as the belief that nothing exists as a correspondent component of the self-efficient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/nihilism?view=uk|title=AskOxford: nihilism|author=www.askoxford.com|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122131329/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/nihilism?view=uk|archivedate=2005-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Heritage Medical Dictionary defines one form of nihilism as "an extreme form of skepticism that denies all existence."&lt;ref name="Heritage2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Medical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kT7ykAhh3fsC&amp;pg=PA363|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-94725-6|page=363|entry=nihilism}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar skepticism concerning the concrete world can be found in [[solipsism]]. However, despite the fact that both deny the certainty of objects' true existence, the nihilist would deny the existence of [[self (philosophy)|self]] whereas the solipsist would affirm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/solipsis/|title=Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these positions are considered forms of [[anti-realism]].

=== Epistemological ===
{{Main|Epistemological nihilism}}
Epistemological nihilism is a form of [[Epistemological nihilism|skepticism]] in which all knowledge is accepted as being possibly untrue or as being impossible to confirm as true.

=== Mereological ===
{{Main|Mereological nihilism}}
Mereological nihilism (also called compositional nihilism) is the position that objects with proper parts do not exist (not only objects in space, but also objects existing in time do not have any temporal parts), and only basic building blocks without parts exist, and thus the world we see and experience full of objects with parts is a product of human misperception (i.e., if we could see clearly, we would not perceive compositive objects).

This interpretation of existence must be based on resolution. The resolution with which humans see and perceive the "improper parts" of the world is not an objective fact of reality, but is rather an implicit trait that can only be qualitatively explored and expressed. Therefore, there is no arguable way to surmise or measure the validity of mereological nihilism. Example: An ant can get lost on a large cylindrical object because the circumference of the object is so large with respect to the ant that the ant effectively feels as though the object has no curvature. Thus, the resolution with which the ant views the world it exists "within" is a very important determining factor in how the ant experiences this "within the world" feeling.

=== Existential ===
{{main|Existential nihilism}}
[[File:Merwart-Nihilist.jpg|thumb|''The Nihilist'' by [[Paul Merwart]] (1882)]]

Existential nihilism is the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism posits that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. The meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of [[existentialism]].

=== Moral ===
{{Main|Moral nihilism}}
Moral nihilism, also known as ethical nihilism, is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view that morality does not exist as something inherent to objective reality; therefore no action is necessarily preferable to any other. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is not inherently right or wrong.

Other nihilists may argue not that there is no morality at all, but that if it does exist, it is a human construction and thus artificial, wherein any and all meaning is relative for different possible outcomes. As an example, if someone kills someone else, such a nihilist might argue that killing is not inherently a bad thing, or bad independently from our moral beliefs, because of the way morality is constructed as some rudimentary dichotomy. What is said to be a bad thing is given a higher negative weighting than what is called good: as a result, killing the individual was bad because it did not let the individual live, which was arbitrarily given a positive weighting. In this way a moral nihilist believes that all moral claims are void of any truth value. An alternative scholarly perspective is that moral nihilism is a morality in itself. Cooper writes, "In the widest sense of the word 'morality', moral nihilism is a morality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Moral Nihilism | journal = Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society | first = Neil | last = Cooper | volume = 74 | issue = 1973-1974 | pages = 75–90 | jstor = 4544850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
Political nihilism follows the characteristic nihilist's rejection of non-rationalized or non-proven assertions; in this case the necessity of the most fundamental social and political structures, such as [[government]], [[family]], and [[law]]. An influential analysis of political nihilism is presented by [[Leo Strauss]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Strauss, "German Nihilism", ''Interpretation'' 26 (3) (1999): pp. 353–378.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russian movement ====
{{main|Russian nihilist movement}}
The Russian Nihilist movement was a Russian trend in the 1860s that rejected all authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=anarchism&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary] s.v. "nihilism"&lt;/ref&gt;  After the assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881, the Nihilists gained a reputation throughout Europe as proponents of the use of violence for political change.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Nihilists expressed anger at what they described as the abusive nature of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and of the tsarist monarchy, and at the domination of the Russian economy by the aristocracy. Although the term ''Nihilism'' was coined by the German theologian [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743–1818), its widespread usage began with the 1862 novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' by the Russian author [[Ivan Turgenev]]. The main character of the novel, [[Eugene Bazarov]], who describes himself as a Nihilist, wants to educate the people. The "go to the people{{spaced ndash}}be the people" campaign reached its height in the 1870s, during which underground groups such as the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], the [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|People's Will]], and [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]] formed. It became known as the [[Narodnik]] movement, whose members believed that the newly freed [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]] were merely being sold into [[wage slavery]] in the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and that the middle and upper classes had effectively replaced landowners. The Russian state attempted to suppress the nihilist movement. In actions described by the Nihilists as [[propaganda of the deed]] many government officials were assassinated. In 1881 [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] was killed on the very day he had approved a proposal to call a representative assembly to consider new reforms.

== History ==
===Buddhism===
The concept of nihilism was discussed by the Buddha (563 B.C. to 483 B.C.),  as recorded in the Theravada and Mahayana [[Tripiṭaka]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/buddhists-celebrate-birth-of-gautama-buddha&lt;/ref&gt;. The Tripiṭaka, originally written in Pali, refers to nihilism as "natthikavāda" and the nihilist view as "micchādiṭṭhi"&lt;ref&gt;Pali-English Glossary, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikkaya, by Bikkhu Bodhi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Index of Subjects, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikkaya, by Bikkhu Bodhi&lt;/ref&gt;. Various sutras within it describe a multiplicity of views held by different sects of ascetics while the Buddha was alive, some of which were viewed by him to be morally nihilistic. In the Doctrine of Nihilism in the Appannaka Sutta, the Buddha describes moral nihilists as holding the following views&lt;ref&gt;Apannaka Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli &amp; Bikkhu Bodhi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note 425, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli &amp; Bikkhu Bodhi&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Giving produces no beneficial results
* Good and bad actions produce no results
* After death, beings are not reborn into the present world or into another world
* There is no one in the world who, through direct knowledge, can confirm that beings are reborn into this world or into another world

The Buddha then states that those who hold these views will not see the danger in misconduct and the blessings in good conduct and will, therefore, avoid good bodily, verbal and mental conduct; practicing misconduct instead&lt;ref&gt;Apannaka Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli &amp; Bikkhu Bodhi&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Nirvana and nihilism====
The culmination of the path that the Buddha taught was Nirvana, "a place of nothingness... nonpossession and... non-attachment... [which is] the total end of death and decay"&lt;ref&gt; http://www.fsnewsletter.amaravati.org/pdf/FSN_88_October_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. In an article Ajahn Amaro, a practicing Buddhist monk of more than 30 years, observes that in English 'nothingness' can sound like nihilism. However the word could be emphasised in a different way, so that it becomes 'no-thingness', indicating that Nirvana is not a thing you can find, but rather a place where you experience the reality of non-grasping&lt;ref&gt; http://www.fsnewsletter.amaravati.org/pdf/FSN_88_October_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the Alagaddupama Sutta, the Buddha describes how some individuals feared his teaching because they believe that their 'self' would be destroyed if they followed it. He describes this as an anxiety caused by the false belief in an unchanging, everlasting 'self'. All things are subject to change and taking any impermanent phenomena to be a 'self' causes suffering. Nonetheless, his critics called him a nihilist who teaches the annihilation and extermination of an existing being. The Buddha's response was that he only teaches the cessation of suffering. When an individual has given up craving and the conceit of 'I am' their mind is liberated, they no longer come into any state of 'being' and are no longer born again&lt;ref&gt;Alagaddupama Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli &amp; Bikkhu Bodhi&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Aggivacchagotta Sutta records a conversation between the Buddha and an individual named Vaccha that further elaborates on this. In it Vaccha asks the Buddha to confirm one of the following, with respect to the existence of the Buddha after death&lt;ref&gt;Aggivacchagotta Sutta, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;:

* After death a Buddha reappears somewhere else
* After death a Buddha does not reappear
* After death a Buddha both does and does not reappear
* After death a Buddha neither does nor does not reappear

To all four questions, the Buddha answers that the terms 'appear', 'not appear', 'does and does not reappear' and 'neither does nor does not reappear' do not apply. When Vaccha expresses puzzlement, the Buddha asks Vaccha a counter question to the effect of: if a fire were to go out and someone were to ask you whether the fire went north, south east or west how would you reply? Vaccha replies that the question does not apply and that a fire gone out can only be classified as 'out'&lt;ref&gt;Aggivacchagotta Sutta, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thanissaro Bikkhu elaborates on the classification problem around the words 'reappear' etc.  with respect to the Buddha and Nirvana by stating that a "person who has attained the goal [Nirvana] is thus indescribable because [they have] abandoned all things by which [they] could be described".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Suttas themselves describe the liberated mind as 'untraceable' or as 'consciousness without feature', making no distinction between the mind of a liberated being that is alive and the mind of one that is no longer alive&lt;ref&gt;Alagaddupama Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bikkhu Nanamoli &amp; Bikkhu Bodhi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevatta (Kevaddha) Sutta, Digha Nikkaya, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite the Buddha's explanations to the contrary, Buddhist practitioners may, at times, still approach Buddhism in a nihilistic manner. Ajahn Amaro illustrates this by retelling the story of a Buddhist monk, Ajahn Sumedho, who in his early years took a nihilistic approach to Nirvana. A distinct feature of Nirvana in Buddhism is that an individual attaining it is no longer subject to rebirth. Ajahn Sumedho, during a conversation with his teacher Ajahn Chah comments that he is "determined above all things to fully realize Nirvāna in this lifetime... deeply weary of the human condition and... [is] determined not to be born again". To this Ajahn Chah replies "what about the rest of us, Sumedho? Don't you care about those who'll be left behind?". Ajahn Amaro comments that Ajahn Chah could detect that his student had a nihilistic aversion to life rather than true detachment. With his response, Ajahn Chah chided Ajahn Sumedho about the latter's narrowness and opened his eyes to this attitude of self centred nihilism&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amaravati.org/the-view-from-the-centre/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===19th century===
[[File:Turgenev by Repin.jpg|thumb|The novelist [[Ivan S. Turgenev]] made the term nihilism popular.]]
The term ''nihilism'' was first used by [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743–1819). Jacobi used the term to characterize [[rationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;George di Giovanni, ''Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi'', The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/friedrich-jacobi/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s "critical" philosophy to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]] according to which all rationalism (philosophy as criticism) reduces to nihilism—and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]]. Bret W. Davis writes, for example, "The first philosophical development of the idea of nihilism is generally ascribed to Friedrich Jacobi, who in a famous letter criticized [[Fichte]]'s idealism as falling into nihilism. According to Jacobi, Fichte's absolutization of the ego (the 'absolute I' that posits the 'not-I') is an inflation of subjectivity that denies the absolute transcendence of God."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Bret W. - "Zen After Zarathustra: The Problem of the Will in the Confrontation Between Nietzsche and Buddhism" ''Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' Issue 28 (2004):89-138 (here 107).&lt;/ref&gt; A related but oppositional concept is [[fideism]], which sees reason as hostile and inferior to faith.

With the popularizing of the word ''nihilism'' by [[Ivan Turgenev]], a new Russian political movement called the [[Nihilist movement]] adopted the term. They supposedly called themselves nihilists because nothing "that then existed found favor in their eyes".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Harper, "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=nihilism&amp;searchmode=none Nihilism]", in: ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', retrieved at December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement was significant enough that, even in the English speaking world, at the turn of the 20th century the word nihilism without qualification was almost exclusively associated with this Russian revolutionary sociopolitical movement &lt;ref&gt;British and American encyclopediae of this period regularly use the term nihilism without qualification to refer to Russian Nihilism e.g. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Nihilism&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Kierkegaard===
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|left|unfinished sketch {{circa}} 1840 of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] by his cousin [[Niels Christian Kierkegaard]]]]

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855) posited an early form of nihilism, which he referred to as ''[[Leveling (philosophy)|leveling]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert. Kierkegaard on the Internet: Anonymity vs. Commitment in the Present Age. [http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_kierkegaard.html Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He saw leveling as the process of suppressing individuality to a point where an individual's uniqueness becomes non-existent and nothing meaningful in one's existence can be affirmed:

{{quote|Levelling at its maximum is like the stillness of death, where one can hear one's own heartbeat, a stillness like death, into which nothing can penetrate, in which everything sinks, powerless. One person can head a rebellion, but one person cannot head this levelling process, for that would make him a leader and he would avoid being levelled. Each individual can in his little circle participate in this levelling, but it is an abstract process, and levelling is abstraction conquering individuality.|Søren Kierkegaard|The Present Age'', translated by Alexander Dru with Foreword by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], 1962, pp. 51–53}}

Kierkegaard, an advocate of a [[philosophy of life]], generally argued against levelling and its nihilistic consequences, although he believed it would be "genuinely educative to live in the age of levelling [because] people will be forced to face the judgement of [levelling] alone."&lt;ref name="Hannay"&gt;Hannay, Alastair. ''Kierkegaard'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; George Cotkin asserts Kierkegaard was against "the standardization and levelling of belief, both spiritual and political, in the nineteenth century," and that Kierkegaard "opposed tendencies in [[mass culture]] to reduce the individual to a cipher of conformity and deference to the dominant opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Cotkin, George. ''Existential America'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In his day, [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] (like the Danish magazine ''[[Corsaren]]'') and apostate [[Christianity]] were instruments of levelling and contributed to the "reflective [[apathy|apathetic]] age" of 19th century Europe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Present Age'', translated by Alexander Dru with Foreword by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard argues that individuals who can overcome the levelling process are stronger for it, and that it represents a step in the right direction towards "becoming a true self."&lt;ref name="Hannay" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Sickness Unto Death''&lt;/ref&gt; As we must overcome levelling,&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Christopher. ''Kierkegaard, pietism and holiness'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Jane Rubin argue that Kierkegaard's interest, "in an increasingly nihilistic age, is in '''''how''''' we can recover the sense that our lives are meaningful".&lt;ref&gt;Wrathall, Mark et al. ''Heidegger, Authenticity, and Modernity'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note, however, that Kierkegaard's meaning of "nihilism" differs from the modern definition, in the sense that, for Kierkegaard, levelling led to a life lacking meaning, purpose or value,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; whereas the modern interpretation of nihilism posits that there was never any meaning, purpose or value to begin with.

===Nietzsche===
{{Main|Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche}}
[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]]]]

Nihilism is often associated with the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who provided a detailed diagnosis of nihilism as a widespread phenomenon of Western culture. Though the notion appears frequently throughout Nietzsche's work, he uses the term in a variety of ways, with different meanings and connotations. Karen Carr describes Nietzsche's characterization of nihilism "as a condition of tension, as a disproportion between what we want to value (or need) and how the world appears to operate."&lt;ref&gt;Carr, K., ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'', State University of New York Press, 1992, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; When we find out that the world does not possess the objective value or meaning that we want it to have or have long since believed it to have, we find ourselves in a crisis.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:6 [25]&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche asserts that with the decline of Christianity and the rise of physiological decadence,{{clarify|reason="Physiological" normally refers specifically to living biochemical processes; this seems to rather be "material (or materialistic) decadence"|date=December 2015}} nihilism is in fact characteristic of the modern age,&lt;ref name=Michels&gt;Steven Michels, "Nietzsche, Nihilism, and the Virtue of Nature", Dogma, 2004, [http://dogma.free.fr/txt/SM-Nietzsche.htm Free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; though he implies that the rise of nihilism is still incomplete and that it has yet to be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:10 [142]&lt;/ref&gt; Though the problem of nihilism becomes especially explicit in Nietzsche's [[Nachlass|notebooks]] (published posthumously), it is mentioned repeatedly in his published works and is closely connected to many of the problems mentioned there.

Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, or essential value. This observation stems in part from Nietzsche's [[perspectivism]], or his notion that "knowledge" is always by someone of some thing: it is always bound by perspective, and it is never mere fact.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 13:14 [22]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, there are interpretations through which we understand the world and give it meaning. Interpreting is something we can not go without; in fact, it is something we ''need''. One way of interpreting the world is through morality, as one of the fundamental ways that people make sense of the world, especially in regard to their own thoughts and actions. Nietzsche distinguishes a morality that is strong or healthy, meaning that the person in question is aware that he constructs it himself, from weak morality, where the interpretation is projected on to something external. 

Nietzsche discusses Christianity, one of the major topics in his work, at length in the context of the problem of nihilism in his notebooks, in a chapter entitled "European Nihilism".&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:5 [71]&lt;/ref&gt; Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[humanism|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[theodicee|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote against a primal form of nihilism, against the despair of meaninglessness. However, it is exactly the element of truthfulness in Christian doctrine that is its undoing: in its drive towards truth, Christianity eventually finds itself to be a construct, which leads to its own dissolution. It is therefore that Nietzsche states that we have outgrown Christianity "not because we lived too far from it, rather because we lived too close".&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:2 [200]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the self-dissolution of Christianity constitutes yet another form of nihilism. Because Christianity was an interpretation that posited itself as ''the'' interpretation, Nietzsche states that this dissolution leads beyond [[skepticism]] to a distrust of ''all'' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:2 [127]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, K., ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'' (1992), pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Rosen]] identifies Nietzsche's concept of nihilism with a situation of meaninglessness, in which "everything is permitted." According to him, the loss of higher metaphysical values that exist in contrast to the base reality of the world, or merely human ideas, gives rise to the idea that all human ideas are therefore valueless. Rejecting idealism thus results in nihilism, because only similarly transcendent ideals live up to the previous standards that the nihilist still implicitly holds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Rosen|Rosen, Stanley]]. ''Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]]. 1969. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The inability for Christianity to serve as a source of valuating the world is reflected in Nietzsche's famous [[aphorism]] of the madman in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, ''[[The Gay Science]]'': 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of God, in particular the statement that "we killed him", is similar to the ''self''-dissolution of Christian doctrine: due to the advances of the sciences, which for Nietzsche show that man is the product of [[evolution]], that Earth has no [[geocentrism|special place]] among the stars and that [[history]] is not [[progress (history)|progressive]], the Christian notion of God can no longer serve as a basis for a morality.

One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine, which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Western Buddhism#Buddhism and Western Intellectuals|Western Buddhism]], advocates a separating of oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[ascetic]] attitude as a "will to [[nothing]]ness", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This mowing away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears inconsistent:&lt;ref&gt;This "will to nothingness" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought ''not'' to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos&amp;nbsp;– at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power,'' section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}

Nietzsche's relation to the problem of nihilism is a complex one. He approaches the problem of nihilism as deeply personal, stating that this predicament of the modern world is a problem that has "become conscious" in him.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he emphasises both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that "I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!"&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation upon which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure.&lt;ref name="Michels"/&gt;

He states that there is at least the possibility of another type of nihilist in the wake of Christianity's self-dissolution, one that does ''not'' stop after the destruction of all value and meaning and succumb to the following nothingness. This alternate, 'active' nihilism on the other hand destroys to level the field for constructing something new. This form of nihilism is characterized by Nietzsche as "a sign of strength,"&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [35]&lt;/ref&gt; a willful destruction of the old values to wipe the slate clean and lay down one's own beliefs and interpretations, contrary to the passive nihilism that resigns itself with the decomposition of the old values. This willful destruction of values and the overcoming of the condition of nihilism by the constructing of new meaning, this active nihilism, could be related to what Nietzsche elsewhere calls a 'free spirit'&lt;ref&gt;K. Carr, ''The Banalisation of Nihilism'', State University of New York Press, 1992, pp. 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''[[Übermensch]]'' from ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', the model of the strong individual who posits his own values and lives his life as if it were his own work of art. It may be questioned, though, whether "active nihilism" is indeed the correct term for this stance, and some question whether Nietzsche takes the problems nihilism poses seriously enough.&lt;ref&gt;J. Doomen, "Consistent Nihilism", ''[[Journal of Mind and Behavior]]'' 33 (1/2) (2012): pp. 103–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche===
[[Martin Heidegger]]'s interpretation of Nietzsche influenced many postmodern thinkers who investigated the problem of nihilism as put forward by Nietzsche. Only recently has Heidegger's influence on Nietzschean nihilism research faded.&lt;ref&gt;"Heideggers, Aus-einander-setzung' mit Nietzsches hat mannigfache Resonanz gefunden. Das Verhältnis der beiden Philosophen zueinander ist dabei von unterschiedlichen Positionen aus diskutiert worden. Inzwischen ist es nicht mehr ungewöhnlich, daß Heidegger, entgegen seinem Anspruch auf, Verwindung' der Metaphysik und des ihr zugehörigen Nihilismus, in jenen Nihilismus zurückgestellt wird, als dessen Vollender er Nietzsche angesehen hat." [[Wolfgang Müller-Lauter]], ''Heidegger und Nietzsche. Nietzsche-Interpretationen III'', Berlin-New York 2000, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1930s, Heidegger was giving lectures on Nietzsche's thought.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. both by Heidegger: Vol. I, ''Nietzsche I'' (1936-39). Translated as ''Nietzsche I: The Will to Power as Art'' by David F. Krell (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1979); Vol. II, ''Nietzsche II'' (1939-46). Translated as "The Eternal Recurrence of the Same" by David F. Krell in ''Nietzsche II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' (New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the importance of Nietzsche's contribution to the topic of nihilism, Heidegger's influential interpretation of Nietzsche is important for the historical development of the term ''nihilism''.

Heidegger's method of researching and teaching Nietzsche is explicitly his own. He does not specifically try to present Nietzsche ''as'' Nietzsche. He rather tries to incorporate Nietzsche's thoughts into his own philosophical system of [[Heidegger#Philosophy|Being, Time and ''Dasein'']].&lt;ref&gt;"Indem Heidegger das von Nietzsche Ungesagte im Hinblick auf die Seinsfrage zur Sprache zu bringen sucht, wird das von Nietzsche Gesagte in ein diesem selber fremdes Licht gerückt.", Müller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Nihilism as Determined by the History of Being'' (1944–46),&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''Die seinsgeschichtliche Bestimmung des Nihilismus''. Found in the second volume of his lectures: Vol. II, ''Nietzsche II'' (1939-46). Translated as "The Eternal Recurrence of the Same" by David F. Krell in ''Nietzsche II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' (New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger tries to understand Nietzsche's nihilism as trying to achieve a victory through the devaluation of the, until then, highest values. The principle of this devaluation is, according to Heidegger, the [[Will to Power]]. The Will to Power is also the principle of every earlier ''valuation'' of values.&lt;ref&gt;
"Heidegger geht davon aus, daß Nietzsche den Nihilismus als Entwertung der bisherigen obersten Werte versteht; seine Überwindung soll durch die Umwertung der Werte erfolgen. Das Prinzip der Umwertung wie auch jeder früheren Wertsetzung ist der Wille zur Macht.", Müller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; How does this devaluation occur and why is this nihilistic? One of Heidegger's main critiques on philosophy is that philosophy, and more specifically metaphysics, has forgotten to discriminate between investigating the notion of ''a'' being (''Seiende'') and ''Being'' (''Sein''). According to Heidegger, the history of Western thought can be seen as the history of metaphysics. And because metaphysics has forgotten to ask about the notion of Being (what Heidegger calls ''[[:de:Seinsvergessenheit|Seinsvergessenheit]]''), it is a history about the destruction of Being. That is why Heidegger calls metaphysics nihilistic.&lt;ref&gt;"What remains unquestioned and forgotten in metaphysics is being; and hence, it is nihilistic.", [http://www.iep.utm.edu/heidegge/ UTM.edu], visited on November 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Nietzsche's metaphysics not a victory over nihilism, but a perfection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger, in his interpretation of Nietzsche, has been inspired by [[Ernst Jünger]]. Many references to Jünger can be found in Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche. For example, in a letter to the rector of Freiburg University of November 4, 1945, Heidegger, inspired by Jünger, tries to explain the notion of "[[God is dead]]" as the "reality of the Will to Power." Heidegger also praises Jünger for defending Nietzsche against a too biological or anthropological reading during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 272-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche influenced a number of important postmodernist thinkers. [[Gianni Vattimo]] points at a back-and-forth movement in European thought, between Nietzsche and Heidegger. During the 1960s, a Nietzschean 'renaissance' began, culminating in the work of [[Mazzino Montinari]] and [[Giorgio Colli]]. They began work on a new and complete edition of Nietzsche's collected works, making Nietzsche more accessible for scholarly research. Vattimo explains that with this new edition of Colli and Montinari, a critical reception of Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche began to take shape. Like other contemporary French and Italian philosophers, Vattimo does not want, or only partially wants, to rely on Heidegger for understanding Nietzsche. On the other hand, Vattimo judges Heidegger's intentions authentic enough to keep pursuing them.&lt;ref&gt;
Müller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 301-303.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers who Vattimo exemplifies as a part of this back and forth movement are French philosophers [[Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and [[Derrida]]. Italian philosophers of this same movement are [[Massimo Cacciari|Cacciari]], [[Emanuele Severino|Severino]] and himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Er (Vattimo) konstatiert, in vielen europäischen Philosophien eine Hin- und Herbewegung zwischen Heidegger und Nietzsche". Dabei denkt er, wie seine späteren Ausführungen zeigen, z.B. an Deleuze, Foucault und Derrida auf französischer Seite, an Cacciari, Severino und an sich selbst auf italienischer Seite.", Müller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Richard Rorty]] are also philosophers who are influenced by Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Lauter, ''Heidegger und Nietzsche'', pp. 303–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmodernism===
[[Postmodern philosophy|Postmodern]] and [[poststructuralist]] thought has questioned the very grounds on which [[Western culture]]s have based their 'truths': absolute knowledge and meaning, a 'decentralization' of authorship, the accumulation of positive knowledge, historical progress, and certain ideals and practices of [[humanism]] and [[the Enlightenment]].

==== Derrida ====
[[Jacques Derrida]], whose [[deconstruction]] is perhaps most commonly labeled nihilistic, did not himself make the nihilistic move that others have claimed. Derridean deconstructionists argue that this approach rather frees texts, individuals or organizations from a restrictive truth, and that deconstruction opens up the possibility of other ways of being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/specials/derrida/josenihil.htm Borginho, Jose] 1999; Nihilism and Affirmation. Retrieved 05-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], for example, uses deconstruction to create an ethics of opening up Western scholarship to the voice of the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and to philosophies outside of the canon of western texts.&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, Chakravorty Gayatri; 1988; Can The Subaltern Speak?; in Nelson, Cary and Grossberg, Lawrence (eds); 1988; Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture; Macmillan Education, Basingstoke.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida himself built a philosophy based upon a 'responsibility to the other'.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Jack; 2001; [http://www.mic.ul.ie/stephen/derrida.pdf The Other of Derridean Deconstruction: Levinas, Phenomenology and the Question of Responsibility]; Minerva - An Internet Journal of Philosophy 5: 31–62. Retrieved 05-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Deconstruction can thus be seen not as a denial of truth, but as a denial of our ability to know truth. That is to say, it makes an [[epistemological]] claim compared to nihilism's [[ontological]] claim).

==== Lyotard ====
[[Lyotard]] argues that, rather than relying on an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] truth or method to prove their claims, philosophers legitimize their truths by reference to a story about the world that can't be separated from the age and system the stories belong to—referred to by Lyotard as ''[[meta-narrative]]s.'' He then goes on to define the [[postmodernity|postmodern condition]] as characterized by a rejection both of these meta-narratives and of the process of [[legitimation]] by meta-narratives.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In lieu of meta-narratives we have created new [[language-game]]s in order to legitimize our claims which rely on changing relationships and mutable truths, none of which is privileged over the other to speak to ultimate truth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This concept of the instability of truth and meaning leads in the direction of nihilism, though Lyotard stops short of embracing the latter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==== Baudrillard ====
Postmodern theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] wrote briefly of nihilism from the postmodern viewpoint in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''. He stuck mainly to topics of interpretations of the real world over the simulations of which the real world is composed. The uses of meaning were an important subject in Baudrillard's discussion of nihilism:

{{quote|The [[apocalypse]] is finished, today it is the precession of the neutral, of forms of the neutral and of indifference...all that remains, is the fascination for desertlike and indifferent forms, for the very operation of the system that annihilates us. Now, fascination (in contrast to seduction, which was attached to appearances, and to dialectical reason, which was attached to meaning) is a nihilistic passion par excellence, it is the passion proper to the mode of disappearance. We are fascinated by all forms of disappearance, of our disappearance. Melancholic and fascinated, such is our general situation in an era of involuntary transparency.|Jean Baudrillard, ''Simulacra and Simulation'', "On Nihilism", trans. 1995{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}}}

===Transcendental nihilism / methodological naturalism===
In ''Nihil Unbound: Extinction and Enlightenment'', [[Ray Brassier]] maintains that philosophy has avoided the traumatic idea of [[extinction]], instead attempting to find meaning in a world conditioned by the very idea of its own annihilation. Thus Brassier critiques both the phenomenological and hermeneutic strands of Continental philosophy as well as the vitality of thinkers like [[Gilles Deleuze]], who work to ingrain meaning in the world and stave off the "threat" of nihilism. Instead, drawing on thinkers such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[François Laruelle]], [[Paul Churchland]], and [[Thomas Metzinger]], Brassier defends a view of the world as inherently devoid of meaning. That is, rather than avoiding nihilism, Brassier embraces it as the truth of reality. Brassier concludes from his readings of Badiou and Laruelle that the universe is founded on the nothing,&lt;ref&gt;Ray Brassier, ''Nihil Unbound'', 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; but also that philosophy is the "organon of extinction," that it is only because life is conditioned by its own extinction that there is thought at all.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Brassier, ''Nihil Unbound'', 223–226, 234–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Brassier then defends a radically anti-correlationist philosophy proposing that Thought is conjoined not with Being, but with Non-Being.

== In culture ==
===Dada===
The term ''[[Dadaism|Dada]]'' was first used by [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;de Micheli, Mario (2006). ''Las vanguardias artísticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. pp. 135-137.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement, which lasted from approximately 1916 to 1922, arose during [[World War I]], an event that influenced the artists.&lt;ref name = "Tzara"&gt;Tzara, Tristan (December 2005). Trans/ed. Mary Ann Caws ''"Approximate Man" &amp; Other Writings''. Black Widow Press, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada Movement began in the old town of Zürich, Switzerland – known as the "Niederdorf" or "Niederdörfli" – in the Café Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;de Micheli, Mario (2006). ''Las vanguardias artísticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dadaists claimed that Dada was not an art movement, but an [[anti-art]] movement, sometimes using found objects in a manner similar to [[found poetry]]. 

The "anti-art" drive is thought{{By whom|date=April 2018}} to have stemmed from a [[post-war]] emptiness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} This tendency toward devaluation of art has led many{{Who|date=April 2018}} to claim that Dada was an essentially nihilistic movement.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Given that Dada created its own means for interpreting its products, it is difficult to classify alongside most other contemporary art expressions. Due to perceived ambiguity, it has been classified as a nihilistic ''[[modus vivendi]]''.&lt;ref name="Tzara" /&gt;

===Literature===
The term "nihilism" was actually popularized by [[Ivan Turgenev]] in his novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]],'' whose hero, Bazarov, was a nihilist and recruited several followers to the philosophy. He found his nihilistic ways challenged upon falling in love.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism | title = Nihilism | publisher = The University of Tennessee, Martin | date  =  April 1, 2012| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton Chekhov]] portrayed nihilism when writing ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''. The phrase "what does it matter" or variants of this are often spoken by several characters in response to events; the significance of some of these events suggests a subscription to nihilism by said characters as a type of coping strategy.

The philosophical ideas of the French author, the [[Marquis de Sade]], are often noted as early examples of nihilistic principles.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://books.google.com.ng/books?isbn=1312938684 | title = Nihilism: Philosophy of Nothingness | publisher = Google Books | date  =  January 5, 2015| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odo II''' ({{Lang-fr|Eudes le Champenois}}) (983 – 15 November 1037) was the [[Count of Blois]], [[Chartres]], [[Châteaudun]], [[Beauvais]] and [[Count of Tours|Tours]] from 1004 and [[Count of Troyes]] (as '''Odo IV''') and [[Meaux]] (as '''Odo I''') from 1022. He twice tried to make himself a king: first in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] after 1024 and then in [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] after 1032.

Odo II was the son of [[Odo I of Blois]] and [[Bertha of Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="ESII46"&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, ''[[Europäische Stammtafeln|Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten]]'', Neue Folge, Band II: Die Ausserdeutschen Staaten Die Regierenden Häuser der Übrigen Staaten Europas (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J. A. Stargardt, 1984), Tafel 46&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to unite Blois and Champagne under one authority although his career was spent in endless feudal warfare with his neighbors and suzerains, many of whose territories he tried to annex.&lt;ref name="CMHIII-123"&gt;J.W. Bury, ''Cambridge Medieval History'', Vol III (The Macmillan Company, New York, 1922), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1003/4 he married [[Maud of Normandy|Maud]], a daughter of [[Richard I of Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, ''Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten'', Neue Folge, Band II: Die Ausserdeutschen Staaten Die Regierenden Häuser der Übrigen Staaten Europas (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J. A. Stargardt, 1984), Tafel 79&lt;/ref&gt;  After her death in 1005,&lt;ref name="ESII46"/&gt; and as she had no children, [[Richard II of Normandy]] demanded a return of her [[dowry]]: half the county of [[Dreux]].&lt;ref name="KN487"&gt;Kate Norgate, Odo of Champagne, Count of Blois and 'Tyrant of Burgundy', ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 5, No. 19, (July, 1890), p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; Odo refused and the two warred over the matter.&lt;ref name="KN487"/&gt; Finally, [[Robert II of France|King Robert II]], who had married Odo's mother, imposed his arbitration on the contestants in 1007, leaving Odo in possession of the castle [[Dreux]] while Richard II kept the remainder of the lands.&lt;ref name="KN487"/&gt; Odo quickly married a second wife, Ermengarde, daughter of {{Interlanguage link multi|William IV of Auvergne|fr|3=Guillaume IV d'Auvergne}}.&lt;ref name="KN487"/&gt;

Defeated by [[Fulk III, Count of Anjou]], and [[Herbert I, Count of Maine]], at the [[Battle of Pontlevoy]] in July 1016, he quickly tried to overrun the [[Touraine]].&lt;ref name="CMHIII-123"/&gt; After the death of his cousin [[Stephen I, Count of Troyes|Stephen I]] in 1019/20, without heirs he seized Troyes, Meaux and all of Champagne for himself without royal approval.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Norgate, Odo of Champagne, Count of Blois and 'Tyrant of Burgundy', ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 5, No. 19, (July, 1890), pp. 488–89&lt;/ref&gt; From there he attacked [[Ebles I of Roucy|Ebles]], the [[archbishop of Reims]], and [[Theodoric I, Duke of Lorraine]]. Due to an alliance between the king and the [[Emperor Henry II]] he was forced to relinquish the county of Rheims to the archbishop.

He was offered the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|crown of Italy]] by the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] barons, but the offer was quickly retracted in order not to upset relations with the king of France. In 1032, he invaded the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] on the death of [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles William Previté-Orton|C.W. Previté-Orton]], ''The Early History of the House of Savoy'', (Cambridge University Press, 1912), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He retreated in the face of a coalition of the [[Emperor Conrad II]] and the new king of France, [[Henry I of France|Henry I]].&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Previte-Orton, ''The Early History of the House of Savoy'', 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in combat near [[Bar-le-Duc]] during another attack on Lorraine.&lt;ref name="CMHIII-123"/&gt;

==Issue==
By his second wife, Ermengarde of Auvergne, Odo had three children:
#[[Theobald III, Count of Blois|Theobald III]], who inherited the county of Blois and most of his other possessions.&lt;ref name="ESII46"/&gt;
#[[Stephen II of Troyes|Stephen II]], who inherited the counties of [[Count of Meaux|Meaux]] and [[Count of Troyes|Troyes]] in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]].&lt;ref name="ESII46"/&gt;
#[[Bertha of Blois|Bertha]], who married first [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany]], and second [[Hugh IV, Count of Maine]]&lt;ref name="ESII46"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, ''Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten'', Neue Folge, Band II: Die Ausserdeutschen Staaten Die Regierenden Häuser der Übrigen Staaten Europas (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J.

The [[Mercury program]] included several pad abort tests for the [[launch escape system]] with a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] crew module. 
* 1959 July 22 - First successful pad abort flight test with a functional escape tower attached to a Mercury boilerplate.
* 1959 July 28 - A Mercury boilerplate with instruments to measure sound pressure levels and vibrations from the [[Little Joe (rocket)|Little Joe]] test [[rocket]] and Grand Central abort rocket/escape tower.

== Project Apollo ==

The [[Apollo program]] included several pad abort tests for the launch escape system with a boilerplate crew module.

* [[Pad Abort Test-1 (Apollo)|Pad Abort Test-1]] was conducted on November 7, 1963, and
* [[Pad Abort Test-2 (Apollo)|Pad Abort Test-2]] was conducted on June 29, 1965.

Both tests were conducted at the [[White Sands Missile Range]].

The Orion Pad Abort Test will start with the construction of the first Orion boilerplate. It will be a basic mockup [[prototype]] to test the assembling sequences and launch procedures at NASA’s [[Langley Research Center]] while Lockheed aerospace engineers assemble the first rocket motors for the spacecraft’s escape tower.  [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp. was awarded the contract to build Orion on Aug. 31, 2006. The first Pad Abort Test trial of the escape tower system was successfully completed at New Mexico’s [[White Sands Missile Range]] on May 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/11631855&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/main/index.html NASA's Project Constellation] Official Site&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SpaceX]] [[Dragon V2]] [[Dragon V2#Pad abort test|Pad Abort Test-1]] was conducted on May 6, 2015.

The pad abort test was conducted successfully on 6 May 2015 at approximately 0900 [[Eastern Daylight Time]] (EDT). The vehicle splashed down safely in the ocean to the east of the launchpad 99 seconds later.&lt;ref name=sfn20150506&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Stephen|title=SpaceX crew capsule completes dramatic abort test|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/05/06/spacex-crew-capsule-completes-dramatic-abort-test/|website=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fuel mixture ratio issue was detected after the flight in one of the eight SuperDraco engines, but did not materially affect the flight.&lt;ref name=nsf20150506&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceX Crew Dragon pad abort: Test flight demos launch escape system|url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-050615a-spacex-dragon-pad-abort.html|website=CollectSpace|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More detailed test results were to be subsequently analyzed by both SpaceX and NASA engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergin |first=Chris |title=Dragon 2 conducts Pad Abort leap in key SpaceX test |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/05/dragon-2-pad-abort-leap-key-spacex-test/ |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |accessdate=6 May 2015 |date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ISRO Pad Abort Test ==
[[File:ISRO Pad abort test Crew Module lifting off.jpg|thumb|ISRO pad abort test of its crew module as part of [[Indian human spaceflight programme]].]]

On 5 July 2018, Indian Space Research Organisation successfully conducted 'pad abort' test at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. A first in a series of tests to qualify a Crew Escape System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isro.gov.in/update/05-jul-2018/successful-flight-testing-of-crew-escape-system-technology-demonstrator|title=SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT TESTING OF  CREW ESCAPE SYSTEM - TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATOR - ISRO|website=www.isro.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a smooth countdown of 5 hours, the Crew Escape System along with the simulated crew module with a mass of 12.6 tonnes, lifted off at 07.00 AM (IST) at the opening of the launch window from its pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota today. The test was over in 259 seconds, during which the Crew Escape System along with crew module soared skyward, then arced out over the Bay of Bengal and floated back to Earth under its parachutes about 2.9 km from Sriharikota.

{{About||a comparison of parables with other stories|Traditional story|a geometrical figure with a similar name|Parabola}}

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Return of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Return of the Prodigal Son]], by [[Rembrandt]].]]
A '''parable''' is  a succinct, [[Didacticism|didactic]] story, in [[prose]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] that illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a [[fable]] in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference Between Fable and Parable|url=http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-fable-and-vs-parable/|website=DifferenceBetween.com|publisher=Difference Between|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parable is a type of [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSjRcQSE2uQC&amp;pg=PA99 |title=What are they saying about the parables |author=David B. Gowler |year=2000 |work= What are they saying about the parables |pages=99,137,63,132,133, }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars of the [[canonical gospels]] and the [[New Testament]] apply the term "parable" only to the [[parables of Jesus]],&lt;ref name="Die Gleichnisreden Jesu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"&gt;[[John P. Meier]], ''[[A Marginal Jew]]'', volume II, Doubleday, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; though that is not a common restriction of the term. Parables such as "[[Parable of the Prodigal Son|The Prodigal Son]]" are central to Jesus's teaching method in the [[Biblical canon#New Testament|canonical narratives]] and the [[apocrypha]].

==Etymology==
The word ''parable'' comes from the  [[Greek language|Greek]] παραβολή (''parabolē''), meaning "comparison, illustration, analogy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparabolh%2F παραβολή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; It was the name given by Greek [[rhetorician]]s to an illustration in the form of a brief fictional [[narrative]].

==History==
Parables are often used to explore ethical concepts in [[Spirituality|spiritual]] texts. The [[Bible]] contains numerous parables in the [[Gospel]]s section of the [[New Testament]] ([[Parables of Jesus|Jesus's parables]]). These are believed by some scholars (such as [[John P. Meier]]) to have been inspired by [[Mashal (allegory)|mashal]]im, a form of Hebrew comparison.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"/&gt; Examples of Jesus' parables include the [[Good Samaritan]] and the [[Prodigal Son]]. Mashalim from the [[Old Testament]] include the parable of the ewe-lamb (told by [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] in 2 Samuel 12:1-9&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=289892665 2 Samuel 12:1–9]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the parable of the woman of Tekoah (in 2 Samuel 14:1-13 &lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=2898925961 Samuel 14:1–13]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Parables also appear in [[Islam]].  In [[Sufi]] tradition, parables are used for imparting lessons and values. Recent authors such as [[Idries Shah]] and [[Anthony de Mello]] have helped popularize these stories beyond Sufi circles.

Modern parables also exist.  A mid-19th-century example, the [[Parable of the broken window]], criticises a part of [[Economics|economic]] thinking.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Jan Wijnants - Parable of the Good Samaritan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], by [[Jan Wijnants]] (1670).]]

A parable is a short tale that illustrates a  universal truth; it is a simple [[narrative]]. It sketches a setting, describes an [[Action (philosophy)|action]], and shows the results. It may sometimes be distinguished from  similar narrative types, such as the [[allegory]] and the [[apologue]].&lt;ref name="fowler558"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage |last=Fowler |first=H.W.|year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London|page=558}} See entry at '''simile and metaphor'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A parable often involves a character who faces a [[morality|moral]] dilemma or one who makes a bad decision and then suffers the [[unintended consequences]]. Although the meaning of a parable is often not explicitly stated, it is not intended to be hidden or secret but to be quite straightforward and obvious.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Fyler Townsend]], in his translator's preface to ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' (Belford, Clarke &amp; Co., 1887), defined the parable as being "purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words themselves, and which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer or reader." However, Townsend may have been influenced by the 19th century expression, "to speak in parables", connoting obscurity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristic of the parable is the presence of a [[subtext]] suggesting how a person should behave or what he should believe. Aside from providing guidance and suggestions for proper conduct in one's life, parables frequently use [[metaphor]]ical language which allows people to more easily discuss difficult or complex ideas. Parables express an [[Abstract and concrete|abstract argument]] by means of using a concrete narrative which is easily understood.

The allegory is a more general narrative type; it also employs [[metaphor]]. Like the parable, the allegory makes a single, unambiguous point. An allegory may have multiple noncontradictory interpretations and may also have implications that are ambiguous or hard to interpret. As [[H.W. Fowler]] put it, the object of both parable and allegory "is to enlighten the hearer by submitting to him a case in which he has apparently no direct concern, and upon which therefore a disinterested judgment may be elicited from him, ..."&lt;ref name="fowler558"/&gt; The parable is more condensed than the allegory: it rests upon a single [[principle]] and a single moral, and it is intended that the reader or listener shall conclude that the moral applies equally well to his own concerns.

===Jesus' parables===
{{Main article|Parables of Jesus}}
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] interpreters of the Bible often treated [[Jesus]]' parables as allegories, with symbolic [[correspondence (theology)|correspondence]]s found for every element in his parables. But modern scholars, beginning with [[Adolf Jülicher]], regard their interpretations as incorrect.&lt;ref name="Die Gleichnisreden Jesu"&gt;Adolf Jülicher, ''Die Gleichnisreden Jesu'' (2 vols; Tübingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1888, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; Jülicher held that Jesus' parables are intended to make a single important point, and most recent scholarship agrees.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"/&gt;

[[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] suggested that Jesus kept some of his teachings secret within the circle of his disciples and that he deliberately obscured their meaning by using parables. For example, in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark 4:11–12]]:

{{Quotation|And he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the [[kingdom of God]], but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that ‘they may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be [[Forgiveness|forgiven]].’” ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])}}

===Other figures of speech===
The parable is related to [[Figure of speech|figures of speech]] such as the metaphor and the simile, but it should not be identified with them.

A parable is  like a metaphor in that it uses concrete, perceptible phenomena to illustrate abstract ideas. It may be said that a parable is a metaphor that has been extended to form a brief, coherent narrative.

A parable also resembles a [[simile]], i.e., a metaphorical construction in which something is said to be "like" something else (e.g., "The just man is like a tree planted by streams of water"). However, unlike the meaning of a simile, a parable's meaning is implicit (although not secret).

{{moresources|date=March 2018}}
'''Sampson Salter Blowers''' (March 10, 1742 &amp;ndash; October 25, 1842) was a noted [[North America]]n lawyer, [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and jurist from [[Nova Scotia]] who, along with Chief Justice [[Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange]], waged "judicial war" in his efforts to free [[Black Nova Scotian]] slaves from their owners.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Winks. ''Blacks In Canada,'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and marriage==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}
He was born in [[Boston]], the son of John Blowers III and Sarah Salter, but raised by his maternal grandfather, Sampson Salter, after the death of his parents. He was educated in Boston and at [[Harvard College]], then went on to study law. Blowers is probably most noted as one of the defence [[Lawyer|attorneys]] representing the [[soldier]]s accused after the [[Boston Massacre]], along with such notables as [[John Adams]] and [[Josiah Quincy II|Josiah Quincy Jr]]. He worked in the office of Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]].

In 1774, he married Sarah Kent, daughter of patriot lawyer [[Benjamin Kent]], and went to England with her later that year. He returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in 1778; he was arrested after travelling to Boston to visit his sick wife. He was later released and returned to Newport as a judge in the [[vice admiralty court]].

==Nova Scotia==
{{onesource|section|date=March 2018}}
In 1783, he went to [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. The following year, he was appointed attorney general for [[New Brunswick]] but refused the post, not wanting to relocate his family. Later that year, he was named attorney general for [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785, he was elected to the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] for [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] and was chosen to be speaker for the assembly. In 1788, he was named to the [[Nova Scotia Council]]. 

In his later years, he served as [[Chief Justice]] of Nova Scotia for 36 years, from 1797 to 1832. Blowers was also judge in the vice admiralty court from 1821-33. Because Blowers put the onus on slave owners to prove that they had a legal right to purchase slaves, slavery died out in Nova Scotia early in the 19th century. He was a member of the board of governors for [[University of King's College|King's College]] in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]].

Solicitor General [[Richard John Uniacke]] beat [[Jonathan Sterns]] so "savagely" that died. Sterns was Blowers' [[protégé]] who afterward challenged Uniacke to a dual, which Uniacke accepted but then contacted the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Blowers, Sampson Salter |first=Phyllis R. |last=Blakeley |volume=VII |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/blowers_sampson_salter_7E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diary342&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Thomas|title=The Diary and Letters of His Excellency Thomas Hutchinson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOUbw0m-1pUC&amp;pg=PA342|year=2010|publisher=Applewood Books|isbn=978-1-4290-2299-6|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Blowers died in Halifax in 1842, aged 100, soon after he broke his hip in a fall. Most of his estate went to his adopted daughter, Sarah Ann Anderson, who had married [[William Blowers Bliss]].&lt;ref name=Diary342/&gt; He is buried in the crypt of [[St. Paul's Church (Halifax)]].

'''Siphonogamy''' is a condition in plants in which [[pollen tube]]s are developed for the transfer of the male cells to the eggs. The seed plants are siphonogamous, while in the lower plants the male cells usually swim to the eggs. As a consequence, the [[spermatophyte]]s were sometimes called siphonogams.

==History==
Snowflake was captured in the [[Rio Muni]] region in [[Equatorial Guinea]] on October 1, 1966 by ethnic [[Fang people|Fang]] farmer Benito Mañé. Mañé had killed the rest of Snowflake's gorilla group (who were normal in color). Mañé then kept Snowflake at his home for four days before transporting him to [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], where he was purchased by [[primatologist]] [[Jordi Sabater Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;Riopelle, A.J., "Snowflake the world's first white gorilla", ''National Geographic'' 131: 442-8, March 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally named "Nfumu Ngui" in [[Fang language]] ("white gorilla") by his captor, he was then nicknamed "Copito de nieve" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "little snowflake"&lt;ref&gt;"The Name Is Snowflake", ''The Pittsburgh Post Gazette'', May 28, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;) by his keeper [[Jordi Sabater Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc.cbuc.cat/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/sabaterpi&amp;CISOPTR=341&amp;REC=13 Sabater's pictures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804110135/http://mdc.cbuc.cat/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fsabaterpi&amp;CISOPTR=341&amp;REC=13 |date=2009-08-04 }}, at the Sabater Pi Collection at the Universitat de Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Little Snowflake, World's First White Gorilla", ''The Palm Beach Post'', February 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Snowflake was a [[Western lowland gorilla]] with non-syndromic [[oculocutaneous albinism]].&lt;ref name=bmc130531/&gt; Snowflake had unpigmented skin and hair.&lt;ref&gt;''International Wildlife Encyclopedia'' Vol. 20, Marshall Cavendish Corporation/New York, 1970, pg. 2710&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duplaix-Hall&gt;{{cite book | last=Duplaix-Hall| first=Nicole | authorlink=Nicole Duplaix|author2=Antonio Jonch  | page=196 | chapter=The White Gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla) At Barcelona Zoo | title= International Zoo Yearbook |volume=Vol. XIII| location=London | publisher=Zoological Society of London | year=1967 |oclc=604039131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowflake had poor vision, which is associated with [[albinism]]. A test to try to determine whether Snowflake had a central blind spot did not find one.&lt;ref&gt;Riopelle, A.J., "Growing up with Snowflake", ''National Geographic'', 138:490-503, October 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona Zoo director Antonio Jonch wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The eye had a blueish [[sclera]], a normal [[cornea]], and a light blue [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] which was very transparent to transillumination. [[Accommodation (eye)|Accommodation]] and refraction were normal. The media were transparent and the [[Fundus (eye)|fundus]] of the eye normal and totally depigmented. The [[choroid]]al [[blood vessel|vessels]] were perfectly visible and the [[pupil]] was normal. The animal displayed marked [[photophobia]] which caused it to close its eyes repeatedly when exposed to bright light. In diffuse light similar to that in its [[biotope]], we calculated that it blinked on an average of 20 times a minute."&lt;ref name=Duplaix-Hall/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Study of Snowflake's genome determined that his parents had 12% of their DNA in common, leading researchers to believe that his parents were uncle and niece. The same study revealed that his albinism was caused by a mutation of [[SLC45A2]] gene. Snowflake received the [[recessive gene]] from both parents, causing his albinism.&lt;ref name=bmc130531/&gt;&lt;ref name=hp130617/&gt;

==Life in Barcelona==
[[File:CopitoDeNieveGorilaAlbinoZooBarcelona.jpg|thumb|left|Snowflake resting in his enclosure]]
[[File:1993-Barcelona Zoo - Copito de Nieve.webm|thumb|Floquet de Neu (August 1993)]]

Upon his arrival to Barcelona in November 1966, he was given an official reception by the then [[Mayor of Barcelona]], [[Josep Maria de Porcioles]] and called "Blancanieves" ("[[Snow White]]") in the newspaper ''[[Tele/Exprés]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anuaris.cat/continguts/article.php?id=2306 anuaris.cat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014051136/http://www.anuaris.cat/continguts/article.php?id=2306 |date=2008-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he became famous with the name given to him by Sabater when ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' featured him on the cover in March 1967, with the English name Snowflake. This name spread among the press (''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Paris-Match]]''). Sabater himself called the gorilla "Copi" or "Floquet", and in the later years "Nfumu". He was also known as "Little Buttercup",&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Henry J., "An Animal Lover: Elephant Is Real King Of Jungle", ''Ocala Star-Banner'', July 28, 1967, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; and as the "Vanilla Gorilla".

At first, the Barcelona Zoo was not aware that Snowflake was a unique specimen. They sent a message to Sabater Pi saying, "Please send more white gorillas." The zoo later hoped to produce a genetic strain and an entire family group of white gorillas through [[selective breeding]]. The Barcelona Zoo had a protocol in place to have Snowflake's testicles harvested, upon his death, and placed in the [[frozen zoo]] so as to reserve the option of having more offspring from him in the future.{{Citation needed |date=June 2014}} Snowflake's genes would have been considered particularly valuable because he was wild caught, and therefore one of the genetic founders to the captive population of [[Western lowland gorilla]]s, which are endangered, and are being managed by [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] [[Species Survival Plan|SSP]]/[[European Endangered Species Programme|EEP]] captive breeding programs for wildlife conservation.

In 1986 the Barcelona Zoo enlisted British zoo veterinarian [[David Taylor (veterinarian)|David Taylor]] to collect sperm from Snowflake for [[artificial insemination]]. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, the story was carried by newspapers the world over.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Taylor (veterinarian)|Taylor, David]], ''Vet on the Wild Side: Further Adventures of a Wildlife Vet'', Arrow (Random Century Group), 1991&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Since this is about David Taylor, need a source not by himself.|date=June 2014}}

===Offspring===
Snowflake fathered twenty-two offspring by three different mates, or "dams". Six of his offspring survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name="nigertimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenigertimes.com/2013/11/meet-snowflake-the-world-only-known-albino-gorilla.html|title=Meet Snowflake The World's Only Known Albino Gorilla|date=November 29, 2003|publisher=thenigertimes.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316142414/http://www.thenigertimes.com/2013/11/meet-snowflake-the-world-only-known-albino-gorilla.html|archivedate=March 16, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of Snowflake's offspring were albino, but all should be heterozygous, recessive carriers, for the albino gene. Half of his grandchildren likely carry the albino gene. If both parents were albino gene carriers they have 25% chance of producing an albino offspring.

As of May 2014, Snowflake had a total of 21 grandchildren (11 survived) and four great-grandchildren (all living).&lt;ref name=studbook/&gt; Snowflake's great-grandson N'Kou has pink fingers which is perhaps suggestive of partial albinism.{{Citation needed |date=June 2014}}

==Death==
In 2001, Snowflake was diagnosed with an unusual form of [[skin cancer]], almost certainly related to his albinism condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Albino gorilla dying of skin cancer | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3128738.stm | work=BBC News | date=September 22, 2003 | accessdate=June 1, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040607022035/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3128738.stm | archivedate=June 7, 2004 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, Snowflake's health began to deteriorate.

==Albino gorillas in other media==
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
Other albino (or white-furred) gorillas similar in appearance to Snowflake have appeared in different media appearances.
* Prior to the birth of Snowflake, the film ''[[Son of Kong]]'' featured [[King Kong]]'s son who was an albino gorilla that's twice the height of a human that was named "Little Kong".
* In ''[[Legends of Chima]]'', the Gorilla Tribe member Grizzam has white fur similar to Snowflake.
* A white-furred gorilla appears in the French superhero comic series ''[[Photonik]]'' (featuring in "African Devil"; Volume 1, ''Mustang'' #66, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/photonik.htm Cool French Comics: ''Photonik'']. Retrieved July 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, serving as the totem for an evil shaman who wishes to rule all of Africa. As was the case with Snowflake, his entire group is killed by an unscrupulous poacher, and the white gorilla sold into captivity.
* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', [[Solovar]] was depicted as an albino gorilla.
* In the 2017 film ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]'', an albino gorilla named Winter (voiced and motion-captured by [[Aleks Paunovic]]) appears in Caesar's tribe and was defected to the Colonel's side out of fear.
* In the 2018 film ''[[Rampage (2018 film)|Rampage]]'' (which is based on the [[Rampage (franchise)|video game series of the same name]]), George (motion-captured by Jason Liles) is albino in the movie adaptation to differentiate from King Kong as [[Dwayne Johnson]] says George is based on Snowflake.

{{other uses|Devil's Chair (disambiguation)}}

The term '''devil’s chair''' (or "haunted chair") in [[folklore]] is frequently attached to a class of funerary or memorial sculpture common in the United States during the nineteenth century and often associated with [[legend tripping]]. Nineteenth-century graveyards sometimes included carved chairs for the comfort of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hauntedusa.org/devilchair.htm |title=Haunted Places and Urban Legends from Illinois. The gate |publisher=Hauntedusa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this function, the object was known as a "mourning chair," and cemeteries have since provided benches for similar purposes, most often movable units of the type used in parks, but also specimens in the tradition of the carved chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm1.static.flickr.com/113/316080859_da342c49a5.jpg?v=0 |title=Image 1 at Flickr |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}{{Verify credibility|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some carved chairs were probably not intended for use as anything but monuments, while the "monubench" is still commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiringmonuments.com/design-gallery.php?ImageCategoryID=7 |title=Quiring Monuments |publisher=Quiring Monuments |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the original purpose of these chairs fell out of fashion, superstitions developed in association with the act of sitting in them. In a typical example, local young people dare one another to visit the site, most often after dark, at midnight, or on some specified night such as [[Halloween]] or [[New Year’s Eve]]. Variously, the stories suggest the person brave enough to sit in the chair at such a time may be punished for impudence or rewarded for courage.

== Ulverston, Cumbria, England ==
The '''Devil's Chair''' or '''Devil's Armchair''' in Ulverston is an ambiguous chair that appears to have been carved into a small rocky terrain, which is used for climbing, near the monument Hoad in Ulverston. Sometimes the rock 'wall' itself is referred to as the '''Devil's Armchair''' but that is because at the top there is a "chair" large enough for four adults to sit in which is carved into the rock surface. Naturally or not, no-one knows.{{cn|date=October 2015}}{{or|date=October 2015}}

The '''Devil's Chair''' in [[Cassadaga, Florida]] is a graveside bench in the cemetery that borders Cassadaga and [[Lake Helen, Florida|Lake Helen]]. According to one local legend, an unopened can of beer left on the chair will be empty by morning. In some accounts, the can is opened, and in others, the beer is simply gone, through the unopened top.

The '''Devil's Chair''' in [[Guthrie Center]], [[Iowa]], is a cement-cast chair located in Union Cemetery, situated between two graves and unmarked as belonging to either. Local legend claims that bad luck will follow anyone who sits in it. While the cemetery itself was established as a private burial ground in 1885, the legend of the chair is only documented for approximately thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unexplainedresearch.com/media/images/spirit_quests3.jpg |title=Chair-shaped tomb image |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}{{Verify credibility|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missouri ==
The '''Devil's Chair''' or Baird Chair as it is officially named in the Highland Park Cemetery of [[Kirksville, Missouri]] was placed in the cemetery by William Baird a prominent banker (whose bank building is now Pagliai's pizza) and is involved in "numerous legends of a type widely replicated across the U.S., especially in rural and small-town communities, and beloved of young people.... Some versions say that something dreadful will happen to the person so bold as to be seated in it at midnight (or on a particular evening, such as Halloween) -- a hand will emerge from the grave and drag the impious one down to the underworld. Other versions suggest the intrepid one will be rewarded." The chair itself was sculpted out of concrete by Charles Grassle of the Baird and Grassle marble company Kirksville MO and placed as a memorial for Anna and David Baird. Despite popular belief it does not act as a marker of any grave.&lt;ref&gt;http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=record_ID:siris_ari_334633&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duncan monument in the Fletcher Cemetery, [[Fletcher, OH]] appears to be a carved headstone rather than a mourning chair intended for use by cemetery visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ByoDLYKF12g/Sdaeoe2n0gI/AAAAAAAAAQg/NF7IeVGOX_w/s400/Duncan+Chair+Stone.jpg |title=Image at Blogspot |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}{{Verify credibility|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=mr&amp;MRid=46616545 |title=Find A Grave Contributor: Julio and Nannette Worrell Serra |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vermont==
"The Empty Chair" in Hope Cemetery, [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre, VT]] is actually a sculpted gravestone rather than being intended as a seat. However, the usual legends have grown up around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/vt/VTBARcem_chair.jpg |title=Image - VTBARcem_chair.jpg |publisher=Roadside America |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}{{Verify credibility|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lore may not be exclusive to the United States.

'''''The Hundred Tales of Wisdom''''' is a translation from the Persian by [[Idries Shah]] of the "Life, Teachings and Miracles of Jalaludin [[Rumi]]" from [[Aflaki]]’s ''[[Munaqib]]'', together with certain important stories from Rumi’s own works, traditionally known by that title. It was published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1978.

==Summary==
The tales, anecdotes and narratives in this collection are used in [[Sufi]] schools for the development of insights beyond ordinary perceptions. Although the number 100 is used in the title, in Idries Shah’s presentation there are 159 tales beginning with a brief description of Rumi’s childhood and youth.

==Reception==
The author [[Doris Lessing]] wrote in ''Books and Bookmen'':&lt;ref&gt;''Books and Bookmen'', May 1979&lt;/ref&gt; “The Hundred Tales is traditional hagiography, a classic studied for seven hundred years by students of the [[Sufi]] Way as part of the ‘curriculum’ – and that means [[Christians]] and [[Jews]] as well as [[Muslims]]. It concerns Rumi, the saint whose funeral was attended by members of these and other faiths, all saying he was their teacher. What has been needed is a simple and clear version ... and here it is."

The '''zoo hypothesis''' speculates as to the assumed behavior and existence of technically advanced [[extraterrestrial life]] and the reasons they refrain from contacting Earth and is one of many theoretical explanations for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The hypothesis is that alien life intentionally avoids communication with Earth, and one of its main interpretations is that it does so to allow for natural [[evolution]] and [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]], avoiding [[interplanetary contamination]], similarly to people observing animals at a zoo. The hypothesis seeks to explain the apparent absence of extraterrestrial life despite its generally accepted plausibility and hence the reasonable expectation of its existence.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=John A. |title=The Zoo Hypothesis |journal=[[International Journal of Solar System Studies|Icarus]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=347–349 |date=Jul 1973 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90111-5 |bibcode=1973Icar...19..347B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliens might, for example, choose to allow contact once the human species has passed certain technological, political, or ethical standards. They might withhold contact until humans force contact upon them, possibly by sending a [[spacecraft]] to planets they inhabit. Alternatively, a reluctance to initiate contact could reflect a sensible desire to minimize risk. An alien society with advanced remote-sensing technologies may conclude that direct contact with neighbors confers added risks to oneself without an added benefit. 

==Assumptions==
The zoo hypothesis assumes first that a large number of alien cultures exist,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and second that these aliens have great reverence for independent, natural evolution and development. In particular, assuming that intelligence is a physical process that acts to maximize the diversity of a system's accessible futures,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Wissner-Gross|A. D. Wissner-Gross]], "[http://www.alexwg.org/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexwg.org%2Fpublications%2FPhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf Causal entropic forces]", ''Physical Review Letters'' 110, 168702 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; a fundamental motivation for the zoo hypothesis would be that premature contact would "unintelligently" reduce the overall diversity of paths the universe itself could take. 

These ideas are perhaps most plausible if there is a relatively universal cultural or legal policy among a plurality of extraterrestrial civilizations necessitating isolation with respect to civilizations at Earth-like stages of development. In a universe without a hegemonic power, random single civilizations with independent principles would make contact. This makes a crowded Universe with clearly defined rules seem more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Soter, S. (2005). Astrobiol. Mag. 17 Oct [http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1745 "SETI and the Cosmic Quarantine Hypothesis"]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is a plurality of alien cultures, however, this theory may break down under the uniformity of motive concept because it would take just a single extraterrestrial civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be undone, and the probability of such a violation increases with the number of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all", Scientific American, July 2000, 38–43, (2000).[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=where-are-they]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea, however, becomes more plausible if all civilizations tend to evolve similar cultural standards and values with regard to contact much like [[convergent evolution]] on Earth has independently evolved eyes on numerous occasions,&lt;ref&gt;Kozmik, Z.; Ruzickova, J.; Jonasova, K.; Matsumoto, Y.; Vopalensky, P.; Kozmikova, I.; Strnad, H.; Kawamura, S. et al. (Jul 2008). "Assembly of the cnidarian camera-type eye from vertebrate-like components". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' 105 (26): 8989–8993.[http://www.pnas.org/content/105/26/8989.full]&lt;/ref&gt; or all civilizations follow the lead of some particularly distinguished civilization, such as the [[first civilization]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;Bracewell, R. (1982). Pre-emption of the Galaxy by the First AdvancedCivilization, Pergmon Press, Oxford.[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982ewat.book...34B]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermi paradox==
{{Main|Fermi paradox}}
With this in mind, a modified zoo hypothesis becomes a more appealing answer to the Fermi paradox. The time between the emergence of the [[first civilization]] within the [[Milky Way]] and all subsequent civilizations could be enormous. [[Monte Carlo simulation]] shows the first few inter-arrival times between emergent civilizations would be similar in length to [[Epoch (geology)|geologic epochs]] on Earth. Just what could a civilization do with a ten-million, one-hundred-million, or half-billion-year head start?&lt;ref&gt;[[Kardashev scale]] Kardashev, N.S. (1964). ''Soviet Astronomy''. 8, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if this first grand civilization is long gone, their initial legacy could live on in the form of a passed-down tradition, or perhaps an artificial life form dedicated to such a goal without the risk of death. Beyond this, it does not even have to be the first civilization, but simply the first to spread its doctrine and control over a large volume of the galaxy. If just one civilization gained this hegemony in the distant past, it could form an unbroken chain of taboo against rapacious colonization in favour of non-interference in those civilizations that follow. The uniformity of motive concept previously mentioned would become moot in such a situation.

If the oldest civilization still present in the Milky Way has, for example, a 100-million-year time advantage over the next oldest civilization, then it is conceivable that they could be in the singular position of being able to control, monitor, influence or isolate the emergence of every civilization that follows within their sphere of influence. This is analogous to what happens on Earth within our own civilization on a daily basis, in that everyone born on this planet is born into a pre-existing system of familial associations, customs, traditions and laws that were already long established before our birth and which we have little or no control over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hair | first1 = T.

==Appearance in fiction==
*In [[Olaf Stapledon|Olaf Stapledon's]] 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', great care is taken by the Symbiont race to keep its existence hidden from "pre-utopian" primitives, "lest they should lose their independence of mind". It is only when such worlds become utopian-level space travellers that the Symbionts make contact and bring the young utopia to an equal footing.
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' (first published in 1951) and its later novel adaptation ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) feature a beacon which is activated when the human race discovers it on the moon. An alien race has apparently visited us in the distant past.
*In ''[[Childhood's End]]'', a novel by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] published in 1953, the alien cultures had been observing and registering the [[Earth]]'s evolution and human history for thousands (perhaps millions) of years. At the beginning of the book, when mankind is about to achieve [[spaceflight]], the aliens reveal their existence and quickly end the [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]], [[colonialism]], [[racial segregation]] and the [[Cold War]].
*In ''[[Star Trek]]'', the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] (including humans) has a strict [[Prime Directive]] policy of nonintervention with less technologically advanced cultures which the Federation encounters. The threshold of inclusion is the independent technological development of [[faster-than-light]] propulsion. In the show's canon the [[Vulcans (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] race limited their encounters to observation until Humans made their first [[warp drive (Star Trek)|warp]] flight, after which they initiated [[Star Trek: First Contact|first contact]], indicating the practice predated the Human race's advance of this threshold. Additionally, in the episode "[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase (TNG)]]", a message from a first (or early) civilization is discovered, hidden in the [[DNA]] of [[Sentience|sentient]] species spread across many worlds, something that could only have been fully discovered after a race had become sufficiently advanced.
* In [[Julian May]]'s 1987 novel ''[[Galactic Milieu Series#Intervention|Intervention]]'', the five alien races of the Galactic Milieu keep the Earth under surveillance, but do not intervene until humans demonstrate mental and ethical maturity through a paranormal prayer of peace.
* [[Bill Watterson]]'s ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' comic strip for November 8, 1989, alludes to the possibility of an ethical threshold for first contact (or at least for the prudence of first contact) in Calvin's remark "Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us."
*In [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s SF novel ''[[Calculating God]]'' (2000), Hollus, a scientist from an advanced alien civilization, denies that her government is operating under the prime directive.
*In ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'' by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], the (unnamed) medieval-esque planet where the novel takes action is protected by the advanced civilization of Earth, and the observers from Earth present on the planet are forbidden to intervene and make overt contact. One of the major themes of the novel is the ethical dilemma presented by such a stance to the observers.
*In ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], the human xenobiologists and xenologers, biologists and anthropologists observing alien life, are forbidden from giving the native species, the Pequeninos, any technology or information. When one of the xenobiologists is killed in an alien ceremony, they are forbidden to mention it. This happens again until Ender Wiggin, the main character of ''[[Ender's Game]]'', explains to the Pequeninos that humans cannot partake in the ceremony because it kills them. While this is not exactly an example of the zoo hypothesis, since humanity makes contact, it is very similar and the humans seek to keep the Pequeninos ignorant of technology.
*In ''[[South Park]]'''s inaugural episode of season seven, "[[Cancelled (South Park)|Cancelled]]", aliens refrain from contacting Earth because the planet is the subject and setting of a reality television show. Unlike most variations of the zoo hypothesis where contact is not initiated in order to allow organic socioeconomic, cultural, and technological development, the aliens in this episode refrain from contact for the sole purpose of entertainment. In essence, the aliens treat all of Earth like the titular character in ''[[The Truman Show]]'' in order to maintain the show's integrity.
*In the 2008 video game ''[[Spore (2008 game)|Spore]]'', which [[simulation video game|simulates]] the evolution and life of species on a fictional galaxy, intelligent species in the "Space Stage" cannot contact those in previous stages, which did not [[world unification|unify]] their planets, nor develop [[spaceflight]] yet. However, they are allowed to [[alien abduction|abduct]] their citizens/members, to create [[crop circle]]s in their terrain and to place in their planets a tool called "[[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]]", which accelerates their technological evolution.
*[[Iain M. Banks]]' ''[[The State of the Art]]'' depicts [[the Culture]] secretly visiting Earth and then deciding to leave it uncontacted, watching its development as a [[control group]], to confirm whether their manipulations of other civilizations are ultimately for the best.
