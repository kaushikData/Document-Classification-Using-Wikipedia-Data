The multinational technology corporation '''[[Apple Inc.]]''' has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation and, like its competitors and peers, engages in [[litigation]] in its normal course of business for a variety of reasons. In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its [[intellectual property]] interests.&lt;ref name="genPatent"&gt;[http://www.generalpatent.com/remembering-steve-jobs Remembering Steve Jobs], General Patent Corporation, generalpatent.com, 2012-2.

From the 1980s to the present, Apple has been plaintiff or defendant in [[Lawsuit|civil action]]s in the [[United States]] and other countries. Some of these actions have determined significant [[case law]] for the [[information technology]] industry and many have captured the attention of the public and media. Apple's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, but the company has also been a party in lawsuits that include [[competition law|antitrust]] claims, consumer actions, commercial [[unfair competition|unfair trade practice]] suits, [[defamation]] claims, and [[industrial espionage|corporate espionage]], among other matters.

==Background==
Apple is a member of the [[Business Software Alliance]] (BSA), whose principal activity is trying to stop copyright infringement of software produced by BSA members; Apple treats all its intellectual property as a business asset, engaging in litigation as one method among many to police its assets and to respond to claims by others against it.&lt;ref name="applTmPirPol"&gt;[https://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/piracy.html Apple Trademarks – Piracy Policy], Apple, Inc., apple.com. Accessed April 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's portfolio of intellectual property is broad enough, for [[trademark]]s alone, to encompass several pages of the company's web site and, in April 2012, it listed 176 general business trademarks, 79 [[service mark]]s, 7 trademarks related to [[NeXT]] products and services, and 2 trademarks related to [[FileMaker]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/appletmlist.html Apple trademark list], and [https://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/nexttmlist.html NeXT trademark list], Apple, Inc., apple.com.

Accessed April 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Apple claims [[copyright]] interests in multiple products and processes and owns and licenses [[patent]]s of various types as well and, while it states it generally does not license its patent portfolio, it does work with third parties having an interest in product interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/legal/contact/patent.html Apple Legal – Patents], Apple, Inc., apple.com.

Accessed 2012-4-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 2008 and May 2010, Apple Inc. filed more than 350 cases with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark office]] (USPTO) alone, most in opposition to or taking exception to others' use of the terms "apple", "pod", and "safari"; those cases include sellers of apples (the fruit), as well as many others' less unassuming use of the term "apple".&lt;ref name="appleTTAB"&gt;U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), [http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Apple%20Inc.%20%20&amp;page=15 U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board search for 'Apple Inc.'.] Accessed July 26, 2012.

==Antitrust==

===Apple iPod, iTunes antitrust litigation===
The case ''In re Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation'' was filed as a [[class action]] in 2005&lt;ref name="MacLean"&gt;MacLean, Pamela, and Gullo, Karen, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-22/apple-s-jobs-must-answer-questions-in-itunes-antitrust-dispute.html Apple's Jobs Must Answer Questions in ITunes Antitrust Suit], Bloomberg News, bloomberg.com, March 22, 2011. Accessed 2012-4-13. Apple customer Thomas Slattery filed the suit seeking class-action status on behalf of consumers, claiming Apple illegally limited consumer choice by limiting iPod content selection to the company's own iTunes music store.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Apple violated the U.S. antitrust statutes in operating a music-downloading [[monopoly]] that it created by changing its software design to the proprietary [[FairPlay]] [[Code|encoding]] in 2004, resulting in other vendors' music files being incompatible with and thus inoperable on the [[iPod]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17764978882748288683 In re Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation]'', case C-05-00037-JW, 2008 U.S. Dist. [[LexisNexis|LEXIS]] 107127, N.D. Cal., December 22, 2008. Accessed 2012-7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit initially alleged that five days after [[RealNetworks]] released in 2004 its [[FairPlay#Harmony: RealPlayer Music on the iPod|Harmony]] technology making its music playable on iPods, Apple changed its software such that the RealNetworks music would no longer play on iPods.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, N.F., and Arewa, O.B., [http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1144&amp;context=njtip Is Apple Playing Fair? Navigating the iPod FairPlay DRM Controversy], ''NW Jour. of Tech. &amp; Intell. Prop.'', 5:2, 2007, p. 332. Accessed July 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of Apple's changes to its encoding and its refusal to license FairPlay technology to other companies were dismissed by the court 2009, but the allegation of Apple's monopoly on the iPod's music download capabilities between 2004 and 2009 remained as of July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Jacqui, [https://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/ipod-owners-being-notified-of-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-apple/ iPod owners being notified of class-action antitrust suit against Apple], The lawsuit has been winding its way through the legal system since 2004, [[Ars Technica]], arstechnica.com, May 9, 2012. Accessed July 23, 2012. The case was granted class action status in 2012 and a website was set up for class members: [https://ipodlawsuit.com/ ipodlawsuit.com] (this link works only with [[HTTP referer|referrer]]s turned on in the browser).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, [[Bloomberg L.P.|''Bloomberg'']] reported that, after a related 3-year inquiry by the [[Competition Commission (United Kingdom)|Competition Commission]], Apple agreed in 2008 to lower its prices on [[iTunes]] tracks sold in the United Kingdom and that Steve Jobs had been directed by the court in March 2011 to make himself available to be [[Deposition (law)|deposed]] on Apple's FairPlay changes as they relate to the plaintiffs' monopolization claim.&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt;

===Apple and AT&amp;amp;T Mobility antitrust class action===
In October 2007 (four months after the [[iPhone]] was introduced), Paul Holman and Lucy Rivello filed a class action lawsuit (numbered C07-05152) in the Northern District of California.  The lawsuit referenced Apple's [[SIM lock]] on the iPhone and Apple's (at the time) complete ban on third-party apps, and alleged that the 1.1.1 software update was "expressly designed" to disable unapproved SIM cards and apps.  The lawsuit said that this was an unfair, unlawful, and fraudulent business practice (see [[False advertising]]) under California's Unfair Competition Law; that the combination of [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;amp;T Mobility]] and Apple was to reduce competition and cause a monopoly in violation of California's antitrust law and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]; and that this disabling was a violation of the [[Protected computer|Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/5:2007cv05152/196514/1/0.pdf?ts=1377199493]" Complaint, Paul Holman et al. v. Apple Inc. et al. No. 07-05152, U.S. Dist.Ct., N.D. Cal. 2007. Accessed August 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this initial filing, other lawsuits were filed, and these were consolidated with the original Holman suit, bringing in additional plaintiffs and complaints:  Timothy Smith, et al., v. Apple, Inc. et al., No. C 07-05662 RMW, adding complaints related to ringtones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/5:2007cv05152/196514/34/0.pdf?ts=1376380861] Order Relating Cases; Consolidating Cases; And Setting Case Management Conference, In Re Apple &amp; AT&amp;TM Anti-Trust Litigation No. C 07-05152 &amp; No. C 07-05662, U.S. Dist.Ct., N.D. Cal. 2008. Accessed August 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kliegerman v. Apple, Inc., No. C 08-948, bringing in allegations under the federal [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/5:2007cv05152/196514/86/0.pdf?ts=1376380861] Stipulation And Order Granting Plaintiff's Administrative Motion To Relate Cases Under L.R. 3-12, In Re Apple &amp; AT&amp;TM Anti-Trust Litigation No. C 07-05152, U.S. Dist.Ct., N.D. Cal. 2008. Accessed August 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined case title was changed to "In Re Apple &amp; AT&amp;TM Anti-Trust Litigation."  The court appointed lead counsel from the various plaintiffs' lawyers, and several versions of a combined complaint were filed.

In October 2008, the court denied the defendants' motions to dismiss the case on the federal claims and granted their motions to dismiss the state unfair trade practice claims except in California, New York, and Washington, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend those claims.&lt;ref&gt;In re Apple &amp; AT &amp;amp; T M Antitrust Litig., No. C 07-05152 JW, 2010 WL 3521965, N.D. Cal., 2010-7-8, pp. 5&amp;ndash;8. Accessed July 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011, the district court granted Apple and AT&amp;T's motions to compel arbitration, following the Supreme Court decision in  ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]'', and decertified the class; in April 2012 the Ninth Circuit denied plaintiffs permission to appeal.&lt;ref name="ATTM0816Dismissal"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/0816AppleSuit.pdf] Order Granting Apple's Motion To Dismiss Amended Consolidated Complaint, In Re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litigation No. C 11-cv-06714-YGR, U.S. Dist.Ct., N.D. Cal. 2013. Accessed August 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, immediately after class decertification of the previous case, a new group of plaintiffs led by Robert Pepper won the race to the courthouse by filing a complaint in the Northern District, which was combined with some slightly later filers and titled "In re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litigation", case 11-cv-06714-YGR.  The new case is essentially the same but is filed only against Apple, not AT&amp;T Mobility.  In late 2013, the various parts of the case were dismissed by the district court.  The parts relating to SIM locking were rejected because AT&amp;T was not a party and the plaintiffs were not willing to add AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name="ATTM0816Dismissal"/&gt;  The remaining claim, in its final version, was that Apple monopolised the market for iPhone applications and that the plaintiffs were damaged by paying Apple's 30% commission for paid applications in the App Store, which the court rejected saying that the commission was "a cost passed-on to consumers by independent software developers", not paid by the consumers directly, and so the plaintiffs did not have standing under the [[Illinois Brick Co v. Illinois|Illinois Brick]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/4:2011cv06714/249697/124/0.pdf?1386062572] Order Granting Apple's Motion To Dismiss Second Amended Complaint With Prejudice, In Re Apple iPhone Anti-Trust Litigation No. C 11-cv-06714-YGR, U.S. Dist.Ct., N.D. Cal. 2013. Accessed December 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth District, which reversed the District Court's dismissal. The Ninth Circuit asked the question that in light of Illinois Brick, if Apple was to be treated as a manufacturer or producer, in which case the class did not have standing to sue, or if they were a distributor, in which case the class could sue for damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-appeals-court-reopens-lawsuit-against-apple-for-alleged-app-store-monopoly/ |title= US appeals court reopens lawsuit against Apple for alleged App Store monopoly |first= Stephanie |last= Condon  |date= January 12, 2017 |accessdate= June 18, 2018 |work = [[ZDNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-apple/9th-circuit-apple-antitrust-ruling-splits-with-8th-is-boon-to-consumers-idUSKBN14X2HV |title= 9th Circuit Apple antitrust ruling splits with 8th, is boon to consumers |first= Alison |last= Frankel |date= January 13, 2017 |accessdate= June 18, 2018 |publisher= [[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European antitrust investigation===
In 2008, Apple agreed to cut the price UK consumers pay to download music for their iPods after a formal complaint to the [[European Commission]] from the UK consumer group ''[[Which?]]'' demonstrated higher prices in UK for the same iTunes songs sold elsewhere in the [[European Union]] (EU).&lt;ref&gt;Apple, Inc., [https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/09Apple-to-Standardize-iTunes-Music-Prices-Throughout-Europe.html Apple to Standardize iTunes Music Prices Throughout Europe], apple.com, January 9, 2008.

====Apple Corps====
{{main|Apple Corps v. Apple Computer}}
For nearly 30 years [[Apple Corps]] ([[The Beatles]]-founded record label and holding company) and Apple Inc. (then Apple Computer) litigated a dispute involving the use of the name "Apple" as a [[trademark]] and its association with music. In 1978, Apple Corps filed suit against Apple Computer for trademark infringement and the parties settled in 1981 with Apple Computer paying an undisclosed amount to Apple Corps, later revealed to be $80,000.&lt;ref&gt;Salkever, Alex, [http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-09-29/john-paul-george-ringo-dot-dot-dot-and-steve John, Paul, George, Ringo...and Steve?], ''Businessweek'', businessweek.com, September 30, 2004. Accessed 2012-7-23.&lt;/ref&gt; A primary condition of the settlement was that Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business. In 1991, after Apple introduced the [[Apple IIgs]] with an [[Ensoniq]] music synthesizer chip, Apple Corps alleged the product to be in violation of the terms of their settlement. The parties then reached another settlement agreement and Apple paid Apple Corps around $26.5 million, with Apple agreeing it would not package, sell, or distribute physical music materials.&lt;ref&gt;Borland and Fried, [http://news.cnet.com/Apple-vs.-Apple-Perfect-harmony/2100-1027_3-5378401.html Apple vs. Apple: Perfect harmony?], [[CNET]] News, news.cnet.com, September 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, Apple Corps again sued Apple Computer alleging Apple Computer had breached the settlement once more, this time for introducing [[iTunes]] and the [[iPod]]. Apple Corps alleged Apple Computer's introduction of the music-playing products with the [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] violated the terms of the previous agreement in which Apple agreed not to distribute music. The trial opened on March 29, 2006, in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4854408.stm Apple giants do battle in court], BBC News, news.bbc.co.uk, March 29, 2006.

On February 5, 2007, Apple Inc. and Apple Corps announced another settlement of their trademark dispute, agreeing that Apple Inc. would own all of the trademarks related to 'Apple' and would license certain of those trademarks back to Apple Corps for its continued use. The settlement ended the ongoing trademark lawsuit between the companies, with each party bearing its own legal costs, and Apple Inc. continuing to use the Apple name and logos on iTunes.

====Domain name disputes====

=====''appleimac.com''=====
In an early [[domain name]] dispute, two months before announcing the [[iMac]] in July 1998, Apple sued then-teenager Abdul Traya. Having registered the domain name ''appleimac.com'' in an attempt to draw attention to the web-hosting business he ran out of his parents' basement, a note on Traya's site stated that his plan was to "generate traffic to our servers and try to put the domain to sale.

=====''itunes.co.uk''=====
The Apple-Cohen dispute was a [[cybersquatting]] case where a top-level domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), rather than to the prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts,&lt;ref name="CohenDecision"&gt;Full text of the ''Nominet-Cohen'' decision, including the full history of the use of the domain itunes.co.uk: [http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/766_itunes.pdf Nominet Cohen-Apple decision].&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2000, [[Benjamin Cohen (journalist)|Benjamin Cohen]] of [[CyberBritain]] registered the domain name ''itunes.co.uk''. The domain initially pointed to ''skipmusic.com'', and then to ''cyberbritain.com'', and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for ''iTunes'' in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, [[Napster]];&lt;ref name="nominetIndepExpert"&gt;Nominet UK Dispute Resolution Service, [http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/766_itunes.pdf Decision of Independent Expert], DRS No. 02223, p. 3, March 10, 2005. Accessed 2012-7-23.&lt;/ref&gt; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.&lt;ref name="CohenDecision"/&gt;

In 2005, Apple took the matter to the Dispute Resolution Service operated by [[.uk]] [[domain name registry]] [[Nominet UK]] (the DRS), claiming that Apple had trademark rights in the name "iTunes" and that the use of the domain name by Cohen's company was abusive (these being the two tests under the DRS rules for prevailing in a matter where the complaint related only to the later use of a trademarked name).&lt;ref name="nominetBackground"&gt;[http://www.nominet.org.uk/disputes/courtcases/itunes/ iTunes.co.uk Background], Nominet.org.uk., Accessed July 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was unresolved at the free [[mediation]] stage and so Apple paid for an independent expert to decide the case; the expert decided the dispute in Apple's favor.&lt;ref name="CohenDecision"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nominetIndepExpert"/&gt;

Cohen thereafter launched a media offensive claiming the DRS was biased in favor of large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet.&lt;ref name="mccarthyNominet"&gt;McCarthy, Kieren, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/27/itunes_no_nominet/ Cohen disputes UK registry's legitimacy], ''The Register'', Financial News, May 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen stated he believed that the DRS system was unfair for a number of reasons and would seek redress against Nominet with the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] via [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="nominetBackground"/&gt; Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings for judicial review.&lt;ref name="richardsonNominet"&gt;Richardson, Tim, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/17/itunes_nominet/ Nominet faces judicial review over itunes.co.uk ownership], ''The Register'', Music and Media, June 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service.&lt;ref name="cohenHighCtOp"&gt;High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Administrative Court, ''[http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/30566_iTunes-Judicial-Review.pdf Cyberbritain Group Ltd. vs. Nominet UK Ltd.]'', CO Ref: CO/8360/2005, August 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a rehearing and, as that case progressed, the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple.&lt;ref name="cohenDropped"&gt;Richardson, Tim, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/25/cohen_itunes/ Cohen ends legal bid for itunes.co.uk], Financial News, ''The Register'', November 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cisco Systems: iPhone mark====
In 2006, [[Cisco Systems]] and Apple negotiated over allowing Apple rights to use Cisco's [[Linksys iPhone]] trademark, but the negotiations stalled when Cisco pushed for the two products to be interoperable. Following the public unveiling of the [[iPhone|Apple iPhone]] at the 2007 [[Macworld – iWorld|Macworld Expo]], Cisco filed a lawsuit against Apple&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.findlaw.com/wsj/docs/apple/ciscoaap110007cmp.html Cisco Systems Inc. v.

Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered that there would be no [[Confusing similarity|likelihood of confusion]] between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] phone.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Marguerite, and Krazit, Tom, [http://news.cnet.com/Cisco-sues-Apple-over-use-of-iPhone-trademark/2100-1047_3-6149285.html Cisco sues Apple over use of iPhone trademark], CNET News, news.cnet.com, January 10, 2007.

In March 2007, Apple [[Opposition proceeding|opposed]] a trademark application by [[Startup company|startup]] Sector Labs, which sought to register "Video Pod" as a mark identifying goods associated with a video projector product.

===Copyright===

====''Apple v. Franklin''====
{{main|Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.}}
''Apple v. Franklin'' established the fundamental basis of copyright of computer software, even if it was provided only as object code or in [[firmware]]. In 1982, Apple filed a lawsuit against [[Franklin Computer Corp.]], alleging that Franklin's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of the [[Apple II]]'s [[operating system]] and [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. The case was decided in Franklin's favor but reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;''Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.'', 714 F.2d 1240, 3d Cir., 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Object code cases and conflicts of law====
{{See also|Apple Computer, Inc. v. Mackintosh Computers Ltd.}}
Apple's litigation over [[overhead code|object code]]&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[overhead code|object code]] with [[object file]]&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the development of contemporary copyright law because the company's object code cases brought different results in different courts, creating a [[conflict of laws]] that resulted in international litigation. In the 1980s, Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with [[source code]]) of a computer program is subject to copyright laws. A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were ''Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc.'' (1986, Australia) ("''Computer Edge''"),&lt;ref name="computerEdge"&gt;''Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc.'', 65 ALR 33, 1986; F.S.R. 537, 1986, High Court of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd.'', (Canada, 1987) ("''Apple v. Mackintosh''"),&lt;ref name="ApplevMac"&gt;''Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd.'', 44 DLR (4th) 74 Federal Court of Appeal, 1987, Canada, (later affirmed, [http://scc.lexum.org/en/1990/1990scr2-209/1990scr2-209.html Supreme Court of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609121231/http://scc.lexum.org/en/1990/1990scr2-209/1990scr2-209.html |date=June 9, 2012 }}, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 209).

Computer Imports Limited'', 2 NZLR 395, 409, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Computer Edge'' case, the Australian court decided against the then-prevailing opinions in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable,&lt;ref name="CE2"&gt;In ''Computer Edge'' the court looked to 1986 161 CLR 171 (test in Exxon for literary work is "not intended to establish a comprehensive or exhaustive definition of literary work for copyright purposes" per Mason and Wilson JJ (Aus.)).&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''Apple v. Mackintosh'' reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was a translation of source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within [[Read-only memory|ROM]] silicon chips are protected under the [[Copyright Act of Canada]] and the conversion from the source code into object code is a form of [[translation]]. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.

In these conflict of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In ''IBM v. Computer Imports'', the [[High Court of New Zealand]] then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner.&lt;ref name="nzIBM"/&gt; Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until the creation of an international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law.&lt;ref name="copyrtChgs"&gt;The 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPs]]), the 1991 European Economic Council Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs ("[[Computer Programs Directive|EC Directive]]"), the [[Copyright Act of Canada]], the New Zealand [[Copyright Act 1994]], and other national copyright law revisions.&lt;/ref&gt; These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;Corbett, Susan, [http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/research/seminars/documents2007/sc_230307.pdf What if Object Code Had Been Excluded from Protection as a Literary Work in Copyright Law?], a paper for presentation at the 4th Annual Intellectual Property Conference: ''Rewriting History: Counterfactuals and Alternative Stories in Intellectual Property and Cyberspace Law'', Michigan State Univ.

Cited, among other things, was the use of overlapping and resizable windows in Windows 2.0. The case was one of the "[[look and feel]]" copyright lawsuits of the 1980s. After several years in court, Apple's claims against Microsoft were dismissed, primarily due to a license [[John Sculley]] had negotiated with [[Bill Gates]] for Windows 1.0.

In the year before Apple and Samsung began suing each other on most continents, and while Apple and HTC were already embroiled in a patent fight, [[Motorola Mobility]] and Apple started a period of intense patent litigation. The Motorola-Apple patent imbroglio commenced with claims and cross-claims between the companies for patent infringement and encompassed multiple forums in multiple countries as each party sought friendly venues for litigating its respective claims; the fight also included [[administrative law]] rulings as well as ITC and [[European Commission]] involvement.&lt;ref&gt;The cases include: ''Motorola Mobility, Inc. v.

====''Corephotonics v. Apple''====
On 6 November 2017, [[Israel]]i [[Startup company|start-up]] Corephotonics sued Apple. They claimed that the technology behind the dual-camera systems in Apple's [[iPhone 7|iPhone 7 Plus]] and [[iPhone 8|8 Plus]] infringed four patents owned by them (Corephotonics). Corephotonics said that they approached Apple over a possible partnership, but Apple's lead negotiator apparently declined the idea, with Apple going ahead and launching the iPhone 7 Plus in late 2016, and then the 8 Plus in late 2017.

{{quote|Apple's lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics' patents, telling Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something.|source=Corephotonics LTD.}}

The patents claimed by Corephotonics to be infringed are: two patents on mini telephoto lens assembly, one patent on dual aperture zoom digital cameras, and one on high resolution thin multi-aperture imaging systems.

Corephotonics also blamed Apple's consumers (who bought the 7 Plus or 8 Plus) to be infringing the patents, as they claim that Apple sells the products with "knowledge of or willful blindness", which the consumers buy.

The lawsuit demands monetary compensation for the lawyers the start-up had to hire, as well as for damages. They are also asking Apple to immediately stop producing dual-lens cameras systems. The [[iPhone X]] is not included in the lawsuit, despite having a dual-lens camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16619138/apple-israel-dual-lens-iphone-7-8-plus-patent-lawsuit|title=Israeli company sues Apple for dual lens camera patent infringement|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/07/corephotonics-vs-apple/|title=Corephotonics Sues Apple Over Dual-Lens Cameras in iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-patents-lawsuit/israeli-start-up-says-apple-copied-its-patented-smartphone-camera-technology-idUSKBN1D72M0|title=Israeli start-up says Apple copied its patented smartphone camera technology|date=2017-11-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/07/israeli-company-claims-apple-copied-its-dual-camera-tech/|title=Israeli company claims Apple copied its dual-camera tech|work=Engadget|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office of Fair Trading investigation====

In 2008, the UK [[Consumer Focus|National Consumer Council]] (NCC, now Consumer Focus) called on the UK's [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) to investigate Apple's EULA, claiming Apple's EULA, and those of multiple other technology companies, misled consumers and infringed legal rights. The NCC's product complaint included Apple's [[iLife]] as well as Microsoft's [[Microsoft Office|Office for Mac]], and products by [[Corel]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Symantec]], [[Kaspersky Lab|Kaspersky]], [[McAfee]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, John, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/19/eulas_unfair_investigation/ Consumer group slams 'unfair' software licenses, EULAugh, I cry], ''The Register'', theregister.co.uk, February 19, 2008.

Psystar Corporation]'', 673 F. Supp. 2d 943, U.S. Dist.Ct., N.D. Cal. 2009. Accessed July 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; alleging Psystar sold [[Intel]]-based systems with [[macOS|Mac OS X]] pre-installed and that, in so doing, violated Apple's copyright and trademark rights and the [[software license|software licensing]] terms of Apple's [[Shrink wrap contract|shrink wrap license]]. That [[license]] restricted the use of Mac OS X to Apple computers, and specifically prohibited customers from installing the operating system on non-Apple computers.The case brought the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking facets of the [[DMCA]] into this licensing dispute, with Apple ultimately prevailing and awarded permanent injunctive relief, and the decision affirmed on appeal in 2011.&lt;ref name="psystarAppeal"&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Apple+Inc.+v.+Psystar+Corp&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=115813569563137915&amp;scilh=0 Apple Inc. v.

Accessed July 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Psystar's appeal asserted copyright misuse as a defense by arguing that Apple's license agreement was an unlawful attempt to extend copyright protection to products that are not copyrightable. The appeals court ruled that Psystar failed to demonstrate "copyright misuse" by Apple because Psystar must show either that the license agreement restricts creativity or that it restricts competition, and that Apple's [[license]] agreement does neither.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/09/28/10-15113.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria adopted a resolution to establish the 'Institute of the Arab Encyclopedia' (IAE) ({{Lang-ar|هيئة الموسوعة العربية}}) in 1981 which issued the first edition of the encyclopedia in 1998 in Damascus, Syria.  In 2016, the official website was launched which allows free access to all the entries of the encyclopedia.

[[Image:1921 Automobile Blue Book v1 cover.png|upright|thumb|right|Cover of ''Automobile Blue Book'' volume 1, 1921]]
The '''''Automobile Blue Book''''' was an American [[Book series|series]] of road [[Guide book|guides]] for [[driving|motoring]] travelers in the [[United States]] and Canada published between 1901 and 1929.

== Origin ==
[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]  [[automobile]] businessman and enthusiast Charles Howard Gillette initiated the series. It was first published in 1901, covering 62 routes across the [[Northeastern United States|American Northeast]]ern metropolitan areas of [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] Gillette had originally intended the book to focus on routes that connected automobile supply stations, and included extensive reference sections on automobile repair and maintenance, but  the book would find its most success focusing on routes between cities.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/cp62-bauer/239 |author=John T. Bauer |year=2009 |title=The Official Automobile Blue Book, 1901–1929: Precursor to the American Road Map |journal= Cartographic Perspectives |issue=62 |publisher=North American Cartographic Information Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

== Growth ==

[[File:Blue Book Route Palmer to Willimantic 1914.jpg|thumb|upright|Route from 1914 ''Automobile Blue Book'', showing a garage advertisement and start of route between [[Palmer, Massachusetts]] and [[Willimantic, Connecticut]]]]
The ''Automobile Blue Book'' was published annually as a single volume through 1906, expanding to 3 volumes in 1907, but would not cover the full United States until 1915.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|13,16}} In 1906 the [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA), of which Gillette was Secretary, officially sponsored the book, dramatically increasing its circulation as the book was sold to association members at a discount.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|13}} The 1907 edition was the first to include maps of cities and routes, while also removing the automobile maintenance sections in favor of more space for advertisements related to automobiles and touring.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|13}} Readers could also find information on trip planning and state road laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wnpr.org/post/getting-there-here-0 |title=Getting There From Here |last=Gammell |first=Ben |date=June 7, 2013 |website=WNPR |publisher= |access-date=2017-12-09 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1910s, it became "the standard publication" of its type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = University Of Chicago Press |isbn = 9780226010748 |title = Cartographies of Travel and Navigation |editor = James R. Akerman |publication-date = 2006 |author= James R. Akerman |chapter=20th-Century American Road Maps and the Making of a National Motorized Space }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volumes of the ''Automobile Blue Book'' published before 1927 were primarily designed to provide routes between cities, focusing on turn-by-turn directions, with supplemental maps providing context and showing connections. Directions were not necessarily intended to be the shortest or fastest connection between each city, but to provide interesting scenery and opportunities for rest and maintenance along the route. Each route was listed twice{{snd}} once in each direction. This emphasis on providing separate routes for each city connection led to volumes often containing more than 800 pages to describe the hundreds of routes contained within.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|7}} These routes relied primarily on landmarks and right or left turn descriptions, while avoiding compass directions like north or east, which made the directions difficult to use if travelers left the designated route or a landmark was destroyed.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|10}} These turn-by-turn directions may have been a necessity however, as roads at the time were designed for local{{snd}} not intercity{{snd}} travel, limiting long stretches of continuous roads, and meaning "anyone wishing to travel cross-country by automobile was forced to make hundreds of turns onto hundreds of different roads" that were impractical to represent visually on a map.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

== Production and Development ==
The routes used in the ''Blue Book'' were initially developed by amateur "pathfinders" who used their knowledge of local roads to compile the listed routes. Early pathfinders were actually bicyclists, but eventually automobile clubs{{snd}} especially those of the AAA{{snd}} became the major source of routes compiled by the ''Blue Book''.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|17}} By 1907 the ''Blue Book'' had its own fleet of cars and professional pathfinders working in teams of two to create and update routes.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|18}}

== Audience and Advertisements ==
Early editions of the book were aimed primarily at wealthy Americans traveling for leisure, as only the rich could afford an automobile in the early 1900s. With the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s release of the [[Model T]] in 1908, the article's advertisements evidenced a shift toward a larger middle class market as touring in automobiles became more accessible.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|11}} The book's reliance on mileages as a navigational aid created difficulty at a time when many automobiles were not sold with [[odometer]]s or [[speedometer]]s included, but provided an opportunity for the book to regularly advertise after-market versions in its volumes.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|8}} As the ''Blue Book'' grew to include hundreds of advertisements for hotels, restaurants, garages, and auto dealers in each volume, some retailers hung signs announcing themselves as an "Official Automobile Blue Book Garage" or an "Official Automobile Blue Book Hotel."&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|21}}

== Decline ==
[[File:1921 index map Automobile Blue Book guidebooks.png|thumb|Index map of volumes in the ''Automobile Blue Book'' series, 1921]]
After reaching peak size by publishing 12 volumes in 1921, publishers consolidated to 4 volumes in 1922, removing routes, shrinking fonts, and increasing use of abbreviations over the years.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|16–17}} As a number of competing map services arose, including [[Rand McNally]], the ''Blue Book'' suffered declining sales, exacerbated when AAA stopped distributing the books in 1926. In response, the 1927 edition was dramatically reformatted, with an emphasis on maps and the elimination of turn-by-turn route directions as the increasing development of highways made map-based navigation more practical.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2009" /&gt;{{rp|17,24}} The last ''Blue Book'' was published in 1929.

'''''Bulfinch's Mythology''''' is a collection of [[general audience]] works by American [[Latinist]] and banker [[Thomas Bulfinch]], named after him and published after his death in 1867. The work was a highly successful popularization of [[Greek mythology]] for English-speaking readers. Carl J. Richard comments that it was "one of the most popular books ever published in the United States and the standard work on [[classical mythology]] for nearly a century," until the release of classicist [[Edith Hamilton]]'s 1942 ''[[Mythology (book)|Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0qAY29cYNxsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=bulfinch’s+mythology+by+thomas+bulfinch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ew9fTYqwB8iCgAfYmuWKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=bulfinch’s%20mythology%20by%20thomas%20bulfinch&amp;f=false Richard, Carl J., ''The Golden Age of the Classics in America,''] Harvard University Press, 2009, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a prose recounting of [[myth]]s and stories from three eras: Greek and [[Roman mythology]], [[King Arthur]] legends and [[chivalric romance|medieval romances]]. Bulfinch intersperses the stories with his own commentary, and with quotations from writings by his contemporaries that refer to the story under discussion. This combination of classical elements and modern literature was novel for his time.&lt;ref name="Miscuit"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060720010620/http://www.fivecolleges.edu/mcleary/cl-world.html Miscuit utile dulci: ''Bulfinch's Mythology'' as a pedagogical prototype] ''Classical World'', Vol. 78, No. 6 (1985), page 591, accessed 19 August 2015 via Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulfinch expressly intended his work for the general reader. In the preface to ''The Age of Fable'' he states "Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation."&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, Thomas. 1934. ''The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes'', p. vii. Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulfinch originally published his work as three volumes: ''The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes'', published in 1855; ''The Age of Chivalry, or Legends of King Arthur'', published in 1858; and ''Legends of Charlemagne, or Romance of the Middle Ages,'' published in 1863. The original three volumes were later combined into a single volume titled ''Bulfinch's Mythology'', published in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sgg2AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=bulfinch’s+mythology+by+thomas+bulfinch&amp;dq=bulfinch’s+mythology+by+thomas+bulfinch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kRBfTcurA83qgQeX-NyJDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgo ''Guide to Reference Books'', 1929, page 89]&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the [[public domain]], multiple editions of the combined work are still in print more than 150 years after the three books were published.

The '''City of Toronto Archives''' is the municipal archives for the City of [[Toronto]]. It holds records created by the City of Toronto government and its [[Amalgamation of Toronto|predecessor municipalities]] from 1792 to the present day,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/archives/government_records.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as non-government records created by private groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/archives/non_govt_records.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There are also over one million photographs of Toronto within its collection, with over 50,000 available to view on its website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/archives/description.htm#photographs&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:City of Toronto Archives, stacks 2.jpg|thumbnail|A portion of the City of Toronto Archives holdings]]

== The Collection ==
The oldest record in the Archives is a map of [[Toronto Harbour]] dated 1792,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/archives/description.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the newest one is a DVD of the previous month's [[Toronto City Council]] meeting. Of the 1.2 million photographs within the Toronto Archives collection, the oldest are a [[Armstrong, Beere and Hime panorama|set of twenty-five prints of the city taken in 1856-57 by the firm of photographers, Armstrong, Beere and Hime]].  These are the earliest known photographs of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/archives/earliest_1_earliestknown.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Other important photographic collections are the William James collection, the Alexander Galbraith collection and the [[Micklethwaite|F.W. Micklethwaite]] collection, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' collection (1922–56), as well as over 100,000 photographs taken by city photographers.

== The Building ==
[[File:City of Toronto Archives, main floor.jpg|thumbnail|City of Toronto Archives building, main floor]]
The present Archives building was opened in 1992.  It was designed by the architectural firm of [[Eberhard Zeidler|Zeidler Roberts]], who also designed the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]], as a state-of-the-art purpose-built archives building incorporating a climate controlled records, a central atrium and exhibition area; a 60-seat theatre and a Research Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wx.toronto.ca/inter/culture/doorsopen2011.nsf/c6aa5b41200ea1758525720d004c5e96/de1b8753d6d146918525784f0063b425?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728011003/http://wx.toronto.ca/inter/culture/doorsopen2011.nsf/c6aa5b41200ea1758525720d004c5e96/de1b8753d6d146918525784f0063b425?OpenDocument |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of the building was to hold the records of the government of [[Metropolitan Toronto]].  Since [[Amalgamation of Toronto#1998 amalgamation|amalgamation in 1998]], documents from the other six constituent municipalities have been housed there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/archives/research_guides.htm#formermunicipalities&lt;/ref&gt;   Prior to amalgamation, the archives were held in the respective city halls.

{{neuropsychology}}
'''Comparative neuropsychology''' refers to an approach used for understanding human [[brain]] functions. It involves the direct evaluation of clinical neurological populations by employing experimental methods originally developed for use with nonhuman animals.

Over many decades of animal research, methods were perfected to study the effects of well-defined brain [[lesion]]s on specific behaviors, and later the tasks were modified for human use.  Generally the modifications involve changing the reward from food to money, but standard administration of the tasks in humans still involves minimal instructions, thus necessitating a degree of [[procedural memory|procedural learning]] in human and nonhuman animals alike.

Currently, comparative neuropsychology is used with neurological patients to link specific deficits with localized areas of the brain.

The comparative neuropsychological approach employs simple tasks that can be mastered without relying upon language skills.  Precisely because these simple paradigms do not require linguistic strategies for solution, they are especially useful for working with patients whose language skills are compromised, or whose cognitive skills may be minimal.

Comparative neuropsychology contrasts with the traditional approach of using tasks that rely upon linguistic skills, and that were designed to study human cognition.  Because important ambiguities about its heuristic value had not been addressed empirically, only recently has comparative neuropsychology become popular for implementation with [[brain damage|brain-damaged]] patients.

Within the past decade, comparative neuropsychology has had prevalent use as a framework for comparing and contrasting the performances of disparate neurobehavioral populations on similar tasks.

==History==

Comparative neuropsychology involves the study of brain-behavior relationships by applying experimental paradigms, used extensively in animal laboratories, for testing human clinical populations.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oscar-Berman|first1=M|title=A comparative neuropsychological approach to alcoholism and the brain.|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism Supplement|date=1994|volume=2|pages=281–9|pmid=8974348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular paradigms include delayed reaction tasks, discrimination and reversal learning tasks, and matching- and nonmatching-to-sample.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; These tasks are used to test animals and relate them to human brain functioning. Such tasks were perfected on experimental animals having well defined brain lesions, and adapted for human neurological patients.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; The comparative aspects of such approach resides in the analogy between animals with brain lesions and human patients with lesions in homologous areas of the brain. One example is represented by the comparison between the brain of laboratory animals (primarily non human primates and mice) with the one of people with damages resulting from alcohol abuse.

==George Ettlinger==

George Ettlinger was one of the few who actively combined human and animal research, and he did so consistently throughout his scientific career.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, A. D. (1998). Introduction: Comparative Neuropsychology. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger work focused on the importance of the inferior temporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning and memory in macaque monkeys,&lt;ref name="cowey"&gt;Cowey, A., Dean, P., &amp; Weiskrantz, L. (1998). Ettlinger at Bay: can visual agnosia be explained by low-level visual impairments? Chicago: Oxford University Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the importance of ventral temporal lobe in vision. Ettinger animals models carried inferotemporal or latero-ventral prestriate [[Ablative brain surgery|ablation]]. In 1966 George Ettlinger, together with the psychologist [[Colin Blakemore]] and the neurosurgeon Murray Falconer, described the results of a study on correlation between pre-operative intelligence and the severity of mesial temporal sclerosis in temporal lobe specimens excised to treat intractable epilepsy.&lt;ref name="oxbury" /&gt; Such study It is known as a forerunner of what has become one of the potentially most interesting techniques for exploring the relationship between certain aspects of human memory and temporal lobe structures.&lt;ref name="oxbury"&gt;Oxbury, J. M., &amp; Oxbury, S. (1998). Memory and the human temporal lobes. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Accessible Information SYstem (DAISY) is an [[XML]]-based open standard published by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and maintained by the DAISY Consortium for people with [[print disabilities]].  DAISY has wide international support with features for multimedia, navigation and synchronization. A subset of the DAISY format has been adopted by law in the United States as the National Instructional Material Accessibility Standard (NIMAS), and K-12 textbooks and instructional materials are now required to be provided to students with disabilities.

DAISY is already aligned with the EPUB technical standard, and is expected to fully converge with its forthcoming EPUB3 revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daisy.org/z3986 |title=DAISY Standard &amp;#124; DAISY Consortium |publisher=Daisy.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| .[[DjVu|djvu]]
|}
DjVu is a format specialized for storing scanned documents. It includes advanced compressors optimized for low-color images, such as text documents. Individual files may contain one or more pages. DjVu files cannot be re-flowed.

The contained page images are divided in separate layers (such as multi-color, low-resolution, background layer using [[lossy compression]], and few-colors, high-resolution, tightly compressed foreground layer), each compressed in the best available method. The format is designed to decompress very quickly, even faster than vector-based formats.

The advantage of DjVu is that it is possible to take a high-resolution scan (300–400 DPI), good enough for both on-[[screen reading]] and printing, and store it very efficiently. Several dozens of 300 DPI black-and-white scans can be stored in less than a megabyte.

===DOC===

|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| Microsoft Word
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| .[[Doc (computing)|DOC]]
|}

[[Doc (computing)|DOC]] is a [[document]] file format that is directly supported by few ebook readers. Its advantages as an ebook format is that it can be easily converted to other ebook formats and it can be reflowed. It can be easily edited.

===DOCX===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':

[[DOCX]] is a [[document]] file format that is directly supported by few ebook readers. Its advantages as an ebook format are that it can be easily converted to other ebook formats and it can be reflowed. It can be easily edited.

=== EPUB ===
{{Main article|EPUB}}

The .epub or [[Open eBook|OEBPS]] format is a technical standard for e-books created by the [[International Digital Publishing Forum]] (IDPF).

The EPUB format has gained some popularity as a vendor-independent XML-based e-book format. The format can be read by the [[Kobo eReader]], [[BlackBerry]] devices, Apple's [[iBooks]] app running on [[Macintosh]] computers and [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices, [[Google Play Books]] app running on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and iOS devices, [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]], Amazon [[Kindle Fire]],&lt;ref name="kdp.amazon.com"/&gt; [[Sony Reader]], [[BeBook]], [[Cybook Gen3|Bookeen Cybook Gen3 (with firmware v2 and up)]], [[Adobe Digital Editions]], [[Lexcycle|Lexcycle Stanza]], [[FBReader]], [[PocketBook eReader]], [[Aldiko]], the [[Mozilla Firefox]] [[Add-on (Mozilla)|add-on]] EPUBReader, [[Lucifox]], [[Okular]] and other reading apps.

Adobe Digital Editions uses .epub format for its e-books, with [[digital rights management]] (DRM) protection provided through their proprietary ADEPT mechanism. The ADEPT framework and scripts have been reverse-engineered to circumvent this DRM system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://i-u2665-cabbages.blogspot.com/2009/02/circumventing-adobe-adept-drm-for-epub.html |title=i♥cabbages: Circumventing Adobe ADEPT DRM for EPUB |publisher=I-u2665-cabbages.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eReader is a [[freeware]] program for viewing Palm Digital Media electronic books which use the pdb format used by many Palm applications. Versions are available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Palm OS]] (not webOS), [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]] Pocket PC/Smartphone, and [[macOS]]. The reader shows text one page at a time, as paper books do. eReader supports embedded hyperlinks and images. Additionally, the [[Lexcycle Stanza|Stanza]] application for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]] can read both [[encryption|encrypted]] and unencrypted eReader files.

The program supports features like bookmarks and footnotes, enabling the user to mark any page with a bookmark and any part of the text with a footnote-like commentary. Footnotes can later be exported as a Memo document.

On July 20, 2009, [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] made an announcement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/2009_july_20_ebookstore.html |title=Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers |publisher=Barnesandnobleinc.com |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2015-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182441/http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/press_releases/2009_july_20_ebookstore.html |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that eReader would be the company's preferred format to deliver e-books.

[[FictionBook]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://haali.cs.msu.ru/pocketpc/FictionBook_description.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703204958/http://haali.cs.msu.ru/pocketpc/FictionBook_description.html|date=July 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a popular [[XML]]-based e-book format, supported by free readers such as [[PocketBook eReader]], [[FBReader]], [[Okular]], [[CoolReader]], [[Bebook]] and [[STDU Viewer]].

The FictionBook format does not specify the appearance of a document; instead, it describes its structure and semantics. All the ebook metadata, such as the author name, title, and publisher, is also present in the ebook file. Hence the format is convenient for automatic processing, indexing, and ebook collection management. This also is convenient to store books in it for later automatic conversion into other formats.

[[APABI]] is a format devised by [[Founder Electronics]]. It is a popular format for Chinese e-books. It can be read using the [[Apabi Reader]] software, and produced using [[Apabi Publisher]]. Both .xeb and .ceb files are encoded binary files. The [[iLiad (E-book Reader)|Iliad]] e-book device includes an Apabi 'viewer'.

| Hypertext
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':

|}
[[HTML]] is the [[markup language]] used for most [[World Wide Web|web]] pages. E-books using HTML can be read using a [[Web browser]]. The specifications for the format are  available without charge from the [[W3C]].

HTML adds specially marked meta-elements to otherwise plain text encoded using [[character set]]s like [[ASCII]] or [[UTF-8]]. As such, suitably formatted files can be, and sometimes are, generated ''by hand'' using a ''[[text editor|plain text editor]]'' or ''[[Source code editor|programmer's editor]]''. Many ''HTML generator'' applications exist to ease this process and often require less intricate knowledge of the format details involved.

HTML on its own is not a particularly efficient format to store information in, requiring more storage space for a given work than many other formats. However, several e-Book formats including the Amazon Kindle, Open eBook, Compiled HTML,  Mobipocket and EPUB store each book chapter in HTML format, then use [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] compression to compress the HTML data, images, metadata and style sheets into a single, significantly smaller, file.

HTML files encompass a wide range of standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webstandards.org/learn/faq/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - The Web Standards Project |publisher=Webstandards.org |date=2002-02-27 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and displaying HTML files correctly can be complicated. Additionally many of the features supported, such as forms, are not relevant to e-books.

|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| iBook
|-

|}
The .ibooks format is created with the free [[iBooks Author]] ebook layout software from [[Apple Inc.]]. This proprietary format is based on the [[EPUB]] standard, with some differences in the CSS tags used in an ibooks format file, thus making it incompatible with the EPUB specification. The End-User Licensing Agreement (EULA) included with iBooks Author states that "If you want to charge a fee for a work that includes files in the .ibooks format generated using iBooks Author, you may only sell or distribute such work through Apple". The "through Apple" will typically be in the Apple [[iBooks]] store. The EULA further states that "This restriction does not apply to the content of such works when distributed in a form that does not include files in the .ibooks format." Therefore, Apple has not included distribution restrictions in the iBooks Author EULA for ibooks format ebooks created in iBooks Author that are made available for free, and it does not prevent authors from re-purposing the content in other ebook formats to be sold outside the iBookstore. This software currently supports import and export functionally for three formats. ibook, Plain text and PDF. The iBooks Author 2.3 and later supports importing EPUB and export EPUB 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204884|title=About ePubs created with iBooks Author|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEC 62448 is an international standard created by [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), Technical Committee 100, Technical Area 10 (Multimedia e-publishing and e-book).

The current version of IEC 62448 is an umbrella standard that contains as appendices two concrete formats, XMDF of Sharp and BBeB of Sony. However, BBeB has been discontinued by Sony and the version of XMDF that is in the specification is out of date. The IEC TA10 group is discussing the next steps, and has invited the IDPF organization which has standardized [[EPUB]] to be a liaison. It is possible that the current version of EPUB and/or the forthcoming EPUB3 revision may be added to IEC 62448.  Meanwhile, a number of Japanese companies have proposed that IEC standardize a proposed new Japanese-centric file format that is expected to unify DotBook of Voyager Japan and XMDF of Sharp.  This new format has not been publicly disclosed as of November 2010 but it is supposed to cover basic representations for the Japanese language.  Technically speaking, this revision is supposed to provide a Japanese minimum set, a Japanese extension set, and a stylesheet language. These issues were discussed in the TC100 meeting held  in October 2010 but no decisions were taken besides offering the liaison status to IDPF.

[[IBM]] created this e-book format and used it extensively for [[OS/2]] and other of its operating systems. The INF files were often digital versions of printed books that came with some bundles of OS/2 and other products. There were many other newsletters and monthly publications (e.g.: EDM/2) available in the INF format too.

The advantage of INF is that it is very compact and very fast. It also supports images, reflowed text, tables and various list formats. INF files get generated by compiling the markup text files — in the [[Information Presentation Facility]] (IPF) format — into binary files.

Originally only IBM created an INF viewer and compiler, but later open source viewers like NewView, DocView and others appeared. There is also an open source IPF compiler named WIPFC, created by the [[Open Watcom]] project.

With the release of the [[Kindle Fire]] reader in late 2011, [[Amazon.com]] also released [[Kindle Format 8]], also known as .AZW3. The .azw3 file format supports a subset of [[HTML5]] and [[CSS3]] features, with some additional nonstandard features; the new data is stored within a container which can also be used to store a Mobi content document, allowing limited backwards compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511|title=Kindle Format 8 Overview|publisher=Amazon.com|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musingsandmarvels.com/2012/03/06/the-new-kindle-format-8-kf8/|title=The New Kindle Format KF8|publisher=Musings and Marvels:Learning the ins and outs of the publishing industry|date=2012-03-06|accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_357613502_6?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000729901&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=right-4&amp;pf_rd_r=0GN9VRRB0NJ08VXGFKWK&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=1343256942&amp;pf_rd_i=1000729511|title=HTML5 tags supported by KF8|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] e-readers use the proprietary format, AZW. It is based on the [[Mobipocket]] standard, with a slightly different serial number scheme (it uses an [[asterisk]] instead of a [[dollar sign]]) and its own [[Digital rights management|DRM]] formatting. Because the ebooks bought on the Kindle are delivered over its wireless system called Whispernet, the user does not see the AZW files during the download process. The Kindle format is available on a variety of platforms, such as through the Kindle app for the various mobile device platforms.

DRM-protected LIT files are only readable in the proprietary [[Microsoft Reader]] program, as the .LIT format, otherwise similar to Microsoft's [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|CHM]] format, includes [[Digital Rights Management]] features. Other third party readers, such as [[Lexcycle Stanza]], can read unprotected LIT files.

The Microsoft Reader uses patented [[ClearType]] display technology. In Reader navigation works with a keyboard, mouse, stylus, or through electronic bookmarks. The Catalog Library records reader books in a personalized "home page", and books are displayed with ClearType to improve readability.  A user can add annotations and notes to any page, create large-print e-books with a single command, or create free-form drawings on the reader pages.  A built-in dictionary allows the user to look up words.

In August 2011, Microsoft announced they were discontinuing both Microsoft Reader and the use of the .lit format for ebooks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aazae.com/|title=Ebooks|work=Aazae}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of August 2012, and ending sales of the format on November 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"Microsoft is discontinuing Microsoft Reader effective August 30, 2012, which includes download access of the Microsoft Reader application from the Microsoft Reader website."[http://www.microsoft.com/reader/ Microsoft Reader] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050822035209/http://www.microsoft.com/reader/ |date=August 22, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mobipocket]] e-book format is based on the [[Open eBook]] standard using [[XHTML]] and can include [[JavaScript]] and frames. It also supports native [[SQL]] queries to be used with embedded databases. There is a corresponding e-book reader.

The [[Mobipocket]] Reader has a home page library. Readers can add blank pages in any part of a book and add free-hand drawings. Annotations – highlights, bookmarks, corrections, notes, and drawings – can be applied, organized, and recalled from a single location. Images are converted to GIF format and have a maximum size of 64K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobipocket.com/dev/article.asp?BaseFolder=creatorhome&amp;File=image.htm |title=Mobipocket Developer Center - Importing Image files |publisher=Mobipocket.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173745/http://www.mobipocket.com/dev/article.asp?BaseFolder=creatorhome&amp;File=image.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; sufficient for mobile phones with small screens, but rather restrictive for newer gadgets. [[Mobipocket]] Reader has electronic bookmarks,  and a built-in dictionary.

The reader has a full screen mode for reading and support for many [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Personal digital assistant|Communicators]], and [[Smartphone]]s. [[Mobipocket]] products support most Windows, Symbian, BlackBerry and Palm operating systems, but not the Android platform. Using WINE, the reader works under Linux or Mac OS X. Third-party applications like [[Okular]] and [[FBReader]] can also be used under Linux or Mac OS X, but they work only with unencrypted files.

The Amazon Kindle's AZW format is basically just the Mobipocket format with a slightly different serial number scheme (it uses an [[asterisk]] instead of a [[dollar sign]]), and .prc publications can be read directly on the Kindle.  The Kindle AZW format also lacks some Mobipocket features such as JavaScript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1299906&amp;postcount=2 |title=MobileRead Forums - View Single Post - Javascript in mobi ebooks? |publisher=Mobileread.com |date=2010-12-29 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[multimedia ebook]] is [[media (communication)|media]] and [[book]] [[content (media and publishing)|content]] that utilizes a combination of different book [[content format]]s. The term can be used as a noun (a medium with multiple content formats) or as an adjective describing a medium as having multiple content formats.

The "multimedia ebook" term is used in contrast to media which only utilize traditional forms of printed or text books. Multimedia ebooks include a combination of [[Written language|text]], [[Audio file format|audio]], [[image]]s, [[video]], or [[interactive]] content formats.  Much like how a traditional book can contain images to help the text tell a story, a multimedia ebook can contain other elements not formerly possible to help tell the story.

With the advent of more widespread tablet-like computers, such as the [[smartphone]], some publishing houses are planning to make multimedia ebooks, such as Penguin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-first-look-how-penguin-will-reinvent-books-with-ipad/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617170741/http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-first-look-how-penguin-will-reinvent-books-with-ipad/|date=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton Books are created using Newton Press, or, for more advanced content, Newton Book Maker and Newton Toolkit.

All systems running the Newton operating system (the most common include the Newton MessagePads, eMates, Siemens Secretary Stations, Motorola Marcos, Digital Ocean Seahorses and Tarpons) have built-in support for viewing Newton books, through a system service known as Newton Book Reader. The Newton [[package format]] was released to the public by Newton, Inc. prior to that company's absorption into Apple Computer. The format is thus arguably open and various people have written readers for it (writing a Newton book converter has even been assigned as a university-level class project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metcs.bu.edu/~feneric/cs331/Archives/Project2002/ |title= MET CS 331 Intermediate Computer Science With C++ Newton Book Parsing Project|accessdate=July 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904191234/http://metcs.bu.edu/~feneric/cs331/Archives/Project2002/ |archivedate=September 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Newton books have no support for DRM or encryption. They do support internal links, potentially multiple tables of contents and indexes, embedded gray scale images, and even some scripting capability using NewtonScript (for example, it's possible to make a book in which the reader can influence the outcome).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.unna.org/wikiwikinewt/index.php/MakeNewtonEbooksIndex |title=WikiWikiNewt Undergoing Maintenance |publisher=Tools.unna.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton books utilize [[Unicode]] and are thus available in numerous languages. An individual [[Newton Book]] may actually contain multiple views representing the same content in different ways (such as for different screen resolutions).

Invented by [[Adobe Systems]], and first released in 1993, [[PDF]] became ISO 32000 in 2008. The format was developed to provide a platform-independent means of exchanging fixed-layout documents. Derived from [[PostScript]], but without language features like loops, PDF adds support for features such as compression, passwords, semantic structures and DRM. Because PDF documents can easily be viewed and printed by users on a variety of computer [[Platform (computing)|platforms]], they are very common on the [[World Wide Web]] and in document management systems worldwide. The current PDF specification, ISO 32000-1:2008, is available from ISO's website, and under special arrangement, without charge from Adobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification &amp;#124; Adobe Developer Connection |publisher=Adobe.com |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the format is designed to reproduce fixed-layout pages, re-flowing text to fit mobile device and e-book reader screens has traditionally been problematic. This limitation was addressed in 2001 with the release of PDF Reference 1.5 and "Tagged PDF",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067|title=What is Tagged PDF?|publisher=Planet PDF|date=|accessdate=2015-08-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118104752/http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067|archivedate=2016-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but 3rd party support for this feature was limited until the release of [[PDF/UA]] in 2012.

Many products support creating and reading PDF files, such as Adobe Acrobat, [[PDFCreator]] and [[OpenOffice.org]], and several programming libraries such as [[iText]] and [[Formatting Objects Processor|FOP]]. Third party viewers such as [[xpdf]] and [[Nitro PDF]] are also available. Mac OS X has built-in PDF support, both for creation as part of the printing system and for display using the built-in Preview application.

PDF files are supported by almost all modern e-book readers, tablets and smartphones. However, PDF reflow based on Tagged PDF, as opposed to re-flow based on the actual sequence of objects in the content-stream, is not yet commonly supported on mobile devices. Such Re-flow options as may exist are usually found under "view" options, and may be called "word-wrap".

The first e-books in history were in [[text file|plain text]] (.txt) format, supplied for free by the [[Project Gutenberg]] community, but the format itself existed before the e-book era. The plain text format doesn't support digital rights management (DRM) or formatting options (such as different fonts, graphics or colors), but it has excellent portability as it is the simplest e-book encoding possible as a plain text file contains only [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]] text (text files with [[UTF-8]] or [[UTF-16]] encoding are also popular for languages other than English). Almost all operating systems can read ASCII text files (e.g. Unix, Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, DOS and other systems) and newer operating systems support Unicode text files as well. The only potential for portability problems of ASCII text files is that operating systems differ in their preferred line ending convention and their interpretation of values outside the ASCII range (their character encoding). Conversion of files from one to another line-ending convention is easy with free software. DOS and Windows uses CRLF, Unix and Apple's OS X use LF, Mac OS up to and including OS 9 uses CR. By convention, lines are often broken to fit into 80 characters, a legacy of older terminals and consoles. Alternately, each paragraph may be a single line.

When Unicode is not in use, the size in bytes of a text file is simply the number of characters, including spaces, and with a new line counting for 1 or 2. For example, the [[Bible]], which is approximately 800,000 words, is about 4 MB.&lt;ref name="bible"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205071232/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10 |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many office printers directly support interpreting PostScript and printing the result. As a result, the format also sees wide use in the [[Unix]] world.&lt;!-- IE if you don't want to fool around with output filters, ghostscript, and whatnot, get a postscript printer.

[[Rich Text Format]] is a [[document]] file format that is supported by many ebook readers. Its advantages as an ebook format is that it is widely supported, and it can be reflowed. It can be easily edited. It can be easily converted to other ebook formats, increasing its support.

The digital book format used by a popular digital library company 超星数字图书馆&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssreader.com/downland_index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070119091551/http://www.ssreader.com/downland_index.asp |archivedate=2007-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in China.  It is a proprietary raster image compression and binding format, with reading time OCR plug-in modules.  The company scanned a huge number of Chinese books in the China National Library and this becomes the major stock of their service.  The detailed format is not published.  There are also some other commercial e-book formats used in Chinese digital libraries.

The [[TomeRaider]] e-book format is a proprietary format. There are versions of [[TomeRaider]] for Windows, Windows Mobile (aka Pocket PC), Palm, Symbian and iPhone. Several Wikipedias are available as [[Wikipedia:TomeRaider database|TomeRaider files]] with all articles unabridged, some even with nearly all images. Capabilities of the TomeRaider3 e-book reader vary considerably per platform: the Windows and Windows Mobile editions support full [[HTML]] and [[CSS]]. The Palm edition supports limited HTML (e.g., no tables, no fonts), and CSS support is missing. For Symbian there is only the older TomeRaider2  format, which does not render images or offer category search facilities. Despite these differences any TomeRaider e-book can be browsed on all supported platforms.  The Tomeraider website&lt;ref name="tomeraider.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomeraider.com/ |title=tomeraider.com |publisher=tomeraider.com |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have over 4000 e-books available, including free versions of the [[Internet Movie Database]] and Wikipedia.

'''Open XML Paper Specification''' (also referred to as '''OpenXPS''') is an open [[specification]] for a [[page description language]] and a fixed-document format. [[Microsoft]] developed it as the XML Paper Specification (XPS). In June 2009, [[Ecma International]] adopted it as international standard '''ECMA-388'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-388.htm |title=Standard ECMA-388 |publisher=Ecma-international.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format is intentionally restricted to sequences of:
Glyphs (a fixed run of text),
Paths (a geometry that can be filled, or stroked, by a brush), and
Brushes (a description of a shaped brush used to in rendering paths).

This reduces the possibility of inadvertent introduction of malicious content and simplifies the implementation of compatible renderers.

==Defunct retailers==

'''Cubital index''' is the ratio of two of the wing vein segments of [[honeybee]]s.  The cubital index is used in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], the study of form and structure, one way to differentiate species and sub species of living organisms.  The pattern of the veins of the fore wings is specific for each breed of bees.  The cubital index is consistent for a given race of bee.  It can be used to distinguish between similar populations of honeybees and to determine degrees of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  
[[File:Cubitalindex.svg|thumb|Cubital index]] 

==Procedure==
To obtain reliable average results, at least 100 bee fore wings have to be analyzed.  Measurements are taken under a dissecting [[microscope]] with a magnification of 10x to 20x.

The '''Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence''' or the '''Washington Declaration''' ({{lang-cs|Washingtonská deklarace}}; {{lang-sk|Washingtonská deklarácia}}) was drafted in [[Washington, D.C.]] and published by [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Paris]]-based Provisional Government on 18 October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|coauthors=  |title= Declaration of Independence of the Czechslovak Nation By Its Provisional Government |publisher=  |location= New York |date=18 October 1918|url= https://archive.org/details/declarationofind00czec}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the document, officially the '''Declaration of Independence of the Czechoslovak Nation by Its Provisional Government''' ({{lang-cs|Prohlášení nezávislosti československého národa zatímní vládou československou}}), was prompted by the imminent collapse of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], of which the [[Czech lands|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak lands]] had been part for almost 400 years, following the First World War.

==Background==
{{see also|Origins of Czechoslovakia}}
In the autumn of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was collapsing.  As one of his [[Fourteen Points]], [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the nationalities of the empire have the "freest opportunity to autonomous development".  On 14 October 1918, Foreign Minister [[István Burián|Baron István Burián von Rajecz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum/en/bal/Ministry/minister/foreign_ministers.htm |title=Hungarian foreign ministers from 1848 to our days |publisher=Mfa.gov.hu |date= |accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] issued a proclamation two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy.  The [[Cisleithania|Imperial Austria]] was to be transformed into a federal union composed of four parts—German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian (Galicia would be allowed to secede).  Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with [[Vienna]], and [[Trieste]] was to receive a special status.{{cn|date=October 2018}} 

However, on that same day, a Czecho-Slovak provisional government joined the Allies.  This provisional government had begun drafting a Declaration of Independence on 13 October and completed its task on 16 October.  The document was drafted by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] and American sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence: A History of the Document|location=Washington, D.C.|date=1985|first=G.J.|last=Kovtun|pages=46–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Borglum hosted future soldiers of a Czecho-Slovak army on his farm in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Francis Sherwood. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ij1aAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA406#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A New Declaration of Independence".] ''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]''. '''120''' (September–December 1918). p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;)  On 17 October, Masaryk presented it to the U.S. government and the president.  It was published in Paris 18 October 1918 with authorship attributed to Masaryk.{{cn|date=October 2018}} 

On the same day, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks, and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities&amp;nbsp;– the tenth of the Fourteen Points&amp;nbsp;– was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points any more.  The Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria-Hungary.{{cn|date=October 2018}}  The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries.  With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] on 24 October, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in [[Prague]] on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czecho-Slovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days.{{cn|date=October 2018}} On 30 October, the Slovaks followed with the [[Martin Declaration]] and the Austro-Hungarian state was dissolved the next day.&lt;ref name="Frucht2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mametey|first=Victor S.|editor=Frucht, Richard C.|title=Encyclopedia of Eastern Europe: From the Congress of Vienna to the Fall of Communism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wiKQgAACAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Garland Pub.|isbn=978-0-8153-0092-2|page=483|chapter=Martin Declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The declaration==
Much of the declaration catalogues a litany of grievances against the Habsburgs.  In the latter portion of the document declares a Czecho-Slovak Republic with freedom of religion, speech, the press and the right of assembly and petition, separation of church from the state, universal suffrage, and equal rights for women.  The declaration calls for a parliamentary political system with respect for rights of national minorities shall use equal rights.  Social, economic, and land reform is announced along with the cancellation of aristocratic privileges.  The declaration uses the term "Czechoslovak nation" ''(národ československý)'', which deviates from formulations [[Cleveland Agreement|Cleveland]] and [[Pittsburgh Agreement]]s, which defined two separate Czech and Slovak nations.  The declaration is signed Masaryk (as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance), [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] (as Minister of National Defense) and [[Edvard Beneš]] (as Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Interior).

'''Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS)''' is a standard used for describing materials in an [[archive]]. First adopted by the [[Society of American Archivists]] (SAA) in March 2004, DACS was updated with a Second Edition in 2013. DACS is broken down into a set of rules used in crafting archival descriptions, and guidelines for creating [[Authority control#Authority%20records%20and%20files|authority records]] in archives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs/describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs-second-|title=Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS), Second Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-16|ol-access=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
When fully adopted in 2005, DACS replaced [[Archives, Personal Papers, and Manuscripts]], the previous SAA archival cataloging standard.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/preface|title=Preface|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|publisher=Society of American Archivists|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the Second Edition, it consists of two parts: Part I, Describing Archival Materials, and Part II, Archival Authority Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS|title=Describing Archives: A Content Standard, Second Edition (DACS)|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|publisher=Society of American Archivists|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; DACS is mostly concerned with providing a framework for creating an [[Collection catalog|archival catalog]] through description and authority records, and is closely related to both the library-focused cataloging rules of [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA) and the international description standards formed by [[ISAD(G)]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The main goal of archival description is to assist users in finding the documents they are looking for through the creation of access tools such as catalogs or [[Finding aid|finding aids]], and DACS exists to provide a standard for creating those tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/overview_of_archival_description|title=Overview of Archival Description|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|publisher=Society of American Archivists|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; DACS has now been widely adopted by the archival community throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="Whittaker"&gt;Whittaker, B. M. (2007). DACS and RDA: Insights and Questions from the New Archival Descriptive Standard. ''Library Resources &amp; Technical Services'', 51(2), 98-105&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently maintained by the SAA's Technical Subcommittee on Describing Archives: A Content Standard and the most up-to-date version is hosted on their [https://github.com/saa-ts-dacs/dacs GitHub]. 

== Principles of DACS ==
Use of DACS is guided by a set of 8 principles, which serve to elucidate why archival description is separate from library description and to give guidance in applying DACS. They are as follows:

# "Records in archives possess unique characteristics.
# "The principle of [[respect des fonds]] is the basis of archival arrangement and description.
# "Arrangement involves the identification of groupings within the material.
# "Description reflects arrangement.
# "The rules of description apply to all archival materials, regardless of form or medium.
# "The principles of archival description apply equally to records created by corporate bodies, individuals, or families.
# "Archival descriptions may be presented at varying levels of detail to produce a variety of outputs.
# "The creators of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/statement_of_principles|title=Statement of Principles|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|publisher=Society of American Archivists|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part I Describing Archival Materials ==
The first part of DACS deals with rules for crafting archival description. It can be broken down into levels of description, with each level adding a layer of complexity. DACS discretely describes these levels as ''Single Level Required'', ''Single Level Optimum'', ''Single Level Added Value'', ''Multilevel Required'', ''Multilevel Optimum'', and ''Multilevel Added Value''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_I/chapter_1|title=Chapter 1 Levels of Description|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|publisher=Society of American Archivists|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every level requires that the DACS [[metadata]] elements from the previous levels are complete, and that the relationship between the current level and previous levels are clearly presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922581516|title=Metadata standards and web services in libraries, archives, and museums : an active learning resource|last=Mitchell|first=Erik T.|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC|year=2015|isbn=9781610694506|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=81|oclc=922581516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of Part I defines the metadata elements required for each level of description. 

== Part II Archival Authority Records ==
The second part of DACS is concerned with creating records that establish the context in which an archival material was created, appraised, and included in an archive. There are three steps in creating these authority records: identifying the people or organizations involved in creating the record, assembling biographical data relating to those creators, and applying a standard such as Resource Description and Access to the names so that the names can be easily referenced between institutions. These authority records can then either be incorporated into metadata of an archival records or separate authority records can be created, which are then linked with the archival materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/part_II/introduction_to_archival_authority_records|title=Introduction to Archival Authority Records|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|publisher=Society of American Archivists|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to Other Standards ==
While the first edition expanded on the basic rules for describing archival material that are found in chapter 4 of the deprecated library cataloging standard, [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]] (AACR2), the second edition of DACS more closely relates to AACR2's successor, Resource Description and Access (RDA).&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/preface|title=Preface|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.archivists.org|publisher=Society of American Archivists|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittaker2"&gt;Whittaker, B. M. (2007). DACS and RDA: Insights and Questions from the New Archival Descriptive Standard. ''Library Resources &amp; Technical Services'', 51(2), 98-105&lt;/ref&gt; DACS serves as the US implementation of international archival descriptive standards such as ISAD(G) and the [[International Standard Archival Authority Record]]. It also provides [[Schema crosswalk|crosswalks]] from DACS to [[MARC standards|MARC]], [[Encoded Archival Description]] (EAD), RDA, and [[Encoded Archival Context]] (EAC-CPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/standards/DACS/appendices/appendix_c_crosswalks|title=Appendix C Crosswalks|last=|first=|date=March 2015|website=|publisher=Society of American Archivists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; DACS specifies only the type of content, not the structural or encoding requirements or the actual verbiage to be used; it is therefore suitable for use in conjunction with structural and encoding standards, such as MARC and EAD, and with [[controlled vocabularies]] such as [[Medical Subject Headings]], [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]], [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]], and so on.

'''Richard Beyer''' (born July 11, 1930)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/13590/ Observer Radio, Interview with Dick Beyer, June 2, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American retired [[professional wrestler]] who is best known by his ring names, '''The Destroyer''' or '''Doctor X'''. Beyer has worked extensively in Japan and in 2017 he was awarded one of the country's highest honors, the [[Order of the Rising Sun]].
 
==Early life==
As an athlete at [[Syracuse University]], Beyer was a member of the [[varsity team|varsity]] [[American football|football]] and [[amateur wrestling|wrestling]] teams. He played in the 1953 [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for Syracuse. Beyer graduated with a [[Masters Degree]] in [[education]] and is a member of the Fraternity of [[Phi Gamma Delta]]'s Syracuse Chapter. Beyer is also an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Beyer was a teacher in New York until he began his wrestling career, and he also coached swimming.
 
==Professional wrestling career==

===Worldwide Wrestling Associates===
Beyer began as a "babyface" wrestler in the mid-1950s. His career as a "masked" wrestler, The Destroyer, began in 1962 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. He used the "[[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure-four]]-leg-lock" on his way to the [[Worldwide Wrestling Associates]] (WWA) championship on July 27, 1962 in a win over [[Freddie Blassie]], who convinced him that the mask gimmick would give him a large "push". Beyer went on to defend the WWA title for 10 months.
 
In early 1963, Beyer wrestled three sold-out matches against [[Shohei Baba|Shohei "Giant" Baba]] at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium|Olympic Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. In May 1963, Beyer traveled to Japan for the first time, to wrestle with [[Rikidōzan]], in a match watched by 70 million TV viewers. In June 1964, Beyer returned to Los Angeles and beat [[Dick the Bruiser]] for another WWA title. Beyer lost the title to Bob Ellis in September, won it back in November, and then lost it for the last time in March 1965 to [[Pedro Morales]].
 
===American Wrestling Association===
Between 1966 and 1972, Beyer wrestled as Doctor X while in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], although he was known as "The Destroyer" elsewhere. During his time as Doctor X, Beyer had matches with many of the top names in the business including his real life brother-in-law [[Billy Red Lyons]]. In fact, it was Lyons who handed "X" his first [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) defeat on Minneapolis television when he defeated the good Doctor with a figure four leg lock. In August 1970, "X" removed his own mask to get a chance at revenge against his former partner Black Jack Lanza. He stood in center ring with announcer Marty O'Neill, who told the fans that "X" was a former coach from Syracuse University. "X" then removed his mask, handed it to St. Paul promoter Eddie Williams, and wrestled the match as Dick Beyer.
 
In other AWA cities, he was actually unmasked by both Lanza and Paul Diamond. In these matches, his name was revealed to be Bruce Marshall. The reason for Beyer wanting to be unmasked was that, he and his family were set to go on a world tour, where he would also wrestle again as The Destroyer. It has been speculated that by late August 1970, Beyer had already left the AWA and that it was "jobber" Bobby Jones under the mask. When Beyer removed his own mask on the August 8, 1970 card in St. Paul. During 1972, Beyer had several battles with [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|"Crippler" Ray Stevens]]. Their last match resulted in Beyer as Doctor X having his leg "broken." This "injury" allowed Beyer to leave the Minneapolis area to join a wrestling tour in Japan.
 
===Japan and Canada===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2017}}
From 1973, Beyer wrestled in Japan for six straight years, in a deal with Giant Baba and [[Nippon Television|NTV]] of [[Tokyo]]. During his tenure in Japan, he had a feud with [[Mil Máscaras]] which resulted in a series of seven matches. Beyer also helped promote [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) for Giant Baba and established himself as a [[Gaijin tarento|television personality]] in a late-night TV show called ''Uwasa No Channel''. Beyer held the PWF United States Championship until 1979, when he left AJPW and the championship was abandoned.

==Post-wrestling==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}
Beyer went into semi-retirement in 1984. From 1984-95, Beyer taught [[physical education]] in the [[Akron, New York|Akron, New York Central School District]], where he also coached football, wrestling and swimming. Beyer now lives in [[Akron, New York]]. He serves on the Board of Directors of the [[Cauliflower Alley Club]], which holds annual reunions in Las Vegas. He is a member of [[Toastmasters International]], a public speaking club, and carries the club designation of Certified Toastmaster. He Inducted Gorgeous George into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 27, 2010.

On August 27, 2011, Beyer, along with his son, returned to Japan to take part in [[All Together (professional wrestling)|All Together]], a charity event held together by AJPW, [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]]. Beyer, appearing under his Destroyer mask, hosted the Destroyer Cup and presented a trophy to its winner, [[Kentaro Shiga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result_game.php?e=276&amp;c=3266|title=東日本大震災復興支援チャリティープロレス　''All Together''|accessdate=2013-09-10|work=[[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Beyer opened Destroyer Park Golf in Akron; the first [[Park golf]] course in the United States.

On November 4, 2017, it was announced that Beyer would be awarded the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], Gold and Silver Rays, by the Japanese government for "a lifetime spent promoting goodwill and bi-cultural exchanges between Japan and the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/news.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171106192254/http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/news.html|title=Slam!

The '''Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library''' (est. 2010) is a series of books published by [[Harvard University Press]] in collaboration with the [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection]]. It presents editions of texts originally written in [[medieval Latin]], [[Byzantine Greek]], and [[Old English]], with facing-page translations into modern English. The aim is to make such texts accessible to English-speaking scholars and general readers.

The general editor of the series is [[Jan M. Ziolkowski]]. The language editors are [[Daniel Donoghue]] (Old English), [[Danuta Shanzer]] (Medieval Latin), and [[Alice-Mary Talbot]] (Byzantine Greek).

The series is a sister of three others published by Harvard University Press: [[Loeb Classical Library]], [[I Tatti Renaissance Library]], and [[Murty Classical Library of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Kirsch, [http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/01/mysteries-and-masterpieces Mysteries and Masterpieces: The latest stage in the "American conquest of the Middle Ages"], ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', Jan.-Feb. 2012.

==History==
In the fall of 1967, [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]] instituted a "choice" system, whereby students at all-white Tupelo High School and all-black [[Carver High School (Tupelo, Missisippi)|Carver High School]] were given the opportunity to choose which school to attend. While no white students chose Carver, Dowsing was one of five African-American students who chose to attend Tupelo High School, and was the first to play football. Unlike school integration in many other areas of Mississippi and the South, this was a peaceful event. Because of a broken jaw, which had been wired shut, Dowsing was unable to speak or practice football at the beginning of school. His first action was for the B team, where he scored a touchdown on the opening play. Dowsing earned all conference honors in football, basketball, and track, and graduated sixth in his class. He also set a state record by running the [[100 yard dash]] in 9.5 seconds.&lt;ref name="Slimantics"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Slim |title=Slimantics: A shameful omission |url=http://www.cdispatch.com/opinions/article.asp?aid=60406 |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to recruitment efforts by former Tupelo resident and future Mississippi State basketball coach Kermit Davis, he enrolled at Mississippi State, where he was also the first black football player. At MSU, Dowsing was an all-American as a defensive back, an academic all-American, and was elected Mr. Mississippi State by his fellow students. This was the first time a black student had won any sort of election at the school. Just before graduation, he married LaFawn Gilliam in the Chapel of Memories at Mississippi State.

Upon graduation, Dowsing was drafted by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], but instead chose to fulfill a lifelong dream by attended medical school at the [[Mississippi University School of Medicine]]. Within two years of their marriage, Dowsing was divorced, and dropped out of medical school in his third year. This was probably largely due to a secret: Dowsing was gay.&lt;ref name="sfGate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Guthmann |first1=Edward |title=A 'sissy' tells it straight / He was orphaned, he was molested, he was shunned for being gay.

In 2010, Dowsing was inducted into the Mississippi Hall of fame, where he was nicknamed "The Jackie Robinson of Mississippi".&lt;ref name="MSHOF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frank Dedric Dowsing, Jr. |url=https://msfame.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/frank-dedric-dowsing-jr/ |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Mississippi State dedicated a plaza at the football stadium to Dowsing.&lt;ref name="Dowsing-Bell"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mississippi State dedicates Dowsing-Bell Plaza |url=http://www.djournal.com/sports/mississippi-state-dedicates-dowsing-bell-plaza/article_a411b2a5-8576-5e36-9b82-47b228198ae1.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''George Gustav Heye Center''' is a branch of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.com/museums/national.museum.of.the.american.indian.html | title=National Museum of the American Indian | publisher=NY.com | accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  The Center features contemporary and historical exhibits of art and artifacts by and about [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

==History==
The center is named for [[George Gustav Heye]], who began collecting Native American artifacts in 1903. He founded and endowed the Museum of the American Indian in 1916, and it opened in 1922, in a building at 155th Street and Broadway, part of the [[Audubon Terrace]] complex, in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan| Washington Heights]] neighborhood of [[upper Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Thomas (April 13, 1988). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/13/nyregion/a-cramped-museum-filled-with-indian-history.html A Cramped Museum Filled With Indian History]". ''New York Times''. nytimes.com. Retrieved November 3, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; That museum closed in 1994 and part of the collection is now housed at the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in [[Lower Manhattan]].  The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts-style]] building, designed by architect [[Cass Gilbert]], was completed in 1907. It is a designated National Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark.  The center’s exhibition and public access areas total about {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}}. The Heye Center offers a range of exhibitions, film and video screenings, school group programs and living culture presentations throughout the year.

==Galleries==
The permanent collection of the Heye Center is called Infinity of Nations, and is designed to show the scope of the Smithsonian's collection. Organized by geographic regions (including Central and South America), the exhibit displays over 700 items and crosses the line from ethnology to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/arts/design/06infinity.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;src=twrhp&amp;adxnnlx=1337801080-pTQulrUTWUPRUkAapqykaA | title=Grace and Culture Intertwined | publisher=New York Times | date=November 5, 2010 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Cotter, Holland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nmai.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/item/?id=901 | title=Infinity of Nations | publisher= National Museum of the American Indian | accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multimedia interactions include audio and video, and feature commentary by historians on specific objects. The rotunda is frequently used as a performance space, and features murals reflecting the history of the building, done by [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]]. Other galleries include the Photography Gallery, Special Exhibit Galleries, Contemporary Galleries, the Haudenosaunee Discovery Room, the Resource Center Reference Library, a small theater (which screens daily films), and the museum store. The ground floor of the building houses the Diker Pavilion for Native Arts and Culture and the Education Center (referred to as the Tipi Room).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8599">'''''Global Feminisms''''' is a [[feminist art]] exhibition that originally premiered at the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[New York City]], [[United States]], in March 2007.&lt;ref name=bmexhib&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/global_feminisms|website=brooklynmuseum.org|title=Brooklyn Museum: Global Feminisms|accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Global Feminisms'' is the first international exhibition exclusively dedicated to [[feminist art]] from 1990 to present. The [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] is co-curated by Maura Reilly and [[Linda Nochlin]] and consists of work by 88 women artists from around the world.&lt;ref name=bmexhib/&gt; ''Global Feminisms'' showcases work in all [[Art media|media]] forms, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]], [[film]], [[Video art|video]], [[Installation art|installation]], and [[Performance art|performance]], with a focus on contemporary feminist art from a global perspective, and moving beyond the Western brand of [[feminism]], which has become the dominant representation of feminism and feminist art since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=maura&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maurareilly.com/exhibitions/2007globalfeminisms.html|author=Ethan Daniel Miller|website=maurareilly.com|title=2007 Global Feminisms|accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brooklyn Museum==
The [[Brooklyn Museum]], located in [[Brooklyn, New York]], has a mission to create inspiring encounters with art that expand knowledge of ourselves, the world and its possibilities.&lt;ref name=bmexhib/&gt; The Brooklyn Museum holds itself to the highest standards of curatorial excellence, striving to create and present inspiring engagement with collections, while welcoming all visitors.&lt;ref name=eascfa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about|website=brooklynmuseum.org|title=Brooklyn Museum: About|accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through action and impact, The Brooklyn Museum celebrates cultural vibrancy and helps build meaningful relationships.&lt;ref name=eascfa/&gt; As an institution, they seek to create an environment that values experimentation and risk, trying new things, and adapting strategies through challenges and learning.&lt;ref name=eascfa/&gt; The Brooklyn Museum is one of the oldest and largest art museums in the United States with roots extending back to 1823,&lt;ref name=eascfa/&gt;

==Artists involved==
''Global Feminisms'' features the work of significant artists, including [[Pipilotti Rist]], [[Catherine Opie]], [[Patricia Piccinini]], [[Lida Abdul]], [[Hiroki Okuda]], [[Ingrid Mwangi]], [[Tanja Ostojić]], [[Miwa Yanagi]], [[Pilar Albarracín]], [[Tracey Rose]], [[Lin Tianmiao]], [[Milica Tomić]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Latifa Echakhch]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Dayanita Singh]], [[Regina José Galindo]], [[Tania Bruguera]], [[Parastou Forouhar]], [[Skowmon Hastanan]], [[Ghada Amer]], [[Yin Xiuzhen]], [[Michèle Magema]], [[Angela de la Cruz]], [[Tracey Emin]], among others. In addition to these feminist artists, the exhibition includes a catalogue with essays by Maura Reilly, [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Geeta Kapur]], [[Virginia Pérez-Ratton]], [[Élisabeth Lebovici]], [[Joan Kee]], Charlotta Kotik, and N'Goné Fall.

==Style and work==
''Global Feminisms'' showcases multiple forms of artworks. The show consists of work in a variety of media forms, such as painting, sculpture, photography, film, video, installation and performance. Artworks include [[Ryoko Suzuki]] (Japanese, b. 1970) ''Bind'', 2001, [[Boryana Rossa]] (Bulgarian, b. 1972) ''Celebrating the Next Twinkling'', 1999, [[Ingrid Mwangi]] (Kenyan, b. 1975) ''Static Drift'', 2001, [[Tania Bruguera]] (Cuban, b. 1968) ''Statistic (Estadistica)'', 1996, among many others.&lt;ref name=bmexhib/&gt;

==The Sackler Center for Feminist Art==
The [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] is an exhibition and education environment within the Brooklyn Museum dedicated to presenting past, present and future forms of feminist art.&lt;ref name=eascfa/&gt; The center's mission is to bring awareness to feminism and its cultural contributions, as well as educating new generations about feminist art, and to maintain a dynamic learning environment.&lt;ref name=eascfa/&gt; The center is 8,300 square feet in size and encompasses a gallery devoted to the permanent installment of ''The Dinner Party'' by [[Judy Chicago]]. The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art was established through the Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation.&lt;ref name=eascfa/&gt;

==Themes==
The ''Global Feminisms'' exhibition is arranged by theme. The question that surrounds the exhibition is 'what is feminist art?'. There are a number of definitions of feminist art, therefore, there are several themes throughout the exhibition. The exhibition is displayed in a space that is anchored by the permanent installation of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''Dinner Party'', consisting of multiple dinner place settings that resemble female genitalia representative of historical female figures.&lt;ref name=maura/&gt; Themes within the exhibition include, openness, multiculturalism, variety, and gender inequality.&lt;ref name=maura/&gt; ''Global Feminisms'' explores feminist issues among women across and within different cultures, races, classes, religions, and sexualities.&lt;ref name=maura/&gt; Themes within these larger overarching thematic patterns include hysteria, death, pain, old age, war, sex, and motherhood.&lt;ref name=maura/&gt; The installation at the Brooklyn Museum does not follow a linear chronology, but is organized by four categories which the works overlap: life cycles, identities, politics, and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schjeldahl|first1=Peter|title=Women's Work: Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/04/09/womens-work-3.|journal=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life cycles consists of the stages of life from birth to death. Identities investigates the notions of the self, including racial, gender, political, and religious identities. Politics explores the world through women artists who have demonstrated that the political is personal. Emotions presents the conventional idea of women as emotional creatures and victims.

==Reviews and critiques==
Discussion in front of feminist artworks within the exhibition revealed that most individuals would not identify the critique being made by the artist, but when given further information about the context of the artwork and the artist's intentions, viewers agree with the artists' points, but refused to identify with them.&lt;ref name=ehrlich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Cheri Eileen|date=2011|title=Adolescent girls' responses to feminist artworks in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum|journal=Project Muse|volume=2|issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most viewers would reveal that the work reminded them of someone that they knew, revealing the prominence of feminism and gender issues within society.&lt;ref name=ehrlich/&gt; In a written survey conducted after viewing feminist artworks at the Brooklyn Museum, participant responses revealed that participants had a new awareness of feminism.&lt;ref name=ehrlich/&gt; Furthermore, the process of reviewing meaningful artworks leads to personal transformations by means of education. In addition, there are many critiques of the use of the word 'global' in the title of the exhibition (''Global Feminisms''). It is said that ''Global Feminisms'' jumps back and forth between the success platforms of the marketplace and the institutional stage.&lt;ref name=hoban&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=We're finally infiltrating|url=http://www.artnews.com/2007/02/01/were-finally-infiltrating/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been critiqued that most of the work within the exhibition is body-oriented and familiar to the point of old-fashioned.&lt;ref name=hoban/&gt; Many works from the 1960s and earlier consisted of the female body, but because of the age of the artwork were not considered for the exhibition. Instead, newer artworks also featuring the female body were displayed. Despite this, feminism is not a style, but a philosophy and a political instrument. It is not an aesthetic value as most categories of art, such as pop art, minimalism, or conceptual art are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maura|first1=Reilly|date=2010|title=Curating transnational feminisms|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=1|issue=36|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">The '''''Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam''''' ({{lang-ar|حدود العالم}} "Boundaries of the World" or "Limits of the World") is a 10th-century geography book written in [[Persian language|Persian]] by an unknown author from [[Jowzjan Province|Jowzjan]].&lt;ref name="CEB"&gt;[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C. E. Bosworth]] in: [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]. New Edition, s.v. ḤUDŪD AL-ʿĀLAM&lt;/ref&gt; The title in full is {{lang|ar|حدود العالم من المشرق الی المغرب}} (''Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam min al-Mashriq ilá l-Maghrib'', "The Boundaries of The World from The East to the West").

In English, the title is also translated as "The Regions of the World" following [[Vladimir Minorsky]]'s 1937 translation, in which he commented on the title as follows: "The word [[Hudud|ḥudūd]] (properly 'boundaries') in our case evidently refers to the 'regions within definite boundaries' into which the world is divided in the Ḥ.-'Ā., the author indicating with special care the frontiers of each one of these areas, v.i., p. 30. [As I use the word "region" mostly for ''nāḥiyat'' it would have been better, perhaps, to translate ''Ḥudūd al-Ālam'' as "The limited areas of the World".]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/hudud/hud_transl_preface.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

Finished in 982 CE, it was dedicated to [[Abu'l Haret Muhammad]], the ruler of the [[Farighunids]]. Its author is unknown, but Vladimir Minorsky has surmised that it might have been written by the enigmatic Šaʿyā bin Farīghūn, author of a pioneer encyclopedia of the sciences, the ''Jawāmeʿ al-ʿUlum'', for an [[Emir|amir]] of Čaghāniān on the upper [[Amu Darya]] in the mid-10th century.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{iranica|hodud-al-alam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available text of ''Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam'' is part of a larger manuscript which contains other works: 

#A copy of the ''Jahān-Nāma'' ("Book of The World") by Muḥammad ibn Najīb Bakrān
#A short passage about music
#The ''Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam''
#The ''Jāmiʿ al-ʿUlūm'' ("Collection of Knowledge") by [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]];

The ''Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam'' contains information about the known world. The anonymous author reports about different countries (''nāḥiyat''), people, languages, clothing, food, religion, local products, towns and cities, rivers, seas, lakes, islands, the steppe, deserts, topography, politics and dynasties, as well as trade. The inhabited world is divided in Asia, Europe and "[[Ancient Libya|Libya]]" (i.e. the [[Maghreb]]). The author counts a total of 45 different countries north of the equator. 

The author never visited those countries personally, but rather compiled the book from earlier works and tales. He did not indicate his sources, but researchers deduced some, for example [[Estakhri]] ''Book of the Paths and Provinces'' ({{lang-ar|كتاب المسالك والممالك}}),&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Taeschner in [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]. New Edition, s.v. Djughrāfīya&lt;/ref&gt; or the works of [[Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani]] and [[Ibn Khordadbeh]].

Among other things, Hudud al-Alam appears to mention [[Rus' Khaganate]]; it refers to the Rus' king as "Khāqān-i Rus".&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The unknown author is believed to have relied on several 9th-century sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Minorsky xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery and translation==

The [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] Russian scholar [[Alexander Tumansky]] found a manuscript with a copy of this text in 1892 in Bukhara. The copy from the original was made by the Persian chronographer Abu l-Mu'ayyad ʿAbd al-Qayyūm ibn al-Ḥusain ibn 'Alī al-Farīsī in 1258.&lt;ref name="CEB" /&gt; The facsimile edition with introduction and index was published by [[Vasily Bartold]] in 1930; a thoroughly commented English translation was made by Vladmir Minorsky in 1937, and a printed Persian text by Manouchehr Sotudeh in 1962&lt;ref&gt; The Hejri-ye Shamsi date on the title page of Sotudeh's edition reads in Persian "esfand-mah 1340"; on the 4. cover page, which is in English, the year "1962" is written.&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Importance==

The sections of its geographical treatise which describes the margins of Islamic world, are of the greatest historical importance. The work also includes important early descriptions of the [[Turkic peoples]] in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Maqbul Ahmad in: C. E. Bosworth and M. S. Asimov (Hrsg.): History of Civilizations of Central Asia. Vol. IV, Part II, Paris 1992, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Also noteworthy is the archaic language and style of the ''Ḥudud'', which makes it a valuable linguistic document as well.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3257">[[File:BletchleyPark Hut4 01.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Hut 4, sited adjacent to the mansion, was used during wartime for naval intelligence. Today, it has been refurbished as a bar and restaurant for the museum]]
'''Hut 4''' was a wartime section of the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]] tasked with the translation, interpretation and distribution of ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (German navy) messages deciphered by [[Hut 8]]. The messages were largely encrypted by [[Enigma machine]]s. As the Kriegsmarine operated Enigma more securely, Hut 8 had less information for [[Ultra]] than [[Hut 6]] which handled Army and Air Force messages. Hut 4 also broke various hand cyphers and some Italian naval traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (2011) p 67&lt;/ref&gt;
  
== Location ==
Located initially in one of the original single-story wooden huts, the name "Hut 4" was retained when the section moved to a new brick building, Block A, in 1941.

== Operation ==
Naval Ultra was handled differently from Army and Air Force Ultra because the Admiralty was an operational HQ and could give orders during a battle; while the Imperial General Staff (Army) and Air Staff would give directives to theatre commanders general orders say to "clear the enemy out of Africa" with discretion over how to do it. Verbatim translations of naval decodes were sent to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC) in London and nowhere else (except for some naval intelligence sent directly from Bletchley to Commanders-in-Chief in the Mediterranean).&lt;ref&gt;Calvacoressi (1980) pp. 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the "dockyard cipher". This sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut 8 provided excellent ''[[Known-plaintext attack|cribs]]'' for breaking the current naval Enigma key.

'''Johann von Posilge''' (c. 1340 – 1405) was a parish priest of Deutsch Eylau ([[Iława]]) and later assistant to [[Bishop of Pomesania]].&lt;ref name=garl/&gt; He is better known as the author of ''Chronik des Landes Preussen'', a chronicle detailing events in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] from around 1360. It is one of the most important sources on the history of the [[Teutonic Knights]] for the period. After his death, the chronicle was translated from Latin to German continued to 1420.&lt;ref name=garl/&gt; Posilge was not a German, but a native [[Old Prussians|Prussian]], born in the village of Posilge ([[Żuławka Sztumska]]), east of Marienburg ([[Malbork]]). As such, he was more critical of the Knights and deviated from traditional overly [[panegyric]] chronicles of the time.&lt;ref name=fried/&gt;

[[File:LD6050.jpg|thumb|Label dispenser LD6050 from START International]]
'''Label dispensers''' and '''label applicators'''  are machines built to simplify the process of removing a [[label]] from its liner or backing tape. Some are bench-top for dispensing the labels while others include the application of the label to the item (such as a package).

Label dispensers are generally intended to dispense a label to an operator who manually applies the label to the package. They are designed with varying sizes and features which are often specific to the type of label they can dispense and to the degree of automation desired.

Label applicators are usually part of a larger packaging line. They receive the package from a previous automation stage, apply the label, and feed the package to the next stage in the packaging line.

==Use==
Label dispensers have many uses.  Imagine how many items you purchase have labels, almost everything.  Those labels were either applied by a machine or by hand, and most likely were peeled from the backing paper using some sort of label dispenser.  Some of the more popular are [[bulk mailing]], [[manufacturing]], [[packaging]], [[food and beverage]], [[fast food]], photo labs, and more.

==Manual label dispenser==
Patents on Manual [[label]] dispensers go back to the 1920s. They are designed for light-duty use. They are operated by hand and are not automated, but still assist in the process of removing [[label]]s from their liners. Many manual [[label]] dispensers can dispense multiple rolls at once.  Operation is performed by pulling the liner/backing paper around a plate or bar which causes the [[label]] to peel away from the backing paper.  This happens because the backing paper is usually thinner than the [[label]] itself and is also underneath.  When the liner is forced around a tight radius the [[label]] lifts away and protrudes through the front or top of the dispenser.

==Price guns==
A price gun is a tool used in small and large retail outlets to label products with price stickers of varying sizes. While there are a wide variety of pricing gun manufacturers that offer different styles and features, most pricing guns operate in a similar manner i.e. dispensing price labels from a roll.

Using a price gun enables speedy price-marking for products and over-pricing for price reductions for sales or special offer items etc. One of the best benefits of the hand-held price gun is its efficiency and mobility i.e. they are small and lightweight and can be easily taken to the location where the products need to be labelled in store. The gun is held in one hand and by pulling the handle upwards the leading-edge of the roll of labels is pulled through the gun by its internal mechanism and thereby partly ejects one sticker out of the 'mouth' of the gun ready to be applied directly onto the product. The used backing paper is automatically separated from the labels as they are dispensed and that generally comes out the rear of the price gun ready for tearing off as required by the operative. Please see image and explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://printonlabels.co.uk/how-to-use-a-price-gun/|title=How to use a price gun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of tagging guns, fine fabric and standard. Fine fabric guns are used for delicate materials such as silk and standard is generally used for general garments e.g. coats and knitwear etc. 'Taggers', as they are often referred to, are used widely in the retail industry for applying card material, store branded swing tickets, preprinted with product details and price etc., onto garments of all kinds.

==Semi-automatic label dispenser==
Electric Semi-automatic label dispensers were first patented in the early 1970s.  They were originally designed for multiple-row address labels for [[bulk mailing]] houses.  On average a good mailing house employee could apply approximately 500 labels per hour to envelopes.  The label dispenser increased this to over 2,000 per hour. These dispensers advance individual or multiple-row labels and remove them from their lining similar to a manual dispenser, but instead of manually pulling on the liner, label advancement occurs when a trigger on the dispenser detects the absence of a label, such as when the operator removes the label.  The sensor then closes the circuit and engages the motor, dispensing the next label until the sensor once again detects the label which opens the circuit.
The first electric dispenser was designed with the limit switch on the left of a 16" wide machine.  4-up multiple-row labels were loaded into the machine and once activated would advance one row of labels.  The operator would take the labels from right to left, so that when the leftmost label was taken, the next row advanced, automatically providing a constant supply of labels to apply.  The labels are also peeled without the natural curl that will happen when pulled from the backing paper with fingers.  Also, only one hand was needed to take the label, the other hand could be used to move the material the label was being applied to.

Semi-automatic label dispensers are often built to withstand industrial conditions.

==Label Applicators==
Label applicators are fully automated and can range from simple slower speed models to large machines capable of applying hundreds or even thousands of labels per minute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shorewoodengineering.com/5600.htm Shorewood Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610155003/http://www.shorewoodengineering.com/5600.htm |date=2012-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicators advance the label stock over the peeler plate until a portion of the label, called the "flag," is extended into the path of the oncoming package. When the package engages the label flag, the label web is advanced to match the speed of the package and label is either tamped or wiped on to assure adhesion.
Proper alignment of the label on the package depends on sensors that sense the location/orientation of the package and label sensors that detect the location of the label edge. Package sensors can be a variety of [[Position sensor]]s, often optical sensors or [[Ultrasonic sensors]]. Label sensors are usually [[Photoelectric sensors]] because they are inexpensive. But clear labels cannot be detected by photoelectric sensors. Capacitive and ultrasonic technologies are used for clear label detection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labelsensors.com LabelSensors.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===
* [[electric motor|Motor]]: The motor automates the label dispenser and controls the speed at which labels are dispensed.
* Feed-Roller: This actually is the first patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward.  The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal roller and a rubber roller.  The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes.  The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the rubber roller (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material to the side of the machine with the sensor.  Using this method label stock up to 16" width can be advanced and tracked perfectly.  The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle.
* Take-up hub/spool: This can take the place of the feed-roller.  The take-up hub consists of a bar and a liner holder/clip, which are connected to the motor on a single side-frame. In operation, they turn in sync with the motor and wind the label liner in order to collect it in one place. As the take-up hub turns, pressure is placed in the liner and it is stretched across the strip plate, where peeling, or separation, occurs.
* Peeler plate: A component of the machine which acts as a separator for the label and its liner. Each label is pulled across the strip plate until it is recognized by a photo sensor or limit switch. Strip plates can be of varying design and material, but they are often made of plastic, metal coil, or aluminum.
* [[Photodetector]] or [[Limit switch]]: Used to trigger label advancement. Every semi-automatic label dispenser is equipped with one or the other. These detect the absence or presence of a label to facilitate dispensing.
* [[Limit switch]]: This is the original method of label detection and can be used for most applications, it can detect a wide variety of labels.
* [[Photodetector]]/Electric eye: Is an alternate method which uses a beam of light broken by the label as it passes over/between the sensors.  It can be used for many different label types, but transparent material is an issue.

The [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] ('''CGF''') uses [[three-letter abbreviation]] '''country codes''' to refer to each group of athletes that participate in the [[Commonwealth Games]]. Each code identifies a [[Commonwealth Games Association]].

Several of the CGF codes are different from the standard [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] codes. Other sporting organisations, such as the [[International Olympic Committee]] or [[FIFA]], use similar country codes to refer to their respective teams.

==Current CGAs==
There are 70 current CGAs that participate at the Commonwealth Games. The following tables show the currently used code for each CGA and any different codes used in past Games. Some of the past code usage is further explained in the following sections.

Mercurius Ventures Ltd v [[Waitakere City Council]] [1996] 2 NZLR 495 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding whether a contract illegal under law, can be subsequently validated under the [[Illegal Contracts Act 1970]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Waitakere City Council sought to appoint a business development officer for the city. After interviewing numerous applicants for the position, the council decided to hire Ms Howe, and offered her a starting annual salary of $80,000. In reply to this offer, Howe said that as she had been earning $120,000 a year self-employed for the past 2 years.

WDC then increased the starting salary to $100,000, which Howe accepted. However, thinking of the advantages (and not the disadvantages) of being a self-employed contractor, she asked the council if they would consider hiring her as a contractor for $120,000, which the council accepted, and Howe started work whilst the written contract was being drafted.

Several months into the contract, due to an unworkable relationship with the WDC management, they notified Howe that they were canceling her contract, giving 1 months notice. The council claimed that such a contract had to be in writing, and as the contract had not been done, they claimed it was legally unenforceable.
 
Howe initially made a claim for wrongfull dismissal with the Employment Court, but withdrew this when she realized she was not an employee, but a contractor, and proceeded to file a claim for breach of contract instead.

During the discovery proceedings, the WDC discovered that her previous 2 years earnings were overstated, and they amended their defence to include misrepresentation.

==Decision==
The court validated the contract and awarded her damages of 1 month, $12,000.

The '''National Portrait Gallery''' ('''NPG''') is an [[art gallery]] in London housing a collection of portraits of historically important and famous [[British people]]. It was the first portrait gallery in the world when it opened in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=National Portrait Gallery: About | publisher=ARTINFO | year=2008 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/18664/5243/about/national-portrait-gallery-london/ | accessdate=30 July 2008 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204010257/http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/18664/5243/about/national-portrait-gallery-london/ | archivedate=4 December 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St Martin's Place, off [[Trafalgar Square]], and adjoining the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]]. It has been expanded twice since then. The National Portrait Gallery also has regional outposts at [[Beningbrough Hall]] in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Montacute House]] in [[Somerset]]. It is unconnected to the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] in Edinburgh, with which its remit overlaps. The gallery is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].

==Collection==
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Chandos portrait]] of [[William Shakespeare]], the first painting to enter the NPG's collection]]

The gallery houses [[portrait]]s of historically important and famous [[British people]], selected on the basis of the significance of the sitter, not that of the artist. The collection includes photographs and [[caricature]]s as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=f76fcf3a-8f3e-46bf-bb1d-ebce6be3446e&amp;k=48373&amp;p=1 |title=Every great country must have its portrait gallery |publisher=Canada.com |date=12 October 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825122623/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=f76fcf3a-8f3e-46bf-bb1d-ebce6be3446e&amp;k=48373&amp;p=1 |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its best-known images is the [[Chandos portrait]], the most famous portrait of [[William Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080911031935/http://www.npg.org.uk/live/woshakespeare.asp National Portrait Gallery | What's on? | Searching for Shakespeare]&lt;/ref&gt; although there is some uncertainty about whether the painting actually is of the playwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/02/arts.books/print |work=The Guardian  | location=London | title=The only true painting of Shakespeare – probably | first=Charlotte | last=Higgins | date=2 March 2006 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the portraits are exceptional artistically, although there are self-portraits by [[William Hogarth]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and other [[British artists]] of note. Some, such as the group portrait of the participants in the [[Somerset House]] Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the [[anamorphic projection|anamorphic]] portrait of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] by [[William Scrots]], [[Branwell Brontë|Patrick Branwell Brontë]]'s painting of his sisters [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]], [[Emily Brontë|Emily]] and [[Anne Brontë|Anne]], or a sculpture of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969. In addition to its permanent galleries of historical portraits, the National Portrait Gallery exhibits a rapidly changing selection of contemporary work, stages exhibitions of portrait art by individual artists and hosts the annual [[BP Portrait Prize]] competition.

The three people largely responsible for the founding of the National Portrait Gallery are commemorated with busts over the main entrance. At centre is [[Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope]], with his supporters on either side, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay]] (to Stanhope's left) and [[Thomas Carlyle]] (to Stanhope's right). It was Stanhope who, in 1846 as a Member of Parliament (MP), first proposed the idea of a National Portrait Gallery. It was not until his third attempt, in 1856, this time from the House of Lords, that the proposal was accepted. With Queen Victoria's approval, the House of Commons set aside a sum of £2000 to establish the gallery. As well as Stanhope and Macaulay, the founder Trustees included [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Ellesmere]]. It was the latter who donated the [[Chandos portrait]] to the nation as the gallery's first portrait. Carlyle became a trustee after the death of Ellesmere in 1857.&lt;ref name="NPG history"&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/history.asp History of the National Portrait Gallery], accessed 26 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first 40 years, the gallery was housed in various locations in London. The first 13 years were spent at 29 Great George Street, [[City of Westminster|Westminster]]. There, the collection increased in size from 57 to 208 items, and the number of visitors from 5,300 to 34,500. In 1869, the collection moved to [[Exhibition Road]] and buildings managed by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]. Following a fire in those buildings, the collection was moved in 1885, this time to the [[Bethnal Green Museum]]. This location was ultimately unsuitable due to its distance from the [[West End of London|West End]], condensation and lack of waterproofing. Following calls for a new location to be found, the government accepted an offer of funds from the philanthropist William Henry Alexander. Alexander donated £60,000 followed by another £20,000, and also chose the architect, [[Ewan Christian]]. The government provided the new site, St Martin's Place, adjacent to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], and £16,000.&lt;ref name="NPG history"/&gt; The buildings, faced in [[Portland stone]], were constructed by Shillitoe &amp; Son.&lt;ref&gt;Hulme, Graham pg 105&lt;/ref&gt; Both the architect, Ewan Christian, and the gallery's first director, [[George Scharf]], died shortly before the new building was completed. The gallery opened at its new location on 4 April 1896.&lt;ref name="NPG history"/&gt; The site has since been expanded twice. The first extension, in 1933, was funded by [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Lord Duveen]], and resulted in the wing by architect Sir [[Richard Allison (architect)|Richard Allison]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/AboutUs/Community+Programmes/Heritage/rcjheritage.htm Royal Courts of Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721160006/http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/AboutUs/Community+Programmes/Heritage/rcjheritage.htm |date=21 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a site previously occupied by [[St George's Barracks, London|St George's Barracks]] running along Orange Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2NDiDM3tcvIC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=duveen+wing+opens+1933&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5znF6kDQiF&amp;sig=Er7eHp6EKoed6GE7r99q75P23k8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKoLDZwKvPAhUBLMAKHfggA9sQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=duveen%20wing%20opens%201933&amp;f=false|title=Stewards of the Nation's Art: Contested Cultural Authority, 1890-1939|first=Andrea Geddes |last=Poole|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8020-9960-0|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections of the National Portrait Gallery were stored at [[Mentmore Towers]] in Buckinghamshire during the [[Second World War]], along with pieces from the [[Royal Collection]] and paintings from Speaker's House in the Palace of Westminster.&lt;ref name="Martin-Robinson2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin-Robinson|2014|pp=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1909, a murder–suicide took place in a gallery known as the ''Arctic Room''. In an apparently planned attack, John Tempest Dawson, aged 70, shot his 58 year–old wife, Nannie Caskie; Dawson shot her from behind with a revolver, then shot himself in the mouth, dying instantly. His wife died in hospital several hours later. Both were American nationals who had lived in [[Hove]] for around 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Murder And Suicide In The National Portrait Gallery | work=The Times | date=25 February 1909 | page=12 | issue=38892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence at the inquest suggested that Dawson, a wealthy and well–travelled man, was suffering from a [[Persecutory delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Inquests.

In January 2008, the Gallery received its largest single donation to date, a £5m gift from [[Aston Villa]] Chairman and U.S. billionaire [[Randy Lerner]].

In January 2012, [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] announced the National Portrait Gallery as one of her official patronages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-16411358 |title=Duchess of Cambridge announces charity patronages |date=5 January 2012 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Her portrait]] was unveiled in January 2013.

In addition to the busts of the three founders of the gallery over the entrance, the exterior of two of the original 1896 buildings are decorated with stone block busts of eminent portrait artists, biographical writers and historians. These busts, sculpted by [[Frederick R.

== Legal threat against Wikipedia volunteer ==
{{Main|National Portrait Gallery and Wikimedia Foundation copyright dispute}}
On 14 July 2009, the National Portrait Gallery sent a demand letter alleging breach of copyright against an editor-user of Wikipedia, who downloaded thousands of high-resolution reproductions of [[public domain]] paintings from the NPG website, and placed them on Wikipedia's sister media repository site, [[Wikimedia Commons]].&lt;ref name="BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15"&gt;
{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8151989.stm | title = Gallery in Wikipedia legal threat | date=15 July 2009 |work=BBC News | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=27 July 2009}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery's position was that it held copyright in the digital images uploaded to [[Wikimedia Commons]], and that it had made a significant financial investment in creating these digital reproductions. Whereas single-file low resolution images were already available on its website, the images added to [[Wikimedia Commons]] were re-integrated from separate files after the user "found a way to get around their software and download high-resolution images without permission."&lt;ref name="BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15" /&gt;

In 2012, the Gallery licensed 53,000 low-resolution images under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons licence]], making them available free of charge for non–commercial use. A further 87,000 high-resolution images are available for academic use under the Gallery's own licence that invites donations in return; previously, the Gallery charged for high-resolution images.&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt;

The '''Norwegian-American Genealogical Center &amp; Naeseth Library''' (NACGNL) is a not-for-profit Norwegian [[genealogy]] research center and library located at 415 West Main Street, [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  It is available to amateur and professional researchers through membership and fees for services.  The library includes collections of Norwegian parish records, census records, government records, bygdebøker (a Norwegian language local history book), and family histories. The library holds American records, such as obituary records, immigration, and government records, and church records from the [[American Lutheran Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Helpful Organizations and Resources |url=https://www.sofn.com/_asset/7hpr4m/CS5_resourcesR.pdf |website=sofn.com |publisher=Sons of Norway |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online access to some records is available to members. 

== History ==
The Norwegian-American Genealogical Center was founded by [[Gerhard Brandt Naeseth]] (1913-1994), a Norwegian-American scholar in genealogy and immigration research.  The organization was originally associated with the [[Vesterheim]] museum in [[Decorah, Iowa]] from 1974 to 2006. Much of Naeseth's work was published in "Norwegian Immigrants to the United States: A Biographical Directory, 1825-1850", and was continued by the work of the staff of the NACGNL in the 1990's. In 1992, the organization moved to its current location in Madison and since 2007 has operated independently from Vesterheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=D.W. |title=Mini genealogy clinic in Decorah during Nordic Fest |url=https://decorahnewspapers.com/Content/News/Local-News/Article/Landmark-study-for-Norwegian-American-Genealogy-completed-/2/10/20321 |website=DecorahNewspapers.com |publisher=The Decorah Newspapers |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17797">'''POSDCORB''' is an acronym widely used in the field of [[Management]] and [[Public Administration]] that reflects the classic view of [[Organizational theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shafritz |first1=Jay|last2=Ott|first2=J. Steven |editor1-last=Shafritz |editor1-first=Jay |editor2-last=Ott |editor2-first=J.

However, he first presented the concept in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gulick |first1=Luther |chapter=Saturday afternoon session|title=Minutes of the proceedings of the conference on training for the public service, Princeton, NJ |publisher=Public Administration Clearing House.
 |location=Chicago, IL |date=June 22-24, 1935|page=25-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, POSDCORB was envisioned in an effort to develop public service professionals.  In Gulick's own words, the elements are as follows: '''P'''lanning, '''O'''rganizing, '''S'''taffing, '''D'''irecting, '''C'''o-'''O'''rdinating, '''R'''eporting and '''B'''udgeting.

== Coining of the acronym ==
In his piece "Notes on the Theory of Organization," a memo prepared while he was a member of the [[Brownlow Committee]], Luther Gulick asks rhetorically "What is the work of the chief executive? What does he do?"  POSDCORB is the answer, "designed to call attention to the various functional elements of the work of a chief executive because 'administration' and 'management' have lost all specific content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gulick|first1=Luther|editor1-last=Gulick|editor1-first=Luther|editor2-last=Urwick|editor2-first=Lyndall |chapter=Notes on the Theory of Organization|title=Papers on the Science of Administration|publisher=New York: Institute of Public Administration|date=1937|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gulick, the elements are:

*Planning
*Organizing
*Staffing
*Directing
*Co-ordinating
*Reporting
*Budgeting

== Elaborations ==
Gulick's "Notes on the Theory of Organization" further defines the patterns of POSDCORB.  That document explains how portions of an executive's workload may be delegated, and that some of the elements can be organized as subdivisions of the executive depending on the size and complexity of the enterprise.

Under '''Organizing''', Gulick emphasized the division and specialization of labor in a manner that would increase efficiency.  Yet Gulick observed that there were limitations.  Based on his practical experience, he carefully articulated the many factors.

Gulick described how the organization of workers could be done in four ways.  According to him, these are related and may be multi-level.  Specifically, they are:

*By the ''purpose'' the workers are serving, such as furnishing water, providing education, or controlling crime.  Gulick lists these in his organizational tables as vertical organizations.
*By the ''process'' the workers are using, such as engineering, doctoring, lawyering, or statistics.  Gulick lists these in his organizational tables as horizontal organizations.
*By the ''clientele'' or ''material'': the persons or things being dealt with, such as immigrants, veterans, forests, mines, or parks in government; or such as a department store's furniture department, clothing department, hardware department, or shoe department in the private sector.
*By the ''place'' where the workers do their work.
Gulick stresses how these modes of organization often cross, forming interrelated structures.  Organizations like schools may include workers and professionals not in the field of education such as nurses.  How they are combined or carefully aggregated into a school — or a school system — is of concern.  But the early work of Gulick was not limited to small organizations.  He started off his professional career at New York City's Bureau of Municipal Research and advanced to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Committee on Administrative Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitch|first1=Lyle|title=Making Democracy Work|date=1996|publisher=Institute of Governmental Studies Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under '''Coordination''', Gulick notes that two methods can be used to achieve coordination of divided labor.  The first is by organization, or placing workers under managers who coordinate their efforts. The second is by dominance of an idea, where a clear idea of what needs to be done is developed in each worker, and each worker fits their work to the needs of the whole.  Gulick notes that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and that most enterprises function best when both are utilized.

Gulick notes that any manager will have a finite amount of time and energy, and discusses [[span of control]] under '''coordination'''.  Drawing from the work of [[Henri Fayol]], Gulick notes that the number of subordinates that can be handled under any single manager will depend on factors such as organizational stability and the specialization of the subordinates.  Gulick stops short of giving a definite number of subordinates that any one manager can control, but authors such as [[Sir Ian Hamilton]] and [[Lyndall Urwick]] have settled on numbers between three and six. Span of control was later expanded upon and defended in depth by [[Lyndall Urwick]] in his 1956 piece ''The Manager's Span of Control''.

Under '''coordination''', as well as '''organization''',  Gulick emphasizes the theory of [[unity of command]]: that each worker should only have one direct superior so as to avoid confusion and inefficiency.

Gulick discusses the concept of a '''holding company''' which may perform limited coordinating, planning, or budgeting functions.  Subsidiary entities may carry out their work with autonomy, but as the holding company allows, based upon their authority and direction.

== Influence from French Administration Theory ==
[[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]], one of the [[Brownlow Committee]] authors,  states that his statement of work of a chief executive is adapted from the functional analysis elaborated by [[Henri Fayol]] in his "Industrial and General Administration." Indeed, Fayol's work includes fourteen principles and five elements of management that lay the foundations of Gulick's POSDCORB.

Fayol's fourteen principles of management are as follows:
*''Division of Work:'' The division of work principle declares that staffs function better when assigned tasks according to their specialties. 
*''Authority and Responsibility:'' This principle proposes the requirement for managers or manager like authority in order to effectively direct subordinates to perform their jobs while still being held accountable for their conduct.
*''Discipline:'' The discipline principle supports strict and clearly defined rules and regulations in the workplace to ensure professional employee behavior and order.
*''Unity of Command:'' The unity of command doctrine proclaims that employees should only receive command and report to one administrator or boss-like authority figure. 
*''Unity of Direction:'' The unity of direction principle states that there should only be one plan, one objective and one director head for each specific plan.
*''Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest'': The subordination of Individual interest to general interest principle declares that the interests and objectives of the organization overrides the interests of any employee, management staff, or any group.
*''Remuneration of Personnel:'' The remuneration of personnel principle deems that both staff and management salary should be fairly earned, justifiable and no party should be deceived.
*''Centralization:'' The centralization principle advocates that managerial decision making should be centralized with orders being delivered from top tier management to the middle management, where the orders are arranged and then clarified for the line staff to execute.  
*''Scalar Chain (line of authority with peer level communication):'' The scalar chain principle contends that communication within the organization should only be one uninterrupted vertical flow of communication and any other type of communication should only occur in times of emergencies and when approved by a manager.
*''Order:'' The order principle can be interpreted in either of the two ways; some believe this principle refers to giving every material in the organization its right position while other believe it means delegating the right job to the right employee.
*''Equity:'' The equity principle proclaims that managers should be fair and impartial to their staff but the relationship should still be in compliance with the principle of subordination of individual interest to general.
*''Stability of Tenure of Personnel:'' The stability of tenure of personnel principle states that management should employ the right staff and properly train them in hopes of retaining their employment for a long time and benefiting the organization through experience and expertise.
*''Initiative:'' The initiative principle refers to the management and their creativity and their ability to implement them within the organization to ensure growth and success  in the organization.
*''Esprit de Corps:'' The Esprit de Corps principle believes that organizations should promote high morale and unity to retain the best employees for lengthy periods of time.

[[Henri Fayol and the Administrative theory|Henri Fayol's]] influence is also visibly apparent in [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick's]] five elements of management discussed as in his book, which are as follows:
*'''Planning''' - examining the future and drawing up plans of actions
*'''Organizing''' - building up the structure (labor and material) of the undertaking
*'''Command''' - maintaining activity among the personnel
*'''Co-ordination''' - unifying and harmonizing activities and efforts
*'''Control''' - seeing that everything occurs in conformity with policies and practices

== Place in management and public administration history ==
POSDCORB and its humble beginnings in the [[Brownlow Committee]] literature is still heavily referenced in today's public administration and politics. Many public administrators even believe the Brownlow documents initiated "the [[Reorganization Act of 1939]], a train of measures that the act set in motion can reasonably be attributed to it".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=12&amp;sid=07655b43-4831-47e2-bc19-566a871238a4%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4105|title=Administrative Management: Does Its Strong Executive Thesis Still Merit Our Attention?|last=Kaufman|first=Herbert|date=November 1, 2007|website=|publisher=Public Administration Review|access-date=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

POSDCORB management theories that are also responsible for the administrative reorganization that occurred around 1937, which utilizes Gulick's organizing and coordinating steps in the POSDCORB administrative process providing for more concise departments and even room for new agencies within the government making for a more efficient government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

POSDCORB generally fits into the classical management movement, being classified as an element of social scientific management, which was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century. Gulick's POSDCORB patterns were instrumental in highlighting the theory of span of control, or limits on the number of people one manager could supervise, as well as unity of command to the fields of management and public administration.

According to notable [[Public administration|Public Administration]] scholars such as Nicholas Henry, POSDCORB, the principles it represents, and subsequent expansions upon the POSDCORB concept form the height of [[Public Administration]] in an era when it was seen as just another aspect of the field of management as a whole.

Gulick's work has been heavily cited and expanded upon by scholars and practitioners in the fields of management and [[public administration]] since the publication of ''Papers on the Science of Administration'' in 1937.

In his 1987 piece "Deja Vu: French Antecedents of American Public Administration," French [[public administrator]], Daniel Martin notes that virtually all of the principles in American Public Administration up to 1937 and the coining of the POSDCORB acronym, including the POSDCORB principles, were present in the French literature on the subject by 1859, but that this literature had largely been forgotten by the theorists of that era, thus the "re-invention" of these principles in the later French and American literature.

Essentially, "The highest goals of the American Administrative State are the same today as they were in 1937 and in 1787: [[Public administration]] is first and foremost concerned with upholding the democratic values embedded within our constitutional heritage." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newbold | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Terry | first2 = Larry | year = 2006 | title = THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT: The Untold Story and the Federalist Connection | url = | journal = Administration &amp; Society | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 522–555 | doi=10.1177/009539970603800503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
As early as 1938, literature began appearing in the field of [[Public administration|Public Administration]] challenging the validity of POSDCORB and the concept that there could even be a rigid set of principles in administration.  In 1946 and 1947, prominent [[Public administration|Public Administration]] scholars such as [[Robert Dahl]], [[Dwight Waldo]], and [[Herbert A. Simon]] released articles and books criticising POSDCORB and the principles notion.  Simon's article ''Proverbs of Administration'' challenges the POSDCORB principles by stating "For almost every principle one can find an equally plausible and acceptable contradictory principle."  Among other criticisms, Simon states that the POSDCORB principles are an oversimplification of administration.  Simon's criticisms largely center around span of control and unity of command, stating that sometimes it is necessary for a subordinate to receive guidance or directives from more than one source, as well as Gulick's division of labor concepts.  Other criticisms of Simon involved that there was a lack of evidence for the POSDCORB.  Yet others argue that organizations are full of variety and are challenging to control.

== Support ==
In his 2016 piece "Instantiations of POSDCORB," practitioner Paul Chalekian suggested empirical evidence for POSDCORB involving the adoption of institutions and element support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095399713481599|title=Instantiations of POSDCORB: A Framework-Theory-Model Approach|last=Chalekian|first=Paul|date=2016|access-date=January 29, 2017|doi=10.1177/0095399713481599|volume = 48| issue = 3 | journal=Administration &amp; Society|pages=316–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palace of Earthly Tranquility''' ({{zh|s=坤宁宫|t=坤寧宮|p=Kūn Níng Gōng}}) is the northernmost of the three main halls of the Inner Court of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The other two halls are the [[Palace of Heavenly Purity]] and [[Hall of Union]].

The Palace of Earthly Tranquility is a double-eaved building, nine bays wide and three bays deep. In the [[Ming dynasty]], it was the residence of the Empress. In the [[Qing dynasty]], large portions of the Palace were converted for [[Shamanism in the Qing dynasty|Shamanist worship]] by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rulers. Thus, the front part of the hall featured shrines, icons, prayer mats, and a large kitchen where sacrificial meat was prepared. From the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] onwards, the Empress moved out of the Palace following the Emperor's move out of the Palace of Heavenly Purity. However, two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor's wedding night. The wedding ceremony would be held in the main room, and afterwards the Emperor and Empress would retire to one of these rooms.&lt;ref name="Yu 80-83"&gt;pp 80-83, {{cite book |last=Yu |first= Zhuoyun | authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Palaces of the Forbidden City |year=1984|publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=0-670-53721-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighth edition of the '''''Quality Standards''''' (QSI) (published by the [[Architectural Woodwork Institute]]) is a major revision in a line of Standards extending back to 1961.  

==Eighth edition==
There are number of changes in the layout of the eighth edition.

The contents gives a quick look at the scope of fine architectural woodwork. Sections 100 and 200 refer to the raw materials of the trade;  which include lumber, [[wood veneer]]s, overlays like [[laminates]], and the cores to which these products are attached.
Sections 300 through 1400 are product sections, each devoted to the details of materials and workmanship for that wide range of work. Section 1500 is a newly revised factory finishing section. Section 1600 addresses a generic method of specifying institutional cabinetry; and Section 1700 is  about installation. The sections are accessed by black thumb tab indicators.

From 1961 it was recognized that there were different levels of work required. The original committee chose the word ''grade'' to express those levels: "Premium Grade", "Custom Grade", and "Economy Grade". They are defined explicitly on page 6 of the eighth edition, and in other ways, throughout the book.
The raw materials of the trade are not specified using those grade terms. Rather, by selecting a grade of work for the fabricated product, the quality of the materials is specified.

The selection of materials appropriate for the AWI grade of work, and the workmanship and joinery requirements for each type of architectural woodwork are spelled out in Sections 300 through 1400,  the selections and specifications are in sections 1500, ''Factory Finishing''; 1600, ''Modular Cabinets''; and 1700, ''Installation''.

The '''risk of mortality''' (ROM) provides a [[medical classification]] to estimate the [[likelihood]] of inhospital death for a [[patient]]. The ROM classes are minor, moderate, major, and extreme. The ROM class is used for the evaluation of patient [[Death|mortality]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13680">{{About|setting objectives|other meanings|Smart (disambiguation){{!}}Smart}}
'''SMART''' is a [[mnemonic]]/[[acronym]], giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives, for example in [[project management]], employee-[[performance management]] and [[personal development]]. The letters S and M generally mean '''specific''' and '''measurable'''.  Possibly the most common version has the remaining letters referring to '''achievable''', '''relevant''' and '''time-bound'''. However, the term's inventor had a slightly different version and the letters have meant different things to different authors, as described below.  Additional letters have been added by some authors.

The first-known use of the term occurs in the November 1981 issue of ''Management Review'' by George T. Doran.&lt;ref name="Doran-1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doran |first=G. T. |year=1981 |title=There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives |journal=Management Review |volume=70 |issue=11 |publisher=AMA FORUM |pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal advantage of SMART objectives is that they are easier to understand and to know when they have been done.  SMART criteria are commonly associated with [[Peter Drucker]]'s [[management by objectives]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bogue|first=Robert|title=Use S.M.A.R.T. goals to launch management by objectives plan|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/use-smart-goals-to-launch-management-by-objectives-plan/|publisher=TechRepublic|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the term ''S.M.A.R.T Goals'' and ''S.M.A.R.T Objectives'' will surface. Although the acronym '''SMART''' generally stays the same, objectives and goals can differ. Goals are the distinct purpose that is to be anticipated from the assignment or project. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/nc-smart-goals-fact-sheet.pdf|title=Setting Goals and Developing Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound Objectives|last=SAMHSA Native Connections|first=|website=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectives on the other hand are the determined steps that will direct full completion of the project goals. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The November 1981 issue of ''Management Review'' contained a paper by George T. Doran called ''There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives''.&lt;ref name="Doran-1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RapidBI"&gt;[https://rapidbi.com/why-smart-objectives-dont-work/ Why SMART objectives don't work].&lt;/ref&gt;  It discussed the importance of objectives and the difficulty of setting them.
{{quote|Ideally speaking, each corporate, department, and section objective should be:
*''Specific'' – target a specific area for improvement.
*''Measurable'' – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
*''Assignable'' – specify who will do it.
*''Realistic'' – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
*''Time-related'' – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
&lt;!-- Yes, Doran really did say Assignable. Later authors have used different words, as described later in the article --&gt;
Notice that these criteria don't say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management. In certain situations it is not realistic to attempt quantification, particularly in staff middle-management positions. Practicing managers and corporations can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective in order to gain quantification. It is the combination of the objective and its action plan that is really important. Therefore serious management should focus on these twins and not just the objective.
|George T. Doran|There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives&lt;ref name="Doran-1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RapidBI"/&gt;}}

==Current definitions==
Each letter in SMART refers to a different criterion for judging objectives. Different sources use the letters to refer to different things. Typically accepted criteria are as follows.

Choosing certain combinations of these labels can cause duplication, such as selecting 'attainable' and 'realistic'. They can also cause significant overlapping as in combining 'appropriate' and 'relevant'. The term 'agreed' is often used in management situations where buy-in from stakeholders is desirable (e.g. appraisal situations.)

== Objectives Checklist ==
When creating a ''S.M.A.R.T Objective,'' there is specific criteria one should follow. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/pdf/dp17-1701-smart-objectives.pdf|title=How to Write SMART Objectives|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Check mark-n}} '''Specific''': ''Who'' the participants are, and ''what'' the action or activity is.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Check mark-n}} '''Measurable''': Quantity of ''change'' that is to be expected throughout the objective. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Check mark-n}} '''Achievable''': The objective must be attainable with the amount of time and resources available.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting''''' is a non-fiction book and filmmaking guide written by [[Syd Field]].  First published in 1979, ''Screenplay'' covers the art and craft of [[screenwriting]].  Considered a bestseller shortly after its release, to date it has sold millions of copies.  It has served as a reference for [[Judd Apatow]], [[James Cameron]], [[Frank Darabont]], [[Tina Fey]] and many other professional screenwriters.  Now translated into more than a dozen languages, ''Screenplay'' is considered the "bible" of the screenwriting craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=William|title=Syd Field, Author of the Definitive Work On Writing Screenplays, Is Dead at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/arts/syd-field-author-of-the-definitive-work-on-writing-screenplays-is-dead-at-77.html|accessdate=January 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Screenplay'' is noted as the first book to identify the [[Three-act structure|''three-act screenplay model'']].&lt;ref name="Chamberlain2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Chamberlain|title=The Nutshell Technique: Crack the Secret of Successful Screenwriting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=My5YCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|date=1 March 2016|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-1-4773-0866-0|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of Field's explanation of how his screenplay model worked was ''the paradigm''.

===The Paradigm===

In the book, Field outlines the [[paradigm]] to which he says most successful screenplays adhere. In Field's view, successful screenplays are made up of three distinct divisions.  He calls these ''setup'', ''confrontation'', and ''resolution'', and each of them appear in their own act within a screenplay.
* Act I contains the setup.  It is approximately the first quarter of a screenplay, and reveals the main character, premise, and situation of the story.
* Act II contains the confrontation.  It lasts for the next two quarters of the screenplay, and clearly defines the main goal of the [[protagonist]].
* Act III contains the resolution. This is the final quarter of the screenplay. This answers the question as to whether or not the main character succeeded in his or her goal.

Between each of these acts, the paradigm states that there is a ''[[plot point]]''—an event that spins the plot into a new direction, and transitions into a new act of the screenplay.

==Reception==
* After selling millions of copies, the book is credited with starting the "how-to-write-a-movie-script industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elder|first1=Robert K.|title=Scripted program;  Dan Decker's Screenwriters Group gives aspiring writers a creative path to follow|work=Chicago Tribune|date=November 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Filmmaker [[Judd Apatow]] said, "Whenever I write a screenplay, I take out his book and reread it...to see if I screwed anything up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newspapers|first1=Tribune|title=Notable deaths elsewhere|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Thai and LH airsickness bags.jpg|thumb|Unused airsickness bags of [[Thai Airways International|Thai Airways]] and [[Lufthansa]]. Note the metal clips to close bags after use.]]

A '''sickness bag''' (also known as a '''sick sack''', '''airsick bag''', '''airsickness bag''', '''emesis bag''', '''sick bag''', '''barf bag''', '''vomit bag''', '''disposal bag''', '''waste bag''' or '''motion sickness bag''') is a small bag commonly provided to passengers on board [[airplanes]] and [[boats]] to collect and contain [[vomiting|vomit]] in the event of [[motion sickness]].  [[Hovercraft]]-ferry operators and even [[train]] companies have also been known to furnish bags. [[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women with [[morning sickness]] and travelers who know they are prone to motion sickness will sometimes bring their own bags.

The plastic-lined airsickness bag was created by [[inventor]] [[Gilmore Schjeldahl]] for [[Northwest Orient Airlines]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="fad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/32747099.html|title=Fad nauseam|date=1 March 2008|publisher=''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]''|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously bags had been made from waxed paper or card. Modern bags are still mainly made from plastic-lined paper, but a significant proportion are now made completely from plastic.

== Collecting ==
Among the collectors of [[aeronautical]] [[memorabilia]] there is a sub-culture of sickness-bag aficionados. The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' recognizes [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] Niek Vermeulen as the world record holder for the number of different bags (6016 as of 29 January 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/dedication/largest-collection-of-sick-bags Largest collection of sick bags - Guinness World Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Virgin Atlantic]] issued a limited edition set of half a million bags in collaboration with designer Oz Dean of 'forcefeed:swede'. Oz had conceived and run an online gallery of sick bags since 2000 under the project name "Design for Chunks".  It challenged designers to illustrate the usually dull medium of the sick bag, as opposed to T-shirts or [[splash screen|splash pages]] which were the standard challenges at the time.&lt;ref name="DesignforChunks"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.designforchunks.com/base.html |title=Design for Chunks  |work= |accessdate=2010-08-31 |publisher=forcefeed:swede |date=2009-01-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100915170907/http://www.designforchunks.com/base.html| archivedate= 15 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the project achieved cult status in a short time amongst the design community, Dean felt that it had run its course and closed it down in 2003. With the offer of doing the project for real (from Virgin Atlantic) "DFC" was opened up again, in 2004, with the strapline "This time it's real!" The printed bags were intended to be on the global fleet of planes for 6 months but only lasted 3, with people walking through the aisles collecting the sets. The project divided opinion and this came as no surprise to Virgin Atlantic which is intentionally the more offbeat airline company in comparison to their traditional rivals, British Airways. The whole set of 20 finalists designs as a framed piece can be found in the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse at [[Heathrow]], UK or online at the archived website.&lt;ref name="DesignforChunks" /&gt;

[[Virgin Atlantic]] released another four bags promoting the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' shortly after the "Design for Chunks" project.

Steven J. Silberberg is also a collector of air sickness bags; his collection, the [[Air Sickness Bag Virtual Museum]], holds 2297 bags.

== Alternative uses ==
The development of larger aircraft and advances in design have reduced the occurrence of air sickness.  This has led to bags being given a secondary use as general purpose waterproof waste containers which is often reflected in the labelling of the bag and instructional diagrams.  Another common use is that of a photographic mailing envelope (especially Australia). Airlines have also printed bags to serve as card game scoresheets and [[Continental Airlines]] once suggested that they be used as [[doggy bag]]s for [[Airline meal|airline food]]. Non-airline aircrew have occasionally used these bags as improvised urinals or fecal collection devices aboard aircraft lacking on-board toilets. A specialized urine collection bag known colloquially as the "[[piddle pack]]" developed as an improvement from this practice. In 2010, [[Spirit Airlines]] began selling advertising space on its air sickness bags.&lt;ref&gt;"Bumpy Ride? Spirit Airlines Sells Ads on Barf Bags. Seaney, Rick; ABC News, 19 May 2010. Retrieved 27 October 2011. http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/spirit-airlines-sells-advertisements-barf-bags-bathrooms-overhead/story?id=10679887&lt;/ref&gt;

Some airlines have exhibited a certain sense of humor in designing their airsickness bags. For a short time, for example, [[Hapag-Lloyd Express]] (now [[TUIfly]]) had bags that had stated "Thank you for your criticism!". The defunct [[ATA Airlines]] used airsickness bags that had "Occupied" on them. [[Delta Air Lines]] has "Feel Better?" printed on the bag. [[Niki (airline)|NIKI Airlines]] uses sickbags with the legend "Speibsackerl" on them; this translates to "puke bag".

Many [[Exploitation film|exploitation horror films]] in the 1970s handed out vomit bags as a promotion gimmick for the more violent and shocking movies.

'''''Tametsi''''' ([[Latin]], "although") is the legislation of the [[Catholic Church]] which was in force from 1563 until Easter 1908 concerning clandestine [[marriage]].  It was named, as is customary in Latin Rite ecclesiastical documents, for the [[Incipit|first word of the document]] that contained it, Chapter 1, Session 24 of the [[Council of Trent]]. 

This was the document that added the impediment of [[Clandestinity (in Canon Law)|clandestinity]] to the marriage law of the church.
It was also the decree which ended a long debate about validity of marriage and produced sought after reform. Since the Sacrament of Marriage is administered by the parties to the marriage to each other, and not by clergy it is unique among the Sacraments. Fear of possible change in this doctrine prompted the debate, since prior to the Council of Trent (1545-1563), clandestine marriages had been considered valid. These marriages had resultant problems - questions over legitimacy of children; difficulties over inheritance, and the potential for conflict between those who considered they had a right to a voice in the matter. 
The outcome of ''Tametsi'' was to establish a juridical form of marriage. To be considered valid, the marriage required the presence of the parish priest or his deputy authorised by him or the ordinary. And the presence of two or three witnesses. Banns were to be read before the marriage was to take place. For the first time, a record of marriage was to be kept.
A liturgical form for marriage was established. Couples newly married were expected to receive the priestly blessing in the church, having prepared by Confession and Communion. &lt;Van Ommeren,W. "Tametsi." ''New Catholic Encyclopedia' ed., vol 13 2nd ed.,vol 13 gale 2003 ref&gt;

It was superseded in 1908 by ''[[Ne Temere]]'', which stated that a marriage is invalid unless it is contracted before a parish priest in his own parish, or before a bishop in his own diocese , or by a delegate of either. And in the presence of at least two witnesses. Also that the marriage must be registered in the place where the contracting parties were baptised.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Catholic Dictionary 1943''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The product claimed several features, including cleaning up users' inboxes by helping to unsubscribe from unwanted emails while at the same time, allowing receipt as well as searching among those commercially oriented emails an individual still wants to receive. By packaging these messages into a digest format, users could consolidate their email box.

==History==
The Swizzle was a product of Keep Holdings, a consumer and brand engagement conglomerate of business units including Keep.com, [[AdKeeper]] and TheSwizzle.com.
The company was founded in March, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=January 17, 2010 |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=114604562 |title=AdKeeper, Inc. Snapshot |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |author=Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Scott Kurnit]], who serves as Chairman and CEO. Kurnit is best known as the founder of now-defunct [[About.com]], which grew to a public market value of $1.7 billion, and was sold to Primedia for $724 million, in 2001. About.com is now owned by [[IAC (company)|IAC]], and was shut down in April 2017.

In 2016, The Swizzle came under harsh criticism from a small evangelical community after a holiday promotional email featured a song parody of Winter Wonderland, altering the words "Sleigh bells ring, Are you listening" to "Sleigh bells ring, are ya Swizzling?". 

The company under intense media pressure was forced to issue a press release apologizing for its manipulation of the holiday classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gone Too Far?

'''''The Sibley Guide to Birds''''' is a [[reference work]] and [[field guide]] for the [[bird]]s found in the continental [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is written and illustrated by ornithologist [[David Allen Sibley]]. The book provides details on 810 species of birds, with information about identification, life history, vocalizations, and geographic distribution. It contains several paintings of each species, and is critically acclaimed for including images of each bird in flight. Two regional field guides using the same material as ''The Sibley Guide to Birds'' were released in 2003, one for the western half of North American and one for the eastern half.

The guide was favorably reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/26/science/essay-looking-at-birds-in-meticulous-detail.html|title=Looking at Birds, in Meticulous Detail|author=E.

'''United States Coast Guard Cutter''' is the term used by the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] for its [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] vessels.  They are {{convert|65|ft|m|1}} or greater in length and have a permanently assigned crew with accommodations aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft, Boats, and Cutters|url=http://www.uscg.mil/datasheet/|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; USCG History, FAQS, Definitions: {{cite web|title=What is a "Cutter"?|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/FAQS/Designations.asp|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carry the [[ship prefix]] '''USCGC'''.

== History of the USCG cutters ==
The [[Revenue Marine]] and the [[Revenue Cutter Service]], as it was known variously throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries, referred to its ships as [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]s.  The term is English in origin and refers to a specific type of vessel, namely, "a small, decked ship with one [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] and [[bowsprit]], with a [[Gaff rig|gaff]] [[mainsail]] on a [[Boom (sailing)|boom]], a square yard and [[topsail]], and two [[jib]]s or a jib and a [[staysail]]."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kemp, editor, The Oxford Companion to Ships &amp; the Sea; London: Oxford University Press, 1976; pp. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; With general usage, that term came to define any vessel of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[HM Customs and Excise]] and the term was adopted by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] at the creation of what would become the Revenue Marine.  Since that time, no matter what the vessel type, the service has referred to its vessels with permanently assigned crews as cutters.

===First ten cutters===
In 1790, Congress authorized the [[Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], to create a maritime service to enforce customs laws (1 Stat. L. 145, 175; 4 August 1790).  Alternatively known as the system of cutters, Revenue Service, and Revenue-Marine this service was officially named the Revenue Cutter Service (12 Stat. L., 639) in 1863. This service was placed under the control of the Treasury Department. The first ten cutters were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willoughby |first=Malcolm F. |authorlink = |title =The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II |publisher =[[United States Naval Institute]] |volume = |edition = |date =1957 |location =[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |page =3 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
