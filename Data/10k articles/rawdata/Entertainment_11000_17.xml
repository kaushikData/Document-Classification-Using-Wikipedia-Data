{{nihongo|'''Asamushi Aquarium'''|浅虫水族館|Asamushi Suizokukan}} also called '''Aquarium Asamushi''', is an [[aquarium]] in the [[Asamushi Onsen|Asamushi area]] of [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]], [[Aomori Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Overlooking [[Mutsu Bay]], it is the northernmost aquarium in [[Honshū]]. It is also the largest general aquarium in the [[Tōhoku region]]. It keeps and displays 11,000 marine organisms, including those from Aomori Prefecture's abundant marine resources and over 500 species of rare aquatic animals from around the world.

The aquarium is currently operated by the Aomori prefectural government.&lt;ref name="aqua_about"/&gt;

==Exhibits==

The warm and cold water exhibits at the aquarium (a total of 45 tanks containing {{Convert|720|m3|gal}} of water) feature marine animals such as [[sea otter]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[earless seal|seals]], [[penguin]]s, and [[dolphin]]s.&lt;ref name="aqua_map"/&gt; The dolphin show tank is the largest in the facility and holds {{Convert|310|m3|gal}}.&lt;ref name="aqua_about"/&gt; The seawater tank on the first floor includes a {{Convert|15|m|sing=on}} acrylic tunnel for viewing the inhabitants from underneath.&lt;ref name="aomori"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4444">'''Bandboy''' (also expressed as '''band boy''') is a bygone term for a job similar to for what now is known as a "[[roadie]]."  They set up, tear down, and maintain equipment, and music.  They help-out backstage, making sure there are towels, drinks, ice.

Unlike a roadie, the bandboy was more like a personal assistant, or ''[[au pair]]'', or butler/dresser for the leader — making sure suits were dry cleaned, shoes shined, and the like.  On foreign tours a local "bandboy" would translate, find places to eat, change money, buy train tickets, and so on.  Often the "bandboy" would disseminate information for the leader, hand out itineraries, room lists, and set lists.  The role of bandboy was different with every band and had different duties than the more senior road manager, who dealt with promoters, booking agents, contracts, payroll, catering, and such.  When times got tough, financially, road managers often performed bandboy duties &amp;mdash; or band members themselves handled the bandboy duties.

'''Battlecade: Extreme Fighting''', sometimes referred to simply as '''Extreme Fighting''', is a now defunct [[mixed martial arts]] promotion which hosted four events in the United States and Canada between 1995 and 1997. Although few events were held, a number of well known fighters competed for the promotion. Battlecade CEO Rick Blume is credited with coining the phrase ''mixed martial arts'' and the promotion was the first to implement [[mixed martial arts weight classes|weight classes]] in MMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2007/10/13/1625/8169 |title= MMA History VIII: From Russia with Leglocks |accessdate=2010-11-30 |publisher=Kid Nate at BloodyElbow.com |date=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the number of fighters which the promotion was able to attract, Battlecade struggled financially and had trouble with authorities over the sanctioning of MMA bouts. Following the fourth and final Extreme Fighting event, General Media International, Battlecade sponsor and publisher of [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]], withdrew their financial support of the promotion. Additionally, [[cable television]] providers [[Tele-Communications Inc.]] and [[Request TV]] refused to air further Extreme Fighting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pitchforth Patton |first1= John |year= 1997 |title= Extreme Fighting Event Refuses to Quit |journal= Black Belt |volume= 35 |issue= 7 |pages= 96 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Extreme Fighting 1===
The first Extreme Fighting event was planned to be held in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on November 18, 1995. Pressure from state politicians forced the event to be moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] on a single day's notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Goldsmith |first1= Tami |last2= Coleman |first2= Jim |year= 1996 |title= Extreme Fighting Event an Extreme Disappointment |journal= Black Belt |volume= 34 |issue= 3 |pages= 10–11, 24 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event featured a four-man heavyweight tournament which was won by eventual [[American Top Team]] co-founder Marcus Silveira. Silveira defeated Victor Tatarkin of Russia by submission via strikes in the semi-finals of the tournament, moving on to defeat Gary Myers via [[guillotine choke]] in the finals. With his victory over Myers, Silveira became the Extreme Fighting Heavyweight Champion.

This event also featured a four-man middleweight tournament, showcasing [[judo]]ka Igor Zinoviev and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] practitioner [[Mario Sperry]]. Zinoviev defeated his first opponent, Harold German, an accomplished but notably outweighed New York-based boxer, by submission via strikes. Sperry won by the same means against his opponent, [[UFC 6]] competitor Rudyard Moncayo. Zinoviev defeated Sperry in the finals by [[knockout|technical knockout]] to become Extreme Fighting Middleweight Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcombat.com/news/2010-01-16/no-holds-barred-john-perretti-igor-zinoviev-mario-sperry-fight-extreme-fighting-1 |title=No Holds Barred: John Perretti on Igor Zinoviev-Mario Sperry Fight from Extreme Fighting 1 |accessdate=2010-12-01 |publisher=Eddie Goldman at ADCombat.com |date=2010-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119191804/http://www.adcombat.com/news/2010-01-16/no-holds-barred-john-perretti-igor-zinoviev-mario-sperry-fight-extreme-fighting-1 |archivedate=2010-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the two tournaments held that night, the event featured [[Ralph Gracie]] and a bout between Carlson Gracie Jr. and John Lewis which ended in a draw after twenty minutes.

===Extreme Fighting 2===
On April 26, 1996, a second Extreme Fighting event was held in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. Marcus Silveira and Igor Zinoviev were victorious in separate bouts. An eighteen-year-old [[Carlos Newton]], who would go on to become a champion in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], made his professional debut that night, fighting eventual [[K-1 USA Grand Prix '98]] competitor, and a man almost twice his size, in Jean Riviere. Newton lost the bout via submission by a small package(when an opponent is on their back with their legs being smashed atop of them).

Ralph Gracie returned to action and was declared Extreme Fighting Lightweight Champion after defeating Steve Nelson via submission in the first round of their bout.

Despite arrangements made with the [[Kahnawake]] tribal council for the event to be held, Montreal authorities arrested a number of the evening's competitors, the referee, announcer, and Battlecade's matchmaker following the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Statement+from+Battlecade+LLP.,+sponsors+of+%22Extreme+Fighting+2%22%3B...-a018233097&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme Fighting 3===
[[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] hosted the third Extreme Fighting event on the night of October 18, 1996. In one of the most recognized bouts from the short-lived promotion, [[kickboxer]] and eventual [[List of UFC Champions#Heavyweight Championship|UFC Heavyweight Champion]] [[Maurice Smith (kickboxer)|Maurice Smith]] defeated Marcus Silveira via technical knockout to become the new Extreme Fighting Heavyweight Champion.

[[Matt Hume]] and [[Erik Paulson]], who both went on to become well known trainers after their fighting careers ended, battled until Paulson suffered a cut in the third round of their bout.

Igor Zinoviev retained his middleweight championship after fighting to a draw with [[John Lober]]. A bout between John Lewis and [[Vale Tudo]] fighter Johil de Oliveira also ended in a draw.

Ralph Gracie submitted Ali Mihoubi via [[armlock|armbar]] to retain his lightweight championship. Eventual [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]] competitor [[Kazunari Murakami]] defeated Bart Vale via technical knockout, while [[Anthony Macias]] submitted to the strikes of [[Allan Goes]]. [[Angola]]n fighter [[João Roque]] - who went on to compete in the UFC, [[Deep (mixed martial arts)|DEEP]], and [[Shooto]] - defeated Abdelaziz Cherigui via armbar.

===Extreme Fighting 4===
The final Extreme Fighting event was held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] on March 28, 1997. [[Kevin Jackson (wrestler)|Kevin Jackson]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]]ist [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle wrestler]] and winner of the [[UFC 14]] middleweight tournament, defeated John Lober via [[arm triangle choke]]. In what was his lone professional MMA bout, [[Kenny Monday]], another Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling, defeated John Lewis via technical knockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pitchforth Patton |first1= John |year= 1997 |title= Olympic Gold Medalists Impressive at Extreme Fighting 4 |journal= Black Belt |volume= 35 |issue= 7 |pages= 98 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hume proved victorious against [[Miletich Fighting Systems]] founder [[Pat Miletich]], who suffered a fight-ending broken nose. Allan Goes defeated Todd Bjornethun via [[triangle choke]], while Erik Paulson fought [[Paul Jones (mixed martial artist)|Paul Jones]] to a draw.

Finally, Maurice Smith defended his heavyweight title against Kazunari Murakami. Their bout ended decisively, as Smith knocked Murakami out in the first round.

Neither the middleweight or lightweight titles were defended on the final Extreme Fighting card, as champions Igor Zinoviev and Ralph Gracie did not appear. Zinoviev was unable to compete because of a [[separated shoulder]]. Gracie's scheduled opponent, Luta Livre fighter Eugenio Tadeu, was unable to attend the event and Battlecade could not find a replacement in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pitchforth Patton |first1= John |year= 1997 |title= Olympic Gold Medalists Impressive at Extreme Fighting 4 |journal= Black Belt |volume= 35 |issue= 7 |pages= 98 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruno''', also called '''Ben''' or '''Gentle Ben''' (1962− c. 1981) was a male [[American black bear]] actor best known for playing the leading role of Ben the bear in the 1967-1969 [[CBS]] television series, ''[[Gentle Ben]]''.&lt;ref name=tvguide&gt;TV Guide News, [http://www.tvguide.com/news/stars-gentle-65477/ "Who Were the Stars of Gentle Ben?"], TVGuide.com, Nov. 15, 2005, accessed May 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played the adult Ben in the feature film prequel to the TV series, ''[[Gentle Giant (film)|Gentle Giant]]'' (1967).&lt;ref name=weaverben&gt;UPI, "Gentle Ben," ''[[Press-Telegram|Independent Press-Telegram]]'' (Long Beach, Cal.), Apr. 30, 1967, Tele Vues section, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Bruno received a first-place [[PATSY Award]] for his work on the ''Gentle Giant'' film and a second-place award for his work on the TV series.&lt;ref name=beck&gt;Beck, Ken, and Jim Clark.

==Early life==
Bruno was acquired by [[Ralph Helfer|Ralph Helfer's]] [[Marine World/Africa USA|Africa U.S.A.]] animal ranch sometime before 1965. Africa U.S.A., at that time located in [[Soledad Canyon]] near [[Saugus, California]], provided trained animals to Hollywood for film and television work, including many [[Ivan Tors]] productions.&lt;ref name=amory&gt;Amory, Cleveland. [https://daktaritvshow.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/the-story-of-africa-u-s-a-and-its-proprietors-animal-trainer-ralph-helfer-and-daktari-producer-ivan-tors/ "Animal Kingdom, USA: Out in California flourishes a wild animal domain located just this side of Unbelievable."] ''[[TV Guide]]'', Apr. 23, 1966, p. 4, archived online at daktaritvshow.wordpress.com, accessed May 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ken Beck and Jim Clark, Bruno and a brother were orphaned in Wisconsin as cubs, and later acquired by Helfer from a private party.&lt;ref name=beck /&gt; It was reported during the ''Gentle Ben'' series run that Bruno (who at that point had been renamed "Ben" for the run of the show&lt;ref name=namechange&gt;"'Gentle Giant' Star Changes Name For Marquee Lure", ''Daily Republican'' (Monongahela, Penn.), Feb. 16, 1968, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;) had been "discovered" in [[White Lake, Wisconsin]], and that he was 6 years old in 1968, making his birth year 1962.&lt;ref name=penton&gt;Penton, Edgar. "'Gentle Ben' Is Believable Bear: CBS-TV Program Clicks", ''[[El Paso Herald-Post]]'', Feb. 24, 1968, Showtime section, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pair&gt;"Pair a Natural: Bear, Boy Pals Work For Series", ''Daily Courier'' (Connellsville, Penn.), Jan. 13, 1968, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Helfer confirmed in 1970 that one of the bears who appeared in ''Gentle Ben'' was obtained from Ivan Walters' game farm in White Lake.&lt;ref name=mjobit&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19860110&amp;id=Z18aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pSoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5005,1462170&amp;hl=en "Pelky Dies; Had Raised Bear on 'Gentle Ben' Show,"] ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'', Jan. 10, 1986, Part 2, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony "Tony" Pelky, owner of the Chain Lake Game Farm near [[Lakewood, Wisconsin]], and his son claimed during Pelky's lifetime and in his 1986 obituaries that Pelky was the "man who raised Gentle Ben" from a cub. According to Tony Pelky, "Gentle Ben" and his two brothers were born near Lakewood in 1962. Shortly after their birth, their mother was killed by a hunter and the cubs were adopted and bottle-fed by the hunter's son. A local [[game warden]] took the cubs as wards of the state and offered one cub to Pelky. (According to the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'', the other two cubs were given to a game farm near [[Langlade, Wisconsin]], and eventually appeared on the Ivan Tors-produced TV series ''[[Daktari]]'', which was filmed primarily at Africa U.S.A. using its animals.) Pelky said that the cub, which he named "Smokey", was "the tamest bear he ever saw" although the bear had no training. Smokey, who eventually grew to an adult size of 650 pounds, would allow a man to put an arm in his mouth without biting and would back away from a dog rather than fight.&lt;ref name=joslin&gt;Joslin, Jean T. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19700107&amp;id=dT0aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MCgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5345,3308378&amp;hl=en "Ben Was Gentle Smokey Before He Left Wisconsin,"] ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'', Jan. 7, 1970, "Green Sheet" section, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pelkys, Africa U.S.A. trainers heard about the bear, were impressed by his docile temperament and large size, and purchased him from Pelky for either $500 or $600.&lt;ref&gt;"Rub Elbows With Deer", ''The Post-Crescent'' (Appleton, Wisc.), Jul. 12, 1970, p. E-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pelkys said that they later recognized the bear shown in the opening theme sequence of ''Gentle Ben'', which was Bruno, as the bear they had sold.&lt;ref name=mjobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=upiobit&gt;UPI, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/01/10/Original-owner-of-Gentle-Ben-dies/7319505717200/ "Original Owner of Gentle Ben Dies,"] Jan. 10, 1986, archived at www.upi.com/Archives, accessed May 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pelky also said that the sale took place in 1968 whereas Bruno was reportedly acquired by Africa U.S.A. in 1962 and was living at the Africa U.S.A. ranch by 1965.&lt;ref name=joslin /&gt;&lt;ref name=upiobit /&gt; A 1967 interview with ''[[Gentle Ben]]'' actor [[Dennis Weaver]] refers to a bear named "Smokey" that "alternate[d] with Bruno as Gentle Ben" in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Judy. "Umm, That's a Real Bear Hug," ''[[The New York Times]]'', Sept. 17, 1967, p. D27.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Bruno arrived at Africa U.S.A., he was declawed and his teeth were removed,&lt;ref&gt;Goodavage, Maria.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpTeSKkdTE4C&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Animals On Screen and Radio: An Annotated Sourcebook.''] Scarecrow Press, 1994, p. 290. {{ISBN|0-8108-2939-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared on Tors' hit television series ''[[Daktari]]'' as a guest star, playing a sick circus bear who escapes into the African bush.&lt;ref name=woolery /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sansano, Patrick. [http://www.theavengers.fr/index.php/hors-serie/annees-1960/daktari/daktari-saison-2#11 "Daktari - Saison 2 - 11. Tirez à vue (Shoot to Kill)" (episode guide)], theavengers.fr, accessed May 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; An April 1966 article by [[Cleveland Amory]] in ''[[TV Guide]]'' described Bruno as "a 7-foot, 700-pound black bear, perhaps the biggest 'working' bear in the world and yet so gentle children can ride him.'"&lt;ref name=amory /&gt; 

Before he became known as the star of ''Gentle Ben'', Bruno narrowly escaped death or serious injury at least twice. On December 29, 1965, record rains caused an 8-foot-deep flash flood at the Africa U.S.A. compound in Soledad Canyon. The vast majority of animals were saved, but Bruno was washed away and could not be found after the floodwaters subsided. The Ivan Tors production unit, via radio and newspapers, asked area residents not to shoot him on sight, and assured the public that he had no teeth and was "harmless and just loves Cokes or fruit."&lt;ref name=harmless /&gt; A few days later, Bruno returned to the ranch of his own accord and scratched at his cage to be let back in. He was several pounds lighter and covered with mud, but in good health.&lt;ref name=amory /&gt;&lt;ref name=helfer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helfer's account in ''Beauty and the Beasts'' appears to conflate the 1965 flood with another separate flood that occurred in 1969 in which Bruno was not involved. Contemporaneous news sources support that the flood that affected Bruno occurred in December 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Wild Animals On Loose: Swept Away By Los Angeles Floods", ''Eureka Humboldt Standard'', Jan. 18, 1966, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 12, 1966, a runaway [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] [[locomotive]] (or according to some accounts, a flatcar carrying a steam-powered crane) suddenly derailed and crushed several cages in the Africa U.S.A. compound, killing a railroad employee. Bruno's cage was demolished, but he was unharmed because his trainers had taken him out of the cage for a walk shortly before the accident occurred.&lt;ref name=helfer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UPI, "Trainman Killed, 18 Animals Hurt In Wreck", ''Redlands Daily Facts'', July 13, 1966, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Gentle Ben'' ===
[[File:Gentle Ben premiere Clint Howard 1967.JPG|thumb|Clint Howard as "Mark Wedloe" with Bruno the Bear as "Ben" in 1967]]
Bruno rose to fame when he appeared in the leading role of the adult Ben the bear in Tors' 1967 feature film ''[[Gentle Giant (film)|Gentle Giant]]'' and the 1967-1969 [[CBS]] television series based on the film, ''[[Gentle Ben]]''. The film and series concern the adventures of a large male bear named Ben and his human companion Mark Wedloe, a little boy whose father is a [[game warden|wildlife officer]] in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]]. Bruno traveled to Florida to film the series, and had difficulty adjusting to the heat, causing him to lose weight and necessitating trips back to Africa U.S.A. to get him back in shape.&lt;ref name=melting /&gt; Following a January 1969 flood which severely damaged Africa U.S.A., he was permanently relocated to Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Annino, J.G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1CwV-tKzorsC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Florida's Famous Animals: True Stories of Sunset Sam the Dolphin, Snooty the Manatee, Big Guy the Panther, and Others.''] Morris Book Publishing, 2008, p. 21. {{ISBN|978-0-7627-4136-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several bears were used to play the adult Ben depending on the desired behavior for a scene (for example, different bears were used for running, fighting, and swimming), Bruno was the favorite due to his large size, relatively docile temperament, broad range of behaviors, facial expressions, and ability to work well with children.&lt;ref name=helfer /&gt;&lt;ref name=brickell /&gt; Helfer said that "Bruno did most of his own work," including riding the [[airboat]] shown in the series, doing his own "attacks", and "grabbing the bad guy."&lt;ref name=beck /&gt; According to actor [[Clint Howard]], who co-starred as Mark in the film and series, Bruno, along with a bear named Buck that was used for running scenes because Bruno did not like to run,&lt;ref name=woolery /&gt; did 75% of the work. Howard, who was a young child between 6 and 10 years old when working with Bruno,&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Rance. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bm_QuZUPP9IC&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Clint Howard Tames a Gentle Giant"], in ''Tales from the Casting Couch'' (ed. Michael Viner and Terrie Maxine Frankel). Phoenix Books, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; said that he never had any trouble working with him except once when Bruno sat on him and had to be gotten off by the trainers.&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;

Bruno was known for his prodigious appetite, with [[Coca-Cola]], fruit and [[Tootsie Roll|Tootsie Rolls]]&lt;ref name=harmless /&gt;&lt;ref name=madsen&gt;Madsen, Axel. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tG7kBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT248#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''John Huston: A Biography'' (eBook edition).] Open Road Media, 2015 (original publication Doubleday, 1978), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loper&gt;Loper, Mary Lou. "Bachelors Grin and Bear It at Circus Ball," ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Mar. 26, 1973, p. F1.&lt;/ref&gt;  being among his favorite foods. When a script called for him to reject his food, he continued to eat despite being fed large meals beforehand and the crew covering the food used in the scene with [[cold cream]] and [[Chanel No. 5]]. He also frequently stole cigarettes from the cast and crew and ate them. Helfer said, "We had a game we played during lunch. We would run around [Bruno] in a circle, and he would catch us in his arms, and we would wrestle, which was fun. When he got tired, he would sit on you."&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;

During the 1967-1969 run of the series, Bruno's name in articles and other publicity materials was briefly changed to "Ben" or sometimes "Gentle Ben".&lt;ref name=namechange /&gt; After the series ended, his name was changed back to Bruno.&lt;ref name=gunsmoke&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H4JWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HEENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4921%2C3500754 "Bruno Objected to Heat in 'Gunsmoke'"], ''[[The Robesonian]]'' (Lumberton, N.C.), Aug. 5, 1973, TV Showtime section, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  (In addition to Bruno, other bears who had appeared in or been involved with the series were also publicly exhibited under the name "Gentle Ben" throughout the late 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;) 

Several trainers were involved with the ''Gentle Giant'' film and/or the ''Gentle Ben'' TV show, but most of the day-to-day work on the show with Bruno was handled by Monty Cox and Vern Debord.&lt;ref name=tvguide /&gt;&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;&lt;ref name=woolery /&gt; Head trainer Cox lived with Bruno in a Miami apartment in order to give him the necessary affection and attention he needed. According to Cox, Bruno sometimes followed him into the shower and slept in his bed.&lt;ref&gt;Rothel, David. ''The Great Show Business Animals.'' Gazelle Book Services Ltd., 1981, p. 193-194. {{ISBN|0498025195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-''Gentle Ben'' career ===

After the ''Gentle Ben'' TV series ended in 1969, Bruno moved back to the Soledad Canyon area near Saugus and [[Acton, California]], with trainer Ron Oxley, who had worked as a trainer on ''Gentle Ben'' and was now setting up his own business, Action Animals, to provide trained animals for film and TV work.&lt;ref&gt;"Wild Animals Will Get New Home", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Feb. 22, 1972, p.

In November 1972, Bruno received publicity for appearing in an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' entitled "Tatum" (Season 18, Episode 10). Due to the desert location, Bruno's scenes had to be shot in the early morning before the ground got too hot for his paws. By this point, Bruno was being credited with over 400 television appearances.&lt;ref name=gunsmoke /&gt;

Bruno again made news for his appearance as Watch Bear (aka Zachary Taylor), the bear companion of Judge [[Roy Bean]] played by [[Paul Newman]] in the 1972 [[John Huston]]-directed film ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]''. The bear character was a fictionalized version of a real pet black bear, coincidentally also named "Bruno", that the real-life Judge Roy Bean had kept while serving as a justice of the peace in [[Langtry, Texas]], in the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Mike.

Other feature films in which Bruno appeared included the family adventure movie ''[[The Adventures of the Wilderness Family]]'' (1975), the [[horror film]] ''[[Shadow of the Hawk]]'' (1976) starring [[Jan-Michael Vincent]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcollections.mypubliclibrary.com/c/Henderson-Home-News/view/2764/page/12/?q= "Trucks, Wild Horses, Mean Marines, and Now Evil Spirits vs. Actor Vincent,"] ''Henderson Home News and Boulder City News'', May 12, 1977, p. 12, archived online at mypubliclibrary.com, accessed May 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[TV movie]] ''Guardian of the Wilderness'' (1976), a [[biopic]] of [[Yosemite National Park]] protector [[Galen Clark]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;"Dogs Top Animal Nominees", ''[[San Mateo County Times]]'', Apr. 22, 1977, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honors and awards ===

In 1968, Bruno won the [[PATSY Award]] in the motion picture category for his work in ''Gentle Giant''. He was also nominated in the TV category for the ''Gentle Ben'' series, but placed second, losing out to Arnold the Pig from ''[[Green Acres]]''.&lt;ref name=beck /&gt; 
 
He was nominated for another PATSY in 1973 for ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]''&lt;ref&gt;AP, "Animal Actors Are Nominated", ''[[La Crosse Tribune]]'' (La Crosse, Wisc.), May 20, 1973, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1977 for ''Guardian of the Wilderness'',&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Answer to Movies' Oscars: PATSY Awards Await Animals in Show Biz," ''Valley News'' (Van Nuys, California), Apr. 26, 1977, Section 1, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not win.&lt;ref name=beck /&gt;

== Death ==

After Ron Oxley's sudden death in 1985,&lt;ref name=upioxobit /&gt; his friend Carol Riggins stated in one of his obituaries that Bruno the bear had died "four or five years ago", which placed Bruno's death in 1980 or 1981 at the age of 18 or 19.&lt;ref name=oxleyobit /&gt;

A '''Character Technical Director''' (TD), also referred to as a '''Creature TD''' ([[Industrial Light &amp; Magic|ILM]], [[Weta Digital|Weta]]) or '''Technical Animator''' ([[Sony Pictures Imageworks|Imageworks]]), is a type of [[technical director]] in film and [[video games]] who is specifically concerned with [[Character (arts)|characters]], creatures, and mechanical objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jeremy Birn|title=What is a Technical Director?|url=http://www.3drender.com/jobs/TD.htm|publisher=3Drender.com|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animation Technical Director|url=http://www.insidejobs.com/careers/animation-technical-director|publisher=Inside Jobs|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The role of a Character TD may vary from studio to studio in its scope, but it is almost always centered around the discipline of [[Rigging (computer graphics)|rigging]]: the process of engineering anatomical or mechanical [[Kinematics|kinematic]] systems that move and deform [[3D modeling|digital model]]s, and the design of higher-level interfaces used by [[computer graphics]] [[animators]] to control the movements of those models.

The role may additionally encompass disciplines such as modeling &amp; simulation.

==Software==
The software used by Character TDs may vary widely from studio to studio, from off-the shelf tools to proprietary in-house systems. [[Autodesk Maya]] is used predominantly throughout the VFX and Animation industry, with [[Autodesk Softimage|Softimage]] also having a large user-base. In the gaming industry, [[Autodesk Maya]] and [[Autodesk 3ds Max]] have been the dominant presence.

Many studios pair off-the-shelf software with their own in-house software and plug-ins for rigging and simulation. For instance, Industrial Light &amp; Magic does much of their sim setup and simulation in a proprietary package called Zeno, and Weta Digital uses an in-house simulation system they call Tissue.

Notable newcomers to the field of rigging include the independent platform [[Fabric Engine]], being used by [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]] and [[Hybride]].

==Notable Character TDs==
Within the VFX, Animation, and Game Development communities, a number of artists have gained name-recognition for their contributions to the field of rigging. A few of those artists include:

===Jason Osipa=== 
An [[Electronic Arts|EA]] and [[LucasArts]] Character TD Known for pioneering and disseminating (through his book "[[Stop Staring: Facial Animation Done Right]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop Staring: Facial Modeling and Animation Done Right|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470609907|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of facial-rigging that did not rely on [[phonemes]] and pre-built expressions, but rather the blending of more generic poses using simplified controls often referred to as [[Osipa-Style control]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Osipa|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0651983/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Jason Schleifer]]=== 
A Weta and Dreamworks Creature TD Known for his video series "Animator Friendly Rigging", wherein he discusses techniques for building complex rigging control systems that are intuitive and easy to use (thus the term "Animator Friendly").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason Schleifer|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0772192/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hans Godard===
A Naughty Dog Character TD Known for his implementation of the Skinning Converter, converting any sequence of meshes to a set of animated Joints and automated Skinning maps.
Another interesting Plugin is the RBF Solver, a global interpolator N-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Godard|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3800858/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Godard ships Skinning Converter for Maya|url=http://www.cgchannel.com/2015/10/hans-godard-releases-skinning-converter-for-maya/|publisher=CG Channel|accessdate=29 January 2016|date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) took its present form on 1 January 1927 when [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Sir John Reith]] became its first Director General. Reith stated that impartiality and objectivity were the essence of professionalism in broadcasting.

Allegations that the corporation lacks impartial and [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] journalism are regularly made by observers, on both the left and right of the political spectrum.

Another key area of criticism is the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|mandatory licence fee]], as commercial competitors argue that this means of financing is unfair and has the result of limiting their ability to compete with the corporation. Also, accusations of waste or over-staffing occasionally prompt comments from politicians and the rest of the media.

== 20th century ==

=== The Thatcher government ===
Accusations of a left-wing bias were often made against the Corporation by members of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s 1980s Conservative government. [[Norman Tebbit]] called the BBC the "Stateless Person's Broadcasting Corporation" because of what he regarded as its unpatriotic and neutral coverage of the [[Falklands War]], and Conservative MP [[Peter Bruinvels]] called it the "Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/opinion/748/where-are-they-now.thtml|title=Where are they now?|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=27 October 2008|first=Paul|last=Linford|work=[[Total Politics]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105182710/http://www.totalpolitics.com/opinion/748/where-are-they-now.thtml|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Barnett wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2001 that in 1983, [[Stuart Young (1934–1986)|Stuart Young]], the "accountant and brother of one of Thatcher's staunchest cabinet allies", [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]], was appointed as BBC chairman. After him, in 1986, came [[Marmaduke Hussey]], a "brother-in-law of another Cabinet Minister. ... According to the then-Tory party chairman, Norman Tebbit, Hussey was appointed 'to get in there and sort the place out'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/sep/23/business.broadcasting | title= Right man, right time, for all the right reasons | first= Steven |last=Barnett | date = 23 September 2001 |work=[[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies continued with the likes of the ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'' general election special with Thatcher in 1983, a ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' documentary called [[Maggie's Militant Tendency]], the ''Real Lives'' interview with [[Martin McGuinness]], the BBC's coverage of the United States' [[1986 Bombing of Libya]] and the [[Zircon affair]]. In 1987, the Director-General of the BBC [[Alasdair Milne]] was forced to resign. Thatcher later said: "I have fought three elections against the BBC and don't want to fight another against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/aspidistra/bbcthatcher.php |title=BBC Under Fire – 80s Style |first=Glenn |last=Aylett |work=transdiffusion.org |accessdate=24 January 2014 |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514074244/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/aspidistra/bbcthatcher.php |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df=dmy }}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Tebbit said: "The BBC was always against Lady Thatcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5114946.stm | title= Cameron scolded over Ross show |work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=25 June 2006 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Thompson (media executive)|Mark Thompson]], Director General of the BBC said in 2010 "In the BBC I joined 30 years ago [as a production trainee, in 1979], there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people's personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left. The organisation did struggle then with impartiality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/09/lecture-thompson-bbc-interview|first=James|last=MacIntyre|title=Mark Thompson: "There was massive left-wing bias at the BBC"|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=2 September 2010|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st century ==
[[BBC News]] forms a major department of the Corporation, and receives many complaints of bias. The [[Centre for Policy Studies]] has stated that, "Since at least the mid-1980s, the Corporation has often been criticised for a perceived bias against those on the centre-right of politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.org.uk/cpsfile.asp?id=521 |title=BBC Bias?

Former political editor [[Andrew Marr]] argued in 2006 that the liberal bias of the BBC is the product of the types of people the Corporation employs, and is thus cultural not political.&lt;ref name="MoSBiasedBBC"/&gt; In 2011, [[Peter Oborne]] wrote in his ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' blog, "Rather than representing the nation as a whole, it [the BBC] has become a vital resource – and sometimes attack weapon – for a narrow, arrogant Left-Liberal elite".&lt;ref name="Oborne"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100113804/coming-to-the-bbc-an-everyday-story-of-bias-and-falling-standards/ |date=27 October 2011 |title=Coming to the BBC, an everyday story of bias and falling standards |first=Peter|last=Oborne|authorlink=Peter Oborne |work=The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=27 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to journalists at a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch in 2009, [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]], the [[Shadow Cabinet]] [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], claimed that BBC News needed more people from the centre-right "I wish they would go and actively look for some Conservatives to be part of their news-gathering team, because they have acknowledged that one of their problems is that people who want to work at the Corporation tend to be from the centre-left. That's why they have this issue with what Andrew Marr called an innate liberal bias."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/24/bbc-news-tories-jeremy-hunt |title=BBC News needs more Tories, says shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt |work=The Guardian |first=Leigh |last=Holmwood |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentators have taken the opposite view and criticised the BBC for being part of [[The Establishment]]. The commentator [[Mehdi Hasan]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' pointed out the right-wing backgrounds of many BBC presenters and journalists, querying why even many "liberals and leftists" accept the right's description of BBC bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mehdi|last=Hasan|authorlink=Mehdi Hasan |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/08/mehdi-hasan-bbc-wing-bias-corporation |title=Bias and the Beeb |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=29 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guardian'' columnist [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] is also of the opinion that the BBC is biased towards the right owing to numerous key posts being filled by Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/17/bbc-leftwing-bias-non-existent-myth|title=It's the BBC's rightwing bias that is the threat to democracy and journalism|last=Jones|first=Owen|work=The Guardian|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by [[Cardiff University]] academics, funded by the [[BBC Trust]], was published in August 2013, examining the BBC's coverage of a broad range of issues. One of the findings was the dominance of party political sources. In coverage of immigration, the EU and religion, these accounted for 49.4% of all source appearances in 2007 and 54.8% in 2012. The data also showed that the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] received significantly more airtime than the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In 2012 Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] outnumbered Labour leader [[Ed Miliband]] in appearances by a factor of nearly four to one (53 to 15), while Conservative cabinet members and ministers outnumbered their Labour counterparts by more than four to one (67 to 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berry |first=Mike |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/broadcast/2013/08/hard-evidence-how-biased-bbc  |title=Hard Evidence: How biased is the BBC? |work=New Statesman |date=23 August 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Director General of the BBC, [[Greg Dyke]], has criticised the BBC as part of a "Westminster conspiracy" to maintain the British political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8265628.stm |title=Dyke in BBC 'conspiracy' claim |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2009 |first=Brian |last=Wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political correctness ===
On Friday 22 September 2004 the BBC's Board of Governors held an impartiality seminar which was streamed live on the Internet. The previous day the then Chairman of the Governors, [[Michael Grade]], explained the thinking behind the seminar in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="Grade2004"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael | last=Grade |authorlink=Michael Grade |title=The digital challenge |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 September 2004 | url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,1877575,00.html |accessdate=25 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced in the same article that a live stream of the seminar would be available on the BBC Governors' website.&lt;ref name="Grade2004"/&gt;

In the seminar there was a hypothetical discussion including senior BBC executives about what they would allow controversial Jewish comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] to throw into a dustbin on the satirical television show ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]''. It was imagined that Baron Cohen would wish to throw into Room 101 [[kosher]] food, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Quran]], and the [[Bible]]. Most at the summit agreed that all would be permissible – except for the Quran. There was also a hypothetical discussion about whether a Muslim BBC newsreader should be allowed to wear a veil.&lt;ref name="MoSBiasedBBC"/&gt;

In the seminar former BBC business editor [[Jeff Randall]] claimed he was told by a senior news executive in the organisation that "The BBC is not neutral in [[multiculturalism]]: it believes in it and it promotes it." The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' claimed in 2006 that Andrew Marr stated, "The BBC is not impartial or neutral. It's a publicly funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] and gay people. It has a liberal bias not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias".&lt;ref name="MoSBiasedBBC"/&gt;

These comments were reported in the UK national press a couple of weeks later. At the seminar [[Helen Boaden]] (Director of BBC News) said that the BBC must be impartial on the issue of multiculturalism. Boaden responded to press criticism of the seminar in a post on the BBC's Editors' Blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2006/10/bias_at_the_bbc.html |title=Bias at the BBC? |first=Helen |last=Boaden |authorlink=Helen Boaden |work=BBC blogs |date=24 October 2006 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Thompson responded to press criticism in an article in the ''Daily Mail'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Thompson |authorlink=Mark Thompson (television executive) |title=BBC closes door on newsreaders in Muslim veils |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date = 29 October 2006 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=413190&amp;in_page_id=1770 |accessdate=15 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Mark Byford]] in an interview in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Hastings |title=BBC 'not crammed full of soft liberals' says deputy chief |work=[[Sunday Telegraph]] |date=30 October 2006 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/10/29/ncannon129.xml |accessdate=15 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racism ===
The BBC has also been accused of racism. In a speech to the [[Royal Television Society]] in 2008, [[Lenny Henry]] said that ethnic minorities were "pitifully underserved" in television comedy and that little had changed at senior levels in terms of ethnic representation during his 32 years in television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7234895.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=TV is too white, Lenny Henry says |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy McGovern]] in a 2007 interview called the BBC "one of the most racist institutions in England".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6973335.stm |title=TV's McGovern calls BBC 'racist' |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, BBC director-general Greg Dyke said that the BBC was "hideously white", and acknowledged difficulties with "race relations". He acknowledged that it was having difficulties in retaining minority staff and outlined plans towards solving these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dyke: BBC is 'hideously white' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/1104305.stm |accessdate=31 October 2012 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=6 January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rageh Omaar]], the [[Somali people|Somali]]-born British journalist and former BBC war correspondent who reported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/itv-fails-in-bid-to-woo-rageh-omaar/1089351.article |title= ITV fails in bid to woo Rageh Omaar |first= |last= |publisher=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]] |date=26 February 2004 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; called BBC a "white man’s club" after he resigned to join [[Al-Jazeera]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-19/rageh-omaar-i-once-said-you-couldnt-get-on-in-the-media-unless-you-were-white-and-middle-class-not-much-has-changed |title= Rageh Omaar: I once said you couldn't get on in the media unless you were white and middle class. Not much has changed |first= |last= |publisher=[[Radio Times]] |date=19 October 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2007, while being interviewed by [[Hannah Pool]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'', he accused the BBC of [[classism]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/15/broadcasting.bbc |title= Question time: Rageh Omaar  |first= |last= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC, which is legally obliged to be an equal opportunities employer, is striving for 12.5% of its staff to be from a black or minority ethnic background (12% at 31 January 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/diversity.shtml |title=About the BBC – Policy on diversity and equal opportunities |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=24 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2014}} The BBC's buildings are largely based in urban areas with a more diverse demography than the UK as a whole (30% ethnic minority population in London and about 15% in the Manchester/Salford area), whereas the 12.5% figure is over 4% higher than the current percentage of ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom as a whole. However, it has been argued that many of its ethnic minority members of staff are cleaners and security guards and not presenters and programme makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/04/nbbc04.xml |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |title=Black staff at the BBC are mainly cleaners and guards, says Ross |first1=Chris |last1= Hastings |first2=Jasper |last2=Copping |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported: "The BBC has pledged to increase the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people on air by more than 40% over the next three years and almost double the number of senior managers from those groups who work at the corporation by 2020."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tara | last=Conlan |title=BBC director general launches new diversity plan for corporation |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 June 2014 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/20/bbc-director-general-diversity-plan-minorities-on-air }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indarjit Singh, chief of Britain's Network of Sikh Organisations, criticised the [[BBC Asian Network]], a radio station intended for an audience of South Asian origin, saying "Stations like BBC Asian Network do little to encourage integration and social cohesion because they allow communities to ghettoise themselves".&lt;ref name=sikh/&gt;

=== Homophobia ===
''[[The Independent]]'' reported the findings of a [[University of Leeds]] study in March 2006 which accused the BBC of being "institutionally homophobic" towards the &lt;!-- The source does not refer directly to the LGBT spectrum, the nearest is "lesbian and gays, references to them, or related issues." --&gt;[[LGBT community]]. The Leeds researchers found that 80% of portrayals by the BBC of those who are lesbian or gay were negative and accounted for just 0.4% of output. Focus groups used in the study accused the BBC of being the worst broadcaster in terms of gay and lesbian issues and their portrayal of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbc-accused-of-institutionalised-homophobia-468079.html |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Maxine |last=Frith |date=1 March 2006 |title=BBC accused of 'institutionalised homophobia' |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century'' ===
A report commissioned by the BBC Trust, ''Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/18_06_07impartialitybbc.pdf |title=From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel: Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century |publisher=[[BBC Trust]] |format=PDF |date=June 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in June 2007, stressed that the BBC needed to take more care in being impartial. It said the BBC broke its own guidelines by screening an episode of ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'' that promoted the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6763205.stm |title=BBC 'must become more impartial' |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=18 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bias was explained as the result of the BBC's liberal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1942948.ece |title=BBC report damns its 'culture of bias' |work=[[The Times]] |date=17 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A transcript of the impartiality seminar is included as a separately published appendix to the report available via the BBC Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/other/century21.shtml |title=From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel: Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century |publisher=[[BBC Trust]] |date=18 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After press reports emerged that BBC employees had edited the Wikipedia article's coverage of the report, the BBC issued new guidelines banning BBC staff from "sanitising" Wikipedia articles about the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8637867/Official-BBC-Twitter-rules-tell-staff-Dont-do-anything-stupid.html |title=Official BBC Twitter rules tell staff: 'Don't do anything stupid' |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |first=John |last=Bingham }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration and the European Union ===
In 2005, two independent reports deemed the BBC's coverage of the [[European Union]] to be rather inadequate and one of the reports noted a "cultural and unintentional bias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two reports accuse BBC of bias in EU coverage|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/two-reports-accuse-bbc-of-bias-in-eu-coverage-7170654.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=28 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/editorial_standards/impartiality/breadth_opinion.html |title=Trust review of the breadth of opinion reflected in the BBC's output |first=Stuart |last=Prebble |authorlink=Stuart Prebble |date=3 July 2013 |work=[[BBC Trust]] |accessdate=16 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned by the BBC Trust found that the organisation had been slow to reflect widespread public concerns about [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since Irish independence|immigration to the UK]], and shifts in public attitudes within the UK towards the [[European Union]]. The report, by [[Stuart Prebble]], stated that [[Helen Boaden]], the former director of [[BBC News]], had said that when she arrived at the organisation there had been a "deep liberal bias" in the handling of immigration issues. It also stated that, within the BBC, "the agenda of debate is probably too driven by the views of politicians", but that "overall the breadth of opinion reflected by the BBC on this subject is broad and impressive, and no persuasive evidence was found that significant areas of opinion are not given due weight today." It also stated that the BBC was "slow to give appropriate prominence to the growing weight of opinion [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|opposing UK membership of the EU]], but in more recent times has achieved a better balance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10157478/BBC-did-not-reflect-public-view-on-immigration-because-of-deep-liberal-bias-says-review.html |first=Rowena |last=Mason |title=BBC did not reflect public view on immigration because of 'deep liberal bias', says review |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/03/bbc-deep-liberal-bias-immigration |first=Josh |last=Halliday |title=BBC had 'deep liberal bias' over immigration, says former news chief |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To contrast, in 2018, former BBC (now ITV) journalist [[Robert Peston]] accused the organisation of not being "confident enough" in pointing out false arguments during the campaign, and giving a [[false balance]] of impartiality. Peston said that the organisation "put people on with diametrically opposed views and didn't give their viewers and listeners any help in assessing which one was the loony and which one was the genius. ... Impartial journalism is not giving equal airtime to two people one of whom says the world is flat and the other one says the world is round".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Mark |title=Robert Peston: BBC not impartial during EU referendum campaign |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/06/robert-peston-bbc-not-impartial-during-eu-referendum-campaign |accessdate=6 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific allegations==

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===
Criticism of the BBC's Middle East coverage from supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians led the BBC to commission an investigation and report from a senior broadcast journalist [[Malcolm Balen]], referred to as [[the Balen Report]] and completed in 2004. The BBC's refusal to release the report under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] resulted in a long-running and ongoing legal case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=43053&amp;c=1 Lords rule Balen report was wrongly blocked under FoI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306015459/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=43053&amp;c=1 |date=6 March 2012 }} [[Press Gazette]] 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/11/balen-report-bbc-timeline Timeline: The battle to make BBC publish Middle East coverage report] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This led to speculation that the report was damning, as well as to accusations of hypocrisy, as the BBC frequently made use itself of Freedom of Information Act requests when researching news stories.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-444074/BBC-pays-200-000-cover-report-anti-Israel-bias.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |title=BBC pays £200,000 to 'cover up report on anti-Israel bias' |first=Paul |last=Revoir |date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Balen report, the BBC appointed a committee chosen by the Governors and referred to by the BBC as an "independent panel report" to write a report for publication which was completed in 2006. Chaired by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] president, Sir [[Quentin Thomas]], the committee found that "apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias" in the BBC's reporting of the middle east. However, their coverage had been "inconsistent," "not always providing a complete picture" and "misleading", and that the BBC failed to adequately report the hardships of Palestinians living under occupation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=3 May 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/03/israel.broadcasting?INTCMP=SRCH|title=BBC's coverage of Israeli-Palestinian conflict 'misleading|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciar|date=3 May 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbc-is-criticised-for-misleading-coverage-of-middle-east-476582.html|title=BBC is criticised for misleading coverage of Middle East|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting concerns from all sides of the conflict, the committee highlighted certain identifiable shortcomings and made four recommendations, including the provision of a stronger editorial "guiding hand".

Of the report's findings regarding the dearth of BBC reporting of the difficulties faced by the Palestinians, [[Richard Ingrams]] wrote in ''The Independent'' that "No sensible person could quarrel with that judgement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingrams|first=Richard|date=6 May 2006|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/richard-ingrams-week-wheres-les-dawson-when-you-need-him-477014.html |title=Richard Ingrams' Week: It doesn't take much to be branded anti-Semitic|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Walker (reporter)|Martin Walker]], then the editor of [[United Press International]], agreed that the report implied favouritism towards Israel, but said this suggestion "produced mocking guffaws in my newsroom" and went on to list a number of episodes of (in his view) clear pro-Palestinian bias on the part of the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article715471.ece |work=[[Sunday Times]] |title=The BBC pro-Israeli?

Former BBC Middle East correspondent Tim Llewellyn wrote in 2004 that the BBC's coverage allowed an Israeli view of the conflict to dominate, as demonstrated by research conducted by the [[Glasgow Media Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/20/israel.broadcasting |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=The story TV news won't tell |date=20 June 2004 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |first=Tim |last=Llewellyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Davis, the London correspondent of ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', has accused the BBC of being anti-[[Israel]]. He wrote that the BBC's coverage of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] was a "portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors" and resembled a "campaign of vilification" that had de-legitimised the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Davis130"&gt;Davis, Douglas.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' has criticised the BBC for its coverage of the Middle East. In 2007, the newspaper wrote, "In its international and domestic news reporting, the corporation has consistently come across as naïve and partial, rather than sensitive and unbiased. Its reporting of Israel and Palestine, in particular, tends to underplay the hate-filled Islamist ideology that inspires Hamas and other factions, while never giving Israel the benefit of the doubt."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/08/20/dl2001.xml Terror victims are BBC licence-payers, too] 20 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, [[Natan Sharansky]] who was then Israel's minister for diaspora affairs wrote to the BBC accusing its Middle East correspondent, [[Orla Guerin]], as having a "deep-seated bias against Israel" following her description of the Israeli army's handling of the arrest of [[Hussam Abdo]], who was captured with explosives strapped to his chest, as "cynical manipulation of a Palestinian youngster for propaganda purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=BBC accused of bias against Israel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/01/bbc.israel|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 April 2004|date=1 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006 a report about the Arab-Israeli conflict on the BBC's online service was criticised in a BBC Governors Report as unbalanced and creating a biased impression. The article's account of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] in 1967 concerning the [[Six-Day War]] between Israel and a coalition of Egypt, Jordan and Syria "suggested the UN called for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from territories seized during the six-day war, when in fact, it called for a negotiated 'land for peace' settlement between Israel and 'every state in the area'. The committee considered that by selecting only references to Israel, the article had breached editorial standards on both accuracy and impartiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowell|first=Ben|title=BBC online censured for biased Israel story |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/08/digitalmedia.middleeastthemedia|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 March 2006|date=8 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=4&amp;x_outlet=12&amp;x_article=1096 "BBC Partially Revises Biased Timeline on Web site"], CAMERA, 10 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2008, news anchor Geeta Guru-Murthy clarified significant errors in the BBC's coverage of the [[Mercaz HaRav massacre]] that had been exposed by media monitor [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]]. Correspondent Nick Miles had informed viewers that "hours after the attack, Israeli bulldozers destroyed his [the perpetrator's] family home." This was not the case, and other broadcasters showed the east Jerusalem home to be intact and the family commemorating their son's actions.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Jonny|title=BBC admits inaccuracies in coverage|url=http://www.jpost.com/International//Article.aspx?id=95809|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=22 March 2008|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2008, the BBC accepted that in an article on their website of an IDF operation that stated "The Israeli air force said it was targeting a rocket firing team. ... UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has condemned Israel's attacks on Palestinian civilians, calling them inappropriate and disproportionate", they should have made reference to what [Ban] said about Palestinian rocket attacks as well as to the excessive use of force by Israel. The article was additionally amended to remove the reference of Israeli 'attacks on civilians' as Ban Ki-Moon's attributed comments were made weeks earlier to the UN Security Council, and not in reference to that particular attack, and in fact, he had never used such terminology.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

The BBC received intense criticism in January 2009 for its decision not to broadcast a television appeal by aid agencies on behalf of the people of Gaza during the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]], on the grounds that it could compromise the BBC's journalistic impartiality. A number of protesters asserted that this showed pro-Israeli bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dearden |first1=Lizzie |title=Hundreds protest against 'BBC pro-Israel bias'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hundreds-protest-against-bbc-pro-israel-bias-of-gaza-coverage-in-cities-across-the-uk-9609016.html|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some analysts suggested that the BBC's decision in this matter derived from its concern to avoid anti-Israeli bias as analysed in the Balen report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23628970-details/The+secret+report+at+heart+of+BBC%E2%80%99s+Gaza+paranoia/article.do The secret report at heart of BBC's Gaza paranoia] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120919102629/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23628970-details/The+secret+report+at+heart+of+BBC%E2%80%99s+Gaza+paranoia/article.do |date=19 September 2012 }} ''[[Evening Standard]]'' 27 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Parties criticising the decision, included [[Church of England]] archbishops, British government ministers and even some BBC employees. More than 11,000 complaints were filed in a three-day span. The BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, explained that the corporation had a duty to cover the Gaza dispute in a "balanced, objective way", and was concerned about endorsing something that could "suggest the backing one side".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/world/europe/27britain.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bbc%20gaza&amp;st=cse "BBC Assailed for Refusing to Carry Gaza Appeal."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 26 January 2009. Retrieved on 28 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians such as [[Tony Benn]] broke the corporation's ban on the appeal and broadcast the Gaza appeal on [[BBC News]], saying that "If the BBC won't broadcast the appeal, then I'm going to do it myself", and adding that "no one [working for the broadcaster] agrees with what the BBC has done".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tony Benn launches own Gaza appeal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/mediamonkeyblog/2009/jan/26/tony-benn-launches-own-gaza-appeal|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohamed ElBaradei]], head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], protested the BBC's decision by cancelling interviews scheduled with the company; ElBaradei claimed the refusal to air the aid appeal "violates the rules of basic human decency which are there to help vulnerable people irrespective of who is right or wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7856213.stm |title=IAEA head boycotts BBC over Gaza |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=11 August 2009 |date=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC's chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson, affirmed the need to broadcast "without affecting and impinging on the audience's perception of our impartiality" and that in this case, it was a "real issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest over BBC Gaza appeal veto|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7848614.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 January 2009|date=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to perceived falsehoods and distortions in a BBC One ''Panorama'' documentary entitled 'A Walk in the Park', transmitted in January 2010, British journalist [[Melanie Phillips]] wrote an open letter in news magazine ''[[The Spectator]]'' to the Secretary of State for Culture, Jeremy Hunt, accusing the BBC of "flagrantly biased reporting of Israel" and urged the BBC to confront the "prejudice and inertia which are combining to turn its reporting on Israel into crude pro-Arab propaganda, and thus risk destroying the integrity of an institution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An open letter to the Culture Secretary|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/6862780/an-open-letter-to-the-culture-secretary.thtml|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=12 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228140714/http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/6862780/an-open-letter-to-the-culture-secretary.thtml|archivedate=28 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the BBC was accused of pro-Israel bias in its documentary about the [[Gaza flotilla raid]]. The BBC documentary concluded that Israeli forces had faced a violent premeditated attack by a group of hardcore IHH activists, who intended to orchestrate a political act to put pressure on Israel. The programme was criticised as "biased" by critics of Israel and the PSC (Palestine Solidarity Campaign) questioned why the IDF boarded the ship at night if it had peaceful intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Paul |first=Jonny |date=20 August 2010 |title=BBC's flotilla film slammed as 'biased' |url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=185381 |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitness Ken O'Keefe accused the BBC of distorting the capture, medical treatment and ultimate release of three Israeli commandos into a story of heroic self-rescuing commandos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeerah.info/Opinion%20Editorials/2010/August/19%20o/BBC%20Panorama%20on%20the%20Mavi%20Marmara%20Massacre%20Is%20Israeli%20Propaganda%20By%20Gilad%20Atzmon%20and%20Ken%20O'Keefe.htm |title=BBC Panorama on the Mavi Marmara Massacre Is Israeli Propaganda|date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Lawson produced a 15-minute video detailing the BBC's alleged bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrD9PRKRqRA |title=BBC Bias: Panorama Death in the Med|date=16 August 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Member of Parliament [[Louise Bagshawe]] criticised the inaccuracies and omissions in BBC's coverage of the [[Itamar massacre]] and questioned the BBC's decision not to broadcast this incident on television and barely on radio, and its apparent bias against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8402973/A-family-slaughtered-in-Israel-doesnt-the-BBC-care.html |title=A family slaughtered in Israel – doesn't the BBC care? |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 March 2011 |first=Louise |last=Bagshawe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his July 2012 testimony to the Parliament, the outgoing Director-General of the BBC [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] admitted that BBC "got it wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/bbc-official-admits-the-network-got-it-wrong-on-fogel-murders/ |title=BBC chief admits the network ‘got it wrong’ on Fogel murders|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=24 January 2014 |agency=JTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A BBC Editorial Standards Findings issued in July 2011 found that a broadcast on Today on 27 September 2010 that stated "At midnight last night, the moratorium on Israelis building new settlements in the West Bank came to an end. It had lasted for ten months", had breached the Accuracy guideline in respect of the requirement to present output "in clear, precise language", as in fact the moratorium on building new settlements had been in existence since the early 1990s and remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeals to the Trust and other editorial issues considered by the Editorial Standards Committee|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2011/jun.txt|publisher=Editorial Standards Committee|accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the BBC caused further controversy after censoring the word 'Palestine' from a song played on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/182443/ |title=BBC defends decision to censor the word "Palestine" |work=[[New Statesman]] |first=Samera |last=Shackle |date=2 February 2012|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/13/bbc-palestine-lyric-mic-righteous |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Juliette |last=Garside |title=BBC under fire for 'censoring' Palestine lyric |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 Summer Olympics, on their country profiles pages, the BBC listed "East Jerusalem" as the capital of Palestine, and did not list a capital at all for Israel. After public outrage and a letter from Israeli government spokesperson [[Mark Regev]], the BBC listed a "Seat of Government" for Israel in Jerusalem, while adding that most foreign embassies "are in Tel Aviv". It made a parallel change to the listing for "Palestine", listing "East Jerusalem" as the "Intended seat of government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://honestreporting.com/update-fight-over-bbc-olympic-coverage-intensifies/ |title=Fight Over BBC Olympic Coverage Intensifies |publisher=HonestReporting |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a response to a reader's criticism on the issue, the BBC replied that the complaints that prompted the changes were "generated by online lobby activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/70375/bbc-claims-online-lobby-generated-complaints-over-refusal-identify-israels-capita |title=BBC claims 'online lobby' generated complaints over refusal to identify Israel's capital |work=[[Jewish Chronicle]] |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |first=Marcus |last=Dysch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC was also noted for having no coverage whatsoever about the campaign{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} for the IOC to commemorate the 11 killed Israeli athletes from the [[Munich massacre]] in the 1972 Summer Olympics, which was met with repeated refusal by IOC President Jacques Rogge, despite the issue receiving much press by other major news networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/21/olympics-opening-ceremony-israel-munich-ioc-deny_n_1692378.html |work=[[Huffington Post]] |title=Moment Of Silence For 1972 Munich Victims Denied |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |first=Stephen |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/sport/olympics-munich-silence/index.html |work=CNN |title=Olympics head rejects silence for Israeli victims |date=23 July 2012 |first=Richard Allen |last=Greene |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the poll conducted by Jewish Policy Research on more than 4,000 respondents, nearly 80% of British Jews believes that BBC is biased against Israel. Only 14% of British Jews believes that BBC coverage of Israel is "balanced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/105966/we-think-bbc-news-biased-against-israel-%E2%80%94-watch-it-anyway |title=We think BBC news is biased against Israel — but watch it anyway|work=[[Jewish Chronicle]] |date=18 April 2013 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |last=Rocker |first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the BBC scheduled to broadcast a documentary film, ''Jerusalem: an Archaeological Mystery Story'', but pulled the film "off the schedule at the last minute." The film "theorizes that many Jews did not leave Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple, and that many modern-day Palestinians may be in part descended from those Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/culture/article/bbc_slammed_for_pulling_documentary_on_jewish_exodus_from_jerusalem|title=BBC slammed for pulling documentary on Jewish exodus from Jerusalem|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=24 January 2014|agency=JTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Plosker of HonestReporting believed that the decision was made not to offend people who are ideologically opposed to Israel by broadcasting a documentary about Jewish history in the region. The BBC's explanation for the sudden schedule change was that the film did not fit with the theme of the season, which was archaeology.

In 2014, an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' by Raphael Cohen-Almagor criticised BBC for avoiding the word 'terrorism' in connection with violent acts or groups of people considered by various governments or intergovernmental organizations to be terrorists. Cohen-Almagor wrote: "Instead of adhering to one principled definition of terrorism and then employing it across the board, the BBC prefers to sit on the fence, so as to say that it is impossible to differentiate between terrorists and 'freedom fighters', that one person's terrorist might be another's 'freedom fighter'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen-Almagor|first1=Raphael|title=BBC's world without terror|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/BBCs-world-without-terror-384993|accessdate=21 December 2014|agency=The Jerusalem Post|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, protesters presented an [[open letter]] from the [[Palestinian Solidarity Foundation]], [[Stop the War Coalition]], the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and other groups to Lord Hall, Director General of the BBC; the letter accused the broadcaster of presenting Israeli attacks on Gaza as a result of rocket fire from [[Hamas]], without giving any other context. This letter was signed by notable individuals, such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Ken Loach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sign our open letter to the BBC|url=http://www.palestinecampaign.org/sign-open-letter-bbc/|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=Palestinian Solidarity Campaign|date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Fraser Steel]] – head of the Editorial Complaints Unit of the BBC – upheld complaints that it had breached impartiality guidelines in an interview with [[Moshe Ya'alon]], who was then the Israeli defence minister.&lt;ref name=72a5&gt;[http://on.rt.com/su2rza "BBC admits Israeli defense minister interview breached impartiality rules "], ''RT International'', 3 June 2015. Accessed 22 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Ya'alon claimed on the ''Today'' programme that Palestinians "enjoy already political independence" and "have their own political system, government, parliament, municipalities and so forth", claiming that Israel had no desire "to govern them whatsoever".&lt;ref name=72a5 /&gt; The [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]] objected to these claims, saying: "Palestinians don't have political independence. They live under occupation and, in Gaza, under siege."&lt;ref name=72a5 /&gt; Filmmaker and activist [[Ken Loach]] sent a letter via the Campaign, saying that: "You understand, I’m sure, that this interview is a serious breach of the requirement for impartiality. Unlike all other ''Today'' interviews, the minister was allowed to speak without challenge. Why?"&lt;ref name=72a5 /&gt;

After the [[June 2017 Jerusalem attack]], the BBC reported it as "Three Palestinians killed after deadly stabbing in Jerusalem." After being inundated with complaints, the BBC news on-line changed the headline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 June 2017 |title=BBC's shameful headline |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/231163 |website=Arutz Sheva |access-date=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq and the Hutton Inquiry ===
The BBC was criticised for its coverage of the events before the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq, in 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/bb_rm_fs.stm?news=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;nol_storyid=6204797 | title = Viewers most common complaints of 2006 | author = BBC NewsWatch | format = Video | date = 22 December 2006 | accessdate = 21 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy over what it described as the "sexing up" of the case for war in Iraq by the government, led to the BBC being heavily criticised by the [[Hutton Inquiry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/ | title = Investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. David Kelly | author = Lord Hutton | authorlink = Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton | accessdate = 11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this finding was much disputed by the British press, who branded it as a government [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/01/29/hutton.press | title = UK press mauls Hutton 'whitewash' | publisher = CNN | date = 29 January 2004 | accessdate = 11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CNN: [http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/01/29/hutton.press/ UK press mauls Hutton 'whitewash'], 29 January 2004 (on the reaction of the British press to the final report)&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC's chairman and director general both resigned following the inquiry, and its vice-chairman Lord Ryder made a public apology to the government – which the Liberal Democrat [[Norman Baker]] MP described as "of such capitulation that I wanted to throw up when I heard it".&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Norman: ''The Strange Death of David Kelly'', London: Methuen, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===
During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Israeli diplomatic officials boycotted BBC news programmes, refused interviews, and excluded BBC reporters from briefings because Israeli officials believed the BBC's reporting was biased, stating "the reports we see give the impression that the BBC is working on behalf of [[Hezbollah]] instead of doing fair journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Gil |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525841951&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Jerusalem Post article on BBC coverage of the Israel-Lebanon conflict |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=29 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fran Unsworth]], head of BBC News gathering, defended the coverage in an article for ''Jewish News.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/jewish_news_letters/?content_id=4090 |title=Totally Jewish response to Francesca Unsworth |publisher=Totallyjewish.com |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606080124/http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/jewish_news_letters/?content_id=4090 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Balen Report ===
{{Main article|The Balen Report}}
The BBC eventually overturned a ruling by the Information Tribunal rejecting the BBC's refusal to release the Balen report to Steven Sugar, a member of the public, under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] on the grounds that it was held for the purposes of journalism. The report examines BBC radio and television broadcasts covering the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and was compiled in 2004 by [[Malcolm Balen]], a senior editorial adviser.

On 10 October 2006, ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531443/BBC-mounts-court-fight-to-keep-critical-report-secret.html|title=BBC mounts court fight to keep 'critical' report secret|date=15 October 2006|accessdate=24 January 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that "The BBC has spent thousands of pounds of licence payers' money trying to block the release of a report which is believed to be highly critical of its Middle East coverage. The corporation is mounting a landmark High Court action to prevent the release of The Balen Report under the Freedom of Information Act, despite the fact that BBC reporters often use the Act to pursue their journalism. The action will increase suspicions that the report, which is believed to run to 20,000 words, includes evidence of anti-Israeli bias in news programming." ''The Times'' reported in March 2007 that "critics of the BBC" were interested in knowing if the Balen Report "includes evidence of bias against Israel in news programming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article1575543.ece|title=BBC asks court to block Israel report |first=Michael|last=Herman|work=[[The Times]]|date=27 March 2007}}{{subscription required|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2398870.ece |title=BBC fights to suppress internal report into allegations of bias against Israel |first=Andy |last=McSmith |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013035628/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2398870.ece |archivedate=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the Information Commissioner ruled in favour of the BBC. Mr Sugar appealed to the Information Tribunal, who overturned the decision on the basis that the report was not for the purposes of journalism. The BBC appealed on two grounds, firstly that the Information Tribunal did not have jurisdiction in these circumstances, and secondly, even if they did, the report was for the purposes of journalism.  On 27 April 2007 the High Court agreed that the Information Tribunal had no jurisdiction (thus reinstating the Information Commissioner's ruling in favour of the BBC) and therefore they did not rule on the second ground for appeal. The BBC issued a press release which included the following statement:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The BBC's action in this case had nothing to do with the fact that the Balen report was about the Middle East – the same approach would have been taken whatever area of news output was covered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/04_april/27/balen.shtml 'Balen report: BBC successful in High Court challenge'] BBC Press Office 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But then, on 11 February 2009 the House of Lords (then the UK's highest court) overruled them, stating that the Information Tribunal did have jurisdiction, and referred the case back to the High Court to rule on the other ground.  Sugar was then reported as saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is sad that the BBC felt it necessary to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money fighting for three years to try to load the system against those requesting information from it. I am very pleased that the House of Lords has ruled that such obvious unfairness is not the result of the Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/11/lawyer-hails-lords-bbc-middle-east|title=Lawyer hails Lords BBC Middle East report ruling as a victory|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=24 January 2014|first=Afua|last=Hirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, on 2 October 2009, the High Court ruled that the BBC was ''not'' required to disclose the Balen Report, because it was partly for the purposes of journalism, and in spite of appeals by Steven Sugar and, after his death, his wife, both the Court of Appeal, on 23 June 2010, and the Supreme Court, on 23 November 2011, agreed with that ruling, thus clarifying the law applying to any similar reports in the future.

In 2010 it was reported by the Journalism.co.uk website, after a Freedom of Information request, that the BBC had spent £270,867.12 in legal fees since 2005 in sustaining its refusal of the request to publicly release the Balen Report.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Oliver [https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/bbc-reveals-legal-costs-of-freedom-of-information-requests/s2/a540689/ "BBC reveals legal costs of freedom of information requests"], journalism.co.uk, 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two years later, according to a FOI request by The Commentator website, the figure had risen to £330,000, see Simon Rocker [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/76841/bbc-spent-£330000-supressing-balen-report "BBC spent £330,000 suppressing Balen report"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 30 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barbara Plett's tears for Yasser Arafat ===
During the BBC programme ''[[From Our Own Correspondent]]'' broadcast on 30 October 2004, [[Barbara Plett]] described herself crying when she saw a frail [[Yasser Arafat]] being evacuated to France for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=plett1&gt;Plett, Barbara (30 September 2004) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3966139.stm "Yasser Arafat's unrelenting journey"], BBC News, 30 October 2004. Retrieved 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This led to "hundreds of complaints" to the BBC, and suggestions that the BBC was biased. [[Andrew Dismore]], the MP for Hendon, accused Plett of "sloppy journalism", and commented that "this shows the inherent bias of the BBC against Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio 4 broadcast under attack as corporation faces fresh accusations of failing to be impartial |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1476070/Radio-4-broadcast-under-attack-as-corporation-faces-fresh-accusations-of-failing-to-be-impartial.html|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=7 November 2004 |first1=Chris |last1=Hastings |first2=Charlotte |last2=Edwardes |first3=Katharine|last3=Houreld|date=7 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian5"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=26 November 2005 |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1651260,00.html|title=BBC bias complaint upheld|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4471494.stm|title=Arafat report 'broke BBC rules'|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=25 November 2005|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC News]] defended Plett in a statement saying that her reporting had met the high standards of "fairness, accuracy and balance" expected of a BBC correspondent.&lt;ref name=plett1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Gibson, Owen (26 November 2005).

However, almost a year later, on 25 November 2005, the programme complaints committee of the BBC governors partially upheld the complaints, ruling that Plett's comments "breached the requirements of due impartiality".&lt;ref name="Guardian5"/&gt;  Despite initially issuing a statement in support of Plett, the BBC director of news [[Helen Boaden]] later apologised for what she described as "an editorial misjudgment". The governors praised Boaden's speedy response and reviewed the BBC's stance on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref name="Guardian5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TomGross"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bowen===
In April 2009, the Editorial Standards Committee of the [[BBC Trust]] published a report on three complaints brought against two news items involving [[Jeremy Bowen]], the Middle East Editor for [[BBC News]].&lt;ref name="ESCReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2009/mar.pdf |title=Editorial Standards Findings |format=PDF |accessdate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514185245/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2009/mar.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaints included 24 allegations of inaccuracy or partiality of which three were fully or partially upheld.&lt;ref name="ESCReport" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lerman160409&gt;[[Antony Lerman]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 April 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/16/jeremy-bowen-bbc-middle-east What did Jeremy Bowen do wrong?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News Online, 4 June 2007, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6709173.stm How 1967 defined the Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee found that Bowen's radio piece "had stated his professional view without qualification or explanation, and that the lack of precision in his language had rendered the statement inaccurate". They opined that the online article should have explained the existence of alternative views and that it breached the rules of impartiality. However, the report did not accuse Bowen of bias. The website article was amended and Bowen did not face any disciplinary measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC's Jeremy Bowen breached guidelines on accuracy in Israel reports|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5158689/BBCs-Jeremy-Bowen-breached-guidelines-on-accuracy-in-Israel-reports.html|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=15 April 2009|accessdate=24 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-Muslim bias ===
[[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] leaders in the United Kingdom have accused the BBC of pandering to Britain's Muslim community by making a disproportionate number of programmes on Islam at the expense of covering other Asian religions,&lt;ref name="promuslim"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/sikhs-and-hindus-accuse-bbc-of-promuslim-bias-922482.html |work=[[The Independent]] | title=Sikhs and Hindus accuse BBC of pro-Muslim bias | first=Jerome | last=Taylor | date=8 September 2008 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. However, in a letter sent in July to the Network of Sikh Organizations (NSO), the head of the BBC's Religion and Ethics, Michael Wakelin, denied any biases on their part.&lt;ref name="Indy Pro-Muslim"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jerome|title=Sikhs and Hindus accuse BBC of pro-Muslim bias|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/sikhs-and-hindus-accuse-bbc-of-pro-muslim-bias-922482.html|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=7 September 2008|language=en-GB|quote=In a letter sent in July to the NSO, the head of the BBC's Religion and Ethics, Michael Wakelin, denied that there was any bias. He said the demographic makeup of Britain meant that Britain's 1.6 million Muslims outnumber Hindus and Sikhs by two to one. "Therefore," he wrote, "if Muslims get 60 minutes a year, the Sikhs and Hindus should share 30 minutes each." Further content on Islam, he added, was "no doubt sparked by the interest in the faith following 9/11".}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the BBC said the broadcaster was committed to representing all of Britain's faiths and communities.&lt;ref name="Indy Pro-Muslim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farmer|first1=Ben|title=BBC favours Muslims, complain Hindus and Sikhs|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/2703863/BBC-favours-Muslims-complain-Hindus-and-Sikhs.html|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of MPs, including [[Rob Marris]] and [[Keith Vaz]], called on the BBC to do more to represent Britain's minority faiths. "I am disappointed," said Vaz. "It is only right that as licence fee payers all faiths are represented in a way that mirrors their make-up in society. I hope that the BBC addresses the problem in its next year of programming."&lt;ref name="promuslim"/&gt;

=== Arab Spring ===
The overly positive coverage by BBC of the [[Arab Spring]] was criticised both from within and outside of the corporation.  In June 2012, the head of news Helen Boaden admitted that the coverage was "over-excited".  She attributed this to reporters [[Embedded journalism|embedded]] with the rebels, who produced reports which are "too emotive" and "veering into opinion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2164536/BBCs-coverage-Arab-Spring-sporadic-ignoring-uprisings-failed-favour-big-stories-Libya-Egypt.html Our coverage of the Arab Spring was over-excited, admits BBC], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 27 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the BBC admitted making "major errors" in its coverage of the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC admits errors in Bahrain unrest coverage|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MEDIA_219748.html|accessdate=1 July 2012|work=Trade Arabia|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 89-page report, 9 pages were devoted to the BBC's coverage of Bahrain and included admissions that the BBC had "underplayed the sectarian aspect of the conflict" and "not adequately convey the viewpoint of supporters of the monarchy" by "[failing] to mention attempts by Crown Prince" Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa to "establish dialogue with the opposition". The report added that "the government appears to have made a good-faith effort to de-escalate the crisis" in particular during a period when the BBC's coverage of the unrest dropped substantially and that many people had complained that their coverage was "utterly one-sided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC admits errors in unrest coverage|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=333054|accessdate=1 July 2012|work=Gulf News Daily|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indophobia===
In 2008, the BBC was criticised by some for referring to the men who carried out the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]] as "gunmen" rather than "terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Dec222008/editpage20081221108056.asp |accessdate=11 September 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/dec/14mumterror-mj-akbar-slams-bbc-for-biased-coverage-of-mumbai-terror-attack.htm |title='The BBC cannot see the difference between a criminal and a terrorist' |publisher=Rediff.com |first=Sheela |last=Bhat|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/british-biased-corporation-terrorists-in-london-gunmen-in-mumbai/393560/ |title=British Biased Corporation?

&lt;/ref&gt; British parliamentarian [[Stephen Pound]] has supported these claims, referring to the BBC's whitewashing of the terror attacks as "the worst sort of mealy mouthed posturing. It is desperation to avoid causing offence which ultimately causes more offence to everyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bbc-flayed-for-not-terming-mumbai-gunmen-as/393175/ |title=BBC flayed for not terming Mumbai gunmen as terrorists |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial report from BBC accused India of sponsoring Pakistan's MQM party, a domestic party based out of Karachi, to fund  anti-Pakistani activities. However, the only sources BBC managed to mention for this report was "authoritative Pakistani source", rather than independent investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33148880|title=Pakistan's MQM 'received Indian funding'|last=Bennett-Jones|first=Owen|date=2015-06-24|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flawed reporting was severely criticized by India and other prominent journalists like [[Barkha Dutt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/mqm-militants-being-funded-by-indias-raw-claims-controversial-bbc-report-2310820.html|title=Pakistan's MQM militants being funded by India's RAW, claims controversial BBC report - Firstpost|date=2015-06-25|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expectedly, the pro-Pakistan and anti-Indian report was extensively circulated in Pakistani domestic media to fuel propaganda and conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1190175|title=India provided funds to MQM, claims BBC report|last=Dawn.com|date=2015-06-24|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Hindu]] Business Line'', reporter Premen Addy criticises the BBC's reportage on South Asia as consistently [[anti-India]] and pro-[[Islamist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blonnet.com/businessline/2001/05/22/stories/042255pr.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070517153830/http://www.blonnet.com/businessline/2001/05/22/stories/042255pr.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2007 |title=Punchy start to the British election |publisher=Blonnet.com |date=22 May 2001 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |first=Premen |last=Addy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they underreport India's economic and social achievements, as well as political and diplomatic efforts, and disproportionately highlight and exaggerate problems in the country. In addition, Addy alludes to discrimination against Indian anchors and reporters in favour of Muslim [[Pakistan]]i and [[Bangladesh]]i ones who are hostile to India.

Writing for the 2008 edition of the [[peer-reviewed]] ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', [[Alasdair Pinkerton]] analyses the coverage of India by the BBC since India's independence from British rule in 1947 until 2008. Pinkerton observes a tumultuous history involving allegations of [[anti-India]] bias in the BBC's reportage, particularly during the [[cold war]], and concludes that the BBC's coverage of [[South Asian]] geopolitics and economics shows a pervasive and hostile [[anti-India]] bias due to the BBC's alleged [[imperialist]] and [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonialist]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Journalist [[Christopher Booker]] has also criticized the BBC for its coverage of India-related matters. He concludes that the BBC's efforts to reinforce [[Stereotypes of South Asians]] has been directly responsible for damaging the image of India, and encouraging racist incidents against Indians, such as the [[Leipzig University internship controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booker|first1=Christopher|title=Why to blacken India on rape do they have to omit the facts?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11472416/Why-to-blacken-India-on-rape-do-they-have-to-omit-the-facts.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=14 Mar 2015|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-Hindu bias ===

[[Hindu]] groups in the United Kingdom have accused the BBC of [[anti-Hindu]] bigotry and whitewashing [[Islamist]] hate groups that demonise the [[British Indian]] minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/storyOld.php?storyId=42169 |title=BBC coverage biased, say British Hindus |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515113814/http://www.indianexpress.com/storyOld.php?storyId=42169 |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Vivekananda Centre London and the Hindu Council(UK) reported an institutional anti Hindu bias and stated that "Anything that may show Hinduism in a poor light is immediately picked up by the BBC programme makers, while anything that may show Hinduism in a glorious light remains ignored by the BBC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlXb_Po4P6QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=1giDW85EXg&amp;dq=Further%20issues%20for%20BBC%20charter%20review%3A%202nd%20report%20of%20session%202005-06&amp;pg=PA473#v=onepage&amp;q=Further%20issues%20for%20BBC%20charter%20review:%202nd%20report%20of%20session%202005-06&amp;f=false|title=Further Issues for BBC Charter Review|work=google.co.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the BBC referred to the Hindu festival of [[Holi]] as a "filthy festival". The Webster New World Dictionary defines "filthy" as "full of filth, disgustingly foul; grossly obscene; morally vicious or corrupt". The BBC has since apologised for the offence caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/321795/20120330/bbc-controversy-holi-filthy-festival-hindu-criticizes.htm| title=BBC Calls Holi A ‘Filthy Festival’| last=Singh| first=W.

=== Anti-Sikh inclination===

In 2009, the BBC Asian Network angered Sikhs for a show in which Muslim presenter [[Adil Ray]] expressed that Sikhs should not always carry their [[kirpan]], a ceremonial dagger and key item of their faith. The BBC rejected the charge, but deleted the show from their website.&lt;ref name=sikh&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Sikhs accuse BBC of racism|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-20/uk/28188663_1_kirpan-uk-sikhs-sikh-community|accessdate=24 January 2014|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=20 August 2009|agency=PTI|first=W.

=== Anti-American bias ===
In October 2006, Chief Radio Correspondent for BBC News since 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC World Home Page |publisher=BBC News | url = http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_clickpage.asp?pageid=178 | accessdate = 2 November 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028012718/http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_clickpage.asp?pageid=178 |archivedate = 28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent [[Justin Webb]] said that the BBC is so biased against America that deputy director general [[Mark Byford]] had secretly agreed to help him to "correct" it in his reports, and that the BBC treated America with scorn and derision and gave it "no moral weight".&lt;ref name="MoSBiasedBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cut &amp; paste: A public broadcaster acknowledges its left-wing bias |work=[[The Australian]] | date = 1 November 2006 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20684585-7583,00.html | accessdate = 2 November 2006 }}{{subscription required|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Yes, we are biased on religion and politics, admit BBC executives | publisher = Evening Standard | date = 22 October 2006 | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23371706-details/Yes,%20we%20are%20biased%20on%20religion%20and%20politics,%20admit%20BBC%20executives/article.do | accessdate = 2 November 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622200808/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23371706-details/Yes%2C%20we%20are%20biased%20on%20religion%20and%20politics%2C%20admit%20BBC%20executives/article.do | archivedate = 22 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Webb presented a three-part series for BBC Radio 4 called ''Death to America: Anti Americanism Examined'' in which he challenged a common perception of the United States as an international bully and a modern-day imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Death to US': Anti-Americanism examined|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6547881.stm|date=12 April 2007|accessdate=24 January 2014|work=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative American news commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] has repeatedly sought to draw attention to what he calls the BBC's "inherent [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,284353,00.html | title =The Far Left, Angelina Jolie and FOX News | work= [[Fox News Channel]] | date =  19 June 2007 | accessdate = 24 January 2014 |first=Bill |last=O'Reilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Secret Agent'' documentary ===
On Thursday 15 July 2004 the BBC broadcast a documentary on the far right [[British National Party]] where undercover reporter [[Jason Gwynne]] infiltrated the BNP by posing as a [[football hooligan]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The programme resulted in [[Mark Collett]] and [[Nick Griffin]], the leader of the party, being charged for [[inciting racial hatred]] in April 2005, for statements which included Griffin describing Islam as a "wicked, vicious faith," Collett describing [[asylum seekers]] as "a little bit like cockroaches" and saying "let's show these ethnics the door in 2004." Griffin and Collett were found not guilty on some charges at the first trial in January 2006, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the others, so a retrial was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

At the retrial held in November 2006 all of the defendants were found not guilty on the basis that the law at the time did not consider those who follow Islam or Christianity to be a protected group with respect to racial defamation laws.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this case, British law was amended to outlaw incitement to hatred against a religious group (see [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]]).

The BNP believe this was an attempt to "Discredit the British National Party as a party of opposition to the Labour government."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second trial, Nick Griffin described the BBC as a "Politically correct, politically biased organisation which has wasted licence-fee payers' money to bring two people in a legal, democratic, peaceful party to court over speaking nothing more than the truth."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== ''Jerry Springer: The Opera'' ===
In January 2005, the BBC aired ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'', ultimately resulting in around 55,000 complaints to the BBC from those upset at the opera's alleged blasphemies against Christianity. In advance of the broadcast, which the BBC had warned "contains language and content which won't be to some tastes" [[mediawatch-uk]]'s director [[John Beyer]] wrote to the Director General urging the BBC to drop the programme, saying "Licence fee payers do not expect the BBC to be pushing back boundaries of taste and decency in this way." The BBC issued a statement saying: "As a public service broadcaster, it is the BBC's role to broadcast a range of programmes that will appeal to all audiences – with very differing tastes and interests – present in the UK today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4147801.stm |title=BBC urged to axe Springer opera |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=5 January 2005|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the broadcast, some 150 people bearing placards protested outside the [[BBC Television Centre]] in [[Shepherd's Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4154071.stm |title=Protests as BBC screens Springer |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Monday following the broadcast, which was watched by some two million viewers, ''[[The Times]]'' announced that BBC executives had received death threats after their addresses and telephone numbers were posted on the ''[[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]]'' website. The Corporation had received some 35,000 complaints before the broadcast, but reported only 350 calls following the broadcast, which were split between those praising the production and those complaining about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article410579.ece |title=Security guards step in after Springer opera death threats|work=[[The Times]] |date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2005}}{{subscription required|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Christian group attempted to bring private criminal prosecutions for [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|blasphemy]] against the BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4161109.stm |title=Group to act over Springer opera |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another demanded a judicial review of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4188403.stm|title=Second action over Springer opera|work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=20 January 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC's Board of Governors]] convened and considered the complaints, which they rejected by a majority of 4 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/4393533.stm |title=BBC rejects Springer complaints|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=30 March 2005|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent refusal of the BBC to reproduce the actual [[Muhammad cartoons]] in its coverage of the controversy concerning them convinced many that the BBC follows an unstated policy of freely broadcasting defamation of Christianity which it would not allow in the case of any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

=== Climate change ===
The BBC has been criticised for hypocrisy over its high [[carbon footprint]], in view of the amount of coverage it gives to the topic of climate change. ''[[Newsnight]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Paxman]] argues that the Corporation's correspondents "travel the globe to tell the audience of the dangers of climate change while leaving a vapour trail which will make the problem even worse".&lt;ref name ="GuardianGreen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/6322259.stm |title=How green is my Auntie?|first=Jeremy|last=Paxman|authorlink=Jeremy Paxman|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=24 January 2014|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paxman further argues that the 'BBC's coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/broadcasting.digitalmedia |title=Paxman accuses BBC of hypocrisy over environment|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=24 January 2014|first=Jason|last=Deans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]], [[Peter Horrocks]] (Head of TV News) and [[Peter Barron]] (Editor, ''[[Newsnight]]''), said that the BBC should not campaign on the issue of climate change. They criticised proposed plans for a BBC [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]-style day of programmes around climate change. Horrocks was quoted as saying: "I absolutely don't think we should do that because it's not impartial. It's not our job to lead people and proselytise about it."

Peter Barron was quoted as adding: "It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. I think there are a lot of people who think that, but it must be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,2162901,00.html], BBC Drops Climate Change Special, Media Guardian, 5 September&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Horrocks later outlined the BBC's position on the BBC Editors Blog ("No Line").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/08/no_line.html |title=BBC Editors Blog |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2014|first=Peter |last=Horrocks |authorlink=Peter Horrocks |work=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plans for a day of programmes about environmental issues were abandoned in September 2007. A BBC spokesperson said this was "absolutely not" because of concerns about impartiality.&lt;ref name="GuardianGreen"/&gt;

In July 2011 a BBC Trust review cited findings of an assessment by Professor Steve Jones of [[University College London]]. Jones found there was an at times "over-rigid" application of the Editorial Guidelines on impartiality in relation to science coverage, which failed to take into account what he regarded as the "non-contentious" nature of some stories and the need to avoid giving "undue attention to marginal opinion". Professor Jones gave reporting of the safety of the [[MMR vaccine]] and more recent coverage of claims about the safety of GM crops and the existence of man made climate change as examples of his point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/science_impartiality.pdf |title=BBC Trust review of impartiality and accuracy of the BBC's coverage of science|format=PDF |date= July 2011|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[BBC]] apologised for allowing climate change denier [[Nigel Lawson|Lord Lawson]] to falsely claim that global temperatures had not risen in the past decade on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today Programme'']] (which the organisation acknowledged breached its editorial guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carrington |first1=Damian |title=BBC apologises over interview with climate denier Lord Lawson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/24/bbc-apologises-over-interview-climate-sceptic-lord-nigel-lawson |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in 2018, [[Carbon Brief]] released an internal notice sent by [[Fran Unsworth]], BBC director of news and current affairs, arguing that the BBC's coverage of climate change often went against its own guidelines on accuracy and created a [[false balance]] with regard to impartiality stating: "Manmade climate change exists: If the science proves it we should report it. … To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carrington |first1=Damian |title=BBC admits 'we get climate change coverage wrong too often' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/07/bbc-we-get-climate-change-coverage-wrong-too-often |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC is alleged to have attempted to cover up a climate change seminar credited with shaping its coverage of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paton|first=Graeme|title=Row over BBC climate change conference 'cover up'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10566952/Row-over-BBC-climate-change-conference-cover-up.html|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=12 January 2014|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-Catholic bias ===

Prominent Roman Catholic leaders have criticised the BBC for having an anti-Catholic bias and showing hostility towards the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Claire | last = Cozens | title = BBC accused of 'gross insensitivity' to Catholics | date = 4 February 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/04/bbc.religion |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British bishops group accuses BBC of bias against Catholics|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-10-18/news/0310180237_1_bishops-group-contraception-and-abortion-anti-catholic-bias|accessdate=31 October 2012|work=Chicago Tribune|date=18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC has also been criticised for recycling old news and for "insensitivity" and bad timing when it decided to broadcast programmes called ''Kenyon Confronts'' and ''Sex and the Holy City'' around the same time as [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 25th anniversary and the beatification of [[Mother Teresa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archbishop meets BBC over 'bias'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3172408.stm|accessdate=31 October 2012|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=7 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Greg|title=Bishops Accuse BBC Of Anti-Catholic Bias|url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/5660|accessdate=31 October 2012|work=National Catholic Register|date=28 March 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908163150/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/5660|archivedate=8 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC accused of anti-Catholic bias|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3148708.stm|accessdate=31 October 2012|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=29 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the BBC had planned ''[[Popetown]]'', a ten-part cartoon series which "featured an infantile Pope [...] bouncing around the Vatican on a pogostick". The plans were shelved after it evoked intense outrage and criticism from Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bates|first=Stephen|title=BBC drops controversial Pope cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/sep/24/bbc.broadcasting|accessdate=31 October 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentary on Euro 2012 ===

Eleven days before the tournament took place, the [[BBC]] [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', entitled ''[[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]: Stadiums of Hate'', included recent footage of supporters chanting various racist slogans and displays of [[white power]] symbols and banners in Poland, and Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18192375 | title=Sol Campbell warns fans to stay away from Euro 2012 | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC News | date=28 May 2012 | accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary was first commented widely in the British press, but then accused of being one-sided, biased and unethical. Critics included the British media; anti-racism campaigners, and black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and footballers ([[Gary Lineker]], [[Roy Hodgson]] and others).&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/06/ugly-spectre |author="K.

[[Jonathan Ornstein]], the leader of Jewish community in Kraków, a Jewish source used in the documentary said: "I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source. The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda... the BBC knowingly cheated its own audience - the British people - by concocting a false horror story about Poland. In doing so, the BBC has spread fear, ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I am profoundly disturbed by this unethical form of journalism."&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

A reporter from ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', Poland's biggest left-wing newspaper, questioned ''Panorama'''s practices and said: "I am becoming more and more surprised with what the BBC says. So far it has denied two situations I witnessed. I would not be surprised if the BBC prepared a statement saying that the ''Panorama'' crew has never been to Poland."&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

An anti-racism campaigner Jacek Purski said: "The material prepared by the BBC is one-sided. It does not show the whole story of Polish preparations for the Euros. It does not show the Championship ran a lot of activities aimed at combating racism in the "Respect Diversity" campaign. For us the Euro is not only about matches. The event has become an opportunity to fight effectively against racism and promote multiculturalism. There is no country in Europe free from racism. These are the facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakow.gazeta.pl/krakow/1,44425,11824886,Wszyscy_jestesmy_odpowiedzialni_za_pseudokibicow.html |title=Wszyscy jesteśmy odpowiedzialni za pseudokibiców |work=Krakow.gazeta.pl |date=20 May 2012|accessdate=24 January 2014|first=Magdalena |last=Wójcik |language=Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual abuse scandals and their implications ===
{{main article|Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|North Wales child abuse scandal}}
In the weeks after the [[ITV1]] documentary ''[[Exposure (UK TV series)|Exposure]]: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile'' was broadcast on 3 October 2012, the BBC faced questions and criticism over allegations that it had failed to act on rumours about sexual assaults, especially on young girls, by presenter [[Jimmy Savile]], some of which had occurred on BBC premises after the recording of programmes including ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]''. Allegations were also made that a ''[[Newsnight]]'' investigation into Savile in December 2011 was dropped because it conflicted with tribute programmes prepared after Savile's death.

By 11 October 2012 allegations of abuse by Savile had been made to 13 British police forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin|last=Evans|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9601922/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-fourth-British-TV-personality-accused-in-sex-allegations.html|title=Sir Jimmy Savile: fourth British TV personality accused in sex allegations|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and on 19 October [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]] launched a formal criminal investigation into historic allegations of child sex abuse by Savile and others over four decades.&lt;ref name="bbc191012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20006049|title=Savile abuse claims: Met Police launch criminal inquiry|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph 191012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9620149/Jimmy-Savile-police-launch-criminal-investigation-after-victims-claim-some-abusers-are-still-alive.html|title=Jimmy Savile: police launch criminal investigation after victims claim some abusers are still alive|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=19 October 2012|first=Gordon|last=Rayner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The police reported on 25 October 2012 that the number of possible victims was 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20081021|title= Jimmy Savile: Number of victims reach 300, police say|date=25 October 2012|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was claimed that [[Douglas Muggeridge]], the controller of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] in the early 1970s, was aware of allegations against Savile, and had asked for a report on them in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brian|first=Liam|date=4 October 2012|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/boss-of-radio-1-knew-jimmy-savile-was-abusing-young-girls-8196555.html|title=Boss of Radio 1 'knew Jimmy Savile was abusing young girls|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC stated that no evidence of any allegations of misconduct, or of actual misconduct by Savile, had been found in its files&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The BBC was criticised in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for its handling of the affair, with [[Harriet Harman]] stating that the allegations "cast a stain" on the corporation. The [[Culture Secretary]], [[Maria Miller]], said that she was satisfied that the BBC was taking the allegations very seriously, and dismissed calls for an independent inquiry. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] said that an independent inquiry was the only way to ensure justice for those involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19957143|title= Ed Miliband calls for 'outsider' to probe over Savile scandal|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Entwistle offered to appear before the Parliamentary [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] to explain the BBC's position and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19948782|title= MPs say Jimmy Savile claims are 'stain on BBC'|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October the BBC appointed the heads of two separate inquiries into events surrounding Savile. Former High Court judge [[Janet Smith (judge)|Dame Janet Smith]], who led the inquiry into serial killer [[Harold Shipman]], will review the culture and practices of the BBC during the time Savile worked there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rowena|last=Mason|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9613014/BBCs-Jimmy-Savile-probe-to-be-led-by-Harold-Shipman-inquiry-judge.html|title=BBC's Jimmy Savile probe to be led by Harold Shipman inquiry judge|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Nick Pollard]], a former [[Sky News]] executive, will look at why a ''[[Newsnight]]'' investigation into Savile's activities was dropped shortly before transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9613014/BBCs-Jimmy-Savile-probe-to-be-led-by-Harold-Shipman-inquiry-judge.html |title=BBC's Jimmy Savile probe to be led by Harold Shipman inquiry judge |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2014|first=Rowena|last=Mason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the Savile scandal, it was noted that a book written in 1999 by journalist [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]], ''Strange Places, Questionable People'', had referred to an "Uncle Dick" at the BBC who had sexually assaulted children, and who appeared to fit the profile of BBC announcer [[Derek McCulloch]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/395372/20121017/deerek-mccolloch-uncle-mac-dick-john-simpson.htm |work=[[International Business Times]] |title=Jimmy Savile Sex Scandal: Was BBC's Larry the Lamb Derek McCulloch a Paedophile? |date=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BkY9hym2?url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/395372/20121017/deerek-mccolloch-uncle-mac-dick-john-simpson.htm |archivedate=28 October 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |first=Dominic |last=Gover |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Andrew O'Hagan]] wrote that there had long been rumours about McCulloch's activities, and those of his colleague [[Lionel Gamlin]], while working at the BBC in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=AOH&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hagan |first=Andrew |title=Light Entertainment |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/2012/10/27/andrew-ohagan/light-entertainment |work=[[London Review of Books]] |accessdate=28 October 2012 |authorlink=Andrew O'Hagan |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BkXttS5B?url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/2012/10/27/andrew-ohagan/light-entertainment |archivedate=28 October 2012 |date=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC said that they would "look into these allegations as part of the Jimmy Savile review."&lt;ref name="ibtimes.co.uk"/&gt; McCulloch's family described the allegations as "complete rubbish".

''Newsnight'' broadcast, on 2 November 2012, a report making allegations against, but not naming, a "prominent Thatcher era Conservative politician" in relation to the [[North Wales child abuse scandal]]. However, this story collapsed after ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported on 8 November a case of mistaken identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=David|last1=Leigh|first2= Steven |last2=Morris|first3=Bibi|last3=van der Zee|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/08/mistaken-identity-tory-abuse-claim |title='Mistaken identity' led to top Tory abuse claim |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 November 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the next day the victim retracted the allegation.

Nick Pollard's report into the shelving of a ''Newsnight'' report on Savile in 2011 was published in December 2012.  It concluded that the decision to drop the original report was "flawed", but that it had not been done to protect programmes prepared as tributes to Savile.

On 20 December 2012, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] published criticism of payments made to Entwistle after he had resigned, stating that the £450,000 paid to him after 54 days in post - double the amount specified in his contract - together with a year's health insurance and additional payments, was a "cavalier" use of public money.&lt;ref name=bbc201212&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20793496 BBC News, ''Entwistle pay-off was cavalier use of public money - MPs'', 20 December 2012].

== 'Overstaffing' ==

The BBC has been criticised for 'overstaffing' news, sporting, and cultural events and in doing so both wasting licence fee money, and using their dominant position to control the coverage of events.

A 2010 House of Commons Public Accounts Committee report criticised the number of staff that the BBC had sent to sporting events such as the Beijing Olympics and the Euro 2008 football championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7549785/BBC-spending-criticised-in-MPs-report.html | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first=Ben | last=Leach | title=BBC spending criticised in MPs' report | date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 the Corporation sent 263 staff to cover the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The next month they sent 250 staff members to cover an event marking one year until the start of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]], ten times the numbers used by other broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8786546/BBC-books-1663-rooms-for-two-day-concert.html | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first=Roya | last=Nikkhah | title=BBC books 1,663 rooms for two-day concert | date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2011 the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' culture spokesman [[Don Foster (politician)|Don Foster]] criticised the large number of BBC staff members who attended the eviction of travellers and their supporters from the illegal section of the [[Dale Farm]] site. Foster stated that it was 'ludicrous over staffing and hardly good way to get public sympathy for the 20 per cent budget cuts facing the BBC'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8839523/BBC-accused-of-overstaffing-as-protesters-pull-out-of-Dale-Farm.html | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first=Richard | last=Alleyne | title=BBC accused of 'overstaffing' as protesters pull out of Dale Farm | date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC responded that they only had 20 staff members on site.

== Funding ==
{{Main article|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}
The fact that the BBC's domestic services are funded by [[television licence]] fees is heavily criticised by its competitors and others on a number of grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8209-1004679,00.html
| date=17 February 2004
| title=BBC 'anti-competitive' |accessdate=23 January 2007 |first= Raymond |last=Snoddy |authorlink=Raymond Snoddy |work=[[The Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent rise of multi-channel [[digital television]] has led to criticism that the licence fee is unjustifiable on the basis that minority interest programmes can now be transmitted on specialist commercial channels and that the licence fee is funding a number of digital-only channels which many licence holders cannot watch (for example [[BBC Three]] and [[BBC Four]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/Independent_review/Artsworld.pdf |title=Consultation for the Independent Review of the BBC's Digital Television Services |accessdate=19 March 2012 |last=John |first=Hambley |publisher=[[The Stationery Office]] |date=8 June 2004 |work=Letter to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325123001/http://www.culture.gov.uk/Independent_review/Artsworld.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 24 October 2012, with the completion of the [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|digital switchover]] all licence payers can now access this content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kate |last=Solomon |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/television/uks-digital-switchover-is-complete-ofcom-confirms-1106381 |title=UK's digital switchover is complete, Ofcom confirms &amp;#124; News |publisher=TechRadar |date= |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203145907/http://www.techradar.com/news/television/uks-digital-switchover-is-complete-ofcom-confirms-1106381 |archivedate=3 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BBC Russia ==
On 17 August 2007 it was reported that FM broadcast of the BBC's Russian language service in [[Russia]] would be dropped, leaving only medium and short wave broadcasts in Russia. Financial organisation ''Finam'', which owns the FM radio service now dropping the BBC Russia broadcasts, through its spokesman Igor Ermachenkov, said that "Any media which is government-financed is propaganda – it's a fact, it's not negative".&lt;ref name="BbcOffFm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6951710.stm
| date=17 August 2007
| title=BBC radio ordered off Russian FM| accessdate=18 August 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman, for the BBC responded: "Although the BBC is funded by the UK government... a fundamental principle of its constitution and its regulatory regime is that it is editorially independent of the UK government." Reports put the development in the context of criticism of the Russian government for curbing media freedom and strained UK-Russian relations.&lt;ref name="BbcOffFm" /&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned the move as censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=23321 |title=BBC dropped from Russia's FM waveband today |accessdate=24 January 2014 |publisher=[[Reporters without Borders]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030180406/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=23321 |archivedate=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "London-centrism": Lack of National Representation ==
On 1 November 2007 it was reported that [[Michael Lyons (BBC chairman)|Sir Michael Lyons]], chairman of the BBC Trust, criticised the BBC as too London-centric, paying less attention to news stories outside of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/speeches/ml_what_the_bbc_is_for.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515232549/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/speeches/ml_what_the_bbc_is_for.html |date=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of such criticism in terms of both news and general programming (and in recognition of its mandate to represent the entire UK and encourage creativity throughout the country) there have been active efforts made by the Trust and Board of Governors to correct this regional imbalance. This is reflected in a commitment to produce at least 50 percent of programmes outside of the Greater London area, a target that the corporation has achieved in 2013 and 2014, but fell short of in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/reports/pdf/bbc-annualreport-201516.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC's annual report for 2015-2016 makes reference to the "London bubble" while claiming that does this not represent an active bias but rather the fact that London is the place where so many decisions and programming are made. While notable investments in production capacity outside of London have been made- such as the creation of [[MediaCityUK]] in Salford, Greater Manchester- spending figures for radio and television production in the nations and regions has fallen in real terms, though this accompanies a near £600 million pound reduction in funding for the BBC as a whole since 2010.

The UK's move towards increased devolution in the areas of healthcare, education, and a range of other policy areas, has created additional challenges for the corporation. The flagship newscasts are based in London and tend to report "nation-wide" stories related to government and policy that are often only pertinent to England, or sometimes [[England and Wales]]. The BBC Trust and Future for Public Service Television Inquiry has recognized that this requires more clarity in UK-wide news programming (ex. explaining why the [[Junior Doctors Strike]] only effects England, or that Scotland and Northern Ireland are exempt from the [[bedroom tax]] and the funding changes leading to the [[2010 United Kingdom student protests|2010 Student Protests]]) and creates an additional responsibility for the home nations opt-outs to report on devolved matters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36659839]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://futureoftv.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FOTV-Report-Online-SP.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2016 onward, BBC management will go before the devolved committees for culture or media to answer questions and criticism in the same way that it does for the Westminster [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee|Culture, Media, and Sport Committee]].

=== Wales Coverage ===
In August 2007, [[Adam Price]], the [[Plaid Cymru]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], highlighted what he perceived as a lack of a Welsh focus on BBC [[News broadcasting|news broadcasts]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2a"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6955263.stm |title=Plaid MP's BBC licence fee threat Monday, 20 August 2007 |publisher=BBC News |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=20 August 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price threatened to withhold future [[television licence]] fees in response to a lack of thorough news coverage of Wales, echoing a BBC Audience Council for Wales July report citing public frustration over how the Welsh Assembly is characterised in national media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6898870.stm |title=BBC audiences 'want modern Wales' Monday, 16 July 2007 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plaid AM [[Bethan Jenkins]] agreed with Price and called for responsibility for broadcasting to be devolved to the Welsh Assembly, voicing similar calls from Scotland's First Minister [[Alex Salmond]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Criticism of the BBC's news coverage for Wales and Scotland since devolution prompted debate of possibly providing evening news broadcasts with specific focus for both countries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

=== Scotland coverage controversy ===

==== Scottish independence referendum, 2014 ====
{{See also|BBC controversies#September 2014: Coverage of Scottish independence campaign}}
The [[National Union of Journalists]] (NUJ) criticised the BBC in October 2012 for its poor coverage of the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scotland independence referendum]] which took place on 18 September 2014. The BBC reportedly "downplayed the costs of referendum coverage, claiming it was a 'one off'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Scotland comes under fire from NUJ over referendum coverage|url=http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-news/6153-bbc-scotland-comes-under-fire-from-nuj-over-referendum-coverage|accessdate=24 January 2014|work=newsnetscotland.com|date=31 October 2012|first=G.

[[Andrew Marr]], the BBC presenter, was accused of expressing anti-independence views in a March 2014  interview with [[Alex Salmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/10701331/Andrew-Marr-accused-of-bias-over-Scottish-independence.html|title=Andrew Marr accused of bias over Scottish independence|date=16 March 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/16/bbc-justify-andrew-marr-remarks-scotland-right-join-eu|title=BBC asked to justify Andrew Marr's remarks on Scotland's right to join EU|author=Severin Carrell|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC allowed the Better Together campaign to make a pro-unionist cinema advertisement at its Glasgow studios in April 2014 which was thought to contravene its editorial guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn McLaughlin [http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/better-together-film-made-in-bbc-studio-1-3444021 "Better Together film ‘made in BBC studio’"], ''The Scotsman'', 14 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Scotsman]]'', the BBC appointed [[Kezia Dugdale]], Labour’s education spokeswoman, as presenter of ''Crossfire'', a radio programme debating issues relating to the referendum. The newspaper believed this arrangement was also a breach of the corporation's guidelines and asserted that Dugdale is "a member of Scottish Labour’s Truth Team – set up to monitor all SNP and Yes Scotland interviews, press statements and briefing papers" in the run-up to the September vote.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn McLaughlin [http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/independence-bbc-criticised-for-msp-indyref-role-1-3448279 "Independence: BBC criticised for MSP Indyref role"], ''The Scotsman'', 18 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the Audience Council Scotland, the BBC Trust's advisory body in Scotland, questioned the impartiality of BBC Scotland in covering the independence referendum in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/bbc-told-to-rethink-its-news-output-in-scotland.24818576|title=BBC Scotland told to rethink news output amid questions over indy balance|work=Herald Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Sunday Times]]'' article, also in July 2014, queried the BBC's approach to the independence referendum, and stated that emails by a senior member of a production company organising debates for the corporation gave advance notice to the No campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/scotland/article1436728.ece "Better Together ‘tipped off’ on BBC debates"], ''Sunday Times'', 20 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2014 the BBC were accused of bias in their reporting of an Alex Salmond press conference for the international media. In a response to a question by the BBC's [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]], Salmond accused him of heckling and wanted an inquiry by the UK's [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]] into a leak to the BBC from [[HM Treasury|the Treasury]] concerning the plans of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] to relocate its registered office to London which had been in the previous evening's news.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Johnson [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11089702/Alex-Salmond-goes-to-war-with-BBC-over-RBS-leak.html "Alex Salmond goes to war with BBC over RBS 'leak'"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 11 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to complaints about editing of the live coverage of the conference for later bulletins, the corporation said: "The BBC considers that the questions were valid and the overall report balanced and impartial, in line with our editorial guidelines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/complaint/alexsalmondrbsquestion/|title=BBC - Complaints - BBC News at Six and Ten, BBC One, 11 September, 2014|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

After a day of protests from Yes campaigners, and demands that Robinson should be sacked,&lt;ref&gt;Ben Riley-Smith [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11095752/Scottish-independence-Nationalists-demand-Nick-Robinson-sacking-in-vocal-anti-BBC-protest.html "Scottish independence: Nationalists demand Nick Robinson sacking in vocal anti-BBC protest"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 14 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the following Monday (15 September), Salmond responded to questions from journalists at Edinburgh Airport. About Robinson's report in later bulletins, he said: "I don't think it was fair for Nick to suggest that I hadn't answered a question when I actually answered it twice." He did not believe Robinson should be sacked.&lt;ref&gt;Severin Carroll [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/15/alex-salmond-bbc-protest-nick-robinson "Alex Salmond backs protests against 'bias' shown by BBC's Nick Robinson"], theguardian.com, 15 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Former BBC correspondent, [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], was reported in September 2014 to have been critical of the corporation's reporting on his Facebook page (intended only to be read by his 'friends'). According to Mason: "Not since Iraq have I seen BBC News working at propaganda strength like this. So glad I’m out of there."&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Chris|title=BBC Scotland protests: Scottish independence referendum coverage 'institutionally biased', Salmond claims|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbc-scotland-protests-scottish-independence-referendum-coverage-institutionally-biased-salmond-claims-9732095.html|website=The Independent|date=14 September 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Channel 4]]'s director of creative diversity, [[Stuart Cosgrove]] called for a re-think at the BBC on the nature of balance and due impartiality based. This was during a BBC Scotland radio conversation hosted by [[John Beattie (rugby union)|John Beattie]]. Cosgrove commented: "Yesterday, I was watching the rolling BBC News very closely and it was clear that notions of balance were being predicated on a party political basis. It would go from Cameron to Miliband to Clegg and back. If you look at it as a different premise – it’s a yes/no question – then [[Patrick Harvie]] of the Scottish Greens, who is not the leader but is a significant political person within the Yes campaign, should have had exactly the same coverage as Ed Miliband. Do you think for a second he got that? Of course he didn’t. I think there’s been a failure of the understanding of the nature of balance and due impartiality. It’s simply wrong and not acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2014/09/12/balance-failure-bbc-scottish-independence-referendum-coverage-wrong-and-not|title=Balance failure in BBC Scottish independence referendum coverage ‘wrong and not acceptable’ says Channel 4’s Stuart Cosgrove|author=Angela Haggerty|work=The Drum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interview of Alex Salmond for the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' published on 14 September 2014 included his opinion that the BBC had displayed a pro-union bias during the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/is-the-bbcs-coverage-biased-yes-absolutely-dont-get-me-wrong-i-like-these-f.25322002 "'Is the BBC's coverage biased?

=='Off payroll' tax arrangements==

In October 2012 a [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)]] report found that the BBC had 25,000 "off payroll" contracts – 13,000 for people who were on air. These contracts enable people to make their own arrangements to pay tax and national insurance, which could allow them to contribute less than employees on pay-as-you-earn tax ([[PAYE]]). In response the BBC said many of these were short-term contracts, but it was carrying out a detailed review of tax arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19839836|title=MPs voice concerns about 'off payroll' tax arrangements |date=5 October 2012|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Development of musical theatre''' refers to the historical development of [[theatre|theatrical]] performance combined with music that culminated in the integrated form of modern [[musical theatre]] that combines songs, spoken [[dialogue]], acting and dance. Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre developed from several lines of antecedents that evolved over several centuries through the 18th century when the [[Ballad Opera]] and [[pantomime]] emerged in England and its colonies as the most popular forms of musical entertainment.

In the 19th century, following the development of European [[operetta]], many of the structural elements of modern musical theatre were established by the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in Britain and those of [[Harrigan and Hart]] in America. These were followed by the [[Edwardian musical comedies]], beginning in the 1890s in England, and the musical theatre works of American creators like [[George M. Cohan]] early in the 20th century. The [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals in New York City during the First World War, and other smart shows like ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond [[revue]]s and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to the modern "book" musical, where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.&lt;ref&gt;Everett 2002, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Encyclopedia"&gt;Rubin, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early antecedents: Antiquity to Middle Ages==
[[File:Delphi Composite.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Theatre of [[Delphi]].]]
The antecedents of musical theatre in Europe can be traced back to the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], where music and dance were included in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite web| first = Shay| last = Thornton| title = A Wonderful Life| url = http://www.tuts.com/season07/wonderful_study.pdf| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127051412/http://www.tuts.com/season07/wonderful_study.pdf| publisher = Theatre Under the Stars| location = Houston, TX| page = 2| format = PDF| year = 2007| archivedate = November 27, 2007| accessdate = May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatists [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] composed their own music to accompany their plays and [[Choreography|choreographed]] the dances of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. The 3rd-century BCE [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman comedies]] of [[Plautus]] included song and dance routines performed with orchestrations. The Romans also introduced technical innovations. For example, to make dance steps more audible in large open-air theatres, Roman actors attached metal chips called ''sabilla'' to their stage footwear, creating the first [[Tap dance|tap]] shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn 1997, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The music from all of these forms is lost, however, and they had little influence on later development of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/stagecap.htm "A Capsule History"], Musicals101.com, 2003, accessed October 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Middle Ages]], theatre in Europe consisted mostly of travelling minstrels and small performing troupes of performers singing and offering slapstick comedy.&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/erastage.htm "History of Stage Musicals"], Musicals101.com, 2003, accessed May 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas, such as ''The Play of Herod'' and ''The Play of Daniel'' taught the [[liturgy]], set to church chants. Later "[[mystery play]]s" were created that told a biblical story in a sequence of entertaining parts. Several [[pageant wagon]]s (stages on wheels) would move about the city, and a group of actors would tell their part of the story. Once finished, the group would move on with their wagon, and the next group would arrive to tell its part of the story. These plays developed into an autonomous form of musical theatre, with poetic forms sometimes alternating with the prose dialogues and liturgical chants. The poetry was provided with modified or completely new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin 1978, pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance to the 1800s==
[[File:Opera backdrop..gif|thumb|250px|left|A view of Rhodes by [[John Webb (architect)|John Webb]], to be painted on a backshutter for the first performance of ''The Siege of Rhodes'' (1856)]]
The European [[Renaissance]] saw older forms evolve into [[commedia dell'arte]], an Italian tradition where raucous clowns improvised their way through familiar stories, and later, [[opera buffa]]. In England, Elizabethan and Jacobean plays frequently included music, with performances on organs, lutes, viols and pipes for up to an hour before and during the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Lord 2003, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Plays, perhaps particularly the heavier histories and tragedies, were frequently broken up with a short musical play, perhaps derived from the Italian [[intermezzo]], with music, jokes and dancing, or were followed by an [[afterpiece]] known as a jigg, often consisting of scandalous or libellous dialogue set to popular tunes (anticipating the [[Ballad Opera]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lord 2003, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Court [[masques]] also developed during the Tudor period that involved music, dancing, singing and acting, often with expensive costumes and a complex [[stage design]], sometimes by a renowned architect such as [[Inigo Jones]], presented a deferential allegory flattering to a noble or royal patron.&lt;ref&gt;Buelow 2004, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Jonson]] wrote many masques, often collaborating with Jones. [[William Shakespeare]] often included masque-like sections in his plays.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare 1998, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical sections of masques developed into sung plays that are recognizable as English operas, the first usually being thought of as [[William Davenant]]'s ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'' (1656), originally given in a private performance.&lt;ref name="Buelow 2004, p. 328"&gt;Buelow 2004, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; In France, meanwhile, [[Molière]] turned several of his farcical comedies into musical entertainments with songs (music provided by [[Jean Baptiste Lully]]) and dance in the late 17th century. His ''[[Psyché (play)|Psyche]]'' was the model for an English opera by [[Thomas Shadwell]], ''The Miser'' produced in 1672.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Carter and Butt 2005, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Davenant produced ''[[The Tempest (Dryden)|The Tempest]]'' in 1667, which was the first Shakespeare plot set to music, and was then adapted by Shadwell into an opera in 1674 (composed by [[Matthew Locke (composer)|Matthew Locke]] and others).&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often considered the first true English-language opera.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2001, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Blow was followed by [[Henry Purcell]] and a brief period of [[Opera in English|English opera]]. After the death of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1685, English opera began to fall out of fashion.&lt;ref name="Buelow 2004, p. 328"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the most popular forms of musical theatre in Britain were [[ballad operas]], like [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), that included lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and later the developing form of [[pantomime]] and [[comic opera]]s with original scores and mostly romantic plot lines, like [[Michael Balfe]]'s ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' (1845). Meanwhile, on the continent, [[singspiel]], [[comédie en vaudeville]], [[opéra comique]] and other forms of light musical entertainment were emerging. Other musical theatre forms developed by the 19th century, such as [[music hall]] and [[melodrama]]. Melodramas and [[burletta]]s, in particular, were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music. Some unlicensed theaters avoided the legal restrictions by providing supposedly free musical shows while serving tea at wildly inflated prices. In 1820, a new ordinance restricted all unlicensed theater productions to no more than six songs, which had to be an organic part of the play rather than a break or digression.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen (2007), p. 810&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, what a piece was called did not necessarily define what it was. The Broadway [[extravaganza]] ''The Magic Deer'' (1852) advertised itself as "A Serio Comico Tragico Operatical Historical Extravaganzical Burletical Tale of Enchantment."&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt;

The first recorded long-running play of any kind was ''The Beggar's Opera'', which ran for 62 successive performances in 1728. It would take almost a century before the first play broke 100 performances, with ''Tom and Jerry'', based on the book ''Life in London'' (1821), and the record soon reached 150 in the late 1820s.&lt;ref name="dgillan.screaming.net"&gt;{{cite web| first = Don| last = Gillan| title = Longest Running Plays in London and New York| url = http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html| work = Stage Beauty| year = 2007| accessdate = May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial America did not have a significant theatre presence until 1752, when London entrepreneur William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors to the colonies with his brother [[Lewis Hallam|Lewis]] as their manager.&lt;ref name=Wilmethp.182&gt;Wilmeth and Miller, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; They established a theatre in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] and opened with ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''The Anatomist''. The company moved to New York in the summer of 1753, performing ballad-operas such as ''The Beggar’s Opera'' and ballad-farces like ''Damon and Phillida''.&lt;ref name=Wilmethp.182/&gt; By the 1840s, [[P.T. Barnum]] was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmeth and Miller, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Other early musical theatre in America consisted of British forms, such as burletta and pantomime.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown from around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate prices, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s. Broadway's first "long-run" musical was a 50 performance hit called ''The Elves'' in 1857. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's "musical burletta" ''Seven Sisters'' (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1991, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1850, the French composer [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]] was experimenting with a form of comic musical theatre that came to be called [[opérette]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/937354 "The Music of 'Musicals'"]. ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 98, No. 1375 (September, 1957), pp. 483–85, Musical Times Publications Ltd., accessed 17 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The best known composers of [[operetta]] were [[Jacques Offenbach]] from the 1850s to the 1870s and [[Johann Strauss II]] in the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; Offenbach's fertile melodies, combined with his librettists' witty satire, formed a model for the musical theatre that followed.  In 1957, Mark Lubbock traced the development of musical theatre from Offenbach to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and eventually to [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], writing: "Offenbach is undoubtedly the most significant figure in the history of the 'musical'.&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/937354 "The Music of 'Musicals'",] ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 98, No. 1375 (September 1957), pp. 483–485 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century in England, musical theatre consisted of mostly of [[music hall]], adaptations of the French operettas (played in bad, risqué translations) and [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] (the culmination of which were seen at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] beginning in 1868). In reaction to these, a few family-friendly entertainments were created, such as the [[German Reed Entertainments]].&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;[[Jessie Bond|Bond, Jessie]]. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/intro.html Introduction to ''The Life and Reminiscences of Jessie Bond''], reprinted at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed March 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, mid-18th century musical theatre entertainments included crude variety revue, which eventually developed into [[vaudeville]], [[minstrel shows]], which soon crossed the Atlantic to Britain, and Victorian burlesque, first popularized in the US by British troupes.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; The first original theatre piece in English that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is generally considered ''[[The Black Crook]]'', which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was a staggering five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances, in no small part because of its scantily-clad female ballet chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen (2007), p. 811&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post'' was the first show to call itself a "musical comedy." Comedians [[Edward Harrigan]] and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (''The Mulligan Guard Picnic'') and 1885, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law David Braham. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step from burletta, minstrel shows, variety and burlesque, towards a more [[Legitimate theater|legitimate]] theatrical form. They starred high quality singers ([[Lillian Russell]], [[Vivienne Segal]], and [[Fay Templeton]]) instead of the ladies of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.

The length of runs in the theatre changed rapidly around the same time that the modern musical emerged. As transportation improved, poverty in London and New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London (non-musical) comedy ''[[Our Boys]]'', opening in 1875, which set an astonishing new record of 1,362 performances.&lt;ref name="dgillan.screaming.net"/&gt;  This run was not equaled on the musical stage until [[World War I]], but musical theatre soon broke the 500 performance mark in London, most notably by the series of more than a dozen long-running [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] family-friendly [[comic opera]] hits, including ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878 and ''[[The Mikado]]'' in 1885.  These were sensations on both sides of the Atlantic&lt;ref name=WeAll&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/usafter.htm "G&amp;S in the USA" at the musicals101 website] ''The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film'' (2008).  Retrieved on 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and, along with the other changes in the theatre, raised the standard for what was considered a successful run.  Only a few 19th century musical pieces exceeded the run of the Mikado:  ''[[The Chimes of Normandy]]'' (''Les Cloches de Corneville'') ran for 705 performances in 1878 in London, and [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[B. C. Stephenson]]'s 1886 hit, ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' (a show midway between comic opera and musical comedy), set a new record with 931 performances.

Gilbert and Sullivan's influence on later musical theatre was profound, creating examples of how to "integrate" musicals so that the lyrics and dialogue were designed to advance a coherent story.&lt;ref name=Jones10&gt;Jones, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WqQH31qkYNoC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Bordman+pinafore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-4A-Dm231B&amp;sig=UwT_XytKbxkRXtLo_OV7-_VTlps&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RPzlSezEBpeUMcSs4I4J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA4,M1 pp. 10–11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier, Earl F.

Osmond Carr]]. The most popular British shows, beginning with the [[Savoy operas]], also enjoyed profitable New York productions and tours of Britain, America, Europe, Australasia and South Africa. These shows were fare for "respectable" audiences, a marked contrast from the risqué burlesques, melodramas, minstrel shows, bawdy music hall shows and French operettas that dominated the stage prior to Gilbert and Sullivan and drew a sometimes seedy crowd looking for less wholesome entertainment.&lt;ref name=Bond/&gt;

==1890s to the new century==
[[File:GaietyGirlDudleyHardy.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) was one of the first hit musicals]]
[[Charles H. Hoyt]]'s ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' (1891) was Broadway's long-run champion (until ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'' in 1919), running for 657 performances. Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were both pirated and imitated in New York by productions such as [[Reginald de Koven]]'s ''[[Robin Hood (comic opera)|Robin Hood]]'' (1891) and [[John Philip Sousa]]'s ''[[El Capitan (operetta)|El Capitan]]'' (1896). ''A Trip to Coontown'' (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by [[African American]]s in a Broadway theatre (largely inspired by the routines of the [[minstrel show]]s), followed by the [[ragtime]]-tinged ''Clorindy, or the Origin of the Cakewalk'' (1898), and the highly successful ''In Dahomey'' (1902). Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century composed of songs written in New York's [[Tin Pan Alley]] by composers such as [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]], [[John Walter Bratton]] and [[George M. Cohan]] (''[[Little Johnny Jones]]'' (1904)). Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="dgillan.screaming.net"/&gt; Tours, however, were often extensive, beginning with the original Broadway cast.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Evan Swartz's ''[[Oz Before the Rainbow]]'' describes the enormous train trips required of the cast of the 1903 smash hit, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which tour ran for nine years, including on the road. See Swartz, Mark Evan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_7VbOGM8iMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Oz+before+the+rainbow%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q_nhXLTqwK&amp;sig=Bsrcqapb4szk6WPRC_xhUo7Fyg8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-ncuTbn2JIH58AaSwM2UCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Oz Before the Rainbow: L. Frank Baum's 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' on Stage and Screen to 1939"]. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8018-6477-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, musicals had spread to the London stage by the [[Gay Nineties]]. [[George Edwardes]] had left the management of [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s [[Savoy Theatre]]. He took over the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] and, at first, he improved the quality of the old burlesques. He perceived that audiences wanted a new alternative to the [[Savoy opera|Savoy]]-style comic operas and their intellectual, political, absurdist satire. He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the Gaiety, [[Daly's Theatre]] and other venues. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and also used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his "respectable" corps of dancing, singing [[Gaiety Girls]] to complete the musical and visual fun. The success of the first of these, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' in 1892 and ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' in 1893, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking. These "musical comedies", as he called them, revolutionized the London stage and set the tone for the next three decades.

[[File:Cover of the Vocal Score of Sidney Jones' The Geisha.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of the Vocal Score of [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]]' ''The Geisha'']]
Edwardes' early Gaiety hits included a series of light, romantic "poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds" shows, usually with the word "Girl" in the title, including ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894) and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898), with music by [[Ivan Caryll]] and [[Lionel Monckton]]. These shows were immediately widely copied at other London theatres (and soon in America), and the [[Edwardian musical comedy]] swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. At [[Daly's Theatre]], Edwardes presented slightly more complex comedy hits. ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) by [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] with lyrics by [[Harry Greenbank]] and [[Adrian Ross]] and then Jones' ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899) each ran for more than two years and also found great international success, for example in Australian productions by [[J. C. Williamson]].

The British musical comedy ''[[Florodora]]'' (1899) by [[Leslie Stuart]] and [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] made a splash on both sides of the Atlantic, as did ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' (1901), by British lyricist [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]] and American-born composer [[Howard Talbot]], which ran for a record setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York. The story concerns couples who honeymoon in China and inadvertently break the kissing laws (shades of ''[[The Mikado]]''). ''[[The Belle of New York (theatre)|The Belle of New York]]'' (1898) ran for 697 performances in London after a brief New York run, becoming the first American musical to run for over a year in London. After the turn of the 20th century, [[Seymour Hicks]] (who joined forces with American producer [[Charles Frohman]]) wrote popular shows with composer [[Charles H. Taylor (lyricist)|Charles Taylor]] and others, and Edwardes and Ross continued to churn out hits like ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901), ''[[A Country Girl]]'' (1902), ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903), ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907) and ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909). Other Edwardian musical comedy hits included ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909) and ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/the_gaiety/biblio.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:49:37 Index to ''The Gaiety''], a British musical theatre publication with articles about Victorian and Edwardian musical theatre.

==Operetta and World War I==

Virtually eliminated from the English-speaking stage by competition from the ubiquitous Edwardian musical comedies in the 1890s, operettas returned to London and Broadway in 1907 with ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', and operettas and musicals became direct competitors for a time. In the early years of the 20th century, English-language adaptations of 19th century continental operettas, as well as operettas by a new generation of European composers, such as [[Franz Lehár]] and [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]], among others, spread throughout the English-speaking world. In America, [[Victor Herbert]] produced a string of famous operettas (''[[The Fortune Teller (operetta)|The Fortune Teller]]'' (1898), ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903), ''[[Mlle. Modiste]]'' (1905), ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906) and ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910)), often with librettist [[Harry B. Smith]], as well as some intimate musical plays with modern settings.  In English-speaking countries, during [[World War I]], German-language operetta lost its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/who22.htm Basil Hood], ''Who's Who in Musicals: Additional Bios XII'', Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other British and American composers and librettists of the 1910s, the team of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Guy Bolton]] and [[Jerome Kern]] stood out. Following in the footsteps of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], their "[[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] shows" paved the way for Kern's later work by showing that a musical could combine light, popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs:&lt;ref name=Jones10/&gt;
{{quote|"These shows built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization. The integration of song and story is periodically announced as a breakthrough in ... musical theater. Great opera has always done this, and it is easy to demonstrate such integration in Gilbert and Sullivan or the French [[opera bouffe]]. However, early musical comedy was often guilty of inserting songs in a hit-or-miss fashion. The Princess Theatre musicals brought about a change in approach. P. G. Wodehouse, the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day, and the team of Bolton, Wodehouse, and Kern had an influence felt to this day.&lt;ref name=Quarterly/&gt;}}

The theatre-going public needed escapist entertainment during the dark times of [[World War I]], and they flocked to the theatre. [[Harry Tierney]] and [[Joseph McCarthy (lyricist)|Joseph McCarthy]]'s 1919 hit musical ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'' ran for 670 performances, a Broadway record that held until 1938's ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]''. The British public supported far longer runs like that of ''[[Maid of the Mountains]]'' (1,352 performances) and especially ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]''. Its run of 2,238 performances was more than twice as many as any previous musical, setting a record that stood for nearly forty years until ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]''. Revues like ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]'' in Britain, and those of [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] and his imitators in America, were also extraordinarily popular. A new generation of composers of operettas emerged in the 1920s, such as [[Rudolf Friml]] and [[Sigmund Romberg]].&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt;

The primacy of British musical theatre from the 19th century through 1920 was gradually replaced by American innovation in the 20th century. Edwardes' competitor and counterpart in the U.S. was [[Charles Frohman]] and his [[Theatrical Syndicate]]. [[George M. Cohan]]'s and Herbert's musical entertainments after the turn of the century gave way to the Princess Theatre shows and a profusion of other musicals as Kern and other [[Tin Pan Alley]] composers began to bring new musical styles such as [[ragtime]] and [[jazz]] to the theatres. The [[Shubert Brothers]] took control of the Broadway theatres after the war as new writers like the Gershwin brothers ([[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]]), [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Rodgers and Hart]] began to produce shows. Musical theatre writer [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]] notes, "The triumph of American works over European in the first decades of the twentieth century came about against a changing social background. The operatic and theatrical styles of nineteenth-century social structures were replaced by a musical style more aptly suited to twentieth-century society and its vernacular idiom. It was from America that the more direct style emerged, and in America that it was able to flourish in a developing society less hidebound by nineteenth-century tradition."&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Lamb| first = Andrew| date = Spring 1986| title = From Pinafore to Porter: United States-United Kingdom Interactions in Musical Theater, 1879–1929| journal = American Music| volume = 4| issue = British-American Musical Interactions | page = 47| publisher = University of Illinois Press| location = Chicago| issn = 0734-4392| jstor = 3052183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression==
[[File:Sallysm.jpg|thumb|upright|Sheet music from ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'', 1920]] 
The musicals of the [[Roaring Twenties]], borrowing from vaudeville, [[music hall]] and other light entertainments, tended to emphasize star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs, at the expense of plot. Typical of the decade were lighthearted productions like ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]''; ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''; ''[[Sunny (musical)|Sunny]]''; ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''; ''[[Oh, Kay!]]'' and ''[[Funny Face (musical)|Funny Face]]''. While the books of these shows may have been forgettable, they featured stars such as [[Marilyn Miller]] and [[Fred Astaire]] and produced dozens of enduring popular songs ("[[Traditional pop music|standards]]") by, most notably, Jerome Kern, the Gershwin brothers, Irving Berlin, [[Cole Porter]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and the team of [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, popular music was dominated by musical theatre composers and lyricists. These musicals and the standards they produced, including "[[Fascinating Rhythm]]", "[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]" and "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (song)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]", became popular on both sides of the Atlantic ocean.

Many shows were [[revue]]s, series of sketches and songs with little or no connection between them. The best-known of these were the annual ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets, elaborate costumes, and beautiful chorus girls.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; These spectacles also raised production values, and mounting a musical generally became more expensive. ''[[Shuffle Along]]'', an all-[[African American]] show was a hit on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;Krasner, David. ''A Beautiful Pageant: African American Theatre, Drama and Performance in the Harlem Renaissance, 1910–1927'', Palgrave MacMillan, 2002, pp. 263–67&lt;/ref&gt;  In London, stars such as [[Ivor Novello]] and [[Noël Coward]] became popular.  Meanwhile, operettas, which had been nearly absent from the English-speaking stage since World War I, had a last burst of popularity; works by continental European composers were successful, as were those by [[Sigmund Romberg]] and [[Rudolf Friml]] in America, which included ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' and ''[[The Student Prince]]'' respectively.  The last hit operetta of the era on Broadway was Romberg's ''[[The New Moon]]'' in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Midgette, Anne. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/29/theater/operetta-review-much-silliness-in-a-gilt-frame.html "Operetta Review: Much Silliness In a Gilt Frame"], ''The New York Times'', March 29, 2003, accessed December 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressing far beyond the comparatively frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, ''[[Show Boat]]'', which premiered on December 27, 1927 at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York, represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. This was accomplished by combining the lyricism of Kern's music with the skillful craft of [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], who adapted [[Edna Ferber]]'s novel and wrote lyrics for the show. One historian wrote, "Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now ... the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity."&lt;ref name=history&gt;Lubbock 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bordman argues, "''Show Boat'' is certainly an operetta with its many [[arioso]] passages, its musical depth and seriousness, and its romantic story set, in typical operetta fashion, in the long ago and far away."&lt;ref name=Quarterly&gt;Bordman, Gerald. "Jerome David Kern: Innovator/Traditionalist", ''The Musical Quarterly'', 1985, Vol. 71, No. 4, pp. 468–73&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as the [[Great Depression]] set in during the post-Broadway national tour of ''Show Boat'', the public turned back to light, brassy, escapist entertainment, and no follow-up was produced so seriously treating serious social themes until ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' in 1943.&lt;ref name=Quarterly/&gt;

The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition to theatre. But by the end of the 1920s, films like ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' could be presented with synchronized sound. [[Sound film|"Talkie"]] films at low prices effectively killed off [[vaudeville]] by the early 1930s. Historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]] commented: "Top vaudeville stars filmed their acts for one-time pay-offs, inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville. After all, when 'small time' theatres could offer 'big time' performers on screen at a nickel a seat, who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent?"&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1927-30film2.htm "History of Musical Film, 1927–30: Part II"]. Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s to ''Oklahoma!''==
[[File:EthelMermanStageDoorCanteen.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Ethel Merman]]]]
The Great Depression affected theatre audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as people had little money to spend on entertainment.  Only a few stage shows exceeded a run on Broadway or in London of 500 performances during the decade.

Many shows continued the lighthearted song-and-dance style of their 1920s predecessors. The revue ''[[The Band Wagon (musical)|The Band Wagon]]'' (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister [[Adele Astaire|Adele]], while Cole Porter's ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934) confirmed [[Ethel Merman]]'s position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. British writers such as Noël Coward and Ivor Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as ''[[The Dancing Years]]''. Similarly, [[Rodgers &amp; Hart]] returned from Hollywood to churn out a series of Broadway hits, including ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, with [[Ray Bolger]], the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), ''[[Babes In Arms]]'' (1937), and ''[[The Boys From Syracuse]]'' (1938), and [[Cole Porter]] wrote a similar string of hits, including ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934) and ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]'' (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record that was finally beaten by ''Oklahoma!'' five years later.

[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rodgers and Hart]]]]
However, a few creative teams began to build on ''Show Boat'''s innovations, experimenting with musical satire, topical books and operatic scope. ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931), a political satire with music by George Gershwin and lyrics by [[Ira Gershwin]] and [[Morrie Ryskind]], was the first musical awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1944 1944 awards], Pulitzer.org, accessed July 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' (1933), a revue by [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Moss Hart]] in which each song or sketch was based on a newspaper headline, marked the first Broadway show in which an African-American, [[Ethel Waters]], starred alongside white actors. Waters' numbers included "[[Supper Time]]", a woman's lament for her husband who has been lynched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Richard | last = Connema| title = San Francisco: ''As Thousands Cheer'' and ''Dear World''| url = http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sanfran/s75.html| publisher = TalkinBroadway.Org, Inc.| year = 2000| accessdate = May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935), by the Gershwin brothers and [[DuBose Heyward]], featured an all African-American cast and blended operatic, folk, and jazz idioms. It has entered the permanent opera repertory and, in some respects, it foreshadowed such "operatic" musicals as ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]''. ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1937), with a book and score by [[Marc Blitzstein]] and direction by [[Orson Welles]], was a highly political pro-[[trade union|union]] piece that, despite the controversy surrounding it, managed to run for 108 performances. Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'' (1937) was a political satire with [[George M. Cohan]] as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'', based on source writings by [[Washington Irving]], depicted New York City's early history while good-naturedly satirizing the good intentions of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

Despite the economic woes of the decade and the competition from film, the musical survived.  In fact, the move towards political satire in ''Of Thee I Sing'', ''I'd Rather Be Right'' and ''Knickerbocker Holiday'', together with the musical sophistication of the Gershwin, Kern, Rodgers and Weill musicals and the fast-paced staging and naturalistic dialogue style created by director [[George Abbott]], showed that musical theatre was beginning to evolve beyond the gags and showgirls musicals of the ''Gay Nineties'' and ''Roaring Twenties'' and the sentimental romance of operetta.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943) completed the revolution begun by ''[[Show Boat]]'', by tightly integrating all the aspects of musical theatre, with a cohesive and more serious plot, and songs and dances that furthered the action of the story and developed the characters. It was also the first "blockbuster" Broadway show, running a total of 2,212 performances, and was made into a hit film.&lt;ref name="World Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Everett 2002, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ELEX''''' ('''''Eclectic, Lavish, Exhilarating, Xenial''''') is a [[science fantasy]]-themed [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Piranha Bytes]] and published by [[THQ Nordic]]. It was released worldwide on October 17, 2017, for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref name="WCC Exlex Article"&gt;http://wccftech.com/elex-the-sci-fi-rpg-from-gothicrisen-devs-gets-first-footage-new-images/&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been described as a "edgy, dark, uncompromising, and complex" post-apocalyptic sci-fi role-playing game where the protagonist joins the war for the powerful resource, "ELEX", which gives people magic-like powers.&lt;ref name="Polygon Gameplay Article"&gt;http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/2/8880675/elex-piranha-bytes-&lt;/ref&gt; The game world is a mix of futuristic and medieval locations, in which the player can use guns, swords and magic against enemies.&lt;ref name="Giant Bomb Entry"&gt;http://www.giantbomb.com/elex/3030-50584/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
{{more plot|date=November 2017}}
Magalan was a planet looking to the future. Then a comet hit the planet, causing massive destruction. Those who survived are now trapped in a battle to survive, and a struggle to decide the fate of the planet. At the center of this fight is the element ELEX, a precious and limited resource that arrived with the meteor, which can power machines, give magical powers, or re-sculpt life into new, different forms. The protagonist is a former member of the Albs, who use ELEX to power their advanced technology and consume it to gain enhanced strength as well as rid them of emotions and enable them to make decisions based on cold logic alone.&lt;ref name="Dev Interview"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=86&amp;v=YuBjK7Kf9F4&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovering from a crash in his glider jet, the protagonist goes through withdrawal from ELEX, experiences emotions for the first time in his life, and is classified as a traitor to the Albs. A central conflict of the story will be the player character's history with the Albs and the need to hide his former identity from the factions he previously fought with.

The player can cooperate with and eventually join one of three factions in the game. The Berserkers have renounced modern technology and the use of Elex, instead finding a way to purify the substance into Mana to weave magic and restore life to nature. The Clerics fanatically worship a god called Calaan and operate like a religious police state where consuming Elex is expressly forbidden but it is used to power complex war technologies. The Outlaws have no formal leadership and operate with a "survival of the fittest" mentality, using improvised and deadly weaponry, and consume Elex in the form of specialized stimulant drugs.

==Gameplay==
''ELEX'' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] game set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[open world]] environment and played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The player can use both swords and firearms in the game, with magic becoming available later.&lt;ref name="Polygon Gameplay Article"/&gt; The game includes mutated creatures as one of the enemy types, and has an interconnected quest system that supports player choices. The player may join up with one of three factions - the Berserkers who use ELEX for magical purposes, the Clerics who use the substance to power their machines, or the Outlaws who embrace an "everyone for themselves" philosophy.&lt;ref name="Dev Interview"/&gt;

== Development ==
''ELEX'' was announced during [[Gamescom]] 2015, where [[Piranha Bytes]] and [[THQ_Nordic|Nordic Games]] confirmed their partnership on the project.&lt;ref name="WCC Exlex Article"/&gt; It was featured as a cover story in the German magazine ''GameStar''.&lt;ref name="GameStar Cover Story on ELEX"&gt;http://www.gamestar.de/spiele/elex/artikel/elex,52515,3234106.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{Video game reviews

| GSpot = 7.3/10
| IGN = 4.9/10
}}

''ELEX'' received "mixed to average" reviews from critics, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. Most critics praised the game's ambition and world, but criticized the story, unresponsive controls, and frustrating combat mechanics.

[[File:Ragazza1963Bava01.png|thumb|[[Letícia Román]] in ''[[The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963 film)|The Girl Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1963), considered by most critics to be the first ''giallo'' film.]]
'''''Giallo''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒallo}}; plural '''''gialli''''') is a 20th-century [[Italy|Italian]] genre of literature and film. Especially outside Italy, ''giallo'' refers specifically to a particular Italian thriller-horror genre that has [[mystery fiction|mystery]] or [[detective fiction|detective]] elements and often contains [[Slasher film|slasher]], [[crime fiction]], [[psychological thriller]], [[psychological horror]], [[exploitation film|exploitation]], [[Sexploitation film|sexploitation]], and, less frequently, [[supernatural|supernatural horror]] elements. In Italy, the term generally denotes [[thriller (genre)|thrillers]], typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror [[subgenres]], regardless of the country of origin.

In English-speaking countries, the term ''giallo'' often refers to the Italian film version of the genre, a particular style of Italian-produced [[murder mystery]] thriller-horror film that usually blends the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with elements of [[horror fiction]] (such as slasher violence) and [[eroticism]] (similar to the French ''[[fantastique]]'' genre), and often involves a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the final act of the film. The genre developed in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades. (Some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American [[slasher film]] genre.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pp=46–49}}

The word [[:wiktionary:giallo|''giallo'']] is Italian for yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=WhatCulture |url=http://whatculture.com/film/watch-me-while-i-kill-top-20-italian-giallo-films.php |title=Watch Me While I Kill: Top 20 Italian Giallo Films |author=Simpson, Clare |date=February 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117220049/http://whatculture.com/film/watch-me-while-i-kill-top-20-italian-giallo-films.php |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from a series of cheap [[paperback]] mystery novels with yellow covers that were popular in post-fascist Italy.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinoeye.org/02/11/needham11.php |title=Playing with Genre: An Introduction to the Italian Giallo |last=Needham |first=Gary |website=Kinoeye |accessdate= September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Giallo Novel by Edgar Wallace, il Fante di Fiori.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Mondadori's]] 1933 translation of [[Edgar Wallace]]'s 1920 novel ''Jack O' Judgement'' (rendered in Italian as ''Il Fante di Fiori'', ''The Jack of Clubs''), with the characteristic yellow background and the figure of a masked killer.]]

The term ''[[:wiktionary:it:giallo|giallo]]'' ("yellow") derives from a series of crime-mystery [[pulp magazine|pulp novels]] entitled ''[[Il Giallo Mondadori]]'' (''Mondadori Yellow''), published by [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Mondadori]] from 1929 and taking its name from the trademark yellow cover background. The series consisted almost exclusively of Italian translations of mystery novels by British and American writers. These included [[Agatha Christie]], [[Ellery Queen]], [[Edgar Wallace]], [[Ed McBain]], [[Rex Stout]] and [[Raymond Chandler]].&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sound on Sight"/&gt;

Published as cheap paperbacks, the success of the ''giallo'' novels soon began attracting the attention of other Italian publishing houses. They published their own versions and mimicked the yellow covers. The popularity of these series eventually established the word ''giallo'' as a [[synonym]] in Italian for a mystery novel. In colloquial and media usage in Italy, it also applied to a mysterious or unsolved affair.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

==Film==
In the Italian language, ''giallo'' is a broad term that can be translated as "crime novel" including any literary genre involving crime and mystery, with all its sub-genres such as crime fiction, detective story, murder mystery or thriller-horror.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the movie context, for Italian audiences ''giallo'' has come to refer to any kind of murder mystery or horror thriller, regardless of its origin.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Thus, American, British or other horror-thrillers such as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', and ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'' are considered ''gialli''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

English-speaking audiences have used the term to refer specifically to the type of Italian-produced thriller-horror films known to Italian audiences as ''giallo all'italiana''.&lt;ref name="Sound on Sight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsight.org/greatest-horror-movies-ever-made-part-6-best-italian-giallo-films/ |title=Greatest (Italian) Giallo Films |last=da Conceição |first=Ricky |website=Sound on Sight |date=October 16, 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film subgenre began as literal adaptations of the ''giallo'' mystery novels. Directors soon began taking advantage of modern cinematic techniques to create a unique genre that retained the [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[crime fiction]] elements of ''giallo'' novels but veered more closely into the [[psychological thriller]] or [[psychological horror]] genres. Many of the typical characteristics of these films were incorporated into the later American [[slasher film|slasher]] genre.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pp=46–49}}

===Characteristics===
Critics disagree on characterization of a ''giallo'' film.&lt;ref name="koven"/&gt; Gary Needham wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By its very nature, the ''giallo'' challenges our assumptions about how non-Hollywood films should be classified, going beyond the sort of Anglo-American taxonomic imaginary that "fixes" genre both in film criticism and the film industry in order to designate something specific. ...however, despite the ''giallo'''s resistance to clear definition there are nevertheless identifiable thematic and stylistic tropes.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These distinct "thematic and stylistic tropes" constitute a loose definition of the genre which is broadly consistent, though various critics have proposed slightly differing characteristic details (which consequently creates some confusion over which films can be considered gialli).&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How To Spot"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10377468/Violence-mystery-and-magic-how-to-spot-a-giallo-movie.html|title=Violence, mystery and magic: how to spot a giallo movie |first=Anne |last= Billson |date= October 14, 2013 |accessdate= August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they often involve crime and detective work, gialli should not be confused with the other popular Italian crime genre of the 1970s, the ''[[poliziotteschi]]'', which includes more [[action film|action]]-oriented films about violent [[law enforcement officer]]s (largely influenced by gritty 1970s American films such as ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]''). Directors and stars often moved between both genres and some films could be considered under either banner, such as Massimo Dallamano's 1974 film ''La polizia chiede aiuto'' (''[[What Have They Done to Your Daughters?]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcomment.com/entry/bombast-poliziotteschi-and-screening-history |title=Bombast: Poliziotteschi and Screening History |last1=Pinkerton |first1=Nick |date=4 July 2014 |website=[[Film Comment]] |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics agree that the ''giallo'' represents a distinct category with unique features.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

====Structure====
Giallo films are generally characterized as gruesome murder-mystery thrillers, that combine the suspense elements of [[detective fiction]] with scenes of shocking horror, featuring excessive bloodletting, stylish camerawork and often jarring musical arrangements. The [[Archetype|archetypal]] ''giallo'' plot involves a mysterious, black-gloved psychopathic killer who stalks and butchers a series of beautiful women.&lt;ref name="How To Spot"/&gt; While most gialli involve a human killer, some also feature a [[supernatural]] element.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{cite web |last=Abrams |first=Jon |title=GIALLO WEEK!

The typical ''giallo'' [[protagonist]] is an outsider of some type, often a traveler or [[tourist]], and usually a young woman (gialli rarely feature [[law enforcement officer]]s as chief protagonists, which would be more characteristic of the [[poliziotteschi]] genre).&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt; The protagonists are generally unconnected to the murders before they begin and are drawn to help find the killer through their role as a [[witness]] to one of the murders.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt; The mystery is the identity of the killer, who is often revealed in the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] to be another key character, who conceals his or her identity with a [[disguise]] (usually some combination of hat, mask, sunglasses, gloves, and trench coat).&lt;ref name="koven 4"/&gt; Thus, the literary [[whodunit]] element of the ''giallo'' novels is retained, while being filtered through horror genre elements and Italy's long standing tradition of [[opera]] and staged [[Grand Guignol|grand guignol]] drama.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The structure of ''giallo'' films is also sometimes reminiscent of the so-called "[[weird menace]]" pulp magazine horror mystery genre of the 1930–1940s, a genre itself also heavily influenced by grand guignol and related to the original Italian ''giallo'' novels.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

It is important to note that while most gialli feature elements of this basic [[narrative structure]], not all do. Some films (for example Mario Bava's 1970 ''[[Hatchet for the Honeymoon]]'', which features the killer as the protagonist) may radically alter the traditional structure or abandon it altogether and still be considered gialli due to stylistic or thematic tropes, rather than narrative ones.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt; A consistent element of the genre, is an unusual lack of focus on coherent or logical narrative storytelling. While most have a nominal mystery structure, they may feature bizarre or seemingly nonsensical plot elements and a general disregard for [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in [[acting]], [[dialogue]] and character motivation.&lt;ref name="Sound on Sight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kannas"/&gt; As Jon Abrams wrote, "Individually, each [''giallo''] is like an improv exercise in murder, with each filmmaker having access to a handful of shared props and themes. Black gloves, sexual ambiguity, and psychoanalytic trauma may be at the heart of each film, but the genre itself is without consistent narrative form."&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;

====Content====
While a shadowy killer and mystery narrative are common to most gialli, the most consistent and notable shared trope in the ''giallo'' tradition is the focus on grisly death sequences.&lt;ref name="Sound on Sight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt; The murders are invariably violent and gory, featuring a variety of explicit and imaginative attacks. These scenes frequently evoke some degree of [[voyeurism]], sometimes going so far as to present the murder from the [[First-person narrative|first-person perspective]] of the killer, with the black-gloved hand holding a knife viewed from the killer's [[Point of view shot|point of view]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Guins |first= Ray |date= 1996|title= Tortured Looks: Dario Argento and Visual Displeasure.|journal= Necronomicon: The Journal of Horror and Erotic Cinema |publisher= Creation Books |volume= 1|pages=141–153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koven 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koven |first =Mikel |date=October 2, 2006  |title= La Dolce Morte: Vernacular Cinema and the Italian Giallo Film|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0810858703 |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murders often occur when the victim is most vulnerable (showering, taking a bath, or scantily clad); as such, ''giallo'' films often include liberal amounts of nudity and sex, almost all of it featuring beautiful young women (actresses associated with the genre include [[Edwige Fenech]], [[Barbara Bach]], [[Daria Nicolodi]], [[Mimsy Farmer]], [[Barbara Bouchet]], [[Suzy Kendall]], [[Ida Galli]] and [[Anita Strindberg]]).&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt; Due to the titillating emphasis on explicit sex and violence, gialli are sometimes categorized as [[exploitation cinema]].&lt;ref name ="hunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koven 3"/&gt; The association of female sexuality and brutal violence has led some commentators to accuse the genre of [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name="Sound on Sight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koven"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koven |first=Mikel |date=October 2, 2006 |title= La Dolce Morte: Vernacular Cinema and the Italian Giallo Film |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0810858703 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olney |first=Ian |date=February 7, 2013 |title=Euro Horror: Classic European Horror Cinema in Contemporary American Culture (New Directions in National Cinemas) |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=025300652X |pp=36, 104, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Themes====
Gialli are noted for psychological themes of madness, alienation, sexuality and [[paranoia]].&lt;ref name="How To Spot"/&gt; The protagonist is usually a witness to a gruesome crime but frequently finds their [[testimony]] subject to [[skepticism]] from authority figures, leading to a questioning of their own [[perception]] and authority. This ambiguity of memory and perception can escalate to [[delusion]], [[hallucination]] and delirious paranoia. Since gialli protagonists are typically female, this can lead to what writer Gary Needham calls, "...the ''giallo'''s inherent pathologising of femininity and fascination with "sick" women."&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt; The killer is likely to be mentally ill as well; ''giallo'' killers are almost always motivated by insanity caused by some past psychological trauma, often of a sexual nature (and sometimes depicted in flashbacks).&lt;ref name="How To Spot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt; The emphasis on madness and subjective perception has roots in the ''giallo'' novels (for example, [[Sergio Martino]]'s ''[[Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key]]'' was based on [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", which deals with a psychologically unstable narrator) but also finds expression in the tools of cinema: The unsteady mental state of both victim and killer is often mirrored by the wildly exaggerated style and unfocused narrative common to many gialli.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Writer Mikel J. Koven posits that gialli reflect an ambivalence over the social upheaval modernity brought to Italian culture in the 1960s.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The changes within Italian culture... can be seen throughout the ''giallo'' film as something to be discussed and debated -- issues pertaining to identity, sexuality, increasing levels of violence, women's control over their own lives and bodies, history, the state -- all abstract ideas, which are all portrayed situationally as human stories in the ''giallo'' film.&lt;ref name="koven 5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koven |first =Mikel |date=October 2, 2006  |title= La Dolce Morte: Vernacular Cinema and the Italian Giallo Film|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0810858703 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Production===
Gialli have been noted for their strong cinematic technique, with critics praising their [[editing]], [[production design]], [[film score|music]] and visual style even in the marked absence of other facets usually associated with critical admiration (as gialli frequently lack [[characterization]], believable dialogue, realistic performances and logical coherence in the narrative).&lt;ref name="Sound on Sight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kannas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2007/book-reviews/la-dolce-morte/ |first=Alexia |last=Kannas |title=Simple Acts of Annihilation: La Dolce Morte: Vernacular Cinema and the Italian Giallo Film by Mikel J. Koven |date=August 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexia Kannas Wrote of 1968's ''[[La morte ha fatto l'uovo]]'' (''Death Laid an Egg'') that "While the film has garnered a reputation for its supreme narrative difficulty (just as many art films have), its aesthetic brilliance is irrefutable", while Leon Hunt wrote that frequent gialli director [[Dario Argento]]'s work "vacillate[s] between strategies of art cinema and exploitation".&lt;ref name="Kannas"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="hunt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Leon |date=Autumn 1992 |title=A (Sadistic) Night at the Opera: Notes on the Italian Horror Film |journal=Velvet Light Trap |volume=30 |p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visual style====
Gialli are frequently associated with strong technical [[cinematography]] and stylish visuals. Critic Maitland McDonagh describes the visuals of ''[[Deep Red|Profondo rosso]]'' (''Deep Red'') as, "vivid colors and bizarre camera angles, dizzying pans and flamboyant tracking shots, disorienting framing and composition, fetishistic close-ups of quivering eyes and weird objects (knives, dolls, marbles, braided scraps of wool)..."&lt;ref name="broken mirrors"/&gt; In addition to the iconic images of shadowy black-gloved killers and gruesome violence, gialli also frequently employ strongly stylized and even occasionally [[surrealism|surreal]] uses of color. Directors [[Dario Argento]] and [[Mario Bava]] are particularly known for their impressionistic imagery and use of lurid colors, though other ''giallo'' directors (notably [[Lucio Fulci]]) employed more sedate, realistic styles as well.&lt;ref name="AV Club"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.avclub.com/article/giallo-63699 | last= Murray| first = Noel | title= Gateways to Geekery: Giallo | date= October 20, 2011 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate= September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their typical 1970s milieu, some commentators have also noted their potential for visual [[Camp (style)|camp]], especially in terms of [[fashion]] and [[Interior design|decor]].&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How To Spot"/&gt;

====Music====
Music has been cited as a key to the genre's unique character;&lt;ref name="How To Spot"/&gt; critic Maitland McDonagh describes  ''[[Deep Red|Profondo rosso]]'' (''Deep Red'') as an "overwhelming visceral experience...equal parts visual...and aural." &lt;ref name="broken mirrors"&gt;{{cite book |last=McDonagh |first =Maitland |date=March 22, 2010  |title= Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn= 081665607X |page=vii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Anne Billson explains, "The Giallo Sound is typically an intoxicating mix of groovy lounge music, nerve-jangling discord, and the sort of soothing lyricism that belies the fact that it's actually accompanying, say, a slow motion decapitation", (she cites as an example [[Ennio Morricone]]'s score for 1971's ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'').&lt;ref name="How To Spot"/&gt; [[Film score|Composers]] of note include Morricone,  [[Bruno Nicolai]], and the Italian band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] (all three of whom are probably best known for their collaborations with director [[Dario Argento]], though they worked with other directors as well).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Other important composers known for their work on ''giallo'' films include [[Piero Umiliani]] (composer for ''[[Five Dolls for an August Moon]])'', [[Riz Ortolani]] (''[[The Pyjama Girl Case]]'') and [[Fabio Frizzi]] (''[[Sette note in nero]]'' a.k.a.''The Psychic'').{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

====Titles====
Gialli often feature lurid or [[baroque]] titles, frequently employing animal references or the use of numbers.&lt;ref name="How To Spot"/&gt; Examples of the former trend include ''[[Sette scialli di seta gialla]]'' (''Crimes of the Black Cat''), ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling|Non si sevizia un paperino]]'' (''Don't Torture a Duckling''), ''[[La morte negli occhi del gatto]]'' (''Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye'') and ''[[La tarantola dal ventre nero]]'' (''Black Belly of the Tarantula''); while instances of the latter include ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (''Seven Notes in Black'') and ''[[The Fifth Cord]]''.&lt;ref name="Giovannini"&gt;{{cite book |last= Giovannini|first =Fabio |date=1986 |title= Dario Argento: il brivido, il sangue, il thrilling.|publisher=Edizione Dedalo |isbn= 8822045165 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
The first ''giallo'' novel to be adapted for film was [[James M. Cain]]'s ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', adapted in 1943 by  [[Luchino Visconti]] as ''[[Ossessione]]''.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt; Though the film was technically the first of [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Mondadori's]] ''giallo'' series to be adapted, its [[Italian neorealism|neo-realist]] style was markedly different from the stylized, violent character which subsequent adaptations would acquire. Condemned by the fascist government, ''Obsessione'' was eventually hailed as a landmark of neo-realist cinema, but it did not provoke any further ''giallo'' adaptations for almost 20 years.&lt;ref name="koven 3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koven |first =Mikel |date=October 2, 2006  |title= La Dolce Morte: Vernacular Cinema and the Italian Giallo Film|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0810858703 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the literary ''giallo'' tradition, early gialli were also influenced by the German "[[krimi]]" films of the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="koven 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koven |first =Mikel |date=October 2, 2006  |title= La Dolce Morte: Vernacular Cinema and the Italian Giallo Film|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0810858703 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by Danish/German studio [[Rialto Film]], these black-and-white crime movies based on [[Edgar Wallace]] stories typically featured whodunit mystery plots with a masked killer, anticipating several key components of the ''giallo'' movement by several years.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Despite their link to ''giallo'' author Wallace, though, they featured little of the excessive stylization and gore which would define Italian gialli.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Swedish director [[Arne Mattsson]] has also been pointed to as a possible influence, in particular his 1958 film ''[[Mannequin in Red]]''. Though the film shares stylistic and narrative similarities with later ''giallo'' films (particularly its use of color and its multiple murder plot), there is no direct evidence that subsequent Italian directors had seen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersson |first =Pidde |date=October 2, 2006  |title= Blue Swede Shock!

[[File:Sei donne per l'assassino.png|thumb|left|Goffredo Unger as The Masked Killer from ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964) would serve as the visual template for the stock ''giallo'' killer.]]

The first "true" ''giallo'' film is usually considered to be [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963 film)|The Girl Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt; Its title alludes to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s classic ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934, remade by Hitchcock in 1956), highlighting the early link between gialli and Anglo-American crime stories. Though shot in black and white and lacking the lurid violence and sexuality which would define later gialli, the film has been credited with establishing the essential structure of the genre: in it, a young American tourist in Rome witnesses a murder, finds her testimony dismissed by the authorities, and must attempt to uncover the killer's identity herself. Bava drew on the krimi tradition as well as the Hitchcockian style referenced in the title, and the film's structure served as a basic template for many of the gialli that would follow.&lt;ref name="koven 4"/&gt;

Bava followed ''The Girl Who Knew Too Much'' the next year with the stylish and influential ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964). It introduced a number of elements that became emblematic of the genre: a masked stalker with a shiny weapon in his black-gloved hand who brutally murders a series of glamorous fashion models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rockoff |first =Adam |date=2002  |title= Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986|publisher= [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |isbn=0786469323| page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the movie was not a financial success at the time, the tropes it introduced (particularly its black-gloved killer, provocative sexuality, and bold use of color) would become iconic of the genre."&lt;ref name="koven 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;Lucas, Tim. ''Blood and Black Lace'' DVD, [[Image Entertainment]], 2005, [[liner notes]]. ASIN: B000BB1926&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Suspiria 1977.jpg|thumb|220px|Suzy ([[Jessica Harper]], right) and Sara ([[Stefania Casini]], left) in ''[[Suspiria]]'', the first film in [[Dario Argento]]'s "[[The Three Mothers]]" trilogy.]]
Several similarly-themed crime/thriller movies followed in the next few years, including early efforts from directors [[Antonio Margheriti]] (''Nude... si muore'' [''[[Naked You Die]]''] in 1968), [[Umberto Lenzi]] (''[[Orgasmo]]'' in 1968, ''Paranoia'' [''[[A Quiet Place to Kill]]''] and ''Così dolce... così perversa'' [''[[So Sweet... So Perverse]]''] in 1969) and [[Lucio Fulci]] (''[[Una sull'altra]]'' [''One on Top of the Other''] in 1969), all of whom would go on to become major creative forces in the burgeoning genre. But it was [[Dario Argento]]'s first feature, in 1970, that turned the ''giallo'' into a major cultural phenomenon. That film, ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]'', was greatly influenced by ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'', and introduced a new level of stylish violence and suspense that helped redefine the genre. The film was a box office smash and was widely imitated.&lt;ref name="broken mirrors 14"&gt;{{cite book |last=McDonagh |first =Maitland |date=March 22, 2010  |title= Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn= 081665607X |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success provoked a frenzy of Italian films with stylish, violent, and sexually provocative murder plots,  (Argento alone made three more in the next five years) essentially cementing the genre in the public consciousness. In 1996, director [[Michele Soavi]] wrote, "there's no doubt that it was Mario Bava who started the "spaghetti thrillers" [but] Argento gave them a great boost, a turning point, a new style...'new clothes'. Mario had grown old and Dario made it his own genre... this had repercussions on genre cinema, which, thanks to Dario, was given a new lease on life."&lt;ref name="Nightmares"&gt;{{cite book |last=Soavi |first=Michele |editor-last=Palmerini |editor-first=Luca M. |editor-last2=Mistretta |editor-first2=Gaetano|title= Spaghetti Nightmares |publisher=Fantasma Books |date=1996 |pages=147 |chapter=Michele Soavi Interview |isbn=0963498274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'' provoked a decade which saw multiple gialli produced every year. In English-language film circles, the term ''giallo'' gradually became synonymous with a heavy, theatrical and stylized visual element.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Il dolce corpo di Deborah.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Carroll Baker]] in ''[[The Sweet Body of Deborah]]'' (1968); the American actress starred in a number of ''giallo'' films.]]

The ''giallo'' genre had its heyday from 1968 through 1978. The most prolific period, however, was the three-year timespan between 1971 and 1973, during which time 65 different gialli were produced (see filmography below). Directors like Bava, Argento, Fulci, Lenzi, and Margheriti continued to produce gialli throughout the 70s and beyond, and were soon joined by other notable directors including [[Sergio Martino]], [[Paolo Cavara]], [[Armando Crispino]], [[Ruggero Deodato]] and Bava's son [[Lamberto Bava]]. The genre also spread to Spain by the early 70s, resulting in films like ''[[La residencia]]'' (''The House That Screamed'') (1969) and ''[[Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll|Los Ojos Azules de la Muneca Rota]]'' (''Blue Eyes Of The Broken Doll'') (1973) which had unmistakable ''giallo'' characteristics but feature Spanish casts and production talent. Though they preceded the first ''giallo'' by a few years, German krimi films continued to be made contemporaneously with early gialli, and were also influenced by their success. As the popularity of krimis declined in Germany, [[Rialto Film]] began increasingly pairing with Italian production companies and filmmakers (such as composer [[Ennio Morricone]] and director, cinematographer [[Joe D'Amato]], who worked on later krimi films following their successes in Italy). The overlap between the two movements is extensive enough that one of Rialto's final krimi films, ''[[What Have You Done to Solange?|Cosa avete fatto a Solange?]]'' (''What Have You Done to Solange?''), features an Italian director and crew and has been called a ''giallo'' in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rockoff |first =Adam |date=2002  |title= Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986|publisher= [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]] |isbn=0786469323| pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hanke | first = Ken | contribution = The Lost Horror Film Series: The Edgar Wallace Kirmis. | editor-last = Schnieder | editor-first = Steven Jay | title = In Fear without Frontiers: Horror Cinema across the Globe  | pages = 111–123 | publisher = FAB Press | place = Godalming, UK | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gialli continued to be produced throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but gradually their popularity diminished and film budgets and production values began shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerswell |first =J.A. |date=2012  |title=The slasher movie book. |publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]. |isbn=1556520107  |pages=54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Pupi Avati]] satirized the genre in 1977 with a slapstick ''giallo'' titled ''Tutti defunti... tranne i morti''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Though the ''giallo'' cycle waned in the 1990s and saw few entries in the 2000s, they continue to be produced, notably by Argento (who in 2009 released a film actually titled ''[[Giallo (film)|Giallo]]'', somewhat in homage to his long career in the genre) and co-directors Hélène Cattet &amp; Bruno Forzani, whose ''[[Amer (film)|Amer]]'' (which uses music from older giallis, including tracks by Morricone and [[Bruno Nicolai]]) received a positive critical reception upon its release in 2009.&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt; To a large degree, the genre's influence lives on in the [[Slasher film|slasher]] films which became enormously popular during the 1980s and drew heavily on tropes developed by earlier gialli.{{sfn|Kerswell|2012|pp=46–49}}

===Influence===
The ''giallo'' cycle has had a lasting effect on horror films and murder mysteries made outside Italy since the late 1960s.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This cinematic style and unflinching content is also at the root of the gory [[slasher film|slasher]] and [[splatter film]]s that became widely popular in the early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In particular, two violent shockers from Mario Bava, ''[[Hatchet for the Honeymoon]]'' (1970) and ''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'' (1971) were especially influential.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Early examples of the ''giallo'' effect can be seen in the British film ''[[Berserk!]]'' (1967) and the American mystery-thrillers ''[[No Way to Treat a Lady (film)|No Way to Treat a Lady]]'' (1968), ''[[Klute]]'' (1971), ''[[Pretty Maids All in a Row]]'' (1971, based on an Italian novel), [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972), Vincent Price's ''[[Madhouse (1974 film)|Madhouse]]'' (1974) and ''[[Eyes of Laura Mars]]'' (1978). ''[[Berberian Sound Studio]]'' (2012) offers an affectionate tribute to the genre.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Director [[Eli Roth]] has called the ''giallo'' "one of my favorite, favorite subgenres of film,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Roth, Eli | date = October 10, 2014 | title = Watch: Eli Roth Talks Giallo-Inspired 'House with the Laughing Windows' | medium = Video Short | language = English | url = http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/watch-eli-roth-talks-giallo-inspired-house-with-the-laughing-windows-20141010 | access-date = 25 March 2015 | publisher = Thompson on Hollywood }}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically cited Sergio Martino's ''[[Torso (1973 film)|Torso]]'' (''I corpi presentano tracce di violenza carnale'') (along with the Spanish horror film ''[[Who Can Kill a Child?]]'') as influential on his 2005 film ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'', writing, "...these seventies Italian giallos start off with a group of students that are in Rome, lots of scenes in piazzas with telephoto lenses, and you get the feeling they're being watched.

==Plot==

===#''KeepTheSecrets''===

The producers and Rowling have maintained a campaign called #KeepTheSecrets to ask people who have seen the play not to reveal its major twists.  The slogan is printed on the tickets for the play and badges with the slogan are handed out for free during intervals. People buying their tickets online are emailed a video after the play from J.K. Rowling asking them to support the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36475868/meet-the-harry-potter-fans-keeping-the-secrets-of-the-cursed-child|title=Meet the Harry Potter fans 'keeping the secrets' of the Cursed Child|publisher=BBC News|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 1===
In the opening scene, set during the epilogue of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'' in the year 2017, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny Potter]] send their second son, [[Albus Severus Potter]], on the [[Hogwarts Express]] to begin his first year at [[Hogwarts]]. Harry is now working in a desk job as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the [[Ministry of Magic]], while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of ''[[The Daily Prophet]]''. [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] also send their daughter [[Rose Granger-Weasley]] on the train. Hermione is now [[Minister of Magic]], while Ron manages [[Weasley's Wizard Wheezes]] in [[Diagon Alley]]. Albus makes an unlikely friendship in [[Scorpius Malfoy]], the son of Harry's former nemesis [[Draco Malfoy]] and Astoria Malfoy (née  Greengrass). The school is stunned when, in a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into [[Gryffindor]], Albus is sorted into [[Slytherin]] alongside Scorpius.

Both boys are bullied by other students over the next few years, Albus due to his perceived failure to live up to his parents, Scorpius due to unproven rumours that he is the son of [[Lord Voldemort]]. In addition, Albus and Harry begin to drift apart, owing to Albus's struggles with his father's shadow and Harry's uncertainty on how to deal with his son's issues. Albus also drifts apart from Rose, with whom he was friends before meeting Scorpius and who was sorted into Gryffindor. Prior to Albus and Scorpius's fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with his father after he is given Harry's baby blanket and a [[Amortentia|love potion]] from Ron. During the fight, Harry accidentally says that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.

Harry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the [[Time-Turner]], built by a Slytherin contemporary of Harry's, Theodore Nott, that allows one to travel back several years into the past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar begins to hurt again, causing him to become concerned that Voldemort may somehow be returning. [[Amos Diggory]], who has become old and is cared for by his niece, Delphi Diggory, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent the death of his son, [[Cedric Diggory]]. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so himself and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express and the trolley operator, who is revealed to be a monster placed on the train to prevent students from escaping. The two arrive at St.&amp;nbsp;Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards in [[Yorkshire]], where Amos lives, and team up with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with [[Polyjuice Potion]].

===Act 2===
Knowing that Cedric's death was the result of him winning the [[Triwizard Tournament]] alongside Harry, the boys use the Time-Turner to travel back to the first challenge of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994 and sabotage Cedric during the tournament's first task in the hope of preventing his victory. Instead, they only succeed in creating an alternate reality in which Ron and Hermione never married, and thus Rose was never born, and Albus was sorted into Gryffindor. Albus discovers that this was because they chose to disguise themselves as [[Durmstrang]] students, causing Hermione to become suspicious of [[Viktor Krum]] and go to the Yule Ball with Ron instead of Viktor. As a result, Ron never experienced the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione, fell in love with [[Padma Patil]] at the Ball, and eventually became married to her, having a son named Panju. Hermione, in turn, became a frustrated and mean professor at Hogwarts, teaching [[Defense Against the Dark Arts]].

At around the same time, Harry's fear increases that Voldemort may return as his scar continues to hurt and as he has Voldemort-related nightmares. After speaking with a portrait of [[Dumbledore]], and being told by centaur Bane that a "dark cloud" is around Albus, he becomes convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus and tries to have the boys kept apart at Hogwarts by forcing a reluctant [[Minerva McGonagall]], now [[headteacher|Headmistress]] of Hogwarts, to keep tabs on Albus using the [[Marauder's Map]], threatening to shut down the school otherwise.

Albus and Scorpius's friendship is destroyed, but the two eventually reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]] from [[James Sirius Potter|James Sirius]] (Albus' older brother), and after McGonagall refuses to enforce Harry's request. Harry himself is persuaded to relent after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus and Scorpius decide to make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to change Cedric's fate, this time by humiliating him during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, however, Albus is not with him, and Scorpius finds himself in a reality in which Harry is dead, and Lord Voldemort rules the [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter|wizarding world]].

===Act 3===
Scorpius discovers that – as a result of his actions – an embittered Cedric joined the [[Death Eater]]s and killed [[Neville Longbottom]] during the events of ''Deathly Hallows'', preventing him from killing [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] and allowing Voldemort to win the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. With Harry now dead, Albus subsequently never existed, while Voldemort was able to completely consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic into a [[dictatorial]] regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and [[Quidditch]] star, helping the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. [[Dolores Umbridge]] became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and patrols the school with [[Dementors]] and a revived Inquisitorial Squad led by Scorpius. Draco Malfoy occupies Harry's old position as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, using his post to encourage routine attacks on Muggles and bribe the [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] to remain silent on the actions of the Death Eaters.

A powerful dark figure called "The Augurey" leads the Ministry of Magic. With help from Ron, Hermione, and [[Severus Snape]], now the final members of a dwindling anti-Voldemort resistance movement, Scorpius is able to use the Time-Turner to prevent the interference of Albus and his past self and restore the events of the original timeline, the alternate Ron, Hermione, and Snape sacrificing themselves to the Dementors in order to allow him to do so. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two boys are eventually found by their parents, as well as Ron and Hermione. Following these events, Harry scolds Albus for his actions, but the two nevertheless begin to reconcile.

Realising the danger the Time-Turner poses and deciding their parents will continue to keep it (as Hermione had done in the Ministry of Magic), Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it themselves, but they are joined by Delphi Diggory. Scorpius realizes that Delphi was in charge of the Ministry of Magic in the alternate timeline (from her tattoo of the wings of a magical bird, which she says is called an Augurey), and she takes them captive, later revealing her intention of restoring the alternate timeline.

After the adults learn Albus and Scorpius were seen disappearing with Delphi, they confront Amos, only to discover Delphi is not his niece, but the daughter of Lord Voldemort and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Delphi had placed Amos under a "confundus" charm.  Searching her room, they discover she is following a prophecy that, if fulfilled, would lead to Lord Voldemort's return. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius prevent her from acting, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel further back in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her and then destroys the Time-Turner to leave them all stranded in time.

===Act 4===
Abandoned by Delphi, Albus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night before Harry's parents were killed at [[Godric's Hollow]] (30&amp;nbsp;October 1981), and assume Delphi is planning to kill Harry before Voldemort attempts to do so (which severely weakens Voldemort). Albus and Scorpius write an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present (which is now also the night of the anniversary of the death of Harry's parents, when he often looks for his blanket as it is the only physical memento he has), the blanket would become stained with love potion and expose the message to Harry.

Meanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him (it was made for his father), but they remain unable to rescue the boys due to their uncertainty over which time period they have entered. After Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to save them and stop Delphi. While waiting for Delphi, they deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his doomed attempt to kill Harry, ensuring her father's survival and allowing her to be with him.

Harry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, and after a struggle, the group manages to subdue her. Rather than killing Delphi, it is decided that she will be brought to [[Azkaban Prison]]. Lord Voldemort then appears and is oblivious to the presence of Harry and the group. The group allows the murder of Harry's parents to play out again, unwilling to risk the consequences of altering the past.

They all stand with Harry to watch the sad event replay. After returning to the present day, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius now decide to be more active at Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for Quidditch and asking Rose on a date. Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, with Harry apologizing for his role in Cedric's death. Albus has also witnessed the death of a fellow student, Craig Bowker&amp;nbsp;Jr. (the only current timeline murder in the play), who tried to intervene when Delphi held Albus and Scorpius captive on the Quidditch pitch.

==Critical reception==

''Harry Potter and the Cursed Child'' has received critical acclaim. Some audiences and critics have complimented the casting and performances, while many debate the quality of the piece and how it compares to entries in the main ''Harry Potter'' series.

Publications awarding five star ratings included ''[[The Independent]]'', the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', ''[[The Stage]]'' and [[WhatsOnStage.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-review-palace-theatre-a-magical-experience-tailor-made-for-the-a7155381.html|title=Harry Potter and the Cursed Child review: Tailor made for the theatre|date=25 July 2016|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standard.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-review-a-magical-experience-a3304191.html|title=Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: A magical experience|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/harry-potter-cursed-child-review-palace-theatre-london/|title=Harry Potter and the Cursed Child review at Palace Theatre|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatsonstage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/harry-potter-cursed-child-palace-west-end_41360.html|title=Review: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (Palace Theatre)|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' also gave five, although "there are some quibbles," while ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] awarded four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-is-pure-magic---review/|title=Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a magical show with a strong emotional core – review|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/26/harry-potter-cursed-child-review-palace-theatre-london|title=Harry Potter and the Cursed Child review – duel of dark and light carried off with dazzling assurance|first=Michael|last=Billington|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Boyle's performance as Scorpius Malfoy garnered particular acclaim.

=== Response within the ''Harry Potter'' fandom ===
The response to the play from the ''Harry Potter'' [[Harry Potter fandom|fandom]] was mixed. Some fans said the story seemed "like a work of [[fan fiction]]" and claimed that it diverged from previously established rules of the universe, criticising the script's characterisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/696259/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-script-book-JK-Rowling-fan-fiction|title='Horrible fan fiction': Fans HATE Harry Potter and the Cursed Child book and here's why|first=George|last=Simpson|date=3 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/030816/harry-potter-and-cursed-child-failed-to-impress-fans-on-pages.html|title=Harry Potter and Cursed Child failed to impress fans on pages|date=3 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a43367/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-review/|title=After Reading The "Harry Potter" Series 20 Times, Here's Why I'll Never Touch "Cursed Child" Again|date=25 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also took issue with the style and plot of the script, complaining that the Time-Turner storylines had already been used, as had Cedric Diggory's death, and that the writers were rehashing old storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4445149/harry-potter-cursed-child-jk-rowling/|title=The Magic Is Gone but Harry Potter Will Never Die|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-disappointed_us_57a2c2fce4b0456cb7e1799b|title=Why 'Harry Potter And The Cursed Child' Disappointed A Lifelong Harry Potter Fan|first=Samantha|last=Lanevi|date=4 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms have led to some of the fandom rejecting the play as separate from the ''Potter'' [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/harry-potter-cursed-child-reactions-2016-7|title=Some 'Harry Potter' fans are so disappointed with the new story that they're refusing to call it canon|publisher=[[Business insider]]|date=31 July 2016|quote=As a longtime "Harry Potter" enthusiast myself, I regretfully agree with the vocal minority who did not enjoy "Cursed Child" and would rather it wasn't part of Harry Potter's story.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some potential plot holes in the story have been highlighted, such as the likelihood of Lord Voldemort's infertility, the speed at which the Polyjuice Potion is created, the unexplained non-operation of the [[Fidelius Charm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/books/harry-potter-the-cursed-child-18-biggest-wtf-moments?page=17|title=Harry Potter &amp; The Cursed Child: 18 Biggest WTF Moments|date=3 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/19312-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-violates-canon-wtf|title=The Most WTF Moments in 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cedric Diggory's dramatic turn to becoming a Death Eater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/books/harry-potter-the-cursed-child-18-biggest-wtf-moments|title=Harry Potter &amp; The Cursed Child: 18 Biggest WTF Moments|date=3 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/6-major-plot-holes-in-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child|title=6 Major Plot Holes In 'Harry Potter And The Cursed Child'|date=9 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some fans responded positively to the play and its characters, with Scorpius Malfoy being particularly popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/08/why-a-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-film-may-or-may-not-work/|title=Why a Harry Potter and the Cursed Child film may or may not work|last=Shoemaker|first=Allison|date=2 August 2016|website=Consequence of Sound|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fans commented that the dialogue between the familiar characters was "spot on",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/07/31/harry-potter-cursed-child-thoughts/|title=15 thoughts I had while reading 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child'|last=Haysom|first=Sam|website=Mashable|access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating it as a faithful continuation of the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://itsmusicalphan24601.tumblr.com/post/157072300373/time-travel-in-harry-potter |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424174446/https://itsmusicalphan24601.tumblr.com/post/157072300373/time-travel-in-harry-potter |archive-date=24 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bounding-heart.tumblr.com/post/159672748068/the-boy-who-lived|title=The Boy Who Lived|website=Harry Potter Oriented Things}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that the play sheds light on some of the relationships between the characters, such as Harry and Dumbledore's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://screenrant.com/harry-potter-cursed-child-plot-summary/|title=How Harry Potter &amp;amp; The Cursed Child Continues Harry's Story|date=9 August 2016|newspaper=Screen Rant|access-date=24 February 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response had been particularly positive among fans who watched the play on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-early-reviews-2016-6|title=Here's what fans are saying about the new 'Harry Potter' play that just premiered in London|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=24 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity of the "Cursed Child"===
The play never explicitly states who the "Cursed Child" is. There are several possible answers, including Delphi, who is cursed by her parentage; Harry himself, whose difficult childhood is the subject of several flashbacks in the play and who must accept and relive the death of his parents to conquer Lord Voldemort; Albus, who at one stage Harry says he wished "was not his son" and can do no right in this father's eyes being "cursed" by the Potter reputation; Scorpius, who is rumoured to be Lord Voldemort's child and whose mother dies during the play; and Cedric Diggory, whose tragic death is a focus of the play, and whose death is also finally accepted as a necessary condition for future peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4433100/harry-potter-cursed-child-questions/|title=8 Questions We Have After Reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child|publisher=Time Magazine|date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hasimta_191.jpg|thumb|Hasimta Theater]]

'''Hasimta Theater''' ({{lang-he-n|תיאטרון הסימטה}}, lit. ''The Alley Theater'') is a [[fringe theater]] located in the old city of [[Jaffa]], [[Israel]], and known for being one of the oldest fringe theaters in Israel, as it has been operating continuously since its foundation in 1982 by [[actor]] and director Niko Nitai, who had also served as the theater's artistic manager for a while. The theater attracts artists that work in theater and music and seek to examine theatrical form and expression outside the box. The current artistic director and CEO of the theater is Irit Frank.

The theater was founded by Nitai with the help of Tel Aviv Municipality, on the location of former Hasimta Art Gallery. Regular artists during the first year of the theater's operation included [[Meir Ariel]]. These artists did not receive proper salaries, rather were paid a certain percentage of the incomes of their shows.

The theater is active almost every day of the year, and serves as a rehearsal hall in the mornings and a stage for performances in the evenings. Over 54 productions and over 200 plays are presented at the theater per year, and the theater maintains a team of around 135 actors and 96 creators. The place also serves as an exhibition center, and serves as a stage for [[music]] and [[Jazz]] concerts. "The Alley Bar" also works at the location.

[[File:Twelve Angry Men.png|thumb|Scene from the 1957 award-winning film, ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' - a film surrounding the jury deliberations of a murder case.]]
A '''legal drama,''' or a '''courtroom drama,''' is a genre of film and television that generally focuses on narratives regarding [[legal practice]] and the justice system. The [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) defines "courtroom drama" as a genre of film in which a system of justice plays a critical role in the film's narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/|title=AFI: 10 Top 10|website=www.afi.com|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal dramas have also followed the lives of the fictional [[Lawyer|attorneys]], [[defendants]], [[plaintiffs]], or other persons related to the practice of law present in television show or film. Legal drama is distinct from [[Police procedural|police crime drama]] or [[detective fiction]], which typically focus on police officers or detectives investigating and solving crimes. The focal point of legal dramas, more often, are events occurring within a [[courtroom]], but may include any phases of legal procedure, such as [[jury deliberations]] or work done at [[law firm]]s. Some legal dramas [[Film à clef|fictionalize real cases]] that have been litigated, such as the play-turned-movie, [[Inherit the Wind (play)|''Inherit the Wind'']], which fictionalized the [[Scopes Monkey Trials|Scopes Monkey Trial]]. As a genre, the term "legal drama"  is typically applied to [[television show]]s and [[film]]s, whereas [[legal thriller]]s typically refer to novels and plays.

== Themes ==
Legal dramas typical portray [[moral dilemmas]] that occur with the practice of the law or participating in the justice system, many of which mirrors dilemmas in real life. The [[ABA Journal|American Bar Association Journal]] has interpreted the public's enjoyment of legal dramas occur because "stories about the legal system are laced with human vulnerability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/why_the_movies_love_lawyers|title=Why Hollywood loves lawyers|work=ABA Journal|access-date=2018-07-16|others=Thane Rosenbaum|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, even though "there are no car chases [and]... [g]uns are never drawn", legal dramas retain strong followings because of their presentation of moral intrigue in a setting that actually reflects what occurs in the world.

Legal dramas may present stories of the [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]], such as persons wrongly convicted of a crime they did not commit. At times, stories may involve the moral implications of [[police misconduct]], such as placing or [[tampering with evidence]], such as in the 1993 film, ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]''. More often, legal dramas focus on the attorneys' point of view when faced with these difficulties. For instance, in ''[[The Practice]]'', a television legal drama series revolving around a firm of criminal defense attorneys, a common theme presented is the difficulty of defending clients known or believed to be guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Practice|title=The Practice - Wikiquote|website=en.wikiquote.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, many legal dramas present themes that reflect [[politicized issues]]. In the 1960 film, ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', the politicized issue portrayed was the legality of a Tennessee statute that made it unlawful to teach the [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in a public school. As laws and public policy opinions change, so do the themes presented in legal dramas. The 1992 film, ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', explored the psychology of [[superior orders]], e.g. excusing criminal actions because they were only committed from 'following orders'. The film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993) addressed [[homophobia]], and the discrimination and public fear of HIV/AIDs carriers. In 1996, ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' portrays the early years of [[Hustler Magazine]] and issues of obscenity and freedom of speech.  ''[[You Don't Know Jack (film)|You Don't Know Jack]]'' (2010) is a fictional biographic film about [[Jack Kevorkian|Dr. Jack Kevorkian]] and the legal actions he faced as a result of providing [[euthanasia]] services to terminal patients. [[Racism#Legal|Racial injustice]] remains a common theme from as far back as ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' in 1962 to the 2017 film ''[[Marshall (film)|Marshall]].''

== Film ==
Legal dramas in American film has an extensive history stemming from as early as the 1908 film, ''Falsely Accused!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7153e82e|title=Falsely Accused! (1908)|work=BFI|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s and 1960s presented a number of legal drama films including, [[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|''12 Angry Men'']] (1957), [[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|''Witness for the Prosecution'']] (1957), ''[[I Want to Live!]]'' (1958), ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), ''[[The Young Philadelphians]]'' (1959), [[Compulsion (1959 film)|''Compulsion'']] (1959), [[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|''Inherit the Wind'']] (1960), ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961),and [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|''To Kill a Mockingbird'']] (1962). Arguably, ''12 Angry Men'' and ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' stand as the cornerstones of early legal dramas, garnering extensive acclaim, recognition, and awards. Despite underwhelming box office performance, ''12 Angry Men'' was nominated in three different categories at the [[30th Academy Awards]] and appears on half of the [[AFI 100 Years... series]] lists of films, which celebrate the greatest films in American cinema. Likewise, ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' received even more acclaim, garnering three academy awards out of eight total nominations at the [[35th Academy Awards]], appears on seven of the AFI's ten lists celebrating the greatest films, including ranking as the best courtroom drama, and selected for preservation United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".  Other countries also premiered legal dramas or courtrooms dramas in the early 1900s, such as the French silent film, ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'' (1928).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dreyer|first=Carl Theodor|title=The Passion of Joan of Arc|date=1928-10-25|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019254/|others=Maria Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, André Berley|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other legal drama films have not focused on even the practice of law, such as [[The Paper Chase (film)|''Paper Chase'']], a film presenting the difficulty and anxiety of entering law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bridges|first=James|title=The Paper Chase|date=1973-10-16|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070509/|others=Timothy Bottoms, Lindsay Wagner, John Houseman|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Early American television programs considered legal dramas include [[Perry Mason (TV series)|''Perry Mason'']], [[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|''The Defenders'']], [[Judd, for the Defense|''JUDD for the Defense'']], ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', and ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]''. More recent examples of serious legal dramas are ''[[The Practice]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order]].''

The two most notable examples of legal drama are ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' and ''[[Boston Legal]],'' both of which [[David E. Kelley]] created and produced, with [[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]] as the most popular legal drama currently.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Legal dramas are becoming more in demand from the public, more popular for many people to watch, and beginning to feature stronger female leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/fox-justice-legal-drama-scandal-judy-smith-1201818553/|title=Fox Developing Legal Drama Inspired &amp; Produced By 'Scandal's Judy Smith|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2016-09-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inaccurate portrayal of legal practice ==
It is widely believed by most practicing [[lawyer]]s that legal dramas result in the general public having misconceptions about the legal process. Many of these misconceptions result from the desire to create an interesting story. For example, because conflict between parties make for an interesting story, legal dramas emphasize the [[trial (law)|trial]] and ignore the fact that the vast majority of [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases in the [[United States]] are settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Theodore|date=March 2009|title=What is the Settlement Rate and Why Should We Care?|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1202&amp;context=facpub|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|volume=6|pages=111–146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trials in legal dramas are often shown to be more emphatic by disregarding actual rules in trials that prevent [[Relevance (law)|prejudicing]] defendants from juries.

Besides the actual practice of law, legal dramas may also misrepresent the character of lawyers in general. Some fictional lawyers may be portrayed as [[Ambulance chasing|ambulance chasers]], breaching rules of professional conduct by seeking out potential [[personal injury]] plaintiffs. Lawyers may also be portrayed as amoral, seeking only to win or financial gain, rather than do what is "morally" right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney|title=Amoral Attorney - TV Tropes|website=TV Tropes|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative portrayals reflect a long-standing [[Lawyer#Cultural perception|cultural perception of lawyers]] since time immemorial. Another misrepresented character trait of attorneys portrayed by legal dramas is their [[Libido|sexual appetite]]. Characters such as [[Bobby Donnell]] and [[Ally McBeal (character)|Ally McBeal]] portray lawyers who seemingly cannot keep from having sex with clients, colleagues, opposing counsel, or judges. Although attorneys appear a top preferred occupation for potential dating partners according to [[Bumble (app)|Bumble]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebeehive.bumble.com/bumbleblog/cheersto2016|title=Cheers to 2016!

{{main|Roman amphitheatre}}

[[File:Amphi-Rome.PNG|thumb|upright=1.25|Map of Roman amphitheatres]]

The remains of at least '''230 [[amphitheatre]]s''' have been found widely scattered around the area of the [[Roman Empire]]. These are large, circular or oval open-air venues with raised 360 degree seating and not to be confused with the more common [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], which are semicircular structures. There are, however, a number of buildings that have had a combined use as both theatre and amphitheatre, particularly in western Europe. Following is a list of Roman amphitheatre locations by country.

'''''Lyricist Lounge: West Coast''''' is the third installment of the ''Lyricist Lounge'' series, released in November 2002. This compilation was not released on [[Rawkus Records]] like the previous two ''Lyricist Lounge'' releases, and was not as successful as the past installments.

'''Milton Berle''' (born '''Mendel Berlinger'''; July 12, 1908 – March 27, 2002) was an American [[comedian]] and [[actor]]. Berle's career as an entertainer spanned over 80 years, first in silent films and on stage as a child actor, then in radio, movies and television. As the host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' (1948–55), he was the first major American television star&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/business/technology/story/1336054.html "Broadcast pioneer NBC prepares for cable takeover"] ''Miami Herald'', Nov. 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to millions of viewers as "Uncle Miltie" and "Mr. Television" during [[Golden Age of Television|TV's golden age]].

==Early life==
Milton Berle was born into a [[Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Baum|title=L.A.'s Power Golf Clubs: Where the Hollywood Elite Play|date=June 23, 2011|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/las-power-golf-clubs-hollywood-205072|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; family in a five-story walkup at 68 [[118th Street (Manhattan)|W. 118th Street]] in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]]. His given name was Mendel Berlinger.&lt;ref name="jewish virtual library" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jns org" /&gt; He chose Milton Berle as his professional name when he was 16. His father, Moses Berlinger (1873–1938), was a paint and varnish salesman. His mother, Sarah (Sadie) Glantz Berlinger (1877–1954),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2CQeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NpgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5278,3741070&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Milton Berle's Mother Dies|date=1 June 1954|publisher=The Tuscaloosa News|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed her name to Sandra Berle when Milton became famous. He had three older brothers (from oldest to youngest): Phil, Frank and Jack Berle. For many years the latter two worked as Berle's TV production staff members, while Phil Berle was a program executive at NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju5CCTAJMq8|title=Milton Berle Interview (1956)|date=1956|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child actor==
Berle entered show business at the age of five when he won an amateur talent contest.&lt;ref name="childwonder"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853738,00.html The Child Wonder]". ''Time'', 16 May 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a [[child actor]] in [[silent films]], beginning with ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'', filmed in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="tvmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/berlemilton/berlemilton.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications – Encyclopedia of Television|work=museum.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director told Berle that he would portray a little boy who would be thrown from a moving train. In ''Milton Berle: An Autobiography'', he explained, "I was scared shitless, even when he went on to tell me that Pauline would save my life. Which is exactly what happened, except that at the crucial moment they threw a bundle of rags instead of me from the train. I bet there are a lot of comedians around today who are sorry about that."

By Berle's account, he continued to play child roles in other films: ''Bunny's Little Brother'', ''[[Tess of the Storm Country (1914 film)|Tess of the Storm Country]]'', ''Birthright'', ''Love's Penalty'', ''Divorce Coupons'' and ''Ruth of the Range''. Berle recalled, "There were even trips out to Hollywood—the studios paid—where I got parts in ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'', with Mary Pickford; ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', with [[Douglas Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]], and ''[[Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914 film)|Tillie's Punctured Romance]]'', with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mabel Normand]] and [[Marie Dressler]]."&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt; In 1916, Berle enrolled in the [[Professional Children's School]].&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;Newcomb, Horace. Editor, ''Encyclopedia of Television'', vol. I, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, (1997) pp. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Vaudeville===
Around 1920, at age 12, Berle made his stage debut in a revival of the musical comedy ''[[Florodora]]'' in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], which later moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  By the time he was 16, he was working as a Master of Ceremonies in Vaudeville.  By the early 1930s he was a successful stand-up comedian, patterning himself after one of Vaudeville's top comics, [[Ted Healy]].

===Rising star===
[[Image:Berle33.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;In ''Poppin' the Cork'', 1933&lt;/center&gt;]]
In 1933, he was hired by producer [[Jack White (film producer)|Jack White]] to star in the theatrical featurette ''Poppin' the Cork'', a topical musical comedy concerning the repealing of Prohibition. Berle also co-wrote the score for this film, which was released by [[Educational Pictures]]. Berle continued to dabble in songwriting. With [[Ben Oakland]] and Milton Drake, Berle wrote the title song for the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] release ''Li'l Abner'' (1940), an adaptation of [[Al Capp]]'s comic strip, featuring [[Buster Keaton]] as Lonesome Polecat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emol.org/movies/lilabner/movie256.html Entertainment Magazine: Astor Pictures, ''Li'l Abner'' (1940)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228075002/http://emol.org/movies/lilabner/movie256.html |date=2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle wrote a [[Spike Jones]] B-side, "Leave the Dishes in the Sink, Ma."

===Radio===
From 1934–36, Berle appeared regularly on ''[[Rudy Vallee|The Rudy Vallee Hour]]'', and he attracted publicity as a regular on ''The Gillette Original Community Sing'', a Sunday night comedy-variety program broadcast on CBS from September 6, 1936 to August 29, 1937. In 1939, he was the host of ''[[Stop Me If You've Heard This One]]'' with panelists spontaneously finishing jokes sent in by listeners.&lt;ref name="RadioArchives2011"/&gt;

[[File:Milton Berle - 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Berle in 1943]]
In the late 1940s, he canceled well-paying nightclub appearances to expand his radio career.&lt;ref name="RadioArchives2011"/&gt; ''Three Ring Time'', a comedy-variety show sponsored by [[Ballantine Ale]], was followed by a 1943 program sponsored by [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soups]]. The audience participation show ''Let Yourself Go'' (1944–1945) could best be described as "[[slapstick]] radio"{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} with studio audience members acting out long suppressed urges—often directed at host Berle. ''Kiss and Make Up'', on CBS in 1946, featured the problems of contestants decided by a jury from the studio audience with Berle as the judge. Berle also made guest appearances on many comedy-variety radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="RadioArchives2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioarchives.com/Milton_Berle_Show_p/ra017.htm|title=The Milton Berle Show|publisher=RadioArchives|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scripted by [[Hal Block]] and [[Martin Ragaway]], ''The Milton Berle Show'' brought Berle together with [[Arnold Stang]], later a familiar face as Berle's TV sidekick. Others in the cast were [[Pert Kelton]], Mary Schipp, [[Jack Albertson]], [[Arthur Q. Bryan]], [[Ed Begley]], Brazilian singer [[Dick Farney]], and announcer [[Frank Gallop]]. Sponsored by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], it aired on NBC from March 11, 1947 until April 13, 1948.

Berle later described this series as "the best radio show I ever did ... a hell of a funny variety show". It served as a springboard for Berle's emergence as television's first major star.&lt;ref name="RadioArchives2011"/&gt;

===Mr. Television===
Berle first appeared on television in 1929 in an experimental broadcast in [[Chicago]] which he hosted in front of 129 people.&lt;ref name="MBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/miltonberle.htm|title=The Milton Berle Show|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berle would revive the structure and routines of his vaudeville act for his debut on commercial TV, hosting The [[Texaco Star Theatre]] on June 8, 1948 over the [[NBC]] Television Network.&lt;ref name="Epstein2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madigan2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sackett, Susan (1993) p.1954 quotation: {{quote|.  When the program premiered on Tuessday, June 8, 1948 on [[NBC]] Television, the format was strictly vaudeville, with dancers, jugglers, acrobats and guest stars in sketches--in short, a close approximation of the show that Berle was already doing for ABC on Wednesday nights.&lt;/ref&gt;  They did not settle on Berle as the permanent host right away, but was originally part of a rotation of hosts (Berle himself had only a four-week contract). Comedian Jack Carter was host for August. Berle was named the permanent host that fall.

Berle's highly visual style, characterized by vaudeville slapstick and outlandish costumes, proved ideal for the new medium.&lt;ref name="Young2010p706"&gt;Young, William H. and Young, Nancy K. (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YjbR9EXABPEC&amp;pg=PA706 ''World War II and the Postwar Years in America: A Historical and Cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], p.706 quotation: {{quote|Radio exists as an aural medium, and no matter how physically animated a performer may be or how clownish his or her costume ... Berle's comedic gift shone in slapstick, something he had mastered in his vaudeville experiences. Many radio stars found it difficult to make the transition to TV ... Not so Berle. Radio had confined the comedian, making him reliant on his wealth of jokes and little else. ... Berle clearly considered no costume too outlandish, no stunt too foolish.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle modeled the show's structure and skits directly from his vaudeville shows, and hired writer Hal Collins to revive his old routines.&lt;ref name="Epstein2002"&gt;Epstein, Lawrence J. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=iTarGWLM5CEC&amp;pg=PT86 ''The Haunted Smile: The Story of Jewish Comedians in America''], ch.6 ''The Magic Box'', pp. 86–7, quotation: {{quote|Berle had hired the writer Hal Collins to revive old vaudeville, burlesque and radio routines that Berle has used successfully. ... The shows were clearly vaudeville brought into the home. ... Berle was the ringmaster, the master of ceremonies who did his opening monologue and introduced each new act. Keeping to his own vaudeville tradition of entering into the acts of other performers, Berle often interrupted or joined in the act. When "Buffalo Bob" Smith came on, Berle appeared dressed as Howdy Doody.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madigan2001"&gt;Madigan, S.P. ''Texaco Star Theatre'' entry in Browne, Pat (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA833 ''The guide to United States popular culture''], p.833, quotation:
{{quote|Texaco Star emulated a vaudeville variety hour, with several guests each week, including singers, comedians, ventriloquists, acrobats, dramatic performances, and so forth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berle dominated Tuesday night television for the next several years, reaching the number one slot in the [[Nielsen ratings]] with as much as an 80% share of the viewing audience. Berle and the show each won [[Emmy Award]]s after the first season. Fewer movie tickets were sold on Tuesdays. Some theaters, restaurants and other businesses shut down for the hour or closed for the evening so their customers would not miss Berle's antics.&lt;ref name="tvmuseum"/&gt; Berle's autobiography notes that in [[Detroit]], "an investigation took place when the water levels took a drastic drop in the reservoirs on Tuesday nights between 9 and 9:05. It turned out that everyone waited until the end of the ''Texaco Star Theatre'' before going to the bathroom."&lt;ref name="Sackett1993p1954"&gt;Sackett, Susan (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=viLuAAAAMAAJ ''Prime-time hits: television's most popular network programs, 1950''] p.1954 quotation: {{quote|The city of Detroit was baffled when the reservoir water levels dropped each Tuesday evening shortly after 9:00 pm An investigation revealed that Detroit's citizens were waiting until Berle was off the air to go to the bathroom; the simultaneous flushing of thousands of toilets created havoc with Detroit's water works.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milton Berle, Haskel Frankel (1974)  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0BaAAAAMAAJ ''Milton Berle: an autobiography, with Haskel Frankel''] p.271&lt;/ref&gt;

Television set sales more than doubled after Texaco Star Theatre's debut, reaching two million in 1949. Berle's stature as the medium's first superstar earned him the sobriquet "Mr. Television".&lt;ref name="tvmuseum"/&gt; He also earned another nickname after ending a 1949 broadcast with a brief ad-libbed remark to children watching the show: "Listen to your Uncle Miltie and go to bed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Milton Berle: An Autobiography|editor-last=Berle|editor-first=Milton|editor2-last=Frankel|editor2-first=Haskel|publisher=Delacorte Press|year=1974|pages=337|isbn=0-440-05609-8|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Craig]] and [[Kermit Goell]]'s ''[[Near You]]'' became the theme song that closed Berle's TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/texacoStarTheater.html|title=Texaco Star Theater / The Milton Berle Show|work=classicthemes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berle risked his newfound TV stardom at its zenith to challenge Texaco when the sponsor tried to prevent black performers from appearing on his show:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember clashing with the advertising agency and the sponsor over my signing [[the Four Step Brothers]] for an appearance on the show. The only thing I could figure out was that there was an objection to black performers on the show, but I couldn't even find out who was objecting. "We just don't like them," I was told, but who the hell was "we"? Because I was riding high in 1950, I sent out the word: "If they don't go on, I don't go on." At ten minutes of eight—ten minutes before showtime—I got permission for the Step Brothers to appear. If I broke the color-line policy or not, I don't know, but later on I had no trouble booking [[Bill Robinson]] or [[Lena Horne]].&lt;ref&gt;Milton Berle, Haskel Frankel (1974)  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0BaAAAAMAAJ ''Milton Berle: an autobiography, with Haskel Frankel''] p.285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berle's mother Sadie was often in the audience for his broadcasts; she had long served as a "plant" to encourage laughter from his stage show audiences.&lt;ref name="childwonder"/&gt; Her unique, "piercing, roof-shaking laugh"&lt;ref name="childwonder"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruth/&gt; would stand out, especially when Berle made an entrance in an outrageous costume. After feigning surprise he would "ad lib" a response; for example: "Lady, you've got all night to make a fool of yourself. I've only got an hour!"

Berle asked NBC to switch from live broadcasts to film, which would have made possible reruns (and residual income from them); he was angered when the network refused. However, NBC did consent to make a [[kinescope]] of each show. Later, Berle was offered 25% ownership of a company manufacturing the [[teleprompter]] by its inventor, [[Irving Berlin Kahn]], if he would simply use the new gadget on his program. He turned the offer down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SWcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7291,3455107&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Berle Recalls Beginning of TV|date=13 June 1968|author=Humphrey, Hal|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frequent user of the tranquiliser, Berle frequently endorsed [[Meprobamate|Miltown]] on his show, and became one of the main figureheads promoting the drug in 1950s America. Due to his promotion of the drug, Berle was dubbed 'Uncle Miltown' by [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/302287405|title=The age of anxiety : a history of America's turbulent affair with tranquilizers|last=1964-|first=Tone, Andrea,|date=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780786727476|location=New York|oclc=302287405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berle's contribution to television, he was inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960.

===TV decline===
At one million dollars a year, NBC signed him to an exclusive, unprecedented 30-year television contract in 1951.

Texaco pulled out of sponsorship of the show in 1953. Buick picked it up, prompting a renaming to ''The Buick-Berle Show'', and the program's format was changed to show the backstage preparations to put on a variety show. Critics generally approved of the changes, but Berle's ratings continued to fall, and Buick pulled out after two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7ecKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CVADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2406,1249723&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Berle Traded For Gleason|date=20 December 1954|publisher=Prescott Evening Courier|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "Berle's [[persona]] had shifted from the impetuous and aggressive style of the ''Texaco Star Theater'' days to a more cultivated, but less distinctive personality, leaving many fans somehow unsatisfied."&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;

By the time the again-renamed ''Milton Berle Show'' finished its only full season (1955&amp;ndash;56), Berle was already becoming history—though his final season was host to two of [[Elvis Presley]]'s earliest television appearances, April 3 and June 5, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/MiltonBerle.html Milton Berle — Milton Berle Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123000046/http://www.elvispresleynews.com/MiltonBerle.html |date=2007-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final straw during that last season may have come from CBS scheduling ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' opposite Berle. Ironically, Silvers was one of Berle's best friends in show business and had come to CBS's attention in an appearance on Berle's program. ''Bilko's'' creator-producer, Nat Hiken, had been one of Berle's radio writers.

Berle knew that NBC had already decided to cancel his show before Presley appeared.&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Moon Boys — The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. page 52. {{ISBN|1-55652-614-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle later appeared in the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' series from 1958 to 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zTwyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-eQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6842,4109474&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Milton Berle Not Moping|author=Torre, Marie|date=11 March 1959|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but NBC was finding increasingly fewer showcases for its one-time superstar. By 1960, he was reduced to hosting a [[Ten-pin bowling|bowling]] program, ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]'', delivering his quips and interviewing celebrities between the efforts of that week's bowling contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LBIrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YpwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4633,5663479&amp;dq=goodman+ace&amp;hl=en|title=Berle's 'Jackpot Bowling' Is A Really Striking Series|author=Ashe, Isobel|date=27 November 1960|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life after ''The Milton Berle Show''===
[[Image:Leavelaugh.jpg|right]]
In Las Vegas, Berle played to packed showrooms at [[Caesars Palace]], [[Sands Hotel|the Sands]], the [[Desert Inn]], and other casino hotels. Berle had appeared at the [[Thunderbird (resort)|El Rancho]], one of the first Vegas hotels, in the late 1940s. In addition to constant club appearances, Berle performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[Herb Gardner]]'s ''[[The Goodbye People]]'' in 1968. He also became a commercial spokesman for the thriving [[Lum's|Lum's restaurant]] chain.

He appeared in numerous films, including ''[[Always Leave Them Laughing]]'' (released in 1949, shortly after his TV debut) with [[Virginia Mayo]] and [[Bert Lahr]], ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' with [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Yves Montand]], ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', ''[[The Loved One]]'', ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'', ''[[Who's Minding the Mint?]]'', ''[[Lepke]]'', [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'' and ''[[Driving Me Crazy]]''.

Freed in part from the obligations of his NBC contract, Berle was signed in 1966 to a new, weekly variety series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show failed to capture a large audience and was cancelled after one season. He later appeared as guest villain [[List of Batman (TV series) episodes#Season 3|Louie the Lilac]] on ABC's ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' series. Other memorable guest appearances included stints on ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[Laugh-In]]'', ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[CHiPs]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''.

Like his contemporary [[Jackie Gleason]], Berle proved a solid dramatic actor and was acclaimed for several such performances, most notably his lead role in "Doyle Against the House" on ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]'' in 1961, a role for which he received an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination. He also played the part of a blind survivor of an airplane crash in ''Seven in Darkness'', the first in ABC's popular ''[[ABC Movie of the Week|Movie of the Week]]'' series. (He also played it straight as an agent in ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'' (1966) and was one of the few actors in that infamous flop to get good notices from critics.)

During this period, Berle was named to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for the greatest number of charity performances made by a show-business performer. Unlike the high-profile shows done by [[Bob Hope]] to entertain the troops, Berle did more shows, over a period of 50 years, on a lower-profile basis. Berle received an award for entertaining at stateside military bases in [[World War I]] as a child performer, in addition to traveling to foreign bases during [[World War II]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. The first charity [[telethon]] (for the [[Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damonrunyon.org] damonrunyon.org&lt;/ref&gt;) was hosted by Berle in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000926/|title=Milton Berle|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent fixture at charity benefits in the Hollywood area, he was instrumental in raising millions for charitable causes.

===Late career===
On April 14, 1979, Berle guest-hosted NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Berle's long reputation for taking control of an entire television production—whether invited to do so or not—was a cause of stress on the set. &lt;!--In Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller's ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'',--&gt; One of the show's writers, [[Rosie Shuster]], described the rehearsals for the Berle ''SNL'' show and the telecast as "watching a comedy train accident in slow motion on a loop." Upstaging, camera mugging, doing [[spit-take]]s, inserting old comedy bits, and climaxing the show with a maudlin performance of "[[September Song]]" complete with a pre-arranged standing ovation (something producer [[Lorne Michaels]] had never sanctioned) resulted in Berle being banned from hosting the show again. The episode was also barred from being rerun until surfacing in 2003, because Michaels thought it brought down the show's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/Infamous+moments+in+Saturday+Night+Live+history/notes/1 Infamous moments in ''Saturday Night Live'' history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722084110/http://www.zimbio.com/Infamous+moments+in+Saturday+Night+Live+history/notes/1 |date=2012-07-22 }} at zimbio.com, retrieved June 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120917165422/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-bestworstsnl/11/ Best and Worst 'SNL' Hosts] at xfinity.comcast.net, retrieved June 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a guest star on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=078644259X|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berle was memorably upstaged by the heckling theatre critics [[Statler and Waldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PGfx3QAV64M|Milton Berle Vs. Statler &amp; Waldorf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Statler and Waldorf puppets were inspired by a character named Sidney Spritzer, played by comedian [[Irving Benson]], who regularly heckled Berle from a box seat during episodes of the 1960s ABC series.  Milton Berle also made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' as a used car dealer, taking Fozzie Bear's 1951 Studebaker in trade for a station wagon.

In 1974, Berle had a minor altercation with younger actor/comedian [[Richard Pryor]] when both appeared as guests on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. At the time, Berle was discussing the emotional fallout from an experience he had with impregnating a woman he was not married to, and having to decide whether or not they would keep the child. During his talk, Pryor let out a laugh, to which Berle took exception and confronted him, stating, "I wish, I wish, Richard, that I could have laughed at that time at your age, when I was your age, the way you just laughed now, but I just couldn't... I told you this nine years ago, and now I'll tell you on the air in front of millions of people: Pick your spots, baby." This prompted Pryor to mockingly quip back, "All right, sweetheart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afflictor.com/2011/10/26/pick-your-spots-baby/|title=This website is currently unavailable.|work=afflictor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milton Berle at the 41st Emmys.jpg|left|thumb|Berle at the [[41st Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1989]]
Another well-known incident of upstaging occurred during the 1982 [[Emmy Award]]s, when Berle and [[Martha Raye]] were the presenters of the Emmy for Outstanding Writing. Berle was reluctant to give up the microphone to the award's recipients, from ''[[Second City Television]]'', and interrupted actor/writer [[Joe Flaherty]]'s acceptance speech several times. After Flaherty made a joke, Berle replied sarcastically "That's funny!" However, Flaherty's response of "Sorry, Uncle Miltie... go to sleep" flustered Berle.&lt;ref name="emmy"&gt;{{cite web|title=SCTV Wins 1982 Emmy For Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4HXCyfcD6M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=140|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SCTV'' later created a parody sketch of the incident, in which Flaherty beats up a Berle look-alike, shouting, "You'll never ruin another acceptance speech, Uncle Miltie!"

One of his most popular performances in his later years was guest starring in 1992 in ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' as womanizing, wise-cracking patient Max Jakey. Most of his dialogue was improvised and he shocked the studio audience by mistakenly blurting out a curse word. He also appeared in an acclaimed and Emmy-nominated turn on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' as an aging comedian befriended by [[Steve Sanders (90210)|Steve Sanders]], who idolizes him, but is troubled by his bouts of senility due to [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He also voiced the Prince of Darkness, the main antagonist in the Canadian animated television anthology special ''The Real Story of Au Clair De La Lune''. He also appeared in 1995 as a guest star in an episode of ''[[The Nanny]]'' in the part of her lawyer and great uncle.

In 1984, Berle appeared in drag in the video for [[Round and Round (Ratt song)|"Round and Round"]] by the 1980s metal band [[Ratt]] (his nephew Marshall Berle was then their manager). He also made a brief appearance in Ratt's "Back For More" video as a motorcyclist.

In 1985, he appeared on NBC's ''[[Amazing Stories (television)|Amazing Stories]]'' (created by [[Steven Spielberg]]) in an episode called "Fine Tuning". In this episode, friendly aliens from space receive TV signals from the Earth of the 1950s and travel to [[Hollywood]] in search of their idols, [[Lucille Ball]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[Burns and Allen]], and Milton Berle. (When he realizes the aliens are doing his old material, Uncle Miltie is thunderstruck: "Stealing from Berle? Is that even possible?") Speaking gibberish, Berle is the only person able to communicate directly with the aliens.

Berle was again on the receiving end of an onstage jibe at the 1993 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] where [[RuPaul]] responded to Berle's reference of having once worn dresses himself (during his old television days) with the quip that Berle now wore diapers. A surprised Berle replied by recycling a line he had delivered to [[Henny Youngman]] on his ''Hollywood Palace'' show in 1966: "Oh, we're going to [[ad lib]]? I'll check my brain and we'll start even."

==Berle offstage==
In 1947, Milton Berle founded the [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills]] at the old Savoy Hotel on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. Other founding members included [[Jimmy Durante]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], and [[Bing Crosby]]. In 1961, the club moved to [[Beverly Hills]]. The Friars is a private show business club famous for its celebrity members and [[roast (comedy)|roasts]], where a member is mocked by his club friends in good fun.

Unlike many of his peers, Berle's offstage lifestyle did not include drugs or drinking, but did include cigars, a "who's who" list of beautiful women, and a lifelong addiction to gambling, primarily [[horse racing]]. Some felt his obsession with "the ponies" was responsible for Berle never amassing the wealth or business success of others in his position.

Berle was famous within show business for the rumored [[human penis size|size of his penis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Susan|title="Lessons from Uncle Miltie: Ethnic Masculinity and Early Television's Vaudeo Star", in Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s edited by Janet Thumin|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=New York|isbn=978-1860646829|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjaYusbwlJEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Misch|first=David|title=Funny: The Book – Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Comedy|year=2012|publisher=Applause Theater &amp; Cinema|location=Milwaukee WI|isbn=978-1557838292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJPGyQIvWgQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=penis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freden|first=Marc|title=Really!?!: A Memoir and Observations From A Man Who's Lived Life 'Not Quite Famous Enough'|year=2010|publisher=Xlibris|isbn=978-1450073660|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vscEiMgiUAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Mike|title=And Here's the Kicker: Conversations with 21 Top Humor Writers on their Craft|year=2009|publisher=Writers Digest|location=Cincinnati OH|isbn=978-1582975054|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey|title=I Only Roast the Ones I Love: Busting Balls Without Burning Bridges|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1439102794|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY5hp9uB7i4C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=milton+berle+penis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I1SzUoqJOubI2gXegYGAAQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=milton%20berle%20penis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;    [[Phil Silvers]] once told a story about standing next to Berle at a urinal, glancing down, and quipping, "You'd better feed that thing, or it's liable to turn on you!"{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In the short story 'A Beautiful Child', [[Truman Capote]] wrote [[Marilyn Monroe]] as saying: "Christ!

Though he "worked clean" for his entire onstage and onscreen career, except for the infamous Friars Club private [[celebrity]] roasts, Berle was known offstage to have a colorful vocabulary and few limits on when it was used. He often criticized younger comedians like [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[George Carlin]] for their X-rated humor, and challenged them to be just as funny without the four-letter words.

Hundreds of younger comics, including several comedy superstars, were encouraged and guided by Berle. Despite some less than flattering stories told about Berle being difficult to work with, his son, Bill, maintains that Berle was a source of encouragement and technical assistance for many new comics. Berle's son Bob backs up his brother's statement. He was present many times during Berle's Las Vegas shows and television guest appearances. Milton aided [[Fred Travalena]], [[Ruth Buzzi]], [[John Ritter]], [[Marla Gibbs]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Dick Shawn]] and [[Will Smith]]. At a taping of a ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' show episode, for example, [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]] recited a scripted joke routine to a studio audience, to little response. The director asked for a retake, and the Osmonds repeated the act, word for word, to even less response. A third attempt, with no variation, proved dismal—until Milton Berle, off-camera, went into the audience, pantomiming funny faces and gestures. Ever the professional, Berle timed each gesture to coincide with an Osmond punchline, so the dialogue seemed to be getting the maximum laughs.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Final role and death==

Berle guest-starred as Uncle Leo in the ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]'' special "[[Two Heads Are Better than None]]", which premiered in 2000. This would be his last acting role.

In April 2001 Berle announced that a malignant tumor had been found in his colon, but he had declined surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/News/04/25/berle.ill/index.html?related|title=Breaking News, Daily News and Videos – CNN.com|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle's wife said the tumor was growing so slowly that it would take 10 to 12 years to affect him in any significant or life-threatening way.

'''Ottokar Fischer Marteau''' (November 10, 1873 &amp;ndash; December 1, 1940) was an Austrian [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].

==History==
'''Ottokar Fischer Marteau''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicnook.com/forum/bioFG.htm|title=Biographies Page FG}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''also known as (born)'' '''Ottokar Fischer''' (November 10, 1873, [[Leschan]] ({{lang-cs|Lešany}}) - December 1, 1940) was born in a small village Leschan in Austrian Empire. In 1883 his parents moved to [[Vienna]], where he saw [[Charles Obra]], [[Mellini]], [[Ben Ali Bey]], and other noted performers. He gave his own first public performance at age 18. He billed himself as ''"O.F. Marteau"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Ottokar_Fischer|title=Ottokar Fischer Magicpedia Entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 Fischer met [[George Heubeck]], who was the successor of [[Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser]], who taught him all of Hofzinser's effects. Fischer also previously had studied with [[A. Fredmar]] the only pupil of [[Compars Herrmann]].

Fischer confessed that he did not find a lot of personal information about Hofzinser. He based his knowledge mainly on delivered stories and information by Hofzinser's friends and pupils and on detected letters and manuscripts as well as on several magic props of Hofzinser which he got from his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicchristian.com/hofzinserlife_en.html|title=J.N. HOFZINSER
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1898 he managed and appeared regularly at the [[Kratky Baschik theatre]] in [[Vienna]], a magic theatre with nearly 1000 seats. For 12 years he performed daily with a two and a half-hour show of magic. Several times Fischer performed before the [[Emperor of Austria|Imperial Court]] of [[Austria]] and before other crowned heads.

He performed for many years as a magician, before retiring after [[World War I]] to write a history of the art of magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-pa-http%253A%252F%252Fwww.slv.vic.gov.au%252Falma%252F0%252F0%252F0%252Fdoc%252Fal000901.shtml|title=Ottokar Fischer, internationally known authority on the art of magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer was the founder of the "Wiener Magischer Klub" and its president for many years.

April 1936, was on cover of [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]] magazine 'The Linking Ring'.

In 1939 the [[Society of American Magicians]] made Fischer an honorary member.

'''Project Fanboy''' (PF) is an American [[website]] that publishes news, interviews and reviews about the [[American comic book]] industry. In addition, the site is host to comic book fan-voted awards. It was founded by Stephen Jondrew and Scott Williams in the fall of 2005 as an alternative site that covers mainstream comic book news, but also promotes smaller independent works.

== History ==

The Project Fanboy website was launched in 2005 as an independently run promoter of comic books and creators in the comic book industry. A little known site in its first three years, it eventually began publishing interviews and reviews of independent comic books in 2008. The site garnered little interest until May 2008, with the introduction of the annual [[Project Fanboy Awards]].

At the 2009 [[MegaCon]] comic book convention the winners of the 2008 Project Fanboy Awards were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookconventions.com/index.php?start_from=120&amp;ucat=&amp;archive=&amp;subaction=&amp;id=&amp; |title=notes the announcement of the Project Fanboy Awards at the MegaCon Convention |publisher=Comicbookconventions.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards sparked controversy amongst comic book fans with the announcement of [[Jim Balent]]'s company [[Broadsword Comics]] receiving three of the twenty five awards, for their publication ''Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose''. Websites such as ''Chris's Invincible Super-Blog'' published sarcastic praise concerning the outcome of the awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-isb.com/?p=1299 |title=The Week In Ink |publisher=Chris's Invincible Super-Blog |author=Chris Sims |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other websites such as ''Panels on Pages'' spoke highly of the publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panelsonpages.com/?p=3439 |title=Panels on Pages on Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose |publisher=Panels on Pages |date=2009-04-25 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is quoted as saying, "...making it easy to see how it walked away with three of the twenty-five awards at Project Fanboy this past March...".

In the 55th issue of ''Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose'', Broadsword colorist, [[Holly Golightly (comics)|Holly Golightly]] appeared adorned in only the three Project Fanboy Awards the company received, again sparking the attention of bloggers and internet users.&lt;ref&gt;Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose ''UPC: 804879149231''&lt;/ref&gt; ''ComicBitsOnline'' spoke with Holly GoLightly after the awards ceremony and showcased a photo of the Broadsword team accepting the Project Fanboy Awards in the interview the site published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbitsonline.com/2009/04/16/the-holly-golightly-interview/ |title=Holly GoLightly Interview |publisher=ComicsBitsOnline.com |author=Terry Hooper |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fanboy Buzz ===
In 2010 the site started its official comic book podcast, the Fanboy Buzz. In 2011 the podcast partnered with the website [[Comic Collector Live]], making the Fanboy Buzz the official podcast of both Project Fanboy and Comic Collector Live.

In February 2012 Project Fanboy and the Fanboy Buzz sites merged and continued all operations under the Fanboy Buzz banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanboybuzz.com/contact-us/ |title=About Fanboy Buzz |publisher=FanboyBuzz.com |author=Fanboy Buzz |date=2012-11-15 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2012 DC Comics artist [[Ethan Van Sciver]] announced his intentions of joining the Fanboy Buzz podcast as a host on the show via his Facebook Page and Twitter pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/scottwilliams32/status/267030264553820160 |title=Ethan Van Sciver joins the Fanboy Buzz podcast |publisher=Twitter.com |author=Ethan Van Sciver |date=2012-11-10 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sciver joined veteran Fanboy Buzz hosts Stephen Jondrew, Scott Williams, Jean Sebastian and Steve Boyd as a full-time host of the Fanboy Buzz podcast starting with episode 142 of the show.

=== Usage as a comic book resource ===
Comic book editor, writer, and Project Fanboy columnist, [[Steven D. Forbes]] is commonly known for his ongoing columns at the site, where he offers advice for aspiring writers as well as offering his professional editorial thoughts on samples of work sent to him by his readers. An established columnist on the site since August 2008, Forbes was interviewed on ''Jazma Online''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazmaonline.com/interviews/interviews2009.asp?intID=349 |title=Interview with Steve Forbes |publisher=Jazma Online |date=2009-04-25 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been referenced on sites such as [[Newsarama]], by columnist Randal Jarrell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newsarama.com/author/rjarrell/ |title=Randall Jarell |publisher=Blog.newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tyler James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James |first=Tyler |url=http://tylerjamescomics.blogspot.com/2009/01/editing-critiques-1-reprisal-by-matthew.html |title=Tyler James |publisher=TylerJamesComics |date= |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes has also been spoken highly of on [https://web.archive.org/web/20090529031313/http://indycomics.today.com/2008/09/27/a-site-for-the-comic-geek-in-all-of-us/ Today.com] by [[Stacey David]], author of the [[Bluewater Publishing]] mini-series [[GearZ]].

In May 2009, the site began being used by the industry as a resource when interviews the site conducted with ''The Original Nutty Funsters'' author, Stephanie O'Donnell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/p/detail/the-original-nutty-funsters-part-1-an-inter-review |title=The Original Nutty Funsters, Part 1 - An Inter-Review |publisher=brokenfrontier.com |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chumble Spuzz]] author, Ethan Nicolle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/p/detail/zink-watoom-gazork-an-inter-review-of-chumble-spuzz-part-1 |title=Zink Watoom Gazork: An Inter-Review of Chumble Spuzz - Part 1 |publisher=brokenfrontier.com |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; were cited by the comic book news website Broken Frontier, as a primer to "inter-reviews" they conducted with the same authors.

The site has also appeared as a reference on the Internet Movie Database for an interview they conducted with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator, [[Peter Laird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453556/miscsites |title=2007 TMNT Movie Internet Movie Database Listing |publisher=IMDB |date= |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Project Fanboy Awards}}

The site is host to the annual event, the Project Fanboy Awards (PFA), which is a fan voted competition similar to the [[Eagle Awards]], where fans decide their favorite writers and artists among several other categories. [[Geoff Johns]]' inclusion in a list of the "Top 20 Comic Book Writers of All Time" in an article on Mania.com, was influenced at least in part by the 2008 award he won from the site as "Best Writer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/top-20-comic-writers-all-time_article_115430.html |title=Top 20 Comic Book Writers of All Time |publisher=Mania |date=2009-06-03 |first=Tim |last=Janson |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PFA began as a monthly honor for deserving fan sites. The [http://www.thegreenlanterncorps.com/ Green Lantern Corps] fan site was the first winner when it received the award for February, 2008. In May 2008 however, the Project Fanboy Award was restructured and re slated as an annual event and dubbed the [[Project Fanboy Awards]]''(plural)''. After the restructuring of the awards it now consisted of twenty-five different categories in which fans are encouraged to nominate and vote on via the Project Fanboy website.

In its first year, nominations in all categories were accepted until November 1, at which point voting began which lasted through the end of December. The same voting and nomination schedule as used for the 2008 awards also applies to following years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12384">'''[[Queer]] [[pornography]]''' depicts performers with various [[gender]] identities and [[sexual orientation]]s interacting and exploring genres of desire and pleasure in unique ways. These conveyed interactions distinctively seek to challenge the conventional modes of portraying and experiencing sexually explicit content.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koller|first=Veronika|date=2015-01-01|title=The subversive potential of queer pornography: A systemic-functional analysis of a written online text|journal=Journal of Language and Sexuality|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=254–271|doi=10.1075/jls.4.2.04kol|issn=2211-3770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Ingrid Ryberg additionally includes two main objectives of queer pornography in her definition as "interrogating and troubling gender and sexual categories and aiming at sexual arousal."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingrid|first=Ryberg,|date=2012-01-01|title=Imagining Safe Space : The Politics of Queer, Feminist and Lesbian Pornography|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:477159|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer porn works to have authentic representations with respect to the [[sexual orientation]]s, [[gender identities]] and [[desire]]s of the performers in it.&lt;ref name="seise"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seise|first=Cherie|date=April 2010|year=|title=Fucking Utopia: Queer Porn and Queer Liberation|url=http://freireproject.org/wp-content/journals/sprinkle/Sprinkle_vol3.pdf|journal=Sprinkle: A Journal of Sexual Diversity Studies|volume=3|pages=19–29|via=|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[heterosexual]] pornography, [[gay pornography]], or [[lesbian pornography]], because queer porn will often be a partnering of performers outside traditional pornographic categories.&lt;ref name="seise" /&gt; Gay porn falls into a similar situation as heterosexual porn by putting an emphasis on androcentric imagery of pleasure, as scholar [[Richard Dyer]] argues, and often glorifies the homonormative, masculine body-type and behavior. To appear as inclusive, gay porn will exotify differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Columbia Reader: On lesbians and gay men in media, society, and politics|last=Dyer|first=Richard|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Larry|location=New York|pages=479–485|chapter=Coming to Terms: Gay Pornography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers' bodies in queer pornography are key to providing a difference between it and other categories of pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Katrien, Marije Janssen, and matteo Pasquinelli. ''C’lickme : A Netporn Studies Reader''. Amsterdam: Institute of Network Cultures, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[DVD]] may have one scene which shows a [[transgender lesbian]] with a [[cisgender]] femme-identified queer woman, while the next scene may showcase two transgender queer-identified men.&lt;ref name="seise" /&gt;

The genre of queer pornography as defined above is relatively recent and has been popularized and distributed by adult film companies such as [[Pink and White Productions]], Trouble Films, Real Queer Productions among others. While porn is not limited to adult cinema and can exist in the context of a variety of media such as queer written pornography, the currently produced queer porn is mostly in the form of video.

Some prominent queer producers include [[Shine Louise Houston]], Chelsea Poe, and [[April Flores]] who attempt to challenge the filming methods within the [[porn industry]].  Typically within the Porn Industry, the producer and director have the majority of control over how each scene will be performed, who is showcased in each set, and creating a differential of performers’ salaries based on their popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|date=2016-04-02|title=Pornography as a creative industry: challenging the exceptionalist approach to pornography|journal=Porn Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–119|doi=10.1080/23268743.2015.1065202|issn=2326-8743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer pornography counters these practices by actively engaging performers in the creations of scenes allowing them to form more organically as a collaboration with a more horizontal access of control rather than a hierarchically vertical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goldengatexpress.org/2015/10/20/the-underside-of-the-porn-industry/|title=The underside of the porn industry|last=Wright|first=Cody|date=2015-10-20|website=Golden Gate Xpress|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dar-dowling/shine-louise-houston-jiz-_b_7595976.html|title=Shine Louise Houston &amp; Jiz Lee: Crowdfunding Queer Porn Their Way.…|last=Dowling|first=Dar|date=2015-06-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer porn similarly celebrates ejaculation but with some signification differences to conventional porn. Unlike in the mainstream industry, the performer does not have a financial bonus for providing such a "money shot." Directors only encourage performers to perform an orgasm if/when the actors feel like it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the [[money shot]] in conventional porn relies of visibility for the camera, it necessarily centers on showing external ejaculation of the penis as the ultimate climax. This reflects attention back to the male centered gaze and a representative instance of phallic power and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/838864947|title=Hard core : power, pleasure, and the "frenzy of the visible"|last=Linda|first=Williams,|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520219434|oclc=838864947|date=1999-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer porn attempts to broaden such a delineation of phallic centered climax and the pornographic production.

== Discourses on Queer Pornography ==
Queer Pornography has been attracting academic attention since the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pinkwhite.biz/PWWP/superfreaky-queerness-feminism-and-aesthetics-in-queer-pornography/|title=Superfreaky: Queerness, Feminism, and Aesthetics in Queer Pornography {{!}} Pink &amp; White Productions|website=pinkwhite.biz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963852414|title=The feminist porn book : the politics of producing pleasure|last=Tristan.|first=Taormino,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=9781558618183|oclc=963852414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/942285669|title=Porn.com : making sense of online pornography|last=Feona.|first=Attwood,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433102073|oclc=942285669}}&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge within queer pornography is that some labeled queer porn may depict scenarios that could be part of any [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]  mainstream pornographic film. This follows academic Niels van Doorn’s concept of the “pornoscript,” eroticizing heterosexual difference and focusing on the male subject position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Doorn|first=Niels|date=2010-11-01|title=Keeping it Real: User-Generated Pornography, Gender Reification, and Visual Pleasure|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=411–430|doi=10.1177/1354856510375144|issn=1354-8565}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a scene from Real Queer Productions’s ''Fluid'' depicts a threesome with elements of submissions and dominance, rough vaginal and anal penetration, and external male ejaculation. The film’s adherence to the pornographic conventions is predictable and serialized. However, further inspection into queer porn that appears like [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]]  pornography reveals particular parody of serial strategy to expose [[Gender Construction|gender construction]] within most conventional pornography.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880439054|title=Pornography and seriality : the culture of producing pleasure|last=1983-|first=Schaschek, Sarah,|isbn=9781137363121|oclc=880439054}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process creates a queer version of the model of "subversive repetition" theorized by academic [[Judith Butler]].  Drawing particular attention to such a facet through imitation permits its productive act of deconstruction. Thus, queer pornography can disassemble the pornographic norm by mimicking it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, queer pornography clearly reveals the imitative process of gender identification when introducing the figure of the transgender man. Compared to trans woman(male-to-female) individuals depicted across other types of pornography, female-to-male [[Trans man|trans men]] appear significantly in [[Feminist pornography|feminist]] and queer pornography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Films of queer pornography make "deviant" sexualities more visible by simultaneously starting a process of their [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]]. So, in order to avoid creating a new kind of norm, queer pornography constantly works along the edge of the [[Gender systems|gender system]]. For example, when strap-on dildos made their appearance in queer pornography leaving viewers guessing whether they were faced with a "real" penis or a dildo, they soon became a common sight. While these strap-on dildos originally offered new ways of thinking about gender and sexuality, their ubiquitous use risked losing their subversive power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As scholar Sarah Schaschek writes, “If heterosexual pornography accentuates clearly defined identity categories such as class, age, ethnicity, sexuality, or gender, queer films tend to reveal the high degree of stylization behind these identities”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19670">The '''Richmond Hill Inn''' was a 25-room Inn located on the Historic Richmond Hill estate in North Carolina. It was a [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] style mansion that was built in 1889 and has now been gutted by the arson fire. It served as the private residence of [[ambassador]] and [[congressman]] [[Richmond Pearson]]. Its name derives from a combination of its builder, Richmond Pearson, and the designer, James G. Hill. At the time of its construction, the mansion was one of the most elegant structures in Asheville, with running water, ten fireplaces, and a pulley-operated baggage elevator. It served as a center for social and political activity for many years during Pearson's life. The Estate is located on French Broad River, surrounded by rolling grounds with gardens.

==Relocation and renovation==
In 1984, the Pearson heirs sold the Richmond Hill estate. The Preservation Society saved the mansion from demolition and had it moved 600 feet. The mansion underwent a $3 million restoration before being opened as part of an Inn in 1989. The second and third floors housed 12 guest rooms, while the first floor contained a restaurant called Gabrielle's, a grand Oak Hall, library, and front parlor.

Two other additions have been made since the initial reopening, both designed by architect Jim Samsel. A manicured [[croquet]] court with 8 cottages overlooking the greens were built in 1990. A new building called ''The Garden Pavilion'' was added in 1996, containing 16 guest rooms and overlooking a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Parterre]]-style [[garden]].

==2009 fire==
On March 19, 2009, a fire destroyed the 120-year-old historic mansion. Due to the size of the fire, an arson investigation began immediately.

Within days of the blaze, officials with the Asheville Fire Department, confirmed the discovery of what they considered to be evidence indicating that the fire had been intentionally set.[http://www.mountainx.com/news/2009/asheville_fire_department_richmond_hill_blaze_was_arson] Further suspicions were aroused due to an ongoing legal battle which had led the Buncombe County Clerk of Court ordering that the inn be sold in a foreclosure auction on the Buncombe county court house steps.[http://www.mountainx.com/files/richmond_hill_foreclosure_petition1.pdf][http://www.mountainx.com/files/richmond_hill_foreclosure_sale1.pdf][http://www.mountainx.com/files/richmond_hill_foreclosure_notice1.pdf] This foreclose notice was entered into three days before the 2009 fire. The owners at the time of the fire had failed to make mortgage payments on the property since August 2008. This failure to make payments led the previous owners, who had financed the purchase, to seek foreclosure. One day before the 2008 foreclose hearing Richmond Hill Inn (Hammock LLC) managing partner William G Gray and his half sister, The Hammocks LLC/Lake Norman pavilion LLC majority partner Virginia C Love (of the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell &amp; Berkowitz, PC) [http://www.bakerdonelson.com/Bio.aspx?NodeID=32&amp;PersonID=1713] filed suit against the former owners and mortgage holders for alleged faulty pipes on the property.[http://www.mountainx.com/xpressfiles/richmond_hill_inn_foreclosure_fire_inspection_tax_records][http://www.mountainx.com/files/richmond_hill_civil_lawsuit1.pdf]
In addition, the Buncombe county tax assessor was seeking over $64,000 in property taxes from 2008 [http://www.mountainx.com/files/Richmond_Hill_Properties.pdf]

The next transcript deals with testimony in regard to William Gray losing his license to practice medicine over charges of sexual misconduct with his under age male patients [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyaWNobW9uZGhpbGxpbm58Z3g6MWQ2YmE2ODQ2ZWJkMDk0NA] see medical board documents below.

The bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of North Carolina has granted a motion for the state lawsuit in regard to the alleged faulty pipes at the Richmond Hill Inn to proceed in state court.

At present, the investigation into the fire is ongoing with a sole person of interest in the case but no arrests have been made.{{update section|date=December 2017}}

== Bankruptcy court case, documents and transcripts ==

The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company has filed a pleading in bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of North Carolina denying liability for the insurance claim for the arson and for the following reasons,

11. As alleged in greater detail in the Complaint, Harleysville believes, and expects to be able to prove at trial, that under these exclusions it has complete defenses to the Demand, including that (a) the fire was caused by the Debtor's arson and (b) that in applying for the Policy the Debtor made material misrepresentations.

The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company filed a petition in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of North Carolina to remove the  civil arson case from bankruptcy court to federal district court and to request a trial by jury. This has been so ordered by the court

Under questioning William Gray testified to a letter his sister Virginia C love,The Hammocks LLC/Lake Norman pavilion LLC majority partner(of the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell &amp; Berkowitz, PC) [http://www.bakerdonelson.com/Bio.aspx?NodeID=32&amp;PersonID=1713] sent to a Jim Sloggart demanding money for failure to perform as a partner in The hammocks LLC [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyaWNobW9uZGhpbGxpbm58Z3g6MjMwZTY3NzI1ZDgyNDlhMQ] William Gray was asked to speculate as to whom may have burned down the Richmond Hill Inn he stated that he could not imagine the following people would have "done it themselves" but may have had motive to do so, Jim Sloggart, Mrs Micheal(the note holder)and Bland Holland a former Richmond Hill Inn manager.

Rockey Lapomardo from Florida is a friend of Virginia C love and has tried to sell the property so far without success.

William Gray gives testimony in regard to 1977 California Medical Board allegations of sexual misconduct with male patients(the first California case)[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyaWNobW9uZGhpbGxpbm58Z3g6MWQ2YmE2ODQ2ZWJkMDk0NA] The bankruptcy court for the western district of North Carolina has granted a motion for the state lawsuit in regard to the alleged faulty pipes at the Richmond Hill Inn to proceed in state court.Further testimony was given in regard to whether William Gray told employees he was bipolar William Gray denied he made any such statement. Testimony on page 76 [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyaWNobW9uZGhpbGxpbm58Z3g6MmU2NGZjOWQ5ZDZkYmY4MA] In a recently filed document in the Federal District Court for western North Carolina The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company makes the statement that it believes that the arson was set by The Hammocks LLC's "Authorized agents"[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyaWNobW9uZGhpbGxpbm58Z3g6NjZlNTUyYmExNzJhZDYyNA]
On January 20 in bankruptcy court for the western region of North Carolina there is a hearing scheduled to argue whether to convert the Richmond Hill Inn from a Chapter 11 to a chapter 7 liquidation, to decide whether to accept "the plan" submitted by the debtor, to appoint the US trustee for the estate and to examine the Hammocks LLC financial discloser statements.The US trustee an employee of the court has objected to the financial discloser statement, "the plan" and has asked the judge to convert the case to a liquidation bankruptcy.[http://www.ncwb.uscourts.gov/calendar/monthly.html] The US trustees motion to convert the case to a chapter 7 and/or appoint a chapter 11 trustee was denied in a hearing 20 January 2010 [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyaWNobW9uZGhpbGxpbm58Z3g6NTcxMTFjNTNhOGI0MmM3Yw] Thus The Hammocks LLC doing business as the Richmond Hill Inn shall remain as debtor in possession in till such time as there is a discharge from bankruptcy court.

It appears that the managing partners plan to shut down the Richmond Hill Inn soon under a chapter 11 "liquidation plan" and sell the real estate to satisfy the mortgage owed [http://8770586835587564609-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/richmondhillinn/file-cabinet/ncwb-3060merged.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crIshjsy3ec3dTGyYk-7NMM1FTPK4FU8pe83svnWMcjIY23N96C-KOO9uvChM6O8nrhYOk7522lJEEAobsrbmywPFZH7A8LGWLmk4gaAZ5nXzsWXzVFUAB_075odRXjLk8dtQfoV3uuGg_08VZFZolcYBmugB0pk8Tq-mdTzevoUWGfDgYnjSX9-1BV8TqntEUGl0IzMCKc7WpHFVyA_V-bfRwiq_Yr-oa3dp2qJYgAwVZxlko%3D&amp;attredirects=0 ]
The bankruptcy court for the western district of North Carolina has objected to this plan as it is not transparent. It does not disclose partner compensation. It does not disclose timing of this "liquidation"[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.ncwb.142275]
It is noted it does not appear that employees or future guests have been notified of this plan.The Richmond hill Inn has closed for the winter but appears to be still taking reservations for April 2010.It is not known if Richmond hill inn is collecting deposits on wedding reservations.As of late February 2010 the Richmond Hill Inn website is reporting that it will not reopen in April 2010, due to arson by former employees.

==Controversy over media coverage of William Gilman Gray==
Local paper Asheville Citizen-Times ran an article on Richmond Hill Inn managing partner William G Gray on his past criminal arrest record for allegedly molesting boys in several states over the last three decades and surrendering his license to practice medicine in lieu of a hearing or after a hearing in many states. The article generated intense controversy in the community as to its content.[http://www.topix.com/forum/cn/beijing/TFPU7IVN4G5B6SGQO][http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/frontpage][http://ashvegas.squarespace.com/journal/2009/3/27/citizen-times-copyrights-richmond-hill-sleaze-story-but-why.html][http://www.citizen-times.com/assets/pdf/B0131561327.PDF][http://waldo.jaquith.org/blog/2005/05/gibson-kilgore-debate/]
There appear to be federal government documents that support the controversy in regard to William G Gray losing his DEA license to proscribe controlled substances for "his prescribing or dispensing various controlled substances to several individuals, two of whom were minors, without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of professional practice"
[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1994-02-10/html/94-3031.htm]
and there appear to be state of California, North Carolina and state of Virginia documents in regard to alleged criminal behavior in regard to minors [http://licenselookup.mbc.ca.gov/licenselookup/lookup.php?LicenseType=C&amp;LicenseNumber=30499][http://wwwapps.ncmedboard.org/Clients/NCBOM/Public/Licensee_Details.aspx?&amp;EntityID=47796&amp;PublicFile=1] And a Revocation of license to practice for a "mental abnormality" in regard to behavior towards his male minor patients [http://www.citizen-times.com/assets/pdf/B0131561327.PDF]
It is a public policy question to note that William Gilmans Gray's 1977 surrender of his California license to practice medicine still does not appear on the California's medical board website.

The ownership management team at the Richmond Hill Inn did release a statement prepared by the public relations firm of Dan Kellerby Media of Nashville, TN. It tells of the hardships in the hotel industry in the last years of the economic crises and alleged forced cutbacks on staff and the ownership structure's family and emotional attachment to the community.
[http://www.mountainx.com/news/2009/richmond_hill_inn_owner_issues_statement_through_spokesman] [http://www.wyff4.com/download/2009/0324/19004286.pdf]
This is an example of a case study of multi-media tourism marketing before the fire [http://www.bclip.com/site/storage/cs_richmondhillinn.pdf]

==Continued Operation After Fire==
The Richmond Hill Inn re-opened after the 2009 fire and continued to operate under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection [http://www.mountainx.com/files/richmondhillbankruptcy1.pdf], even though the mansion was destroyed and Gabrielle's Restaurant was destroyed due to the arson.  In August 2011, Oshun Mountain Sanctuary (OM Sanctuary) purchased the Richmond Hill Inn to transform the property into a holistic education retreat center.

'''''HaKokhav HaBa''''' ({{lang-he-n|הַכּוֹכָב הַבָּא}},  translated as "The Next Star") is an [[Israel]]i interactive reality singing competition, which was first broadcast on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] from 17 September 2013. It is based on the [[Rising Star (TV series)|''Rising Star'' franchise]] created by [[Keshet Broadcasting]]. The show is a continuation of the former program ''[[Kokhav Nolad]]'' (meaning "A Star is Born") which featured aspiring singers competing for a winning title. The program's format combines the [[internet]], [[smartphone]]s and [[television]] and is filmed live.

The shows inaugurative season in 2013 was won by Evyatar Korkus. Since season 2, the winner is given the opportunity to represent [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest]].&lt;ref name=Eurovision&gt;{{cite web|last=Granger|first=Anthony|title=Israel: HaKokhav HaBa (Rising Star) Winner To ESC 2015|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/10/05/israel-hakokhav-haba-rising-star-winner-to-esc-2015/|website=Eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=5 October 2014|date=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2014–2015 winner [[Nadav Guedj]] represented Israel in 2015 with "[[Golden Boy (Nadav Guedj song)|Golden Boy]]" 2015–2016 winner [[Hovi Star]] represented Israel in 2016 with "[[Made of Stars]]", 2016–2017 winner [[Imri Ziv]] represented Israel in 2017 with "[[I Feel Alive]]", and 2017–2018 winner [[Netta Barzilai]] who went on to win the 2018 contest with "[[Toy (song)|Toy]]".

==Format==
As the season begins, each contestant is asked to perform a well-known song in front of judges. After the song, a vote is taken among judges whether to transfer the applicant to the test stage facing the audience at home. If the judges are not sure about how to vote, the contestant is required to perform another song, and then a decision is made.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Contestants who do move forward must then sing in front of an audience. Viewers then connect with an app at makoTV and decide in real time whether a contestant passes or does not pass.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Judges also influence the test stage - all judges may support the promotion of the contestant and thereby add 7% percent. Once the contestant reaches 70% of votes they "pass" and the screen opens and the contestant goes to the next level. 14 singers then move on to a section where the judges and the audience at home vote. At the final stage, four singers are left and one will be elected "The Next Star".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{See also|Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018}}
Israel participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 as the Israeli broadcaster [[Israeli Broadcasting Corporation|Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation]] (IPBC) for the first time collaborated with the commercial broadcaster [[Keshet Media Group|Keshet]] and Tedy Productions which organized the reality singing competition ''HaKokhav HaBa L'Eurovizion'' ("The Next Star for Eurovision") to select the singer to represent Israel, while the song was chosen by a committee of the Israeli broadcaster. Four contestants reached the final, [[Chen Aharoni]], Jonathan Mergui, Riki Ben Ari and [[Netta Barzilai]]. The season was won by [[Netta Barzilai]], the first woman to win the series. As a result, she represented Israel at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]. She went on to win the contest in [[Lisbon]] with the song "[[Toy (song)|Toy]]" earning 529 points.

==International versions==
{{Main|Rising Star (TV series)}}
After the success of the Israeli series in 2013, many television stations throughout the world bought the rights and started broadcasting similar series.

The American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] began airing its first series of ''[[Rising Star (U.S. TV series)|Rising Star]]'' in June 2014 from [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="variety1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/abcs-rising-star-juggles-time-zones-to-allow-for-live-voting-1201195783/|title=ABC’s ‘Rising Star’ Juggles Time Zones to Allow For Live Voting|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US edition was also carried in [[Canada]], with advertising [[simultaneous substitution]] and voting access on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=RISING STAR App Now Available from CTV.ca as Canadians Invited to Judge New Interactive Music Competition Series, Premiering Sunday|publisher=CNW|date=17 June 2014|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1374745/rising-star-app-now-available-from-ctv-ca-as-canadians-invited-to-judge-new-interactive-music-competition-series-premiering-sunday|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was canceled after its full 10-episode season due to low ratings in its target demographic, and extremely low ratings on the German and French versions.

Another major broadcaster [[RTL Television]] launched a [[German language]] version in Germany. But following reported poor ratings on its early shows, it announced it was bringing ''Rising Star Germany'' scheduled final forward airing an extended one-day finale between 20.15 and 00.00 to decide the winning performer, rather than completing the full 10-episode scheduled season originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.c21media.net/rising-star-falls-in-germany/ C21Media: Rising Star falls in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] channel bought the rights, but canceled its scheduled launch&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/17/itv-drops-rising-star-talent-show-format ''The Guardian'': ITV drops Rising Star talent show format]&lt;/ref&gt; citing lower-than-expected viewership in similar launches in USA and Germany.

French television [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]], with its first season, launched in September 2014 keeping the title ''Rising Star''. The French version had a shortened season due to low ratings. The Italian television [[Canale 5]] launched its version as ''Rising Star''.

Other broadcasters that adapted the series include Argentine [[Telefe]] as ''[[Elegidos (La música en tus manos)]]'', Brazilian [[Rede Globo]] as ''[[Superstar (Brazil TV series)|SuperStar]]'', Chinese [[CCTV-3]], Greek [[ANT1]] , Hungarian [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]] as ''[[Rising Star (Hungary)|Rising Star]]'', Indonesian [[RCTI]] as ''[[Rising Star Indonesia]]'', the Japanese [[NHK]] as {{nihongo|Rising Star Japan|ライジングスタージャパン}} (which has not yet been premiered), Portuguese [[Televisão Independente]] (TVI) as ''Rising Star: A próxima estrela'', [[Russia-1]] as ''Артист (Artist)'', Turkish [[TV8 (Turkey)|TV8]] as ''Yükselen Yıldız''. The Russian version of the show had a shortened season due to low ratings on the French and German versions, while the Portuguese and Brazilian versions became quickly popular.

'''Rob(ert) Pilatus''' (8 June 1965 – 2 April 1998) was an American-born German [[model (person)|model]], [[dancer]], and [[singer]]. Pilatus was half of the pop music duo [[Milli Vanilli]], the other one being Frenchman [[Fab Morvan|Fabrice Morvan]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rob Pilatus was born in [[New York City|New York]], the son of an American soldier and a German mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1574756/ IMDb Database] retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6299187 His memorial at the Find A Grave website] retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He was adopted as a baby by a [[Munich]] family.&lt;ref name="MTV Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1432182/milli-vanillis-pilatus-dead/|title=Milli Vanilli’s Pilatus Dead|last=Staff|date=6 April 1998|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilatus worked as a model and [[breakdancing|breakdancer]],&lt;ref name="MTV Obit"/&gt; also appearing as a backing singer with the group Wind at the [[1987 Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[City of Brussels|Brussels]], finishing in second place, before joining Fab Morvan in 1988 to form the pop group Milli Vanilli.&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432182/19980406/milli_vanilli.jhtml|title=Milli Vanilli's Pilatus Dead|date=6 April 1998|publisher=mtv.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milli Vanilli===
Both Pilatus and Morvan were noticed by German music producer [[Frank Farian]], who signed them to be part of a musical act. Shortly after a trip to [[Turkey]], where the duo reputedly took its name from a local advertising slogan, Milli Vanilli was born. Pilatus and Morvan served as the public faces for singers [[Charles Shaw (singer)|Charles Shaw]] and [[Brad Howell (singer)|Brad Howell]], who Farian thought were vocally talented, but lacked a marketable image.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/15/usa.musicnews|title=Hollywood pays lip service to Milli Vanilli|last=Pilikington|first=Ed|date=7 February 2007|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=25 July 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Milli Vanilli [[Music recording sales certification|platinum album]] was ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]'', which became a worldwide hit. The album produced five hit singles including three number 1 hits: "Girl I'm Gonna Miss You", "Baby Don't Forget My Number" and "Blame It On The Rain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=milli vanilli|chart=all}}|title=Milli Vanilli: Billboard Chart History|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milli Vanilli won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] on 21 February 1990, for "Girl You Know It's True".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/fanfare/ny-ffmus5567351feb10,0,5317518.story|title=Not every Grammy decision was a winner|last=Guzmán|first=Rafer|date=10 February 2008|publisher=newsday.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the enormous success, the duo were a frequent target of rumours and allegations of onstage [[lip-synching]] and not having sung on the album. Charles Shaw, one of the actual vocalists, told a reporter the truth, but retracted his statement after Farian paid him $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318744,00.html|title=Artificial Vanilli|last=Goodman|first=Fred|last2=Trakin|first2=Roy|date=30 November 1990|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pilatus and Morvan pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian admitted to reporters on 15 November 1990 that they had not performed on the recordings. Milli Vanilli's Grammy Award was withdrawn four days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D71F3DF936A35751C1A966958260|title=Winner of Grammy Lost By Milli Vanilli: No One|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=5 December 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arista Records dropped them from its roster and deleted their album and songs from their catalog, making ''Girl You Know It's True'' the largest-selling album to ever be taken out of print. A court ruling in the United States allowed anyone who had bought the album to receive a refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowell|first=Gary|author2=Evans, Isaiah|others=Jones, Kim|title=Heritage Music and Entertainment Dallas Signature Auction Catalog #622|editor=Halperin, James L.|publisher=2006|pages=34|isbn=1-59967-081-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farian later attempted an unsuccessful comeback for the group without Pilatus and Morvan. Months after the scandal, Pilatus and Morvan appeared in a commercial for Carefree sugarless chewing gum. In it the duo lip-synched to an opera recording. An announcer asked, "How long does the taste of Carefree Sugarless Gum last?" The record began to skip and the announcer added, "Until these guys sing for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDE1331F937A25755C0A967958260|title=Milli Vanilli Appears Again|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=14 June 1991|work=The New York Times |accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Pilatus and Morvan signed with a new label, Taj, and released ''[[Rob &amp; Fab]]'', an album featuring their own voices, but the album only sold around 2,000 copies.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; The label went bankrupt shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00EED8113AF934A35757C0A96E958260|title= Robert Pilatus, 33, Performer In Disgraced Band Milli Vanilli|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=7 April 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline, addiction and turn to crime===
In the years following the collapse of Milli Vanilli, Pilatus struggled with [[substance abuse]] and even [[suicide attempts]]. After their unsuccessful comeback, Morvan and Pilatus stopped speaking to each other. In 1996, Pilatus served three months in prison for [[assault]], [[vandalism]] and attempted [[robbery]]. Farian paid for Pilatus to spend six months in [[drug rehabilitation]], before returning to Germany from the United States.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,282696_2,00.html|title=The Sad Truth|last=Chris |first=Willman|publisher=ew.com|pages=2|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 3 April 1998, on the eve of a promotional tour for a new completed Milli Vanilli album entitled ''Back and in Attack'' featuring Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan on lead vocals, Pilatus was found dead at the age of 32 from a suspected [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and prescription pill overdose in "Kent's Cube" at Friedrichsdorf,  near Frankfurt. His death was ruled accidental, and their final album has never been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33|title=Milli Vanilli's Pilatus Dead At 32|date=7 April 1998|publisher=rollingstone.com|accessdate=25 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144027/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33|archivedate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his son&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/pimp-slaps-thefts-who-knew-this-milli-vanilli-singer-was-this-wild/3/ "So Sad: This Milli Vanilli Singer Lived A Hard Life After Their Success."

The film deals with a young student played by [[Hao Lei]] who leaves her small hometown to study at the fictional "Beiqing University" (a homage to [[Peking University]]). There she meets a fellow student and begins an intense romantic relationship in the backdrop of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The film also follows the eventual disillusionment of these young idealists after the crackdown, as the years progress through the 1990s and into the 2000s (decade). The film is named after the [[Summer Palace]] located in Beijing.

''Summer Palace'''s [[Sex in film|sex scenes]] and political undertones made the film tinder for controversy in China, leading both the director, Lou Ye, and his producers into conflict with China's [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] (SARFT). After screening ''Summer Palace'' in the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] without government approval, the film was placed under a de facto ban in Mainland China, and its filmmakers officially censored.

== Plot ==
Spanning several cities and over a decade, ''Summer Palace'' tells the story of '''Yu Hong''' (played by [[Hao Lei]]), a young woman from the border-city of [[Tumen, Jilin|Tumen]], who is accepted to the fictional Beiqing University, a name that evokes either [[Peking University]] ("Beida") or [[Tsinghua University]] ("Qinghua"). While in school, Yu Hong meets '''Li Ti''', her best friend (played by [[Hu Lingling]]), and '''Zhou Wei''', her college boyfriend and the love of her life (played by [[Guo Xiaodong]]). The film is divided into two parts. The first begins in the late 1980s (subtitles inform the audience of the place and year at various points in the film), as Yu Hong enters the university. Lonely and isolated despite the cramped living conditions, Yu Hong eventually befriends another student, Li Ti, who introduces her to her boyfriend '''Ruo Gu''' (played by [[Zhang Xianmin]]), and Ruo Gu's friend Zhou Wei. Yu Hong and Zhou Wei embark upon a passionate but volatile love affair just as political forces are moving towards [[Tiananmen Square]].

Two events then bring the first half of the film to a close: First, Zhou Wei, incensed at the jealousy and emotional instability of his girlfriend, begins to have an affair with Li Ti; and second, the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|crackdown]] occurs on the students on Tiananmen Square and on the campus of Beida. During all of this, Yu Hong's old boyfriend '''Xiao Jun''' (played by [[Cui Jin]]) from Tumen arrives and the two of them leave, Yu Hong deciding that she will drop out from the university.

The film then fast forwards several years, as Lou Ye intersperses the travels of his three main characters with news footage of the end of the [[Cold War]], and the 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|Hong Kong handover]]. Yu Hong has left Tumen again, first for [[Shenzhen]], and then for the central China city of [[Wuhan]], while Li Ti and Ruo Gu have moved to Berlin. Yu Hong is unable to forget Zhou Wei, and has empty affairs with a married man and a kind but quiet mailroom worker. The film follows her disaffection with society and her use of sex as a substitute for contentment. Eventually discovering that she is pregnant, Yu Hong gets an [[abortion]] and moves to [[Chongqing]] where she marries.

Li Ti, Ruo Gu, and Zhou Wei, meanwhile, live a quiet life as expatriates in Berlin. While Li Ti and Zhou Wei still occasionally make love, the former quietly realizes that the latter does not love her. Though the three friends appear happy, when Zhou Wei plans to return home to China and settle in the city of Chongqing, Li Ti suddenly commits [[suicide]]. There he connects with former classmates who in turn point him to Yu Hong's email address.

After more than ten years, Zhou Wei and Yu Hong at last reunite in the resort city of [[Beidaihe]]. While they embrace, they ask each other, "Now what?" When Yu Hong leaves, ostensibly to buy drinks, Zhou Wei understands that they can never be together and leaves as well.

==Cast==
*[[Hao Lei]] as Yu Hong - the film's heroine, a young student at the fictional Beiqing University from the small town of [[Tumen, Jilin]] on the North Korean-Chinese border. Yu Hong is a willful young woman who desires to live life more intensely. Her love affair with the character of Zhou Wei serves as the basis of the film.
*[[Guo Xiaodong]] as Zhou Wei - Yu Hong's love interest, another student at the same university. Something of an intellectual, Zhou Wei is both deeply in love with Yu Hong and prone to infidelity. When the Tiananmen protests arrive, he like his fellow students join in the movement.
*[[Hu Lingling]] as Li Ti - Yu Hong's best friend and eventual rival. Li Ti, an English-language major at the same university, is the first to befriend the sullen, quiet Yu Hong. Though considered a cynic, she harbors a romantic side as well.
*[[Zhang Xianmin]] as Ruo Gu - Li Ti's boyfriend, a student studying abroad in [[Berlin]].
*[[Cui Lin]] as Xiao Jun - Yu Hong's high school boyfriend from Tumen.
*[[Bai Xueyun]] as Wang Bo - Yu Hong's lover in Wuhan.

Lou Ye picked Hao Lei from over 400 candidates because she was the only one who turned him down, fearing the sex scenes would hurt her love relationship. As Lou said later, "That was something Yu Hong would say, so I had to have her play (Yu)." The entire crew waited patiently for Hao to accept, for so long that the original choice for Zhou Wei, [[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]], had to abandon the project. Hao was very touched and agreed, but her relationship with actor [[Deng Chao]] did end as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5d22198d0100cutq.html 《颐和园》女主角郝蕾专访实录]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://ent.sina.com.cn/j/2011-04-22/13453289288_2.shtml 《柔软》热演 郝蕾：我不耻笑自己的选择]&lt;/ref&gt; Lou's 2012 film ''[[Mystery (2012 film)|Mystery]]'' reunited him with Hao.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.nfpeople.com/story_view.php?id=2859 娄烨 我想更加自由地拍电影 2012-04-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Summer Palace'' was screened at several international film festivals, most notably [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4352475/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Summer Palace |accessdate=2009-12-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was the only Asian film in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002384372|title = 'Palace' producers challenge Beijing censors|author =Landreth, Jonathon |publisher = ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''|date =2006-04-22|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Palme d'Or]] eventually went to the [[Cinema of Ireland|Irish]] film, ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', directed by [[Ken Loach]]. Besides Cannes, ''Summer Palace'' was also screened at a handful of top-tier festivals including [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.torontointernationalfilmfestival.ca/films_schedules/films_description.asp?id=291|title = Toronto International Film Festival - Film Description| publisher = [[Toronto International Film Festival]] |accessdate =2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mill Valley Film Festival|Mill Valley]].&lt;ref name= "MillValley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mvff.com/node/1957|title = Summer Palace, Mill Valley Film Festival| publisher = [[Mill Valley Film Festival]] | accessdate =2008-01-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109011859/http://mvff.com/node/1957 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were generally positive in reviews, citing the film's ambition and scope with the most common complaint being the film's excessive length at 140 minutes. Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' claimed the film was "half an hour too long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

''[[The New York Times]]'' gave a particularly glowing review for the film with film critic [[A. O. Scott]] writing that "...[despite] its 2-hour-20-minute length, 'Summer Palace' moves with the swiftness and syncopation of a pop song. Like [[Jean-Luc Godard]] in the 1960s, Mr. Lou favors breathless tracking shots and snappy jump cuts, and like Mr. Godard’s, his camera is magnetized by female beauty."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/movies/18pala.html?ref=movies|title= Summer Palace - Movie -Review| author = Scott, A. O. | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''|date=2008-01-18|accessdate=2008-01-20|authorlink= A. O. Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released unrated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/summerpalace|title=Summer Palace (2008):Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several American film critics have described ''Summer Palace'' as one of the most sexually-explicit films in years; indeed [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' noted that he never seen so much lovemaking in an "aboveground" film,&lt;ref name= "Denby"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/01/21/080121crci_cinema_denby |title = Moral Landscapes: "Still Life," "Summer Palace," and "Cassandra’s Dream"| author = Denby, David|publisher = ''[[The New Yorker]]'' | date = 2008-01-21| accessdate = 2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he also noted that these scenes are not pornographic, that is, never separated from emotion.

===Ban===
The film was in competition at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] but failed to garner any awards.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com" /&gt; Though ''Summer Palace'' was the only Asian film in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]], Lou and his producers had not received approval from Chinese censors, thus instigating an official censure by the Chinese [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] (SARFT).&lt;ref name="ban"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117949488.html?categoryid=1442&amp;cs=1 | title = China gives 'Palace' pair 5-year bans | accessdate = 2007-02-20 | author = Variety Staff |date= 2006-09-04 | publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, both Lou and his producer, [[Nai An]], were forbidden by the Chinese Government to make any new films for five years.&lt;ref name="Musetta"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nypost.com/seven/01182008/entertainment/movies/epic_full_of_love__naked_truth_662698.htm |title = Epic Full of Love and Naked Truth |publisher = ''[[New York Post]]'' |author =Musetta, V. A. | date= 2008-01-18| accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ban"/&gt;

Besides the filmmakers, ''Summer Palace'' itself was de facto banned when SARFT refused to grant a certificate to distribute in the Mainland because the film was not up to the official standards for picture and sound quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

''' TAB Trackside''' is New Zealand horse racing and sports broadcast network, incorporating two [[pay TV]] channels and a nationwide radio station. The TV channels are available on [[SKY Network Television|SKY Digital]] channels and [[Vodafone New Zealand]] TV cable channels 062 and 063.&lt;ref name=tabtv&gt;{{cite web|title=TAB Trackside TV|url=http://static.tab.co.nz/content/trackside/index.html|website=TAB Trackside|publisher=[[New Zealand Racing Board]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="april2014"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tab.co.nz/help/tv-radio/radio-trackside.html | title = TAB Help - Trackside Radio | publisher = [[New Zealand Racing Board]]  | accessdate = 13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio station broadcasts on 17 [[AM radio]] and 15 [[FM radio]] frequencies from [[Kaitaia]] to [[Invercargill]], including two frequencies in [[Taupo]].&lt;ref name="tabradio"&gt;{{cite web|title=TAB Trackside Radio|url=http://static.tab.co.nz/content/trackside/index.html|website=TAB Trackside|publisher=[[New Zealand Racing Board]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the outlets provide full coordinated coverage of all [[thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred horse racing]], [[harness racing|harness horse racing]] and [[greyhound racing]] in New Zealand, most racing from Australia, and many races from Hong Kong, Singapore and other countries. The channels provides tickers and commentary with up-to-the-minute odds, field and dividend information. Between races, they feature on-track interviews, in-studio analysis, live footage of horses warming up for races, replays of previous races, and recaps of betting odds.&lt;ref name=tabtv /&gt;&lt;ref name=april2014 /&gt;

The live broadcasting of horse racing in the New Zealand dates back to the launch of a racing radio network in 1978. The station, originally known as Radio Pacific and later as bSport and LiveSport, is now TAB Trackside Radio.&lt;ref name="tabradio" /&gt; A racing television station launched in 1992, initially known as Action TV and later as Trackside, is now TAB Trackside 1. A second racing television station launched in 2007, known initially as TAB TV, is now TAB Trackside 2.&lt;ref name=tabtv /&gt;

==History==

===Radio===
[[File:Radio Pacific logo.gif|thumb|right|This was the Radio Pacific logo in 1991.]]
[[File:LiveSport historical logo.png|thumb|right|This was the LiveSport logo in 2010.]]
Racing network [[Radio Pacific]] began in Auckland in 1978, and became one of the first stations to be networked across the country in the 1990s. The network combined news, news talkback, sports talkback and live racing commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great New Zealand Radio Experiment|author=Morris William Shanahan, Karen Neill|year=2005|isbn=0-17-012480-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rEq27qhOdDwC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22radio+pacific%22|accessdate=2007-11-06|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toast&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee-Robinson|first1=Robinson|title=Talkback Toast|date=2008|publisher=Ocean Books|location=Opitiki|isbn=978-0-473-13752-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Pacific became a listed company on the [[New Zealand Stock Exchange]] and the [[Totalisator Agency Board]] became its major shareholder. The company also owned the North Island music station group Energy Enterprises and merged with the South Island radio company [[Radio Otago]] in 1999. Between May 2000 and January 2001 it was purchased by [[CanWest Global Communications]], becoming part of [[RadioWorks]] and later part of [[MediaWorks New Zealand]]. Part of the company was purchased in July 2004, and the entire company was sold off in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcom.govt.nz/PublicRegisters/ContentFiles/Documents/294.pdf Decision No. 294] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928233856/http://www.comcom.govt.nz//PublicRegisters/ContentFiles/Documents/294.pdf |date=28 September 2006 }} [[Commerce Commission]], Wellington New Zealand, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Pacific's Waikato station began as Radio Waikato, New Zealand's third privately owned station. It originally broadcast in 930AM in 1971, before moving 954AM in 1978. In 1986 Radio Waikato changed to a [[country music]] format and was renamed Country Gold - Waikato 954. In 1988 it was sold to Radio Pacific and transitioned into a local talk radio format with national racing commentary. It changed its name to Radio Pacific and eventually replaced local programmes with Auckland networked programmes. A new station of the same name also operated in Hamilton between 1993 and 1994.&lt;ref name=waikato&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Waikato story|url=http://www.radioheritage.net/Story115.asp|website=Radio Heritage|publisher=Radio Heritage Foundation|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2005 live races and betting odds had been broadcast on Radio Pacific in pre-determined, limited periods during the race day under a contract with the [[New Zealand Racing Board]]. Between 2001 and 2005, this was also complemented by a trial Radio Trackside station in the Southland market dedicated to racing coverage.&lt;ref name=shell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trevett|first1=Claire|title=Radio Live fires first shell in talkback war|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10119964|website=[[New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[New Zealand Media and Entertainment]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turnoff&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drinnan|first1=John|title=Listeners turning off Radio Sport|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10540709|website=[[New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[New Zealand Media and Entertainment]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=revamp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Jonathan|title=Revamp at talk station|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10457239|website=[[New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[New Zealand Media and Entertainment]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 [[MediaWorks New Zealand|MediaWorks]] launched new talkback network [[Radio Live]] and moved many of Radio Pacific's talkback personalities across to the new network. [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] continued to host Radio Pacific's breakfast programme, and Alice Worsley and Martin Crump co-hosted a new morning talkback programme. A Trackside TV simulcast, branded as Radio Trackside, was broadcast in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=shell /&gt;&lt;ref name=turnoff /&gt;&lt;ref name=revamp /&gt;
On 29 October 2007 Radio Pacific became BSport and its tagline became "BSport, the station you can bet on". The general talkback format was replaced with a sports talkback format. [[MediaWorks New Zealand]] and Trackside shared the network's [[Auckland]] studios, with live sports talk and betting odds in the morning, and live races and betting odds in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=notice&gt;{{cite web|title=MediaWorks Notice|url=http://www.mediaworks.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=134&amp;articleID=421|website=MediaWorks|publisher=[[MediaWorks New Zealand]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010 BSport was renamed LiveSport, the sister network to [[Radio Live]]. It became TAB Trackside Radio on 13 April 2015, when it came under the full ownership of the New Zealand Racing Board.&lt;ref name=notice /&gt;

===Television===

TAB Trackside began television broadcasting in 1992 as Action TV - a free-to-air UHF station that only broadcast during live racing events. In 1993, it changed its name to Trackside. From 1994, [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky Television]] began using broadcasting [[Discovery Channel (Australia)|Discovery Channel]] to subscribers when Trackside was in closedown. The station received a dedicated channel on the new Sky Digital platform in 1999, which began broadcasting 18 hours a day from 2004 and 24 hours a day from 2007. In addition to live New Zealand racing, the channel introduced racing replay, preview and review shows, and live racing and racing shows from Australia. The channel began broadcasting on [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview Satellite]] from 2 May 2007, on Freeview terrestrial on 14 April 2008, and in widescreen from 15 December 2008.&lt;ref name=pressrelease1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.tab.co.nz/content/pdf_form/How%20to%20get%20the%20best%20picture.pdf|title=How to get the best of Trackside in widescreen |accessdate=15 December 2008 |date=15 December 2008 |publisher=[[TAB TV|TAB]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, TAB introduced a second channel - TAB TV - to accommodate live racing from Hong Kong and Singapore. In October 2013 it changed the TVNZ metadata on the Freeview satellite service to unlock access to Trackside TV, keeping TAB TV as a pay-TV channel. On 14 April 2014, it ceased operations on Freeview, becoming only available to Sky subscribers. In August 2014, Trackside TV and TAB TV were relaunched as TAB Trackside 1 and TAB Trackside 2, extending racing coverage from all codes and enabling up to 5000 additional races to be broadcast each year that were previously not scheduled.&lt;ref name=faq &gt;{{cite web|title=Trackside on Sky|url=http://www.tab.co.nz/information/ip/trackside-on-sky-faq.html|website=TAB|publisher=[[New Zealand Racing Board]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3715">'''Edward "Ted" Griffin''' is a former aquarium owner and entrepreneur, and was the first man to ever swim with a [[Killer Whale|killer whale (orca)]] in a public exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Frontline Online, "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/etc/summary.html Edward 'Ted' Griffin, The Life and Adventures of a Man Who Caught Killer Whales]"&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for capturing, performing with, and selling a number of orcas during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

He established and owned the [[Seattle Marine Aquarium]] on Pier 56 on the [[Elliott Bay]] waterfront in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], which opened in 1962 and was originally known as the Seattle Public Aquarium (not to be confused with the contemporary [[Seattle Aquarium]]).
In 1965 Griffin purchased the orca [[Namu (orca)|Namu]] after it was accidentally caught in a fishing net, and then displayed it and performed with it at his aquarium. Namu was only the third orca ever captured and was the first to perform and swim with a person for audiences. Namu survived just over one year in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]] and died in his pen on July 9, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;M. L.

Altogether, Griffin and his partner Don Goldsberry captured and sold about 30 orcas in and around [[Puget Sound]] between 1965 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolphinproject.org/orca-captivity-.html "Orca captivity"] at the dolphinproject.org&lt;/ref&gt; They charged buyers $20,000 to $25,000 per captured orca.&lt;ref&gt;Lacitis, Erik, ''[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971123&amp;slug=2573947 Remembering Namu: An Ex-Hunter Looks Back, No Regrets In His Wake]'', [[The Seattle Times]] 1997 November 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Their largest capture took place in August 1970, when they netted most of all three pods of the Southern Resident orca population.  When activists attempted to cut the nets, four animals drowned, included three calves.  Griffin and Goldsberry attempted to conceal the deaths by weighting and sinking the bodies, but months later the carcasses washed up.  This operation also resulted in the capture of the orca [[Lolita (orca)| Lolita]], who is currently kept in Miami and has been subject of petitions and legal actions to retire her to more natural life conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aldf.org/cases-campaigns/features/make-a-splash-free-lolita/ Make a Splash: Free Lolita!]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1972, in response to rising regulation, Griffin retired from orca capture and sold his portion of the Seattle Marine Aquarium to Goldsberry, who soon after sold it to Sea World.  

In 1982 Griffin published ''Namu, Quest for the Killer Whale'', a non-fiction account of his time with Namu and the transformation of public views of killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;Gryphon West Publishers (Seattle) {{ISBN|0-943482-00-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-943482-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television in Switzerland''' was [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|introduced in 1950]]. People who live in [[Switzerland]] and receive television services are required by law to pay a [[television licence]] fee, which is used to finance the public radio and television service [[SRG SSR]]. [[Licence fee]]-payers in all the [[Linguistic geography of Switzerland|linguistic regions of Switzerland]] all pay the same amount (462 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] for 2008, counting both radio and television licences)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakom.ch/themen/radio_tv/00630/01618/01667/index.html?lang=it UFCOM, Reception fees]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in return, are entitled under the law to services of equal quality.

== History ==
The history of television in Switzerland began in 1939 when the first test transmissions commenced. Regular transmissions started in [[1953 in television|1953]], at first only one hour a day for five days a week, and only in [[German language|German]]: transmissions in [[French language|French]] started in 1954 and in [[Italian language|Italian]] only in 1958.

[[Romansh language|Romansh]]-speaking Swiss had to wait until 1963 for the first programme in their language, a full decade after regular television transmission were initiated.  To this day, there is no dedicated Romansh-language channel; instead the German and Italian channels air a few hours of Romansh programming per day.  The 1960s also saw the arrival of [[television advertising]], in 1964, and of [[colour television]], in 1968.

[[Télévision suisse romande]] broadcast their first evening programme in [[colour television|colour]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=Allez&gt;{{fr}} Sonia Arnal, [http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/allezsavoir/cest-l%E2%80%99autre-la-vraie-revolution-de-1968-la-tv-couleur-debarque-en-suisse/ "C'est l'autre (la vraie ?) révolution de 1968 : la TV couleur débarque en Suisse"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012041941/http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/allezsavoir/cest-l%E2%80%99autre-la-vraie-revolution-de-1968-la-tv-couleur-debarque-en-suisse/ |date=12 October 2013 }}, ''[[Allez savoir !]]'', no. 42, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 1968 was also the first year where more than one million Swiss households had a television.&lt;ref name=Allez/&gt;

In 1984, the Swiss [[teletext]] service, [[SwissTXT]], was started. In 1993 a fourth [[SRG SSR]] channel was created, first named "S Plus" but later renamed [[Schweiz 4]] (Switzerland 4). However, this was short-lived: during its existence the channel constantly suffered low ratings and was hence shut down in 1997. In the same year, as a result, all the [[SRG SSR]] subsidiaries started a second channel, and [[SRF zwei]], [[RTS Deux]] and [[RSI La 2]] came into existence.

Analogue television was phased out starting July [[2006 in television|2006]], when [[Televisione svizzera di lingua italiana|TSI]] (now [[Radiotelevisione svizzera di lingua italiana|RSI]]) began the analogue switchoff. The process continued until January [[2008 in television|2008]], when the end of analogue broadcasting in [[Valais]] and [[Chablais]] completed the [[digital television transition]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=3768 Switzerland completes analogue switch-over]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, SRG SSR announced that it would discontinue over-the-air broadcasting in [[DVB-T]] in 2019, citing costs, rather than implement [[DVB-T2]]. The services will remain available via encrypted free-to-air satellite, which offers all SRG SSR channels in [[high-definition television|high definition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/09/06/switzerland-to-end-terrestrial-television/|title=Switzerland to end terrestrial television|date=2018-09-05|work=Broadband TV News|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cat in the Hat Comes Back''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by [[Dr. Seuss]] and published by [[Random House]] in 1958. The book is a sequel to ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]''.

== Plot ==
Once again, Sally and her brother are being left home alone for the day, but this time, their mother has left them with instructions to clear away a large amount of snow while she is out for the day. However, they are soon interrupted in their work by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat. Sally warns her brother not to talk to the Cat, because, he plays lots of bad tricks. Telling him not to let him come near. As they "remember what he did the last time he was there."

But the Cat lets himself into their house to get out of the snow, and when the brother follows him in, he finds the Cat eating a cake in the tub with the hot and cold water on. He glares at the Cat, turns off the water, and drains the tub only to find that a long pink ring has formed around the sides of the bath tub. The Cat offers to help, but his preliminary attempts to remove the pink spot fail as he only transfers the mess to a succession of other objects: their mother's white dress, the wall, their father's pair of $10 shoes, a rug, and their father's bed. Unsure of how to remove the stain from the bed, the Cat calls on the help of Little Cat A, who lives inside his hat, who lifts his hat to reveal Little Cat B, and then Little Cat C. The three Little Cats go to work, sending the stain to the television, then a pan, and finally outside.

Seeing the spot cover the snow, Little Cat C lifts his hat to reveal Little Cats D through G. The seven Little Cats wage war on the snow spots, shooting at pink snowballs with pop guns. This only spreads the spots more, so Little Cat G lifts his hat to reveal Little Cats H through V. All the cats work more, but the spot keeps spreading, until all the snow is pink, so Little Cat V takes off his hat to uncover Little Cats W, X, Y and the microscopic Little Cat Z. Z takes his hat off and unleashes a "Voom", which cleans up the spot, clears all the snow from the paths, and puts all of the Little Cats back into the Cat's hat. The Cat leaves, with the promise that he and the Little Cats, from A through Z, will return someday.

The book ends in a burst of flamboyant versification, with the full list of little cats arranged into a metrically perfect rhymed [[quatrain]], designed to teach the reader the alphabet.

==Adaptations==

After the [[The Cat in the Hat (film)|2003 film adaption of the original story]], it was planned to make a sequel based on ''The Cat in the Hat Comes Back''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,490238,00.html | title=The Deal Report | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=October 3, 2003 | accessdate=March 5, 2018 | author=Kirschilling, Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt; However due to negative reception, Theodore Geisel's widow, Audrey Geisel, decided to not allow any future live-action adaptions of her husband's works and the plans for the sequel were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/4362025|title=Seussentenial: 100 years of Dr. Seuss|work=MSNBC|date=February 26, 2004|access-date=March 5, 2018|quote="Geisel says she will never again allow Hollywood to portray Seuss characters in live action."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on 28 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kit |first= Borys|date=2013-12-23|title= 'The Raid 2' Gets a Release Date |work=The Hollywood Reporter|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/raid-2-gets-a-release-667515|accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://twitter.com/ghuwevans/status/330971104158044160|title=Twitter: Killers - October / The Raid 2: Berandal - sometime next year still undecided. @ghuwevans|format=Twitter|date=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=release&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=111048|title=Sony Pictures Classics and Stage 6 Film to Release The Raid 2 Domestically|publisher=ComingSoon.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400–700 words. As of 2018-07-13 the plot section is 798 words--&gt;

Two hours after the events of the first film, Jakarta crime boss Bejo executes Rama's brother Andi who took over from Tama, a gang boss operating under Bangun. Rama meets  Lt. Bunawar, head of an internal investigation unit. He sends Bowo for treatment but has Lt. Wahyu executed. Bunawar assures Rama it was to protect him from crooked cops like Wahyu, saying courts cannot fix the problem. Testifying would only endanger him and his family. He asks him to go undercover to expose Reza's and other police officials' dealings with the Bangun and Goto crime syndicates. Rama agrees after Bejo murders Andi.
Bunawar tasks him to infiltrate the underworld, befriending Bangun's son Uco. Using the alias "Yuda", Rama is told to assault the politician's son responsible for putting Uco in prison. Bunawar can arrest him and befriend Uco. In a riot a year into Uco's prison term, several assailants attempt to kill him. They are led by Benny who betrays Uco's trust before Yuda saves him. When Yuda is released two years later, Uco takes him to meet his father, who hires him out of gratitude. He proves his value to the family through his work under Uco and his father's consigliere Eka.

Uco is frustrated with his limited role in the organization and is furious when a bar girl calls him a "debt collector". When he leaves the room, Rama plants a bug in his wallet. Bangun meets the hitman Prakoso, who assassinates another of Bangun's targets.

Bejo invites Uco to dinner and tells him he has his eye on Gotos' controlled land. He shares rumors of a plot to turn Reza and others against his father. Bejo brings the assailants from the prison riot. Uco kills them. He notices a gang tattoo on Benny's wrist. They hatch a plot to start a gang war to disrupt the truce between the two families. Uco can prove himself to Bangun; Bejo can profit from carving up Hideaki Goto's territory. Uco lures Prakoso into an ambush. Prakoso is killed by The Assassin. Uco lies to his father saying the Japanese were responsible. Bangun will not counterattack. Frustrated, Uco phones Bejo saying "Just do it." Bejo's hitmen – Hammer Girl, Baseball Bat Man, and The Assassin – kill several of Goto's men, sparking a gang war between the families.

Rama is attacked during the conflict. He defeats the assailants and discovers a police ID on one of the attackers. When the families meet to reconcile, Uco lashes out in anger, embarrassing Bangun into conceding territory. Rama learns from Lt. Bunawar the attackers were Reza's corrupt cops sent after him. He receives a call from Eka to save Uco. Bangun beats Uco when they return to his office. While Yuda is on the way, Bejo and The Assassin barge in with a mob of henchmen. Revealing his betrayal, Uco kills his father and shoots Eka. Before Bejo can finish him off, Yuda arrives and Eka flees. The Assassin subdues Rama. Bejo commands his men to get rid of him. Eka follows. In a car chase several vehicles are destroyed before Yuda is rescued and driven to safety. Ryuichi informs Goto and Keichi that Reza was seen entering Bejo's restaurant. Goto tells Ryuichi to "take care of him". Ryuichi tells him Bejo is not alone. He informs him of Uco's betrayal of his father. Goto declares war against Bejo, Uco, and Reza. When his son Keichi interjects, Goto responds, "They're not cops anymore. They're in my world now." A bleeding and exhausted Eka tells Rama he knows he was also undercover. Rama calls Lt. Bunawar, who informs him the gang war escalated. The police commissioner was shot dead. Bunawar claims Eka "went rogue" and ten honest cops died. He informs him that Reza, the true objective, is meeting Bejo and Uco at the restaurant. Rama breaches its warehouse and fights through Bejo's men.

Bejo and Uco meet Reza to discuss terms against Goto. Still shaken from his act of patricide, Uco discovers the bug in his wallet. Uncertain who planted it, he notices Bejo has the same  tattoo as Benny, suggesting the prison attack may have been another attempt to spark a gang war. Uco sits in shock realizing he has been used. Rama defeats Bejo's three hitmen and disrupts the meeting carrying The Assassin's pair of karambit. Bejo attempts to shoot him. Uco grabs another gun and shoots Reza dead. He shoots Bejo, before turning his gun towards Rama who throws the karambit at Uco then stabs him. Uco dies in his arms. Rama limps from the premises and encounters Keichi, Ryuichi and their men sent to attack the meeting. While Lt. Bunawar drives to the site, Keichi smirks as he shares a silent dialogue with Rama. Rama is heard saying, "No...I'm done."

==Production==
===Development===
Following ''[[Merantau]]'', director [[Gareth Evans (director)|Gareth Evans]] and his producers began to work on a project called ''Berandal'' (which is Indonesian for "thugs"), a large-scale prison gang film intended to star not only ''Merantau'' actors Iko Uwais and [[Yayan Ruhian]], but also an additional pair of international fight stars. A teaser trailer was shot, but the project proved to be more complex and time consuming than they had anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |last=Brown |first=Todd |url=http://twitchfilm.com/news/2010/11/the-merantau-team-prepare-for-the-raid.php |title=The MERANTAU Team Prepare For THE RAID |publisher=[[Twitch Film]] |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909033951/http://twitchfilm.com/news/2010/11/the-merantau-team-prepare-for-the-raid.php |archivedate=9 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year and a half, Evans and the producers found themselves with insufficient funds to produce ''Berandal'', so they changed to a simpler, but different story with a smaller budget. They called the project ''Serbuan Maut'' (''The Raid''), which led to the creation of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |last=Evans|first=Gareth |url=http://theraid-movie.blogspot.com/2011/02/introduction.html |title=The Raid: An Introduction |publisher=Theraid-movie.blogspot.com |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While developing ''The Raid'' in script form, Evans considered the idea of creating a link between it and the initial project, ''Berandal''. Following the release of ''The Raid'', it was later confirmed that ''Berandal'' would serve as a sequel to ''The Raid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|authorlink=Gareth Evans (director) |last=Evans|first=Gareth|url=http://theraid-movie.blogspot.com/2011/03/camera-testing-press-conference.html |title=The Raid: Camera testing, the press conference, Berandal and sometimes this happens |publisher=Theraid-movie.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-05 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://screenrant.com/raid-redemption-sequel-berandal-gareth-evans-kofi-158935/ |title=‘The Raid: Redemption’ Director Talks Sequel Film, ‘Berandal’ |publisher=Screen Rant |date=2012-03-12 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans also said that he wanted to include car chases in the sequel, as well as a third ''Raid'' film being "a lot further down the line."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/gareth-evans-spills-details-on-the-raid-sequel-berandal-has-trilogy-in-mind |title=Gareth Evans Spills Details On 'The Raid' Sequel 'Berandal'; Has Trilogy In Mind &amp;#124; The Playlist |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the title for the North American market announced as ''The Raid 2'', the sequel has a "significantly larger" budget than its predecessor, and its production schedule took approximately 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |last=Gilchrist|first=Todd |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/gareth-evans-berendal-raid-sequel-iko-uwais-286827 |title=Gareth Evans Set for 'The Raid' Sequel 'Berendal' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2012-03-12 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-production began in September 2012 with filming in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-raid-director-gareth-evans-discusses-sequel-plans/ |title=‘The Raid’ Director Gareth Evans Discusses His Sequel Plans &amp;#124; /Film |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=2012-03-12 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ford|first=Rory|date=2012-02-17|title= Interview: Gareth Evans brings The Raid to GFF 2012|publisher=List.co.uk|url= http://film.list.co.uk/article/40465-interview-gareth-evans-brings-the-raid-to-gff-2012/|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Raid 2'' has received positive reviews. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 80% approval rating, with an average score of 7.4/10, based on reviews from 165 critics. The site's consensus states: "Although its high-energy plot and over-the-top violence may play better with genre aficionados, ''The Raid 2'' definitely delivers more of everything audiences loved about its predecessor."&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_raid_2/ |title=The Raid 2 (2014)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a score of 71/100 on [[Metacritic]], indicating "generally favorable reviews", based on 33 critics.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-raid-2 |title=The Raid 2|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its world premiere at [[2014 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]], ''The Raid 2'' received an overwhelming reaction. Mark Olsen of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that "The screening caused an explosion of excitement and enthusiasm for the film on social media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/sundance-film-festival/la-et-mn-sundance-2014-the-raid-2-movie-sundance-festival-trailer-20140122-story.html|title = Sundance 2014: 'The Raid 2' hits festival hard; trailer released |last= Olsen|first = Mark|date = 22 January 2014|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate = 21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3-out-of-5 mixed review, Joey Magidson of the website ''[[Awards Circuit]]'' wrote that he "appreciate(s) the directing skills on display in ''The Raid 2'', but at a certain point, all of the fighting and killing nearly got to be too much for me. I’m recommending the film, but not in the same way as the last one."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citeweb|url = http://www.awardscircuit.com/2014/03/26/raid-2-%E2%98%85%E2%98%85%E2%98%85/|title = The Raid 2 (★★★)|date = 26 March 2014|accessdate = 21 December 2014|website = Awards Circuit|publisher =  |last= Magidson|first = Joey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that while it is "creative enough to be worth a recommendation, it lacks the originality of the first flick" and concluded that "''The Raid 2 ''will delight genre fans, but might not impress to many others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "''The Raid 2'' will make you feel like Christmas came nine months early. Some action sequels don't know when to say when. But here's one where too much is just the right amount."&lt;ref name="EW rev"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20800407,00.html |title=The Raid 2 Review|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|date=14 April 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Abrams of ''[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]]'' praised the film for its "involving plot"; calling the cast, especially Uwais, "charming" and dialogue "winningly precise" while noting that the sequel is "a great step up after the already-impressive ''[[The Raid (2011 film)|The Raid]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url = http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/sundance-report-the-trip-to-italy-and-the-raid-2|title = Sundance Report: The Trip to Italy and The Raid 2|date = 24 January 2014|accessdate = 21 December 2014|website = RogerEbert.com|publisher =  |last= Abrams|first = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a positive review, remarking, "Evans gives the audience a knowing wink by having Rama endure repeated batterings that would leave mere mortals in traction, not to mention some nasty blade wounds. Yet he keeps coming back, finding the stamina to snap more limbs and crush more skulls. Taking place inside moving vehicles, a subway car, a noodle bar, warehouses, a porn factory, tight corridors and in the most electrifying mano-a-mano clash, a gleaming nightclub kitchen and wine cellar, the fights are dynamite."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/raid-2-sundance-review-673197 |title=The Raid 2 Sundance Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' chief critic [[Peter Travers]] wrote, "''The Raid 2'' lets its warriors rip for two and a half thrilling hours. With the precision of dance and the punch of a K.O. champion, Evans keeps the action coming like nobody's business."&lt;ref name="RS rev"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-raid-2-20140327 |title=The Raid 2 Review|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|author=[[Peter Travers|Travers, Peter]]|date=27 March 2014|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have praised the film for matching the action sequences that made the first film so great, as well as improving upon the plot and the dialogue, which its predecessor was criticized for.

Amber Wilkinson of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commented, "Hyper-violent it may be but there is beauty in its brutality," and wrote, "To say a martial arts movie brings something fresh in terms of choreography may sound like fighting talk, but Gareth Evans's sequel to his 2011 film is endlessly inventive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |last=Wilkinson |first=Amber |date=23 January 2014 |title=Sundance 2014, The Raid 2: Berandal, review |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10591571/Sundance-2014-The-Raid-2-Berandal-review.html |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |location=London |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Risley of ''[[Total Film]]'' gave the film 5 stars and wrote: "Sumptuously shot, perfectly paced and flat-out exhilarating, ''The Raid 2'' cements Evans as the best action director working today and may not be the best action, gangster, or even martial-arts movie ever made. But as a combination of all three, it's unparalleled in recent memory and offers a tantalising glimpse into a post-Bayhem action-movie world. Brutal, beautiful and brilliant" and also wrote, "The sheer imagination on show, both in the cinematography and choreography, guarantees each brawl is instantly iconic. Immaculately edited, each traumatic, tensely tactile fight would blur into chaos if not for Evans's pinpoint pacing something that refreshes all the more in the face of modern blockbusting's tendency to start big and just keep getting bigger, until burnout."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |last=Risley |first=Matt |date=6 March 2014 |title=The Raid 2 |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/the-raid-2 |publisher=[[Total Film]] |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible sequel ==
On 6 January 2014, media outlets quoted director Gareth Evans stating that ''The Raid 3'' will take place two hours before the end of ''The Raid 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.totalfilm.com/news/gareth-evans-teases-the-raid-3 |title=Gareth Evans teases The Raid 3|publisher=[[Total Film]]|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Director Gareth Evans Says 'The Raid 3' Starts 2 Hours Before 'The Raid 2' Ends|publisher=''[[IndieWire]]''|date=2014-01-06|url= http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/director-gareth-evans-says-the-raid-3-starts-2-hours-before-the-raid-2-ends-20140106|accessdate=23 April 2014|first=Kevin |last=Jagernauth}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April, during an interview with ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'', director Evans said that he is planning to take a break from martial arts movies for two or three years before filming it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Raid 3 will be a prequel to The Raid 2, says director Gareth Evans |date=2014-04-19|url= http://metro.co.uk/2014/04/19/the-raid-3-will-be-a-prequel-to-the-raid-2-says-director-gareth-evans-4703446/ |publisher=''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' |accessdate=23 April 2014|first=Sarah |last=Deen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Raid 3 details teased by Gareth Evans, director says a Raid 2 scene ‘sets off a chain of events’ |date=2014-04-02|url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/raid-3-gareth-evans-says-3341295 |publisher=''[[Daily Mirror]]'' |accessdate=23 April 2014|first=Danny |last=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Raid 3'' was planned for a 2018 or 2019 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Raid 3 |publisher=Bloody Disgusting|date=2014-04-02|url= http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3328934/dont-expect-third-raid-anytime-soon/|accessdate=23 April 2014|first=Danny |last=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a 21 November 2016 interview with ''Impact Online'', director Evans revealed the sequel was on hold with the franchise likely having ended, stating "Moving back to UK felt like a closing chapter on that franchise—we ended the story pretty neatly (I feel) in Part 2. I'm aware there's an interest for it {{small|[...]}} So never say never, but it's unlikely to happen anytime soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.impactonline.co/film/12859-gareth-evans-apostle/ |title=Gareth Evans sings the praises of ‘Apostle’ |publisher=''[[Impact (action entertainment magazine)|Impact]]''|date=21 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122183224/http://www.impactonline.co/film/12859-gareth-evans-apostle/ |archivedate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Walking Dead: Torn Apart''''' is a six-part [[web series]] based on the television series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]''. It aired in its entirety on October 3, 2011, on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s official website.

The web series tells the origin story of Hannah, also known as "Bicycle Girl", the walker whom [[Rick Grimes]] killed in the [[Days Gone Bye (The Walking Dead)|first episode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/09/27/amc-launches-the-walking-dead-webisodes-on-monday-october-3-at-2-pm-801410/20110927amc01/|title=AMC Launches "The Walking Dead" Webisodes on Monday, October 3 at 2 PM|publisher=AMC|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick risks a walker encounter to go back and find Hannah before he sets out for Atlanta. After telling her he is "sorry this happened to you," Rick shoots her in what is clearly a humanitarian gesture, which reveals much about Rick's own character and sets a tone for the rest of season one.

These webisodes were followed by a second set of webisodes, titled ''[[The Walking Dead: Cold Storage|Cold Storage]]'', which were released on October 1, 2012.

==Plot==
Hannah, a mother of two kids, awakens from a car crash to find her two children missing. She runs to her ex's house, and finds them there. Andrew, her ex, had previously shot and hid his walker wife, who comes back and almost kills the two kids before Hannah kills her. In a flashback, it is revealed that after going to his neighbor's house to scavenge supplies, Andrew was asked to shoot his living neighbor, Mike Palmer, who had been bitten. Mike also asked that he shoot his two children upstairs who have already turned, which he neglects to do. Later in a desperate attempt to flee with his family, Andrew tries to get the keys to Mike's truck, but is killed in the process by Mike's undead children he had failed to shoot. A helicopter hovering over the neighborhood announces to any survivors to make their way to the concession stand at the park, where they are evacuating refugees. Hannah and her children leave on foot in an attempt to get there, but Hannah is bitten along the way. After she is bitten, Hannah hands a pistol to her daughter and tells her and her brother to run to safety at the concession stand, and then she is devoured and torn in half by a horde of walkers. The last shot is of her waking up as a walker and then starting to pull herself along the ground.

The '''UniverSoul Circus''' is a single ring [[circus]], established in 1994 by Cedric Walker, an African American man who had a vision of creating a circus with a large percentage of people of color performing. He began searching for people from all around the world with incredible talents. The circus currently has performers from at least 24 different countries around the world. It is headquartered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

== History ==
The UniverSoul Circus was founded in 1994. The history section of the official website states that "We had the idea to present ... to a wide demographic of spectators."&lt;ref name="universoulaudiences"&gt;{{cite web| title=Official Homepage | url=http://www.universoulcircus.com/ | accessdate=April 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruiting, training and production began in 1993. The first performance took place in 1994 in the parking lot of Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. The first season of operations brought formidable debt upon the organization. By 1997 the circus tour grew to 10 cities, 19 cities in 1999, 31 cities in 2000, and 32 cities in 2005. A tour of South Africa, the first international destination, was completed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universoulcircus.com/company/135|title=The Story of the UniverSoul Circus|publisher=universoulcircus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UniverSoul Circus through some of its animal vendors have had many animal cruelty violations dating from 1997 to the present time. They have also had incidences of escaping animals.&lt;ref name="universoulviolations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circuses.com/pdfs/universoul_fact.pdf|title=UniverSoul Circus Factsheet|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.wabe.org/post/trial-date-set-universoul-circus-alleged-elephant-abuse&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Refrigerators''' (or '''WiR''') is a [[website]] created in 1999&lt;ref&gt;[[Simone, Gail]] (March 1999). [http://www.lby3.com/wir "Women in Refrigerators"]. LBY3. Retrieved August 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; by a group of [[feminist]] comic book fans that lists examples of the comic book [[Trope (literature)|trope]] whereby female characters are injured, raped, killed, or depowered (an event colloquially known as '''fridging''') as a [[plot device]], and seeks to analyze why these plot devices are allegedly used disproportionately on female characters.

==History==
[[File:WomaninRefrigerator.jpg|thumb|left|Panel from ''Green Lantern'' #54, the origin of the phrase]]
The term "Women in Refrigerators" was coined by writer [[Gail Simone]] as a name for the website in early 1999 during online discussions about comic books with friends. It refers to an incident in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #54 (1994), written by [[Ron Marz]], in which [[Kyle Rayner]], the title hero, comes home to his apartment to find that his girlfriend, [[Alexandra DeWitt]], had been killed by the villain [[Major Force]] and stuffed into a [[refrigerator]].&lt;ref&gt;Condon, Michael (October 2002). [http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing49/condonquiz.shtml "The Fanzig Challenge"]. Fanzing. Retrieved January 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;Prowse-Gany, Brian (August 12, 2015). [https://www.yahoo.com/katiecouric/rise-of-the-female-superhero-ever-since-superman-126459307033.html "Rise of the Female Superhero"]. [[Yahoo! News]].&lt;/ref&gt; Simone and her colleagues then developed a list of fictional female characters who had been "killed, maimed or depowered", in particular in ways that treated the female character as merely a device to move a male character's story arc forward, rather than as a fully developed character in her own right.&lt;ref name=Yahoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=WiRWomen&gt;Simone, Gail (March 1999). [http://www.lby3.com/wir/women.html "The List"]. lb3.com. Retrieved August 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The list was then circulated via the [[Internet]] over [[Usenet]], [[bulletin board system]]s, [[e-mail]] and [[electronic mailing list]]s. Simone also e-mailed many comic book creators directly for their responses to the list.

The list is infamous in certain comic book fan circles. Respondents often found different meanings to the list itself, though Simone maintained that her simple point had always been: "If you demolish most of the characters girls like, then girls won't read comics. That's it!"&lt;ref&gt;Simone, Gail (March 28, 1999). [http://www.lby3.com/wir/r-4_2899.html "Email as of 4/28/99"]. LBY3. Retrieved January 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Beau Yarbrough created the initial design and coding on the original site. Technology consultant John Bartol edited the content. Robert Harris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gayleague.com/members/profiles/displayProfile.php?id=181 |title=Who's Who: The Scarlet Rob |publisher=Gay League |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a librarian and comic-book fan, contributed to site maintenance and updates along with fan John Norris. The idea for placing the list online originated with software developer Jason Yu, who also served as the original site host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lby3.com/wir/index.html |title=Women in Refrigerators |publisher=lby3.com |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creator response===
Simone received numerous e-mail responses from comic book fans and professionals. Some responses were neutral and others were positive.&lt;ref name="reacts"&gt;Simone, Gail; Bartol, John (Editors). [http://www.lby3.com/wir/reacts.html "Fan Reactions"]. "Women in Refigerators". Retrieved August 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, arguments on the merits of the list were published on comic-book fan sites in early 1999.

Simone published many of the responses she received on the website.&lt;ref name="reacts"/&gt; 

Several comic book creators indicated that the list caused them to pause and think about the stories they were creating. Often these responses contained arguments for or against the use of death or injury of female characters as a plot device. A list of some responses from comic book professionals is included at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Simone, Gail; Harris Rob (Editors). [http://www.lby3.com/wir/creators.html "Responding Creators"]. Women in Refrigerators. LBY3. Retrieved August 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Marz's reply stated (in part) "To me the real difference is less male–female  than main character-supporting character. In most cases, main characters, "title" characters who support their own books, are male.&amp;nbsp;... the supporting characters are the ones who suffer the more permanent and shattering tragedies. And a lot of supporting characters are female."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lby3.com/wir/c-rmar.html "Ron Marz responds"]. Women in Refrigerators. LBY3. Retrieved August 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead Men Defrosting===
In response to fans who argued that male characters are also often killed, content editor John Bartol wrote "Dead Men Defrosting", an article arguing that when male heroes are killed or altered, they are more typically returned to their [[status quo]]. According to Bartol, after most female characters are altered they are "never allowed, as male heroes usually are, the chance to return to their original heroic states. And that's where we begin to see the difference."&lt;ref&gt;Bartol, John (March 1999). [http://www.lby3.com/wir/r-jbartol2.html "Dead Men Defrosting"]. Women in Refrigerators. LBY3. Retrieved August 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
===References in mass culture===
In 2000, several national newspapers ran articles that referenced the site, generating discussion on the topic of [[sexism]] in [[pop culture]] and the comic-book industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/letters-6400564 |title=Letters: Wonder women |date=May 25, 2000 |publisher=Dallas Observer |access-date=August 31, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000903133408/http:/www.dallasobserver.com/issues/2000-05-25/letters.html |archivedate=September 3, 2000 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities also list the content of Women in Refrigerators as related to analysis and critique of pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~amerstu/pop/comix.html |title=Popular Culture|publisher=[[Washington State University]]|date=|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://perrymoorestories.com/content/hero.asp?id=superheroes |last=Moore |first=Perry |title=Who cares about the death of a gay superhero anyway? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012225358/http://perrymoorestories.com/content/hero.asp?id=superheroes |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in Refrigerators Syndrome===
Women in Refrigerators Syndrome was coined in various forms via online discussions and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Voulieris |first=John |title=What Women Want |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/main/sites/default/files/soapbox/111344749759399..htm |accessdate=August 20, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312031345/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/soapbox/111344749759399.htm |archivedate=May 19, 2005 |website=comicsbulletin.com |quote=And then every now and then you get the girlfriend in the refrigerator syndrome and it probably turns potential female readers off.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term describes the use of the death or injury of a female comic book character as a plot device in a story starring a male comic book character. It is also used to note the depowerment or elimination of a female comic-book character. Cases of it deal with a gruesome injury or murder of a female character at the hands of a [[supervillain]], usually as a motivating personal tragedy for a male [[superhero]], to whom the victim is connected. The death or injury of the female character, then helps cement the hatred between the hero and the villain responsible. [[Kyle Rayner]] is a particularly cited example, due to the common tragedies that befall women in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Krause ||first=Melissa |title=Point/Counterpoint in the Blogosphere... |url=http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/07/06/pointcounterpoint-in-the-blogosphere-48/  |date=July 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013134235/http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/07/06/pointcounterpoint-in-the-blogosphere-48/ |archivedate=October 13, 2017 |website=Newsarama |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the site in his book ''Dangerous Curves: Action Heroes, Gender, Fetishism and Popular Culture'', [[Bowling Green State University]] professor Jeffrey A. Brown noted that while male comic book heroes have tended to die heroically and be magically brought back from the dead afterwards, female characters have been likelier to be casually but irreparably wounded or killed, often in a sexualized fashion. To support his claim, he cited the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] shattering the original [[Batgirl]]'s spine just for fun, resulting in her being restricted to a wheelchair for over a decade, and the villain [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] binding, torturing  and killing the first female [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] from [[DC Universe]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jeffrey A.|title=Dangerous curves: action heroines, gender, fetishism, and popular culture|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=160473714X|pages=175–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
