[[Image:stran.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Flier from the Good Housekeeping Stran-Steel Home tour]]
The '''Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition''' was part of the 1933 Chicago [[World's Fair]].  The Fair's theme that year was a [[Century of Progress]], and celebrated man's innovations in architecture, science, [[technology]] and transportation. The "Homes of Tomorrow" exhibition was one of the most noteworthy exhibits of the Fair, and showcased man's modern innovations in architecture, design, and building materials. 

In addition to several unique [[art deco]] and contemporary designs for a dozen model homes, futuristic home furnishings and accoutrements such as a personal [[helicopter]] pad were anticipated. Several architects and firms used the model homes to demonstrate their techniques for the [[pre-fabricated]] home and new materials.  Baked [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and Rostone — a man-made type of masonry that could be molded into specific shapes and produced in various colors — were hailed as affordable and durable home construction options. 

==Exhibits==
The following homes were showcased in the exhibit which ran the duration of the fair: 
*[[Wieboldt-Rostone House|Weiboldt-Rostone House]], Walter Schuler, Architect
*Good Housekeeping Stran-Steel House and Stran-Steel Garden Home, O'Dell &amp; [[Wirt C. Rowland]], Architects
*[[House of Tomorrow (Indiana)|House of Tomorrow]], [[George Fred Keck]], Architect
*[[Masonite]] House: Frazier &amp; Raftery, Architects
*[[Armco-Ferro House|Armco Ferro]] Enamel Frameless Steel House, Robert Smith, Jr. Architect
*House for Brick Manufacturers Association of America: Andrew N. Rebori, Architect
*[[Florida Tropical House]], Robert Law Weed, Architect
*American Forest Products &amp; Lumber Industries House: Ernest A. Grunsfeld, Jr. Architect
*General House, Inc., Howard T. Fisher, Architect
*Design for Living Home, John C.B. Moore and Horsley &amp; Wood, Architects
*[[Cypress Log Cabin]]
*Universal Houses' Country Home.

==Legacy==
After the exposition ended in 1934, Robert Bartlett purchased five of the homes, the Wieboldt-Rostone House, the House of Tomorrow, the Florida Tropical House, the Cypress Log Cabin, and the Armco-Ferro House, loaded them on barges and floated them across Lake Michigan to [[Beverly Shores]], [[Indiana]].  The original homes have survived the last 75 years on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] and are being restored through a partnership between the [[National Park Service]], Indiana, the [[Indiana Landmarks]], and private individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/indu/learn/historyculture/centuryofprogress.htm|title=1933 Chicago World's Fair Century of Progress Homes - Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; As visitors passed through the homes during the fair, many bought plans and erected the designs in other states.

[[File:Olentzero Hendaia 2006.JPG|thumb|[[Olentzero]], a Basque Christmas figure, wears abarkas.]]

The '''abarka''' (Basque), '''abarca''' or '''albarca''' (Spanish) is the traditional [[footwear]] in [[Pyrenees]].

This sandal made in one piece of calf [[leather]] is tied by braided wool laces around the socks.

Note however that in [[Cantabria]], ''abarca'' is used for a [[wooden shoe]].&lt;ref name="Etxebarria"&gt;''Vocabulario de Las Encartaciones, Cantabria, Las Merindades, Asturias, Palencia y León en las obras de José María de Pereda y Antonio de Trueba'', Txomin Etxebarria Mirones, 2004 {{ISBN|84-609-1811-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were supplanted by [[espadrille]]s and rubber [[Sandal (footwear)|sandal]]s for agricultural activities, but remain used for dance.

The Spanish name of the espadrille, ''alpargata'', is a derivative Mozarab ''al-párğa pl. al-parğāt'' of ''abarka''.

This depiction of the '''''Adoration of the Magi''''' is an [[altarpiece]] by [[Florence|Florentine]] sculptor [[Andrea della Robbia]] (1435–1525). Andrea inherited the family workshop from his famous uncle, [[Luca della Robbia]], who had developed the technique of applying tin glazes, similar to those used by potters, to terracotta (fired clay) to produce sculptures that were colourful, durable and relatively cheap. Larger sculptures, such as this example which dates to about 1500–1510, were made in sections in order to fit into the kiln for firing.

The scene is set in a landscape, showing the [[Three Kings]] with attendants, offering their gifts to the [[Holy Family]]. Andrea's sculpture was similar in style to contemporary painting, but certain colours, such as red, could not be produced in tin-glaze. The coat-of-arms of the [[House of Albizzi|Albizzi]], a prominent Florentine family, can be seen on the frame, and the relief was probably commissioned by them for a church not far from [[Florence]]. The shiny surface of the altarpiece would have reflected the candlelight in the chapel, bringing the image to life.

[[Image:Antikythera statue front.jpg|thumb|right| The Antikythera Youth or Ephebe]]
The '''Antikythera Ephebe''', officially named in English ''Antikythera Youth'' by the museum &lt;ref&gt;http://www.namuseum.gr/object-month/2012/jan/jan12-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;, is a bronze statue of a young man of languorous grace that was found in 1900 by [[Sponge#By_humans|sponge-divers]] in the area of the ancient [[Antikythera wreck| Antikythera shipwreck]] off the island of [[Antikythera]], [[Greece]]. It was the first of the series of Greek bronze sculptures that the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] yielded up in the twentieth century which have fundamentally altered the modern view of [[Ancient Greek sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Other well-known underwater bronze finds have been retrieved, generally from [[shipwreck]] sites: the [[Mahdia shipwreck]] off the coast of Tunisia, 1907; the ''[[Marathon Boy]]'' off the coast of Marathon, 1925; the standing ''[[Poseidon of Cape Artemision]]'' found off Cape Artemision in northern Euboea, 1926; the ''horse'' and ''Rider'' found off Cape Artemision, 1928 and 1937; the ''[[Getty Victorious Youth]] found off [[Fano]], Italy, in 1964; the [[Riace bronzes]], found in 1972; the [[Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo]], near Brindisi, 1992; and the ''[[Apoxyomenos]]'  recovered from the sea off the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Lošinj]] in 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck site, which is dated about 70–60 BC, also yielded the [[Antikythera Mechanism]], an astronomical calculating device, a characterful head of a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher, and a hoard of coins. The coins included a disproportionate quantity of [[Pergamon|Pergamene]] [[Cistophorus|cistophoric]] [[tetradrachm]]s and [[Ephesus|Ephesian]] coins, leading scholars to surmise that it had begun its journey on the [[Ionia|Ionian coast]], perhaps at Ephesus; none of its recovered cargo has been identified as from mainland Greece.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Svoronos 1911, Myers 1999, Dafas 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Ephebos|Ephebe]]'', which measures 1.96 meters &lt;ref&gt;http://www.namuseum.gr/object-month/2012/jan/jan12-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;, slightly over lifesize, was retrieved in numerous fragments. Its first restoration was revised in the 1950s, under the direction of Christos Karouzos, changing the focus of the eyes, the configuration of the abdomen, the connection between the torso and the right upper thigh and the position of the right arm; the re-restoration is universally considered a success.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;
[[Image:0027MAN Paris or Perseus2.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Antikythera Ephebe or Youth'']]
The ''Ephebe'' does not correspond to any familiar iconographic model, and there are no known copies of the type. He held a spherical object in his right hand,&lt;ref&gt;Minute fragments of bronze adhere to the fingers (Svoronos 1911, Myers 1999, Dafas 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly may have represented [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] presenting the [[Apple of Discord]] to [[Aphrodite]]; however, since Paris is consistently depicted cloaked and with the distinctive [[Phrygian cap]], other scholars have suggested a beardless, youthful [[Heracles]] with the [[Hesperides|Apple of the Hesperides]].&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt; It has also been suggested that the youth is a depiction of [[Perseus]] holding the head of the slain [[Gorgon]].&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt; It could also be the God [[Apollo]], a "Learned" [[Hermes]] holding a [[caduceus]] and declaiming, an athlete holding some sort of prize (a spherical [[lekythion]]), or a sphere, a wreathe, a phiale, or an apple. The statue could even be the funerary statue of a young man. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.namuseum.gr/object-month/2012/jan/jan12-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue, dated to about 340-330 BC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namuseum.gr/object-month/2012/jan/jan12-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;, is one of the most brilliant products of Peloponnesian bronze sculpture; the individuality and character it displays have encouraged speculation on its possible sculptor. It is, perhaps, the work of the famous sculptor [[Euphranor]], trained in the [[Polykleitos|Polyclitan]] tradition, who did make a sculpture of Paris, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;By Euphranor is an Alexander [Paris]. This work is specially admired, because the eye can detect in it at once the judge of the goddesses, the lover of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and yet the slayer of [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Natural Histories'', 34.77: ''Euphranoris Alexander Paris est in quo laudatur quod omnia simul intelliguntur, iudex dearum, amator Helenae et tamen Achillis interfector.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Antikythera Youth''  is conserved in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Inv. no. 13396.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Athanasius Kircher''', [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (sometimes erroneously spelled '''Kirchner'''; {{lang-la|Athanasius Kircherus}}, 2 May 1602 – 28 November 1680) was a [[German people|German]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[scholar]] and [[polymath]] who published around 40 major works, most notably in the fields of [[comparative religion]], [[geology]], and [[medicine]]. Kircher has been compared to fellow Jesuit [[Roger Boscovich]] and to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for his enormous range of interests, and has been honored with the title "Master of a Hundred Arts".&lt;ref name="Woods108"&gt;Woods, p 108&lt;/ref&gt; He taught for more than forty years at the [[Roman College]], where he set up a [[wunderkammer]]. A resurgence of interest in Kircher has occurred within the scholarly community in recent decades.

Kircher claimed to have deciphered the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] of the ancient [[Egyptian language]], but most of his assumptions and translations in this field were later found to be incorrect. He did, however, correctly establish the link between the ancient Egyptian and the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages, and some commentators regard him as the founder of [[Egyptology]]. Kircher was also fascinated with [[Sinology]] and wrote an encyclopedia of [[China]], in which he noted the early presence there of [[Nestorian Christians]] while also attempting to establish links with Egypt and Christianity.

Kircher's work in geology included studies of [[volcano]]es and [[fossil]]s. One of the first people to observe microbes through a [[microscope]], Kircher was ahead of his time in proposing that the [[Black Death|plague]] was caused by an infectious [[microorganism]] and in suggesting effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Kircher also displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions; inventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various [[automaton]]s and the first [[megaphone]]. The invention of the [[magic lantern]] is often misattributed to Kircher,&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Athanasius-Kircher |title=Athanasius Kircher |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=June 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he did conduct a study of the principles involved in his ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.

A scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the [[rationalism]] of [[René Descartes]] and others. In the late 20th century, however, the [[aesthetic]] qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One modern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as "a giant among seventeenth-century scholars", and "one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all knowledge as his domain".&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, p 68 &lt;!--quoted by Woods, p 109--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, Edward W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as "the last [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]". In ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' his 2012 book about Kircher, John Glassie writes that while "many of Kircher's actual ideas today seem wildly off-base, if not simply bizarre,"&lt;ref&gt;John Glassie: A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change. New York, Riverhead, 2012, p xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; he was "a champion of wonder, a man of awe-inspiring erudition and inventiveness," whose work was read "by the smartest minds of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Glassie, p xv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Kircher was born on 2 May in either 1601 or 1602 (he himself did not know) in [[Geisa]], [[Buchonia]], near [[Fulda]], currently [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. From his birthplace he took the epithets ''Bucho, Buchonius'' and ''Fuldensis'' which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Society.

The youngest of nine children, Kircher studied volcanoes owing to his passion for rocks and eruptions. He was taught [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] by a [[rabbi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Wo-w2sl6zEC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=Athanasius+Kircher+hebrew&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W68Jsjgbt7&amp;sig=0VaBQThyueA2L2ZZ4QSEJs0HGNE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wrAqVbSdNcPasASm44GICQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage|title=A Study of the Life and Works of Athanasius Kircher, ‘Germanus Incredibilis’: With a Selection of His Unpublished Correspondence and an Annotated Translation of His Autobiography.|last=Fletcher|first=John Edward|date=2011-08-25|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004207120|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to his studies at school. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at [[Paderborn]],&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Athanasius-Kircher |title=Athanasius Kircher |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=June 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but fled to [[Cologne]] in 1622 to escape advancing [[Protestant]] forces. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} On the journey, he narrowly escaped death after falling through the ice crossing the frozen [[Rhine]] — one of several occasions on which his life was endangered. Later, traveling to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], he was caught and nearly [[hanging|hanged]] by a party of Protestant soldiers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

From 1622 to 1624 Kircher was sent to begin his [[regency (Jesuit)|regency]] period in [[Koblenz]] as a teacher. This was followed by his assignment to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], where he taught [[mathematics]], Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Syriac]], and produced a show of [[firework]]s and moving scenery for the visiting [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[Archbishop of Mainz]], showing early evidence of his interest in [[mechanics|mechanical devices]]. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Catholic priest|priesthood]] in 1628&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; and became professor of [[ethics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Würzburg]], where he also taught Hebrew and Syriac. Beginning in 1628, he also began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.

In 1631, while still at [[Würzburg]], Kircher allegedly had a prophetic vision of bright light and armed men with horses in the city. Wurzburg was shortly afterwards attacked and captured, leading to Kircher being accorded respect for predicting the disaster via astrology, though Kircher himself privately insisted that he had not relied on that art.&lt;ref&gt;Newman &amp; Grafton, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; This was the year that Kircher published his first book (the ''Ars Magnesia'', reporting his research on [[magnetism]]), but having been caught up in the [[Thirty Years' War]] he was driven to the papal [[University of Avignon]] in [[France]]. In 1633 he was called to [[Vienna]] by the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] to succeed [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] as Mathematician to the [[Habsburg]] court. On the intervention of [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]], the order was rescinded, and he was sent instead to [[Rome]] to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already embarked for Vienna.

On the way, his ship was blown off course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed decision. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1634&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2011, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; he taught mathematics, [[physics]] and [[Oriental language]]s at the Collegio Romano (now the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]) for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied [[malaria]] and the [[Black Death|plague]], amassing a collection of [[Archaeology|antiquities]], which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the Museum Kircherianum.

In 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a [[Church (building)|church]] said to have been constructed by [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] on the site of [[Saint Eustace]]'s vision of [[Jesus Christ]] in a stag's horns. He raised money to pay for the church's reconstruction as the ''Santuario della Mentorella'', and his heart was buried in the church on his death.

Kircher published a large number of substantial books on a very wide variety of subjects, such as [[Egyptology]], [[geology]], and [[music theory]]. His [[Syncretism|syncretic]] approach disregarded the boundaries between disciplines which are now conventional: his ''Magnes'', for example, was ostensibly a discussion of [[magnetism]], but also explored other forms of attraction such as [[gravity]] and [[love]]. Perhaps Kircher's best-known work today is his ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652–54), a vast study of Egyptology and [[comparative religion]].&lt;ref name="Kircher, Athanasius 2008"&gt;"Kircher, Athanasius." Encyclopædia Britannica from ''Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite''. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

His books, written in [[Latin]], were widely circulated in the 17th century, and they contributed to the dissemination of scientific information to a broader circle of readers. Kircher is not now considered to have made any significant original contributions, although a number of discoveries and inventions (e.g., the [[magic lantern]]) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Kircher, Athanasius 2008"/&gt;

In his foreword to ''Ars Magna Sciendi Sive Combinatoria'' (The Great Art of Knowledge, or the Combinatorial Art), the inscription reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5mqDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;ots=sW_IReVdqd&amp;dq=Athanasius%20Kircher%20und%20seine%20erste%20Prager%20Korrespondenz&amp;pg=PA35#v=snippet&amp;q=Athanasius%20Kircher&amp;f=false|page=35|title=Unsolved!

[[File:Athanasius Kircher Koptisches Alphabet.jpg|thumb|The [[Coptic language|Coptic]] alphabet, from ''Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus''.]]
The [[Graffito of Esmet-Akhom|last known example]] of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphics]] dates from AD 394, after which all knowledge of hieroglyphics was lost.&lt;ref name="Frimmer37"&gt;Frimmer, p 37&lt;/ref&gt; Until [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]] found the key to hieroglyphics in the 19th century, the main authority was the 4th century Greek grammarian [[Horapollon]], whose chief contribution was the misconception that hieroglyphics were "picture writing" and that future translators should look for symbolic meaning in the pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Frimmer, pp 37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern study of hieroglyphics came with [[Piero Valeriano Bolzani]]'s ''Hieroglyphica'' (1556),&lt;ref name="Frimmer37"/&gt; and Kircher was the most famous of the "decipherers" between ancient and modern times and the most famous Egyptologist of his day.&lt;ref name="Frimmer38"&gt;Frimmer, p 38&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta'' (1643), Kircher called hieroglyphics "this language hitherto unknown in Europe, in which there are as many pictures as letters, as many riddles as sounds, in short as many mazes to be escaped from as mountains to be climbed".&lt;ref name="Frimmer38"/&gt; While some of his notions are long discredited, portions of his work have been valuable to later scholars, and Kircher helped pioneer Egyptology as a field of serious study.

Kircher's interest in Egyptology began in 1628 when he became intrigued by a collection of hieroglyphs in the library at [[Speyer]]. He learned [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in 1633 and published the first grammar of that language in 1636, the ''Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus''. Kircher then broke with Horapollon's interpretation of the language of the hieroglyphs with his ''Lingua aegyptiaca restituta''. Kircher argued that Coptic preserved the last development of [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]].&lt;ref name="Frimmer38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods109"&gt;Woods, p 109&lt;/ref&gt; For this Kircher has been considered the true "founder of Egyptology", because his work was conducted "before the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]] rendered Egyptian hieroglyphics comprehensible to scholars".&lt;ref name="Woods109"/&gt; He also recognized the relationship between [[hieratic]] and hieroglyphic scripts.

[[File:oed-aegyp.png|Oedipus Aegyptiacus|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to Kircher's ''Oedipus Ægyptiacus''; the [[Sphinx]], confronted by Kircher's learning, admits he has solved her [[riddle]].]]

Between 1650 and 1654, Kircher published four volumes of "translations" of hieroglyphs in the context of his Coptic studies.&lt;ref name="Frimmer38"/&gt; However, according to Steven Frimmer, "none of them even remotely fitted the original texts".&lt;ref name="Frimmer38"/&gt; In ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'', Kircher argued under the impression of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' that [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] was the language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]], that [[Hermes Trismegistus]] was [[Moses]], and that hieroglyphs were [[occult]] [[symbol]]s which "cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures." This led him to translate simple hieroglyphic texts now known to read as ''ḏd Wsr'' ("Osiris says") as "The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis"&lt;ref&gt;for such translations, see e.g. his ''Sphinx mystagoga'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Egyptologist Sir [[E. A. Wallis Budge]]:

{{quote|Many writers pretended to have found the key to the hieroglyphics, and many more professed, with a shameless impudence which is hard to understand in these days, to translate the contents of the texts into a modern tongue. Foremost among such pretenders must be mentioned Athanasius Kircher, who, in the 17th century, declared that he had found the key to the hieroglyphic inscriptions; the translations which he prints in his ''Oedipus Aegyptiacus'' are utter nonsense, but as they were put forth in a learned tongue many people at the time believed they were correct.&lt;ref name="Budge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics |last= Budge |first= E. A. Wallis |authorlink=E. A. Wallis Budge |year=1983 |origyear=1910 |publisher=Dover |location=Mineola, NY |isbn= |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmfvHfve6KYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Kircher's approach to deciphering texts was based on a fundamental misconception, some modern commentators have described Kircher as the pioneer of the serious study of hieroglyphs. The data which he collected were later consulted by [[Champollion]] in his successful efforts to decode the script. According to Joseph MacDonnell, it was "because of Kircher's work that scientists knew what to look for when interpreting the Rosetta stone".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonnell, p 12 &lt;!--quoted by Woods, p 109--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar of ancient Egypt, Erik Iversen, concluded:
{{Blockquote|It is therefore Kircher's incontestable merit that he was the first to have discovered the phonetic value of an Egyptian hieroglyph. From a humanistic as well as an intellectual point of view Egyptology may very well be proud of having Kircher as its founder.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, pp 97–98 &lt;!--quoted by Woods, p 109; via MacDonnell, p 12--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kircher was also actively involved in the erection of [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks in Roman squares]], often adding fantastic "hieroglyphs" of his design in the blank areas that are now puzzling to modern scholars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Rowland 2002 concluded that Kircher made use of Pythagorean principles to read hieroglyphs of the Pamphili Obelisk, and used the same form of interpretation when reading scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777122590|author=Ingrid D. Rowland|publisher=University of Chicago Library|year=2002|title=Athanasius Kircher and the Egyptian Oedipus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sinology====
[[File:Kircherchinamap.jpg|thumb|350px|Map of China, ''China Illustrata''.]]
{{see also|Jesuit China missions}}

Kircher had an early interest in [[China]], telling his superior in 1629 that he wished to become a [[missionary]] to that country. In 1667 he published a treatise whose full title was  ''China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis naturae &amp; artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata'', and which is commonly known simply as ''[[China Illustrata]]'', i.e. "China Illustrated". It was a work of encyclopedic breadth, combining material of unequal quality, from  accurate [[cartography]] to mythical elements, such as a study of [[dragon]]s. The work drew heavily on the reports of Jesuits working in China, in particular [[Michael Boym]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Hartmut |last=Walravens |url=http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |title=Michael Boym und die Flora Sinensis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152210/http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martino Martini]].

''China Illustrata'' emphasized the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: the book noted the early presence of [[Nestorian Christian]]s (with a Latin translation of the [[Nestorian Stele]] of [[Xi'an]] provided by Boym and his Chinese collaborator, Andrew Zheng),&lt;ref name=tuyl&gt;[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf ''China Illustrata''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818014556/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf |date=August 18, 2011 }}; Modern English translation and preface by Dr Charles D. Van Tuyl&lt;/ref&gt; but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], that [[Confucius]] was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the [[Chinese character]]s were abstracted hieroglyphs.

In Kircher's system, [[ideogram]]s were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the [[Maya civilization#Writing system|Maya]] and [[Aztec]]s were yet lower [[pictogram]]s which referred only to objects. [[Umberto Eco]] comments that this idea reflected and supported the ethnocentric European attitude toward Chinese and native American civilizations;

"China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father". (p.&amp;nbsp;69)

In 1675, he published ''Arca Noë'', the results of his research on the biblical [[Noah's Ark|Ark of Noah]] —  following the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorical interpretation]] was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to [[spontaneous generation|arise spontaneously]]), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.

====Other cultural work====
Kircher was sent the [[Voynich Manuscript]] in 1666 by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in the hope of Kircher being able to decipher it.&lt;ref name=nsa&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |author=Tiltman, John H. |date=Summer 1967 |title=The Voynich Manuscript: "The Most Mysterious Manuscript in the World" |volume=XII |number=3 |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |publisher=NSA Technical Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018025101/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |archivedate=October 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] annexed the [[Papal States]] in 1870, though scepticism as to the authenticity of the story and of the origin of the manuscript itself exists.  In his ''Polygraphia nova'' (1663), Kircher proposed an artificial [[universal language]].

===Physical sciences===
====Geology====
[[File:Kircherearthfires.jpg|thumb|250px|Kircher's model of the [[Earth]]'s internal fires, from ''Mundus Subterraneus''.]]

On a visit to [[southern Italy]] in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the [[Volcano|crater]] of [[Vesuvius]], then on the brink of eruption, to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the [[Strait of Messina]]. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his ''[[Mundus Subterraneus (book)|Mundus Subterraneus]]'' of 1664, in which he suggested that the [[tide]]s were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean [[ocean]].

Kircher was also puzzled by [[fossil]]s. He understood that fossils were the remains of animals. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Douglas (2005) Earth Time: Exploring the Deep Past from Victorian England to the Grand Canyon. Wiley, Chichester. {{ISBN|978-0-470-02221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations. He interpreted mountain ranges as the Earth's skeletal structures exposed by weathering.&lt;ref&gt;''The Earth'' – Richard Fortey, Harper Perennial 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis.gif|thumb|250px| Kircher's map of [[Atlantis]], oriented with south at the top, from ''Mundus Subterraneus''.]]

''Mundus Subterraneus'' includes several pages about the legendary island of [[Atlantis]] including a map with the Latin caption "Situs Insulae Atlantidis, a Mari olim absorpte ex mente Egyptiorum et Platonis descriptio." translating as "Site of the island of Atlantis, in the sea, from Egyptian sources and Plato's description."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of the lost island of Atlantis|url=https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/20754|work=raremaps.com|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biology====
In his book ''[[Arca Noë]]'', Kircher argued that after the Flood new species were transformed as they moved into different environments, for example, when a deer moved into a colder climate, it became a reindeer. Additionally, he held that many species were hybrids of other species, for example, armadillos from a combination of turtles and porcupines. He also advocated the theory of spontaneous generation.&lt;ref&gt;O Breidbach, MT Ghiselin (2006) Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) on Noah's Ark: Baroque "Intelligent Design" Theory, Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, Volume 57, No. 36, pp. 991–1002 &lt;{{cite web|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/scipubs/pdfs/v57/proccas_v57_n36.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009153435/http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/scipubs/pdfs/v57/proccas_v57_n36.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of such hypotheses, some historians have held that Kircher was a proto-evolutionist.&lt;ref&gt;Fairfield Osborn, Henry (1902) From the Greeks to Darwin: An Outline of the Development of the Evolution Idea. MacMillan: London, page 106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medicine====
[[File:Kircherears.jpg|thumb|right|The [[ear]]s of a human, cow, horse, dog, leopard, cat, rat, pig, sheep and goose illustrated in ''Musurgia Universalis''.]]

Kircher took a notably modern approach to the study of [[disease]]s, as early as 1646 using a [[microscope]] to investigate the [[blood]] of [[Black Death|plague]] victims. In his ''Scrutinium Pestis'' of 1658, he noted the presence of "little worms" or "[[animalcules]]" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by [[microorganism]]s. The conclusion was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were in fact [[red blood cell|red]] or [[white blood cell|white]] [[blood cell]]s and not the plague agent, [[Yersinia pestis]]. He also proposed [[hygiene|hygienic]] measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, [[quarantine]], burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing [[Orthodontic headgear#Facemask and reverse-pull headgear|facemasks]] to prevent the inhalation of [[Microorganism|germ]]s.

===Technology===
[[File:Kirchermagneticclock.jpg|thumb|250px|Kircher's magnetic clock.]]

In 1646, Kircher published ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'', on the subject of the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the [[magic lantern]] as developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and others. Kircher described the construction of a "catotrophic lamp" that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he made improvements over previous models, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher's rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.&lt;ref&gt;Musser, p 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of [[King Solomon]]). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical in origin.

Kircher also constructed a [[magnetism|magnetic]] clock, the mechanism of which he explained in his ''Magnes'' (1641). The device had originally been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. [[Linus of Liege]], and was described by an acquaintance of Line's in 1634. Kircher's patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock's motion supported the [[Copernican principle|Copernican]] cosmological model, the argument being that the magnetic sphere in the clock was caused to rotate by the magnetic force of the [[sun]].&lt;ref name="Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock"&gt;[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816044854/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html |date=August 16, 2010 }}, accessed 23 Apr 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Kircher's model disproved the hypothesis, showing that the motion could be produced by a [[water clock]] in the base of the device. Although Kircher wrote against the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican]] model in his ''Magnes'', supporting instead that of [[Tycho Brahe]], his later ''Itinerarium exstaticum'' (1656, revised 1671), presented several systems&amp;nbsp;— including the Copernican&amp;nbsp;— as distinct possibilities. The clock has been reconstructed by Caroline Bouguereau in collaboration with Michael John Gorman and is on display at the Green Library at Stanford University.&lt;ref name="Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock"/&gt;

The ''Musurgia Universalis'' (1650) sets out Kircher's views on [[music]]: he believed that the [[harmony]] of music reflected the proportions of the [[universe]]. The book includes plans for constructing water-powered [[automatic organ]]s, [[Musical notation|notations]] of [[bird vocalization|birdsong]] and diagrams of [[musical instrument]]s. One illustration shows the differences between the [[ear]]s of humans and other animals. In ''Phonurgia Nova'' (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places.

Other machines designed by Kircher include an [[aeolian harp]], [[automaton]]s such as a statue which spoke and listened via a [[speaking tube]], a [[perpetual motion machine]], and a [[Katzenklavier]] ("cat piano"). The last of these would have driven spikes into the tails of cats, which would yowl to specified [[Pitch (music)|pitches]], although Kircher is not known to have actually constructed the instrument.

In ''Phonurgia Nova'', literally new methods of sound production, Kircher examined acoustic phenomena. He explores the use of horns and cones in amplifying sound with architectural applications. He also examines the phenomena of echoes in rooms with domes of different shapes including the muffling effect of an elliptical dome from Heidelberg. In one section he also explores the therapeutic effects of music especially in [[tarantism]], a theme from southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1121/1.2992053|title=The 'Phonurgia Nova' of Athanasius Kircher: The Marvellous sound world of 17th century|pages=015002|series=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|year=2008|last1=Tronchin|first1=Lamberto|first2=I.|last2= Durvilli |first3= V.|last3= Tarabusi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorics===
Although Kircher's work was not mathematically based, he did develop various systems for generating and counting all combinations of a finite collection of objects (i.e., a finite [[Set theory|set]]), based on the previous work of [[Ramon Llull]]. His methods and diagrams are discussed in ''Ars Magna Sciendi, sive Combinatoria'', 1669. They include what may be the first recorded [[graph drawing|drawings]] of [[complete bipartite graph]]s, extending a similar technique used by Llull to visualize [[complete graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Two thousand years of combinatorics|first=Donald E.|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|pages=7–37|title=Combinatorics: Ancient and Modern|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|editor1-first=Robin|editor1-last=Wilson|editor2-first=John J.|editor2-last=Watkins}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Kircher also employed combinatorics in his [[Arca Musarithmica]], an [[aleatoric music]] composition device capable of producing millions of church hymns by combining randomly selected musical phrases.

==Legacy==
[[File:Turris Babel-Why the Tower Could Not Reach the Moon.jpg|thumb|''Turris Babel'': with typical eclecticism, Kircher illustrates the impossibility of the Tower of Babel having reached the moon, 1679]]

===Scholarly influence===
For most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of his world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was "the first scholar with a global reputation". His importance was twofold: to the results of his own [[experiment]]s and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' calls him a "one-man intellectual clearing house". His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. His near exact contemporary, the English philosopher-physician, [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–82) collected his books avidly while his eldest son Edward Browne in 1665 visited the Jesuit priest resident at Rome. Towards the end of Kircher's life however, his stock fell, as the [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as "more quacksalver than savant").

===Cultural legacy===
Kircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and [[postmodernism]].

As few of Kircher's works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their [[aesthetic]] qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian [[Anthony Grafton]] has said that "the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher's work [is] the setting for a [[Borges]] story that was never written", while [[Umberto Eco]] has written about Kircher in his novel ''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'', as well as in his non-fiction works ''[[The Search for the Perfect Language]]'' and ''[[Serendipities]]''. In ''Where Tigers Are At Home'', by [[Jean-Marie Blas de Roblès]], the protagonist works on a  translation of a bogus 17th century biography of  Kircher. The contemporary artist [[Cybèle Varela]] has paid tribute to Kircher in her exhibition ''Ad Sidera per Athanasius Kircher'', held in the [[Collegio Romano]], in the same place where the [[Museum Kircherianum]] was.

The [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] in [[Los Angeles]] has a hall dedicated to the life of Kircher. His ethnographic collection is in the [[Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography]] in Rome.

John Glassie's book, ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' traces connections between Kircher and figures such as [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. It also suggests influences on [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Franz Anton Mesmer]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].

In the end, Glassie writes, Kircher should be acknowledged “for his effort to know everything and to share everything he knew, for asking a thousand questions about the world around him, and for getting so many others to ask questions about his answers; for stimulating, as well as confounding and inadvertently amusing, so many minds; for having been a source of so many ideas—right, wrong, half-right, half-baked, ridiculous, beautiful, and all encompassing.”&lt;ref&gt;Glassie, p 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Kircher's life and research are central to the plot of [[James Rollins|James Rollin's]] 2015 novel ''The Bone Labyrinth''.

The '''Athens International Airport Archaeological Collection''' is a [[museum]] in the [[Athens International Airport]] in [[Spata]], [[Attica]], [[Greece]].

The collection was established in 2003 and houses many ancient artefacts which were uncovered during construction work at the site which was once a flourishing agricultural area in ancient times.

The museum was opened by Greek Culture Minister [[Evangelos Venizelos]] and Transport Minister [[Christos Verelis]] and at that time it had 172 pieces, notably [[amphora]]s, tools, engravings and bas-relief sculpture dating from the Neolithic to the Byzantine eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioltravel.co.za/article/view/3550645 |title=Athens airport opens archaeological museum |publisher=Ioltravel |date=July 1, 2003 |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630210736/http://www.ioltravel.co.za/article/view/3550645 |archivedate=June 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ballgamemarker.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ballcourt marker from Chinkultic.&lt;br&gt;In the [[National Museum of Anthropology]], [[Mexico City]]]]

'''Chinkultic''', sometimes ''Chincultic'', is a moderate-size archeological ruin in the state of [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], some 56&amp;nbsp;km from [[Comitán]], the nearest city.  It is part of the [[Lagunas de Montebello National Park]].

This [[pre-Columbian]] city belongs to the ancient [[Maya civilization]]. The city flourished in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Maya Classic Era]], from about the 3rd through the 9th century. Most of the sculptures were produced in the last 300 years of this era, with hieroglyphic inscriptions dating from 591 to 897.  Post-Classic-Era occupation of the site continued until the 13th century, after which it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="chiapas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitchiapas.com/chinkultic.html |title=Chinkultic |publisher=visitchiapas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has some step-pyramids and some 200 smaller buildings, most in undisturbed ruin. Chinkultic has carved stone [[Maya stelae|stelae]] depicting the site's rulers.  The site contains a court for playing the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], which a marker tells us was dedicated on 21 May 591.&lt;ref name="chiapas"/&gt;

The first published account of the site was made by Edward Seler in the late 19th century. A detailed description of the site was made by Enrique Juan Palacios in 1926.

The first [[archeology|archeological]] investigations of the site were conducted in 1966 under the direction of Stephan F. de Borhegyi of the Public Museum of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].

Starting in 1970, some further excavations and restorations of a few buildings was conducted by Mexican government archeologists, who also dredged some artifacts from the site's ''cenote'' or natural well known as ''[[Agua Azul]]'' ("Blue Water"). The cenote gives the site its [[Maya language]] name; ''Chinkultic'' meaning "stepped-cenote".

The site is open for tourism visits, although it is not one of the more commonly visited Maya sites.

The '''''Chronicle''''' (or '''''Chronicon''''' or ''Temporum liber'', ''The Book of Times'') was a [[universal chronicle]], one of [[Jerome]]'s earliest attempts at history. It was composed c. 380 in [[Constantinople]]; this is a translation into Latin of the chronological tables which compose the second part of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Eusebius]], with a supplement covering the period from 325 to 379. Despite numerous errors taken from Eusebius, and some of his own, Jerome produced a valuable work of [[universal history]], if only for the example which it gave to such later chroniclers as [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Victor of Tunnuna]] to continue his annals. In conformity with the ''Chronicon'' of Eusebius (early 4th century), Jerome dated Creation to 5201 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Andrew. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sKsC-txuJIEC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=_HcftVewNm&amp;sig=I9_s1OGRsuaE08Xm3sJfs4P-xjg ''The Penn Commentary on Piers Plowman''], p. 69. Vide ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/7224/Rick/chron4.htm Fourth Century] (see ''327 Eusebius of Caesarea''). [https://www.webcitation.org/5kmsUlMES Archived] 2009-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicle includes a chronology of the events of [[Greek mythology]], based on the work of [[Hellenistic]] scholars such as [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], and [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearse, Roger et al. (2005) ''The Chronicle of St. Jerome''. http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_00_eintro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While the earlier parts are obviously unhistorical, there may be scattered remnants of historical events of late [[Mycenean Greece]] from entries of the 12th century BC. (See the [[historicity of the Iliad|historicity of the ''Iliad'']]. Notably, Jerome's date for the capture of [[Troy]] of 1183 BC corresponds remarkably well with the destruction layer of [[Troy VII]]a, the main candidate for the historical inspiration of legendary Troy, dated to c. 1190 BC.) [[Homer]] himself is dated to 940 BC, while modern scholarship usually dates him after 800 BC.

{{Communism sidebar}} 
&lt;!-- Do not bold the first sentence. See [[MOS:BOLDTITLE]]. --&gt;[[Communism|Communist]] [[symbol]]ism represents a variety of themes, including [[revolution]], the [[proletariat]], [[peasantry]], [[agriculture]], or [[Proletarian internationalism|international solidarity]].

[[Communist state]]s, [[Communist party|parties]] and [[History of communism|movements]] use these symbols to advance and create solidarity within their cause. These symbols often appear in yellow and red. The [[flag of the Soviet Union]] incorporated a yellow-outlined red star and a yellow [[hammer and sickle]] on red. The flags of [[Flag of Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Flag of North Korea|North Korea]], [[flag of Angola|Angola]] and [[Flag of Mozambique|Mozambique]] would all incorporate similar symbolism under communist rule.

The [[hammer and sickle]] have become the pan-communist symbol, appearing on the flags of most communist parties around the world. However, the flag of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] includes a hammer representing industrial workers, a hoe representing agricultural workers and a brush (traditional writing-implement) representing the intelligentsia.

In [[Hungary]],&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Criminal Code 269 / B. §&amp;nbsp;1993.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Lithuania]], [[Bans on Communist symbols|communist symbols are banned]] and displays in public for non-educational use are considered a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raek.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2387:het-spook-van-het-communisme-waart-nog-steeds-door-europa&amp;catid=51:fascisme-tot-op-de-bodem&amp;Itemid=86|title=Het spook van het communisme waart nog steeds door Europa.|date=22 December 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2012|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic similarities ==
Although there isn't any direct attribution, a contemporaneous large empire within Europe was the [[Ottoman Empire]], which fashioned a [[Flags of the Ottoman Empire|flag]] with a red background, and a crescent with a five pointed star, as early as 1793 for Ottoman ships, and 1844 for all Ottoman flags, predating Karl Marx Communist associated works publishing by 4 years (1848).  The superficial resemblance of Ottoman flags to Communist state flags in color, simplicity, and symbolism are rather striking given the lack of relation of doctrine.

== Hammer and sickle ==
[[File:Hammer and sickle red on transparent.svg|left|100px]]
{{main|Hammer and sickle}}
The hammer stands for the [[industrial working class]] and the sickle represents the agricultural workers, therefore together they represent the unity of the two groups.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The hammer and sickle were first used during the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Russian Revolution]], but it did not become the official symbol of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] until 1924.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Since the Russian Revolution, the hammer and sickle have come to represent various [[Communist party|communist parties]] and [[communist state]]s.

== Red star ==
[[File:Red star.svg|left|80px]]
{{main|Red star}}
The five-pointed red star is a symbol of [[communism]] as well as broader [[socialism]] in general. The red star was a revolutionary symbol after the [[October Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War|following civil war]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} It was widely used by [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] resistance parties and underground organizations in Europe leading up to and during [[World War II]]. During the war, the red star was prominently used as a symbol of the [[Red Army|Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]] from the [[Soviet Union]], which liberated its country from the [[Wehrmacht|invading forces]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and went on to rid the rest of Eastern Europe from the fascist occupation forces, achieving absolute victory and ending the war at the [[Battle of Berlin]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Most states in the [[Eastern Bloc]] incorporated the red star into state symbols to signify their socialist nature.

While there is no known original allegory behind the red star beyond being a universal political symbol,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} in the [[Soviet Union]] the red star gained a more precise symbolism as representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and its position on the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|flag]] over the united hammer and sickle symbolised the party leading the Soviet working class in the building of communism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Today, the red star is used by many socialist and communist parties and organizations across the world.

== Red flag ==
[[File:Red_flag_II.svg|left|100px]]
{{main|Red flag (politics)}}
The red flag is often seen in combination with other communist symbols and party names. The flag is used at various communist and socialist rallies like [[May Day]], or used in a [[red bloc]]. The flag, being a symbol of [[socialism]] itself, is also commonly associated with non-communist variants of socialism.

The red flag has had multiple meanings in history, but it was first used as a flag of defiance.&lt;ref&gt;'''1602''' Dekker Satirom. ''Wks.'' 1873 I. 233 What, dost summon a parlie, my little Drumsticke? tis too late: thou seest my red flag is hung out. '''1666''' ''Lond. Gaz.'' No. 91/4 That the Red Flag was out, both Fleets in sight of each other, expecting every hour fit weather to Engage. ''Flags of the World'', [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/vxt-dvf3.html#flagofdefiance "Flag of Defiance"].&lt;/ref&gt; The red flag gained its modern association with communism in the [[Paris Commune|1871 French Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After the [[October Revolution]], the Soviet government adopted the red flag with a superimposed hammer and sickle as its national flag. Since the October Revolution, various socialist states and movements have used the red flag.

== Red and black flag ==
[[File:Anarchist_flag.svg|left|100px]]
{{See also|Anarchist symbolism#Bisected flag}}
The red and black flag has been a symbol of general communist movements, usually anarchist. The flag was used as the symbol of the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The black represents [[anarchism]] and the red represents [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQAppendix2 "Anarchist FAQ Appendix"].&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the flag spilled into [[Statism|statist]] leftist movements, these movements include the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] and the [[26th of July Movement]], where the flags colors are not divided diagonally, but horizontally. As in the case of the Sandinistas, they adopted the flag due to the movement's anarchist roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipres.org/Institucion/Actualidad/Articulo_74.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928201527/http://www.cipres.org/Institucion/Actualidad/Articulo_74.asp|archivedate=28 September 2007|title=El socialismo libertario de|publisher=Centro Para la Promoción, Investigación Rural y Social|language=Spanish|accessdate=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Internationale'' ==
{{main|The Internationale}}
{{listen|filename=Internationale orchestral arrangement.ogg|title=Orchestral arrangement|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
''The Internationale'' is an anthem of the [[Communism|Communist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt|title=The International|author=The Guardian, Australia|pages=first paragraph|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt&amp;|date=25 October 2009|archivedate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most universally recognized songs in the world and has been translated into nearly every spoken language. Its original [[French language|French]] refrain is ''C'est la lutte finale''/''Groupons-nous et demain''/''L'Internationale''/''Sera le genre humain'' ([[English language|English]]: This is the final struggle/Let's group together and tomorrow/The International/Will be the human race). It is often sung with a [[raised fist]] salute.

The song has been used by communists all over the world since it was composed in the 19th century and adopted as the official anthem of the [[Second International]]. It later became the anthem of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1918 and of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922. It was superseded as the Soviet Union anthem in 1944 with the adoption of the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]], which placed more emphasis on [[Socialist patriotism|patriotism]]. The song was also sung in defiance to Communist governments, such as in the [[German Democratic Republic]] in 1989 prior to [[German reunification|reunification]] as well as in the [[People's Republic of China]] during the [[Tienanmen Square protests of 1989|Tienanmen Square protests]] of the same year.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Plough (or Starry Plough) ==
[[File:Starry Plough flag (1914).svg|right|125px]]
{{main|Starry Plough (flag)}}
{{main|Plough flag}}
Although not an exclusively communist symbol, the Plough, or Starry Plough, is a symbol of Irish socialism. It may have the same roots as the original hammer and Plough that was replaced by the hammer and sickle in Soviet Russia.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The significance of the banner was that a free Workers Republic of Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars and the sword forged into the plough would mean the redundancy of war with the establishment of a socialist International. The flag depicts the [[Big Dipper]], part of the constellation of [[Ursa Major]] that is known as "The Plough" in Ireland and Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Plough is one of the most prominent features of the night sky over Ireland throughout the year. This was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the socialist workers' militia (the [[Irish Citizen Army]]) during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].

In China, the [[Plough flag]] ({{zh|s=犁头旗}}), a red flag with white or yellow plough, is widely used in the period of the [[Northern Expedition|First Revolutionary Civil War]] as the flag of the Chinese peasant associations, an organization led by the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_66ce329301014w42.html "002这是好的很 毛泽东发表《湖南农民运动考察报告》发表四十四周年"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.dfsc.com.cn/html/2014-08/13/content_13_2.htm "土地革命时期农民秋收暴动旗帜"].&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that [[Peng Pai]] ({{zh|s=彭湃}}) was the first user in 1923 at the peasants' association of [[Hailufeng Soviet|Hailufeng]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfxcw.gov.cn/9244.html "彭湃与陆丰农民运动"].&lt;/ref&gt; The Plough flag has many different versions and some are combined with the flag of Blue Sky, White Sun or Red Field;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaoguanmuseum.com/a/wenwujianshang/gemingwenwulei/2013/0524/71.html "广明龙农会会旗"].&lt;/ref&gt; other are different on the details of the plough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://360.mafengwo.cn/travels/info.php?id=3434115 "#消夏计划#石塘双峰寨——中国的意大利费拉拉式水"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cn.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-10/14/content_27064087.htm "【网络媒体走转改】湖北红安这条古街记录过革命时期的壮怀激烈，更见证了新中国的巨大变迁"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socialist heraldry ==
{{main|Socialist heraldry}}
[[File:State Emblem of the Soviet Union.svg|thumb|200px|Soviet leaders sought to distinguish their insignia from the emblems used by the Russian emperor and aristocracy as they replaced and omitted the traditional heraldic devices, substituting an emblem that did not conform to traditional European practices]]
Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of European heraldry in order to distance themselves from the [[Monarchy|monarchies]] that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs. Instead, they followed the pattern of the national emblems adopted in the late 1910s and early 1920s in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union.

Socialist heraldry, also called communist heraldry, is a colloquial name for the common design patterns of the [[national emblem]]s adopted by [[communist state]]s. Although commonly called [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]], most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional [[heraldry|heraldic]] sense, but the recognisable common patterns have led to the use of the unofficial term "socialist heraldry".

== Other communist symbols ==
While not necessarily communist in nature, the following graphic elements are often incorporated into the flags, seals and propaganda of communist countries and movements.
* [[Revolutionary song|Revolutionary music]] as well as [[Protest song|protest music]]. ''The Internationale'' falls under this category.
* [[Socialist realism]], an art style developed in the Soviet Union.
* [[Three Arrows]] pointing downward and to the left. The arrows represent industrial, agrarian, and intellectual workers. Usually superimposed over a Swastika to represent anti-Nazism.
* Crossed proletarian implements, including picks, hoes, scythes and in the case of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] a brush to represent the intelligentsia. The ubiquitous hammer and sickle also belong in this category.
* Rising sun, exemplified on the crests of the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], [[Emblem of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenistan]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[PASOK]].
* Cogwheels, exemplified on the emblems of [[Coat of arms of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Emblem of Angola|Angola]] and [[National Emblem of the People's Republic of China|China]].
* Wreaths of wheat, cotton, corn or other crops, present on the emblems of almost every historical Communist-ruled state.
* Cherries resemblance from the ''[[Le Temps des cerises]]'' exemplified in emblem of the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]].
* Rifle such as the [[AK-47]] on the [[flag of Mozambique]] and [[Mosin–Nagant]] on [[Albanian lek#Second lek|Albanian lek]].
* Red banners with yellow lettering, exemplified on the emblems of [[Emblem of Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Soviet Union]].
* Red or yellow stars, perhaps the most common communist symbol behind the hammer and sickle.
* Open books, exemplified on the state emblems of [[Emblem of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Emblem of Angola|Angola]] and [[Emblem of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]; and also on the party emblems of [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist parties of Russia]] and [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Ukraine]].
* Factories or industrial equipment, exemplified on the emblems of [[North Korea]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Democratic Kampuchea]], and [[Emblem of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]].
* Natural landscapes, exemplified on the emblems of [[Emblem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[Coat of arms of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finland]].
* Torches, exemplified on the emblem of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].
* Sword and shield, exemplified on the [[KGB|Soviet Committee for State Security]] emblem and the [[Mother Motherland, Kiev|Mother Motherland]].
* Cross and sickle, the symbols of the [[Christian communism]] and [[Christian socialism]]
* Portraits of various communist leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], etc.
**[[Che Guevara]]’s image,  in particular as it appears in ''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]'' (“Heroic Guerilla”), is a common symbol of the [[Cuban Revolution]],&lt;ref name=che&gt;“Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon”, by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} [[Guevarism]], and revolution in general.&lt;ref name=che/&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;ref&gt;“Communists, Capitalists still buy into Iconic Che Photo, Author says” by Brian Byrnes, ''[[CNN]]'', May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Arm and hammer]], exemplified in the logo of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]]

Notable examples of communist states that use no overtly communist imagery on their flags, emblems or other graphic representations are [[Cuba]] and the former [[Polish People's Republic]].

'''Conch''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|ŋ|k}},&lt;ref name=speaking/&gt; was originally a [[slang]] term for native [[Demographics of the Bahamas|Bahamians]] of European descent.&lt;ref name=Stetson&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Stetson|title=Grits &amp; Grunts: Folkloric Key West|year=2008|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=978-1-56164-419-3|pages=4, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of the name==
After the [[American Revolution]], many [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] migrated to the [[Bahamas]]. Some of the loyalists looked down on the original white Bahamians and called them "conchs",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Thelma|date=October 1961|title=The Loyalist Migration from East Florida to the Bahama Islands|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30145777|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=40|issue=2|page=140|pages=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly because shellfish was a prominent part of their diet.&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;Foster, Charles C. 1991. ''Conchtown USA'', with Folk songs &amp; tales collected by Veonica Huss. Boca Raton, Florida: Florida Atlantic University Press. {{ISBN|0-8130-1042-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other theories that have been proposed for the origin of the term are:
*The Bahamians told the [[United Kingdom|British]] authorities that they would "eat conch" before paying taxes levied by [[the Crown]].&lt;ref name=Foster/&gt;
*The adventurers from [[St. Augustine, Florida]] (then part of British [[East Florida]]) who recaptured [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] from the [[Spain|Spanish]] in 1782 hoisted a flag with a shell rampant on a field of canvas.&lt;ref name=Foster/&gt;
*The first regiment of militia in Nassau adopted a regimental flag with a gold conch shell on a blue field.&lt;ref name=petals&gt;{{cite book|last=Sunshine|first=Sylvia|title=Petals Plucked from Sunny Climes|year=1886|publisher=Southern Methodist Publishing House|location=Nashville, Tennessee|pages=318|url=https://archive.org/details/petalspluckedfro00brooiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Florida==

===Florida Keys===
[[Image:NSRW Turtles.png|thumb|right|250px|Old photo depicting Conchs in Key West, circa 1900]]
By extension, the term "Conch" has also been applied to the descendants of Bahamian immigrants in [[Florida]]. Bahamians began visiting the [[Florida Keys]] in the 18th{{nbsp}}century to catch turtles, cut timber, and salvage wrecks. During the 19th{{nbsp}}century and the first half of the 20th{{nbsp}}century, most of the permanent residents in the [[Florida Keys]] outside of [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and many in Key West, were Bahamian in origin. "Conch" was reported to be a term of "distinction" for Bahamians in Key West in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=petals/&gt;

The white Bahamians in the keys continued to be known as "conchs". A [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] produced ''Guide to Florida'' noted that both 'Conchs' and black Bahamians in Key West spoke with a "Cockney accent".&lt;ref name="Project2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Writers' Project|title=The WPA Guide to Florida: The Sunshine State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qk_pCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT168|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Trinity University Press|isbn=978-1-59534-208-9|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other residents of the Florida Keys, especially in Key West, began applying the term "Conch" to themselves, and it is now applied generally to all residents of Key West. See: [[Conch Republic]].&lt;ref name=Stetson&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Stetson|title=Grits &amp; Grunts: Folkloric Key West|year=2008|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=978-1-56164-419-3|pages=4, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Viele&gt;Viele, John. 1996. ''The Florida Keys: a History of the Pioneers''. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press, Inc. {{ISBN|1-56164-101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish between natives and non-natives, the terms "Salt Water Conch" (native) and "Fresh Water Conch" (non-native) have been used.&lt;ref name=speaking&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950122/01210034.htm  Speaking the Conch Lingo in Key West] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090310182210/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950122/01210034.htm |date=2009-03-10 }} URL retrieved June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomers become "Fresh Water Conchs" after seven years.&lt;ref name=Stetson/&gt;

===Elsewhere in Florida===
[[Riviera Beach, Florida]], was known as "Conchtown" in the first half of the 20th{{nbsp}}century because of the number of Bahamian immigrants who settled there. Unlike the situation in Key West and the rest of the Florida Keys, where being "Conch" became a matter of pride and community identification, "Conch" was used by outsiders (in particular the residents of [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]) in a pejorative manner to describe the Bahamian community in Riviera Beach. The usage there also carried the connotation that at least some of the "Conchs" were of mixed racial heritage. As a result, some of the Bahamians in Riviera Beach denied being "Conchs" when interviewed by the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) Florida Writers Project in the late 1930s. WPA worker Veronica Huss (with assistance from [[Stetson Kennedy]]) and photographer Charles Foster wrote a book on the Conchs and their culture entitled ''Conch Town,'' but the WPA chose not to publish it (Foster eventually published a version in 1991).&lt;ref name=Foster/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://myfloridahistory.org/webextras/webextras/10|title=Capturing the "Conch People" in Florida|last=|first=|date=|website=MyFloridaHistory.org|publisher=Florida Historical Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Bahamians also settled in [[Miami]], particularly in the [[Coconut Grove]] neighborhood, and in [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/travel-ideas/bahamian-american-culture-in-florida-3-conch-towns-to-see.html|title=3 Conch Towns Where Bahamian Culture Thrives|last=Farrell|first=Jodi Mailander|date=|website=Visit Florida|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eretz Nehederet''''' ({{lang-he|ארץ נהדרת}}; ''lit.'' A Wonderful Country) is a [[satirical]] [[Israel]]i [[television show]], which made its debut on November 7, 2003. It features satirical references to current affairs of the past week through parodies of the people involved, as well as the thoughts of recurring characters. The program's concept is inspired by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and others. The program is one of the most watched and influential shows on [[Israeli TV]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Flower |first=Kevin|title=Israeli TV show attacks taboos with humor|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/05/18/israel.humor/index.html?hpt=C1|publisher=CNN|date=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the longest-running scripted shows in Israeli television to date, running for 15 seasons as of 2017. Beginning with Season 15, the program is aired on [[Keshet 12]], in [[HDTV]].

It was first filmed in [[Tel Aviv]], and in later seasons, was filmed in the neighboring [[Herzliya]].

The show features a regular cast of comedians and actors, including [[Tal Friedman]], [[Eyal Kitzis]] (the [[Jon Stewart]]-type host), [[Alma Zak]], [[Orna Banai]] (6 first seasons), [[Shani Cohen]], [[Asi Cohen]], [[Eli Finish]], [[Mariano Edelman]], [[Yuval Semo]], [[Roey Bar-Natan]], [[Eran Zarachovitch]], [[Yaron Berlad]], [[Maor Cohen]] and [[Dov Navon]] (4 first seasons). During the third season, [[Asi Cohen]] started doing small roles on the show, and by the beginning of the fourth season (fall 2006), Cohen became a regular member.

''Eretz Nehederet'' won the Israeli Television Academy's "Best Entertainment Program" in 2004 and again in 2006, and attracts millions of viewers every season. In a May 2008 poll, web surfers selected all the Season 5 Eretz Nehederet actors from into the top 60 Israeli comedians list. The top 7 spots were all taken by Eretz Nehederet, as well as #9 and #20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3540281,00.html|title=Asi Cohen the Funniest in Israel, Again|publisher=[[Ynet]]|date=2008-05-07|accessdate=2008-05-08|author=Barne'a, Or|author2=Shiloni, Smadar|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Erez Nehederet produced a satire feature film called ''[[Zohi Sdom]]'' (''lit.'' This is [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]).

==Notable sketches==
[[File:Angry-birds-peace-treaty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Angry Birds Peace Treaty]] shot. A moment before the talks break badly.]]
*In May 2010, a sketch played off tensions between [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[American President]] [[Barack Obama]], with Netanyahu trying to smooth over differences as they meet in the [[White House]]. A series of accidents caused Netanyahu to set the American flag on fire, stomp on it, and then torch a copy of Obama's proposed Middle East peace plan.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

'''Figure–ground organization''' is a type of perceptual grouping which is a vital necessity for recognizing objects through vision. In [[Gestalt psychology]] it is known as identifying a ''figure'' from the back''ground''. For example, you see words on a printed paper as the "figure" and the white sheet as the "background".&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "Chapter 4: Sensation and Perception, Vision II: Recognizing What We Perceive." Psychology. ; Second Edition. N.p.: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 149-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The most famous example of figure–ground perception is probably the [[Rubin vase|faces–vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (1921) ''Visuell Wahrgenommene Figuren : Studien in psychologischer Analyse''. Kobenhaven: Gyldendalske boghandel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (2001). Figure and Ground. In Yantis, S.(Ed.), ''Visual Perception''. (pp. 225-229). Philadelphia, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; This drawing exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure–ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on shape perception. Notice in the faces/vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the two curvy edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outwards, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will then settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them. Functional brain imaging shows that when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region &lt;ref&gt;Schacter, L.D., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M. (2011). "Psychology (2nd ed.)." New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasson, U., Hendler, T., Ben Bashat, D., and Malach, R. (2001). Vase or face? A neural correlate of shape-selective grouping processes in the human brain. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 13, 744–753.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual process==
How does the brain decide in a visual scene which item is the figure and which are part of the ground? This perceptual decision can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the figure and the ground, since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground, because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue, because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's at times difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the figure and the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Evidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure–ground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account in order to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] figure–ground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|author2=Peterson, MA|title=A Bayesian observer replicates convexity context effects in figure–ground perception.|journal=Seeing and perceiving|year=2012|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=365–95|pmid=22564398|doi=10.1163/187847612X634445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=L|author2=Lee, L|title=Perceptual information processing system.|journal=USPatent Patent Application 10/618,543,|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic applications==
Figure–ground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure–ground reversal may be used as an intentional [[visual design]] technique in which an existing image's foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images.

==Non-visual==
Figure–ground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include abstract (i.e. non-visual) concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2016}} The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself.&lt;ref name="figure and ground"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R |title=Psychology the science of behaviour-figure and ground |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=USA |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of figure–ground problems==
[[File:Star-jeans.jpg|thumb|Type 2: The actual ground is the figure.]]
There are three types of figure–ground problems:
#The figure and the ground compete.
#The figure should be the ground and the ground should be the figure.
#The figure and ground create an [[optical illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohr L. Creating Graphics for Learning and Performance: Lessons in Visual Literacy Cleveland, OH: Prentice-Hall, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goshikizuka kofun02s3200.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|alt=|The round end of [[Goshikizuka Kofun]] in Kobe covered with restored ''fukiishi'']]

'''{{transl|ja|Fukiishi}}''' ({{lang|ja|葺石}} or {{lang|ja|葺き石}} "roofing stone") were a means of covering burial chambers and [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] during the [[kofun period]] of Japan ({{circa|250–538}}).  Stones collected from riverbeds were affixed to the slopes of raised [[kofun]] and other burial chambers.  They are considered to have descended from forms used in [[Yayoi period|Yayoi-period]] tumuli.  They are common in the early and mid-Kofun periods, but most late Kofun-period tumuli do not have them.

==Origin and ancestry==

[[File:Nishidani Graves 02.JPG|right|thumb|alt=|What are thought to be proto-fukiishi at Nishidani kofun No.&amp;nbsp;3 in [[Izumo, Shimane]] ]]

Tombs covered with fukiishi appear sporadically in Western Japan from the mid-[[Yayoi period]] and continue into the Kofun period.{{sfn|Ishino|1990|p=5}}  Fukiishi are thought to be one element of the characteristics of the period of kofun at the time that they were making their first appearance; what are thought of as the oldest examples of what was to lead the generally fixed form are seen at {{illm|Hashihaka kofun|ja|箸墓古墳}} and the presumed slightly older {{illm|Hokeno-yama kofun|ja|ホケノ山古墳}} in the city of [[Sakurai, Nara|Sakurai]] in [[Nara Prefecture]].{{sfn|Shiraishi|2002|p=49}}  Neither fukiishi nor [[haniwa]] accompany mounds from before regularization such as at the {{illm|Makimuku keyhole-shaped kofun group|ja|纒向型前方後円墳}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The ''{{transl|ja|hariishi}}'' ({{lang|ja|貼石}}) seen at the {{illm|Yosumi Tosshutsu funkyūbo|ja|四隅突出型墳丘墓}} ("four corner projections type grave mound") in the [[San'in region]] in Western Japan are often put forth as an ancestor of ''{{transl|ja|fukiishi}}''.  The perimeter of the foot of kofun No.&amp;nbsp;3 of {{illm|Nishidani kofungun|ja|西谷墳墓群}} in [[Izumo, Shimane|Izumo]] in [[Shimane Prefecture]] is completely covered with ''{{transl|ja|hariishi}}''.  The burial mound at the {{illm|Tatetsuki|ja|楯築遺跡}} archaeological site in the city of [[Sōja]] in [[Okayama Prefecture]] is surrounded with rows of stones; such examples are widely seen in the San'in and the nearby [[San'yō region]]s, where examples of burial mounds demarcated by stacks of [[stone wall]]s are also seen.{{sfn|Kondō|2001|p=141}}

==Terminology==

In his report on an excavation in 1915 on mound No.&amp;nbsp;21 of [[Saitobaru kofungun]] burial mound group in what is now the city of [[Saito, Miyazaki|Saito]] in [[Miyazaki Prefecture]], historian {{illm|Ryū Imanishi|ja|今西龍}} titled an entry ''{{transl|ja|hyōmen no fukiishi}}'' ("surface roofing stones"){{efn|{{lang|ja|表面の葺石}} ''{{transl|ja|hyōmen no fukiishi}}'' "surface roofing stones"}} in which he described the condition of the ''{{transl|ja|fukiishi}}'' in a ground plan and cross-section.{{sfn|Ishizuka|1992|p=60}}

The term ''{{transl|ja|fukiishi}}'' came into use as an archaeological term largely due to the influence of {{illm|Kenji Takahashi (archaeologist)|ja|高橋健自|lt=Kenji Takahashi's}} book ''{{transl|ja|Kofun to jōbunka}}'' (''"Kofun and ancient culture"'', 1922).{{efn|{{cite book

|trans-title  = Kofun and ancient culture
|script-title = ja:古墳と上代文化
|year         = 1922
|publisher    = Tokyo Kokushi Kōshūkai}} }}  Via examples of kofun in the [[Kinai]] capital region Takashi described the ''{{transl|ja|fukiishi}}'' there as serving both practical and decorative purposes: in practical terms the use of pebbles provided protection from the wind, rain, and cold, while the stones served to beautify the mound which was after all built above ground to attract public attention and to impress and rouse piety in visiting worshippers.{{sfn|Ishizuka|1992|p=60–61}}

==Research==

[[Image:Tsukinowa Kofun 01.JPG|thumb|alt=|{{illm|Tsukinowa kofun|ja|月の輪古墳}} in [[Misaki, Okayama|Misaki]], [[Okayama Prefecture]] ]]

[[Image:Jirobeeduka1goukofun-1.JPG|thumb|Jirobēzuka mound No.&amp;nbsp;1 in [[Kani, Gifu|Kani]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] is roofed with fukiishi made up of riverbed stones.]]

Excavation of fukiishi themselves was nearly nonexistent before World War&amp;nbsp;II.  It was only after the war that scientific examination, verification, and surveying of the stones took place.{{sfn|Aoki|2003|p=179}}

In 1953, {{illm|Yoshirō Kondō|ja|近藤義郎}} led a group of specialists, locals, and students in an excavation at the {{illm|Tsukinowa kofun|ja|月の輪古墳}} in [[Misaki, Okayama|Misaki]]{{efn|At the time named {{illm|Yūkason|ja|飯岡村 (岡山県)}} }} in Okayama.  The group surveyed three quarters of the kofun, with a height of 10&amp;nbsp;m and a diameter of 60&amp;nbsp;m.  The report published in 1960 gave the extent of distribution, shape and size, [[Petrology|petrological]] analysis, technical analysis of the roofing method, and minute illustration the configuration of the individual stones.  The report estimated the number of stones at about 80,000.{{sfn|Ishizuka|1992|p=61}}

In response to the rapid increase in the post-war period of large-scale development that led to in the destruction of historical ruins, urgent excavations were carried out with the goal of thorough examination rather than as the preservation of documentation.  As a result of this early research, Shōzō Haraguchi and {{illm|Tadashi Nishitani|ja|西谷正}} published a paper in 1967 on the excavation of tumulus C1 of the Bentenyama kofungun group in [[Takatsuki, Osaka|Takatsuki]] in Osaka.  The paper notes the results of investigation into the stacking methods, the weight and number of stones per unit area, the collection areas and transportation routes of the stones, and other details.{{sfn|Haraguchi|Nishitani|1967}}  {{illm|Tadashi Aoki|ja|青木敬}} stated that following this report hardly any other resulting from such an accumulation of verifiable details on fukiishi has appeared.{{sfn|Aoki|2003|p=179}}

Research into fukiishi has come to require knowledge related to construction technology.{{sfn|Ishizuka|1992|p=62}}  To enable the scientific qualification and quantification of research documentation, Hisanori Ishizuka has called for research on:{{sfn|Ishizuka|1992|pp=62–67}}

==Materials and construction methods==

The material for fukiishi was often made up of pebbles and stones from dry riverbeds.  In the case of pebbles, a variety of stones was used.  For example, the late-4th-century {{illm|Matsuokayama kofun|ja|松岳山古墳}} in [[Kashiwara, Osaka|Kashiwara]] in Osaka Prefecture was made with [[andesite]] flagstones in vertical or sloped piles.{{sfn|Ishino|1992|p={{page needed|date=November 2015}} }}  Other sites used [[chert]], [[sandstone]], [[slate]], [[basalt]], or other types of stone.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Embankments were often made with soil transported from other areas. [[Palynology|Pollen analysis]] of the fifth- and sixth-century kofuns of the [[Kuboizumi-Maruyama Historic Sites]] in [[Saga, Saga|Saga]] has shown clear disparities in the vegetation in the soil of the mound faces and that of the surrounding environment.  This example suggests that the [[borrow pit]]s for the construction of the mounds were in remote locations.{{sfn|Ishizuka|1992|p=67}}

=== Stone Building Methods ===

Among different methods of stone tomb construction, it was found that there are four different classifications of burial mound structures.
 
==== Type 1 ====

These buildings include a stacked stone wall with thick backfill and lack a base stone in the construction. The typical examples of burials in this style are Nakayama Otsuka Kofun (Nara Prefecture [[Tenri City]]), Hokeno Mountain Burial Mound (Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture), and in the rear section of the former Inari Tomaru, [[Kyoto]], these are the oldest structures still present in Yamato.

==== Type 2 ====
This construction method is characterized by the dual-staged stacking of the stone base. The basal stone is stacked horizontally and the subsequent masonry is stacked on top. These mounds tend to exhibit steep inclines of 30 degrees or more. Prime examples of this type of burial mound are found in Red Tsuchiyama Tumulus in the Tenri City of Nara Prefecture and Xizhiduka Mound and the Miwa Mountain Burial Mound 1 in [[Tsuyama]] City Okayama Prefecture.

==== Class 3-1 ====
"Stacking Stone" is the classification of this type of stone, the basement stones are overlapped with the main body of the structure. The Benten Mountain Mound (C1) in Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture is a representative example of this style of mound building.
 
==== Class 3-2 ====
This type of burial mound does not stack stone layers over the foundation. Instead, the stones are embedded in the soil in a method referred to as "pasting stones".

==== Class 3-3 ====
Construction technology changes as current methods fuse with local methods. Examples of this can be found in [[Kashiwabara City]] at Mt Tama 1 and Tama 7 (Tamane Mountain Burial Mounds).

==== Class 4 ====
This method of construction follows the "paste stone" method in Class 3-2. Mounds generally displays shallow inclines of 20-25 degrees. The mounds consist mostly of small stones with gravel filled gaps; which is generally found in the Saki Gouzanyama Kofun (Saki Gouran Mountain Burial Mound) in Nara City, Nara Prefecture.

==Purpose and function==

The purpose of ''{{transl|ja|fukiishi}}'' is seen, as in Kenji Takahashi's account of 1922, to protect the burial mound while projecting its majesty.{{sfn|Ōtsuka|Kobayashi|1982|p=345}}  As they were used primarily on slopes and rarely on flat surfaces it is also thought they may have served to prevent runoff, and may have contributed to waterproofing and drainage.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  They may also have been used to imply the mound was sacred, holy ground and clearly differentiate it from adjacent areas.{{sfn|Kondō|2001|p=141}}  Archaeologist {{illm|Kazuo Hirose|ja|広瀬和雄}} notes the use of ''{{transl|ja|fukiishi}}'' may be related to a desire to make royalty visible and exhibit the people's connection with royalty, a feature he sees as characteristic of Japanese burial mounds in comparison with those of other Asian countries, and in particular in the case of keyhole-shaped kofun.{{sfn|Hirose|2003|pp=134, 179–180}}

==Demise==

[[File:Musashi Fuchū Kumano Jinja kofun 1.jpg|thumb|alt=|Restored kofun at [[Kumano shrine]] in [[Fuchū, Tokyo|Fuchū]] in Tokyo]]

The scale of kofun construction peaked in the middle of the Kofun period in the mid-5th century, reflecting the power and influence of the political structure and the social status of the entombed via the form and scale of the tumuli.  Towards the close of the 5th century, the construction of large keyhole-shaped kofun and groups of layered kofun waned.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

At the beginning of the 6th century, the scale of most keyhole-shaped kofun west from the Kantō region became smaller, the smaller {{illm|Baichō|ja|陪塚}} ("satellite") tumuli began to disappear, and fukiishi began to be used infrequently.  Three-tiered kofun saw a strong decrease in favour of two-tiered ones.  Outside of the Kantō region, [[haniwa]] stopped being used.{{sfn|Hirose|2003|pp=32–33}}  From the end of the 6th century to the beginning of the 7th, the tumuli of the monarchs changed from square ''hōfun'' tumuli to octagonal {{illm|hakkaku-fun|ja|八角墳|lt=''hakkaku-fun''}} tumuli.{{sfn|Niiro|1992|p=160}}  Amongst these, {{illm|Jōenkahōfun|ja|上円下方墳|lt=''jōenkahōfun''}} dome-shaped grave mounds made with fukiishi, such as {{illm|Musashi Fuchū Kumano Jinja Kofun|ja|武蔵府中熊野神社古墳}} in [[Fuchū, Tokyo|Fuchū]] in Tokyo, are noteworthy.  Nevertheless, during this era kofun were quickly ceding the role of central ritual building to [[Buddhist temple]]s, and the adoption of [[rammed earth]] construction techniques stands out.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

With regards to {{illm|kofun of the final period|ja|終末期古墳}}, ''{{transl|ja|gaigo resseki}}''{{efn|{{lang|ja|外護列石}} }} stones lined up to trace the line of the mound are recognized, and what could be called ''fukiishi'' are almost never seen.{{sfn|Iwasaki|1992|p=8}}  ''{{transl|ja|Gaigo resseki}}'' were not piled on the mounds as ''fukiishi'' were, nor were the construction techniques of ''fukiishi'' applied to them.  Aoki has pointed out that this was modeled on the decoration techniques of the foundations of Buddhist temples.{{sfn|Aoki|2003|p=188}}

'''General Assistance''' (also known as '''General Relief''') is a term used in the [[United States]] to denote [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs that benefit adults without dependents (single persons, or less commonly, childless married couples) as opposed to families with children, who receive assistance from the federal program formerly known as [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]], and, since 1996, officially known as [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]].

During the [[Great Depression]], the principal welfare program known as '''Home Relief''' &amp;mdash; established as part of the [[New Deal]] &amp;mdash; made no distinction as to the presence or absence of children in a needy household, but in 1935 a distinct program for such households with children was spun off from the main program.

In later years, individual [[U.S. state|state]]s were given broad discretion as to how much in benefits &amp;mdash; and indeed, ''any'' benefits &amp;mdash; need be paid to adults without dependent children; and the trend since the 1980s has been for states to sharply curtail, and even eliminate, such aid. As of 2005, only two states &amp;mdash; [[New Jersey]] and [[Utah]] &amp;mdash; still paid cash welfare benefits to childless adults deemed "able-bodied" (many other states do allow such payments to be made if a disability is demonstrated). In any event, the person(s) seeking General Assistance must first apply for any other programs &amp;mdash; state or federal &amp;mdash; for which alternate eligibility may or may not exist; only if all such applications are denied is the applicant then permitted to receive General Assistance benefits, which usually include [[Food Stamp Program|food stamps]], and often, assistance in paying for rental housing.

In some states, General Assistance programs are not universal, and the policies of different [[County (United States)|counties]] or cities therein may differ widely. [[California]] is such a state; [[San Francisco]] once paid the most generous benefits in the state, but these were drastically reduced after [[Gavin Newsom]] was elected [[mayor]] of that city in 2003, on a controversial platform known as "[[Care Not Cash]]."

Many jurisdictions use the alternate name "General Relief," including a large number of California counties (among them [[Los Angeles County]]), as well as the states of [[Iowa]] and [[Virginia]].  [[Alaska]] calls its program "General Relief Assistance."

==California==
{{See also|Welfare in California}}

Since 1933, California law has required counties to provide relief to the poor, including health care services and general assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Understanding County Health Services in California: A Brief Overview | publisher= Institute for Local Government | url= http://www.ca-ilg.org/post/understanding-county-health-services-california-brief-overview | accessdate= 2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[California Welfare and Institutions Code]] provides that:&lt;ref&gt;California Welfare and Institutions Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=wic&amp;group=16001-17000&amp;file=17000-17030.1 § 17000]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Every county and every city and county shall relieve and support all incompetent, poor, indigent persons, and those incapacitated by age, disease, or accident, lawfully resident therein, when such persons are not supported and relieved by their relatives or friends, by their own means, or by state hospitals or other state or private institutions.}}

It has been said that the "provision of general assistance is inconsistent, fragmented, and widely differentiated", with aid ranging from $160 per month in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]] to $360 in neighboring [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].&lt;ref name="benevolence"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Stacey Heneage |last=Murphy |title=The Politics of Benevolence: Homeless Policy in San Francisco |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |year=2008 |oclc=436318619 |pages=122-123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles County has the largest number of general assistance recipients in California and gives aid of $221 per month.

California has provided some form of general assistance since the mid-1800s, and much of the language can be traced back to the Pauper Act of 1901.&lt;ref name="benevolence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mooney v. Pickett, 4 Cal. 3d 669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[California Statutes]] 1901, p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco Proposition N (2002)|San Francisco Proposition N of 2002]], colloquially known as Care Not Cash, was a [[San Francisco]] ballot measure sponsored by [[Gavin Newsom]] designed to cut the money given in the General Assistance programs to homeless people in exchange for shelters and other forms of services.

'''Go Topless Day''' (variously known as '''National Go Topless Day''', '''International Go Topless Day''') is an annual event held to support the right of women to go [[Topfreedom|topless in public]] on [[gender equality|gender-equality]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Awesome|first=Barb|title=It's National GoTopless Day!|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/thats-awesome/2011/08/its-national-gotopless-day/|publisher= [[ChicagoNow]] |accessdate= April 3, 2012|date=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topless freedom laws are celebrated and protests are held in states where topless women are prohibited.

==Organizer==
The annual event was started in 2007 by '''Go Topless''', a [[Nevada]] group formed by [[Claude Vorilhon]], leader of the [[Raelian Movement]], a [[UFO religion]].&lt;ref name=topless&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/28/topless-protest-in-to | title=Topless Protest in T.O. | work=[[Toronto Sun]] | date=August 28, 2011 | accessdate=March 2, 2012 | author= Yuen, Jenny}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Post"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/08/27/where-and-when-you-can-go-topless-in-ontario-and-what-it-has-to-do-with-ufos/ | title=Where and When You Can Go Topless in Ontario, and What It Has to Do with UFOs | work=[[National Post]] | date=August 27, 2011 | accessdate=March 2, 2012 | author= Hume, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2011/08/22/Protests-demand-equal-topless-rights/UPI-97541314038767/ | title=Protests Demand Equal Topless Rights | publisher =United Press International | date=August 22, 2011 | accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; GoTopless has supported events and chapters in other countries.&lt;ref name="Group denied"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1045136--group-denied-permit-to-march-topless | title=Group Denied Permit to March Topless | work=[[Toronto Star]] | date=August 25, 2011 | accessdate=March 2, 2012 | author= Ndikubwayezu, Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Go Topless Day was founded in response to the arrest of Phoenix Feeley (Jill Coccaro), a topless activist who was arrested for being topless in public in New York in 2005. The city of New York settled with Feeley for $29,000 because toplessness is legal there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2016/08/22/go_topless_day_returns_to_venice_be.php|title=Go Topless Day Returns To Venice Beach This Weekend|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Go Topless Day is scheduled for the Sunday nearest August 26, [[Women's Equality Day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gotopless.org/gotopless-day | title=2012 Go Topless Day | publisher=GoTopless.org | accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://raelianews.org/e107_plugins/download/request.php?259 news352e.pdf] "The date was chosen thanks to our sister, Sylvie Chabot's remark that August 26 is Women's Equality Day in the US because it is on August 26, 1920 that women won their constitutional right to vote."&lt;/ref&gt; since on that day in 1920 [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] was approved (in 1971 the U.S. Congress declared the day to be Women's Equality Day). The event encourages women to go topless in public, and men to cover their chests by wearing [[brassiere]]s or [[bikini]]s.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2008/08/26/shirts_off_equal_rights_for_topless.php|title=Shirts Off!

In 2011, Go Topless Day was celebrated for the first time in Canada.&lt;ref name="Group denied"/&gt; The 2011 Canadian Go Topless Day rally was held in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], on August 28. Nearly twenty women went topless going from [[Queen Street East]] to [[Kew Beach]] on a pick-up truck sounding loudly the song "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" by [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref name=topless/&gt; According to Diane Brisbois, the spokesperson for Go Topless Canada, "This is not a beauty contest. It is about freedom. We have support; there are many men who come to our events too."&lt;ref name="National Post"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Women in Canada won the right to bare their breasts in public in 1996 when the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the 1991 conviction of Gwen Jacob, saying "there was nothing degrading or dehumanizing" about her decision to take off her shirt in public."&lt;ref&gt;CBC online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, topless women congregated in [[Bryant Park]] in [[New York City]] on Go Topless Day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2dtc.com/2012-0826-go-topless-nyc-page.htm|title=Go Topless at Bryant Park NYC 2012 photos|website=w2dtc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while men mostly observed.{{sfn|"The Neighborhood News," ''New York'' magazine, Sept. 10, 2012|p=15}} 30 cities held demonstrations in the US.&lt;ref name="Huff Post" /&gt;

In 2013, Go Topless Day in the US was held on August 25 and marked the 6th anniversary of the event. There were demonstrations in 40 cities. Men who support the group's mission were asked to cover their own man-boobs with pasties or bras.&lt;ref name="Huff Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=David|first1=Moye|title='Go Topless Day' Is August 25 -- Unless You're A Man|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/20/go-topless-day-august-35_n_3786351.html|accessdate=26 August 2013|work=The Huffington Post|agency=The Huffington Post|publisher=David Moye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''György (George) Konrád''' (born 2 April 1933) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] novelist and essayist, known as an advocate of individual freedom.

== Life ==

George Konrad (he prefers the English version of his name in translations) was born in [[Berettyóújfalu]], near [[Debrecen]] into an affluent [[Judaism|Jewish]] family. His father, József Konrád, was a successful hardware merchant; his mother, Róza Klein, came from the Nagyvárad Jewish middle class. His sister Éva was born in 1930. 

After the German occupation of Hungary, the Gestapo and Hungarian gendarmerie arrested his parents and deported them to Austria. The two children, together with two cousins, managed with difficulty to procure travel permits enabling them to visit their relatives in Budapest. The following day, every Jewish inhabitant of Berettyóújfalu was deported to the ghetto in Nagyvárad, and from there to Auschwitz. Konrád's classmates were, almost without exception, all killed in Birkenau.  The two children and their cousins survived the Holocaust in a safe house under Swiss sponsorship. 

At the end of February 1945, Eva and George returned to Berettyóújfalu.  In June 1945, their parents returned home from deportation, and the Konrád family ultimately survived intact, the only such family among the some 1000 Jewish inhabitants of Berettyóújfalu. Konrad began his studies in 1946 at the Main Reformed Gimnázium in Debrecen, and from 1947 to 1951, he attended the Madách Gimnázium in Budapest, where he was graduated in 1951, and entered the Lenin Institute where he studied literature, sociology and psychology. [[Eötvös Loránd University]]. By 1950, when the state appropriated the father's business and the family residence at Berettyóújfalu, the Konráds returned there, while Konrad completed his university education in the Department of Hungarian literature and language at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest.

In 1956 Konrad participated in the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian Uprising]] against the Soviet occupation, during which he served in the National Guard, which drew its ranks from university students.  He moved through the city with a machine gun, motivated by curiosity more than anything else.  He never used his weapon.  His friends, his sister and his cousins emigrated to the West. Konrád chose to remain in Hungary. The story of Konrád's survival as a child is told in his autobiographical novel ''Departure and Return'' (Hungarian version 2001).

He made his living through ad hoc jobs: he was a tutor, wrote reader reports, translated, and worked as a factory hand. Beginning in the summer of 1959, he secured steady employment as a children's welfare supervisor in Budapest's seventh District. He remained there for seven years, during which time he amassed the experiences that would serve as the basis for his novel ''The Case Worker'' (1969). The book drew a vigorous and mixed response: the official criticism was negative, but the book quickly became very popular and sold out in days. 
	
Between 1960 and 1965 Konrad was employed as a reader at the Magyar Helikon publishing house, where he was chief editor of works by Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Babel, and Balzac.  In 1965, he joined the Urban Science and Planning Institute, there undertaking research in urban sociology with the sociological research group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was  working closely with urban sociologist [[Iván Szelényi]] with whom they wrote a book ''On the Sociological Problems of the New Housing Developments'' (1969) and two extensive works on the management of the country’s regional zones, as well as on urbanistic and ecological trends in Hungary.

His experiences as an urbanist provided material for his next novel, ''The City Builder'', in which he radically extended the experiments in language and form that marked ''The Case Worker''.  ''The City Builder'' was allowed to appear in Hungarian only in censored form from Magvető Publishers in 1977. It was published abroad by Suhrkamp, Seuil, Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, and Philip Roth’s Penguin Series, with a foreword by Carlos Fuentes. Konrád lost his job by order of the political police in July 1973. For half a year he worked as a nurse’s aide at the work-therapy-based mental institution at Doba.

Together with Iván Szelényi, Konrád published ''The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power'' in 1974. Shortly after the completion of ''The Intellectuals'' intended for foreign publication, the political police bugged and searched  Szelényi’s and Konrád’s apartments. A significant part of Konrád’s diaries were confiscated and the authors were arrested for incitement against the state. They were placed on probation and informed that they would be permitted to emigrate with their families. Szelényi accepted the offer, while Konrád remained in Hungary, choosing internal emigration and all that it entailed. A smuggled manuscript of ''The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power'' was  published abroad and remains on  university reading lists to this day. 
 	
He published in Hungarian [[samizdat]] and by publishers in the West.  Virtually from this period until 1989, Konrád was a forbidden author in Hungary, deprived of all legal income. He made a living from honoraria abroad. His works were placed in restricted sections in libraries. Naturally he was also forbidden to speak on radio or television. When the restriction of travel expired in 1976, Konrád spent a year in Berlin on a [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] fellowship, and another year in the U.S, on a stipend of his American publisher. During this period, he wrote his novel ''The Loser''. 
    
Between 1977 and 1982, two volumes of Konrád’s essays appeared: ''The Temptation of Autonomy'' (not translated into English) and ''Antipolitics''. These works called into question the  European political status quo. ''Antipolitics'' portrayed the Yalta Agreement and the spheres of influence system as the potential cause of a possible Third World War. The book’s subtitle was Central-European Meditations, and it was to become one of the voices demanding that region’s secession from the Soviet bloc as a requisite for peace in Europe. Konrád was one of the first to predict the imminent disappearance of the Iron Curtain. In 1984, he read his essay "Does the Dream of Central Europe Still Exist?" in the Schwarzenberg Palace as he received the Herder Prize from the University of Vienna. Critics have compared his essays to the writings of Adam Michnik, Milan Kundera, Václav Havel, Czeslaw Milos and Danilo Kiš.

The years between 1973 and 1989 witnessed the evolution of  a dissident political and artistic subculture, independent of official culture. Konrád was one of the determining voices in the democratic opposition. His works appeared in the underground so called samizdat journals of the opposition. In interviews given to [[Radio Free Europe]], Konrad’s ideas reached a wider Hungarian audience. Beginning in September 1982, he was a year-long guest at the Wissenschaft-skolleg zu Berlin; the following year he received a fellowship at the New York Institute for the Humanities. Over the four years that followed, Konrád wrote ''A Feast in the Garden'' (Hungarian version 1985). Now released from the official prohibition against publication, he sent the manuscript to the Magvető publishing house in Hungary.

In 1986 Konrad received an invitation from the Jerusalem Literary Fund, spending a month in that city. This was the period when Konrád primarily penned those essays and diary entries that would be collected for the volume ''The Invisible Voice'' (Hungarian version 1997). Konrád returned to Israel in 1992 and 1996.  During his first visit he gave a long biographical interview for the University of Jerusalem, while on the second, he gave a lecture entitled "Judaism’s Three Paths" at the Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva. In 1988 he taught world literature at Colorado College in Colorado Springs.

In the first years after the fall of the old regime, beginning in 1989, Konrád took an active part in public life in Hungary, and was one of the thinkers who paved the way for the transition to democracy. He was a founding member of the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ),  and one of the founders and spokespeople for the Democratic Charter. He made frequent appearances in both the print and electronic media. In the spring of 1990  Konrád was elected President of [[PEN International]], holding this office for the full term until 1993. He made strenuous efforts on behalf of imprisoned and persecuted writers and called the writers of disintegrating nations together to roundtable conferences in the interest of peace.

Between 1997 and 2003, Konrád was twice elected President of Berlin’s Akademie der Künste. As the first foreigner to hold that post, Konrád was an effective contributor to the intellectual rapprochement between the East and West of Europe, and did much to introduce writers and other creative figures from Central Europe, and particularly from Hungary, to the West. His efforts were greeted by an appreciative German public. During his presidency, he received the Internationale  Karlspreis zu Aachen  (2001) and the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2003).
    
Though Konrád has frequently portrayed his Berettyóúfalu childhood in his novels, and particularly in ''The Feast in the Garden'', he attempted to present this period in a more precise documentary form in two more recent books, ''Departure and Return'' (2001) and ''Up on the Hill During a Solar Eclipse'' (2003). The first of these books treats a single year – 1944-45 – while the second covers fifty, after beginning with a reflection on the final years of the twentieth century, more precisely the morning solar eclipse of 1999, experienced from the peak of St. György Hill. These books were published separately in Europe, and together in New York as ''A Guest in My Own Country'' (2007).
  
The year 2006 saw the publication of his volume Figures of Wonder, subtitled Portraits and Snapshots. These portraits are modeled primarily on friends, some still living – descriptions that constitute a continuation of the series presented by Konrád in his book ''The Writer and the City'' (2004) together with longer essays. His more recent books, ''The Roosters’ Sorrow'' (2005), ''Pendulum''  (2008), ''The Chimes'' (2009), and ''The Visitor’s Book'' (2013) present his philosophy of life with a near-poetic density.

Konrád has been married three times. In 1955 he married  Vera Varsa, with whom he lived until 1963, then married Júlia Lángh, with whom they had two children, Anna Dóra in 1965, and Miklós István in 1967.  Since 1979, Konrád lives with Judith Lakner, his third wife, and together they have three children, Áron (1986), József (1987), and Zsuzsanna (1994).

{{nihongo|'''Kamakura, Home of the Samurai'''|武家の古都・鎌倉|Buke no koto・Kamakura}} is a grouping of historic sites concentrated in and around the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], near [[Tokyo]]. The city gave its name to the [[Kamakura shogunate]] which governed the country during the [[Kamakura period]] (1185-1333). In 1992 the monuments were submitted jointly for inscription on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] under criteria [[World Heritage site#Cultural criteria|i, ii, iii, iv, and vi]].

In January 2012 it was announced that the [[Japanese government]] would formally submit the Kamakura site, along with [[Mount Fuji]], for consideration by the [[World Heritage Committee]] in 2013. [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]], the advisory body for cultural World Heritage sites, inspected the site in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120127p2g00m0dm162000c.html |title=Japan asks for Mt.

ICOMOS recommended not inscribing the site on the List, stating that the historical aspects of the site had largely been supplanted by the modern city that grew up around it and thus the site lacked the integrity necessary to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2013/whc13-37com-8B1inf-en.pdf |title=''Evaluations of Nominations of Cultural  and Mixed Properties'' WHC-13/37.COM/INF.8B1, pg. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request for World Heritage status was duly withdrawn by Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2013/whc13-37com-20-en.pdf |title=''Decisions Adopted by the World Heritage Committee at its 37TH Session'' WHC-13/37.COM/20, Decision: 37 COM 8B.28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten candidate areas were proposed with twenty-two component sites, spanning the [[Municipalities of Japan|cities]] of Kamakura, [[Yokohama]], and [[Zushi, Kanagawa|Zushi]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/000166842.pdf |title=「武家の古都・鎌倉」の世界文化遺産推薦について(案) |publisher=[[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|MILT]] |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="172688">This '''list of film spoofs in ''Mad''''' includes [[film]]s spoofed ([[parodied]]) by the American comic magazine [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']]. Usually, an issue of ''Mad'' features a spoof of at least one [[feature film]] or [[television program]]. The works selected by the staff of ''Mad'' are typically from the [[cinema of the United States]] and the [[television in the United States]], respectively.

The authors parody the original titles with puns or other wordplay. Characters are caricatured, and lampooned with joke names.

These articles typically cover five pages or more, and are presented as a sequential storyline with caricatures and word balloons. The opening page or two-page splash usually consists of the cast of the show introducing themselves directly to the reader; in some parodies, the writers sometimes attempt to circumvent this convention by presenting the characters without such direct exposition. This approach was also used for ''Mad'''s television parodies, and came to be identified with the magazine. The style was widely copied by other humor publications. In 1973, the promotional movie poster for [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' was designed in the introductory manner of a ''Mad'' parody, including the rectangular word balloons with self-referential dialogue; for verisimilitude, the poster was written and drawn by ''Mad'' regulars [[Frank Jacobs]] and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]].

Many parodies end with the abrupt [[deus ex machina]] appearance of outside characters or pop culture figures who are similar in nature to the film or TV series being parodied, or who comment satirically on the theme. For example, [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] arrives to counsel the ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', or the cast of ''[[Sex and the City]]'' show up as the new hookers on ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]''.

The parodies frequently make comedic use of the [[fourth wall]], [[breaking character]], and [[meta-reference]]s. Within an ostensibly self-contained storyline, the characters may refer to the technical aspects of filmmaking, the publicity, hype, or box office surrounding their project, their own past roles, any [[cliché]]s being used, and so on. In 2013, [[Film Comment]] wrote, "While film studies majors gasp over the deconstruction of genre in the works of [[David Lynch]] and the meta-movies of [[Charlie Kaufman]], 'the usual gang of idiots' over at MAD have been deconstructing, meta-narrativing, and postmodernizing motion pictures since the very first movie parody (''[[High Noon (film)|Hah! Noon!]]'') appeared in 1954."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Hendrix 2013&lt;/ref&gt; (However, ''Mad'''s first movie parody was actually ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|Ping Pong]]''.)

Almost all of the parodies are of a single, particular film. However, ''Mad'' has occasionally done omnibus parodies of film series, such as the [[James Bond]] movies, the 1970s ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' sequels, and the ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' movies. It has also combined multiple mini-parodies of unrelated films into a single article. Some actors and directors have said that they regarded ridicule by ''Mad'' as an indication of major success in their careers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In recent years, the parodies and their creators have been available outside the pages of the regular magazine. The March/April 2013 issue of ''Film Comment'' (Film Society of the Lincoln Center) carried Grady Hendrix's historical survey of ''Mad'''s film parodies, titled "[[Cahiers du Cinema|Cahiers du CinéMAD]]".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In August 2016, four of ''Mad'' 's longtime contributors—editor/artist [[Sam Viviano]], writers [[Dick DeBartolo]] and [[Desmond Devlin]], and artist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]]—appeared at a public symposium in Nebraska to discuss their work in this particular medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omaha.com/go/mad-magazine-veterans-will-discuss-movie-parodies-at-omaha-event/article_566e1b29-2b85-5c3c-83b4-0435dec2d3f8.html "Mad Magazine veterans will discuss movie parodies at Omaha event"], Micah Mertes / World-Herald staff writer, August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad'' has also published thematic collections of their past spoofs, from [[Academy Awards|Oscar-winning films]] to superhero movies to gangster films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madmagazine.com/blog/2015/01/23/mad-spoofs-movie-classics-on-sale-today "MAD Spoofs Movie Classics"], January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===Fantasy===

* ''[[The Lure of the Basilisk]]'' (1980)
* ''[[The Seven Altars of Dûsarra]]'' (1981)

* ''[[Dragon Venom]]'' (2003)

The main chactacter of this series is Arlian, on a perilous mission to destroy all dragons.

====The Legends of Ethshar series====
'''Ethshar''' is a [[constructed world]] which was first developed by Watt-Evans for use in role-playing games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethshar.com/ethsharfaq.html#one |title=Frequently-Asked Questions |publisher=Ethshar |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in which he later set a number of novels and short stories. These usually stand alone and don't need to be read in a particular order, and the scope of the stories tends to be personal rather than cosmic.

He loosely modeled the political and economic aspects of the world on the [[Roman Empire]] of about the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name="ethshar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethshar.com/intro.html |title=An Introduction to Ethshar |publisher=Ethshar.com |date=2000-04-08 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethshar is the common name of three large cities in the major civilization of this world: Ethshar of the Spices, Ethshar of the Sands, and Ethshar of the Rocks, making up a political entity called the Hegemony of the Three Ethshars.&lt;ref name="ethshar1"/&gt; To the southeast of the Hegemony is where the original "Old Ethshar" once was. The former Ethshar, which became embroiled in a generations-long war with the Northern Empire, broke up into more than two hundred statelets collectively called the Small Kingdoms before the end of the "Great War.".&lt;ref name="ethshar1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethshar.com/background.html#geography |title=Some Background Information |publisher=Ethshar |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides humans, this world has other intelligent races, including dragons. The inhabitants don't have a special name for their world, simply calling it "The World" - and this world does not seem to be on a planet, but is rather the end-cap of a cylinder surrounded by what seems to be a noxious yellow gas.

A notable feature of Ethshar - in contrast to some other fantasy worlds - is that there are many distinct different varieties of magic, each with its own laws. Some, like the [[telekinesis]] exhibited by Ethshar's warlocks, seem to owe more influence to science fiction than fantasy. Some forms of magic, in particular wizardry, are powerful enough to create other universes.

The first six Ethshar novels were published by [[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]]'s Del Rey imprint, all of them being accepted and nominally edited by [[Lester Del Rey]]. The seventh and eighth were published by [[Tor Books]], but disappointing sales led Tor to ask  Watt-Evans to concentrate on his non-Ethshar material, which generated much better sales. After writing several non-Ethshar fantasy novels for Tor, Watt-Evans began experimentally serializing the ninth Ethshar novel, ''The Spriggan Mirror'', on his website under a modified form of the [[Street Performer Protocol]]. That novel was published in trade paperback, along with the following, ''The Vondish Ambassador.'' LWE has moved on to a third Ethshar serial ''[[The Final Calling]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethshar.com/thefinalcalling01.html |title=The Final Calling |publisher=Ethshar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethshar short stories were first published in various anthologies; later six of them were included as bonus material in [[Wildside Press]]'s reprints of the Del Rey Ethshar novels.

In the Walasian Empire, sorcerers are the aristocracy. They are granted a lot of social power, prestige and wealth, and in return are expected to use their magical abilities for the common good. The system had worked well enough for hundreds of years, and the people in general considered themselves  better governed than neighbors with a more conventional aristocracy - but things are starting to change: the economy is in trouble, there is more and more discontent, in the cities people gather and listen to speeches, some of which might be seditious... This is the world into which the protagonist, a young man Anrel Murau, has grown up. His background is a bit unusual. In this society. magical ability is the key to success. While such ability is mostly hereditary, a child of commoners found to have a magical ability is taken into the aristocracy and might attain the highest positions, while a magically-deficient child of magical parents - which is unusual but does sometimes happen - is restricted to more humble positions. Anrel Murau is an example of the latter kind. His wizard parents were killed when a spell they worked went wrong. Deeply traumatized by being so orphaned, he thoroughly  detests magic and is happy to be declared a non-magical person and live out his life as a simple clerk. However, when a powerful sorcerer kills Murau's best friend and engages in black magic and human sacrifice, Murau is drawn into a dangerous confrontation, and discovers himself to be an unmatched master in a new kind of magic - that of the orator stirring up the masses. Soon he is caught up in a series of escalating revolutionary events, with increasing popular discontent leading to the title's Fall of the Sorcerers - but a revolution can turn out to be very dangerous also to those who stirred it up. From the outset, it is evident that all this is in fact a fantasy analogue of [[The French Revolution]].

====Carlisle Hsing====
The Carlisle Hsing books are [[hard-boiled detective]] mysteries set in a future interstellar civilization dominated by immensely powerful corporations, with the elites being of clearly East Asian - and specifically, Japanese - origin. Nightside City - hometown of the tough female private detective protagonist - is a city devoted to casinos and gambling, which had been shrouded in perpetual night to the inhabitants' content, but is now doomed as the slow rotation of the planet would within a few decades bring it into the Dayside, into the devastating glare and deadly radiation of the nearby sun, making human life there impossible. For inhabitants of Nightside City, "Sunrise" means an impending apocalypse which they must try to escape. But while the city still lives, Carlisle Hsing must earn an uncertain living in a constant fight with crooks, con-men, corrupt business executives and computer programs whose cunning is equal - sometimes superior - to that of humans.

'''''Man: Whence, How and Whither, A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''', published in 1913, is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the second president of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society (TS) - Adyar]], [[Annie Besant]], and by a TS member, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]].{{refn|group=note|According to [[WorldCat]], "18 editions published between 1913 and 1984 in English and held by 177 WorldCat member libraries worldwide."{{sfn|WorldCat}}}} The book is a study on early [[Round (Theosophy)|times]] on planetary chains, beginnings of early [[root races]], early [[civilization]]s and empires, and past lives of men.{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}{{refn|group=note|There were other collaborative authors [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] works, [[Occult Chemistry (book)|''Occult Chemistry'']] (1908) and ''The Lives of Alcyone'' (1924).{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1013}}}}

== Introduction ==
[[File:Solar syst.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The seven Schemes of our [[Solar System]].{{refn|group=note|"At any one period of time only one of the rings in each Scheme will be active; each ring of each of these seven Schemes is composed of seven globes."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=4}}}}]]
At the beginning of the book the authors wrote that "metaphysicians, ancient and modern, declare that Past, Present, and Future are ever simultaneously existent in the divine Consciousness, and are only successive as they come into manifestation, ''i.e.'', under Time which is verily the succession of states of consciousness." Hence, when a mystic turn the soul away from earth and focuses his attention upon the spirit – the soul may approach the "Memory of Nature", the personification in the material world of the "Thoughts of the [[Logos]]," the image, as it were, of "His Mind." There resides the Past in [[Akashic Records|ever-living records]].{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|pp=iv–v}}{{sfn|Cayce|1968}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=985}}{{sfn|Cerminara|1988}}{{sfn|Todeschi|1998}}{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=106–7}}

The authors say that "they, having been taught the method of gaining touch, but being subject to the difficulties involved in their uncompleted evolution, have done their best to observe and transmit, but are fully conscious of the many weaknesses which mar their work. Occasional help has been given to them by the [[Mahatma|Elder Brethren]]."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=v}}

[[File:Seven kingdoms.jpg|thumb|250px|Seven planetary chains and seven kingdoms.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=9}}]]
Leadbeater speculated that "the total number of souls, or [[Monad (philosophy)|Monads]],{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} making up humanity was sixty thousand million, the majority being out of incarnation at any given time."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1010}} Thus [[reincarnation]]{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=408}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} had been one of the doctrines of the [[Theosophical Society]] almost from its beginnings.

Leadbeater wrote later that "the two hundred and fifty characters to whom names have been assigned are supposed to be less than one tenth of the whole".{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1924|loc=Foreword}} Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] said, "The series of incarnations showed these pioneers going through their own evolution from subhumans to worldly and spiritual leaders of the race."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}

== Early root races ==

=== In Lemuria ===

In the chapter VII the authors describe in detail{{refn|group=note|"Leadbeater wrote elaborate descriptions of these things in a style of simplicity and clearness," — claimed Kuhn.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=329}}}} a remarkable Lemurian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] there was some domestication of animals; the egg-headed Lemurian{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky stated that the Lemurian is "the first physical man which itself took place 18,000,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=46|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}} was seen leading about a scaly monster, almost as unattractive as his master. Animals of all sorts were eaten raw – among some tribes human flesh was not despised – and creatures of the grade of our slugs, snails and worms, much larger than their degenerate descendants, were regarded with peculiar favor as toothsome morsels."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=105|Tillett|1986|2p=452}}{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] wrote, "Leadbeater regularly adopts an archly humorous tone when dealing with disgusting habits, ugly people, or lowly human types."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|p=99}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In Atlantis ===
In the chapter IX the authors wrote about [[Atlantis]] that "explosions of gas, floods and earthquakes" razed Ruta and Daitya, the great islands, left from the cataclysm of 200,000 B.C., and only the island of Poseidonis remained, the last vestige of the once grand continent of the Atlantis. These islands were lost in 75,025 B.C., Poseidonis survived to 9,564 B.C., when it also was devoured by the ocean.{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=132|Lubelsky|2013|2p=351}}

The authors assert in the chapter X of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The immense growth of wealth and of luxury gradually undermined the most splendid civilization that the world has yet seen. Knowledge was prostituted to individual gain, and control over the powers of nature was turned from service to oppression. Hence Atlantis fell, despite the glory of its achievements and the might of its Empires."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=139}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky claimed, "The civilization of the Atlanteans was greater even than that of the Egyptians. It is their degenerate descendants, the nation of [[Plato|Plato's]] Atlantis, which built the first Pyramids... The great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1pp=429, 432|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== On the Moon chain ==
[[File:Seven chains.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The seven planetary chains and the five planes.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=5}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}]]
Blavatsky wrote in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''  that the [[Moon]] "plays the largest and most important part, as well in the formation of the [[Earth]] itself, as in the peopling thereof with human beings". The "Lunar Monads" or Pitris, the progenitors of man, become in reality man himself.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=180}} A religious studies scholar Isaac Lubelsky stated that Besant and Leadbeater write in the book the chain of the Moon "was an evolutionary precursor of the chain of the planet Earth."{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}

In the chapter III the authors describe in detail how Sirius, Alcyone, Herakles and Mizar{{refn|group=note|[[Mizar (star)|Mizar]] — J. Nityananda (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} achieved individualization{{refn|group=note|"The divine life begins the evolution of consciousness, building for itself forms on the various planes, passing slowly through the elemental, mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, and finally reaching self-consciousness and individualization, when it passes into the human stage."{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=407}}}} and left the animal kingdom while living as lunar monkey-creatures.{{refn|group=note|The lunar [[manvantara]] generated seven classes of the entities for the earthly manvantara.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=235}}}} They were servants to a family of lunar men, the leaders of which are now the Masters [[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] and [[Kuthumi|K.H.]]{{refn|group=note|[[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] — [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] — [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}}} Leadbeater wrote that "individualization from the animal kingdom usually takes place through association with the humanity of the period. Such examples of it as we occasionally see taking place round us at the present time will serve as instances for us." Some peculiar domestic animal, well treated by its human friends, is stimulated by its permanent contact with them up to the point where it breaks away from the group-soul to which it has previously belonged.{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/6}} The authors wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One night there is an alarm; the hut is surrounded by savages, supported by their domesticated animals, fierce and strong, resembling furry lizards and crocodiles. The faithful guardians spring up around their master's hut and fight desperately in its defence; Mars comes out and drives back the assailants, using some weapons they do not possess; but, while he drives them backward, a lizard-like creature darts behind him into the hut, and catching up the child Surya{{refn|group=note|"Surya — the Lord [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the present Bodhisattva, the Supreme Teacher of the world" (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} begins to carry him away. Sirius springs at him, bearing him down, and throws the child to Alcyone, who carries him back into the hut, while Sirius grapples with the lizard, and, after a desperate struggle, kills it, falling senseless, badly mangled, over its body.  Meanwhile, a savage slips behind Mars and stabs at his back, but Herakles, with one leap, flings himself between his master and the weapon and receives the blow full on his breast, and falls, dying. The savages are now flying in all directions, and Mars, feeling the fall of some creature against his back, staggers, and, recovering himself, turns. He recognizes his faithful animal defender, bends over his dying servant, and places his head in his lap. The poor monkey lifts his eyes, full of intense devotion, to his master's face, and the act of service done, with passionate desire to save, calls down a stream of response from the Will aspect of the Monad in a fierce rush of power, and in the very moment of dying the monkey individualizes, and thus he dies – a man."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1pp=35–6|Tillett|1986|2pp=450–51}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fruits of Evolution ==
[[File:Life-waves.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Successive Life-waves.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=7}}{{refn|group=note|"The vertical columns indicate the successive incarnations of the Chain; the horizontal divisions represent the various kingdoms of nature; the diagonal arrows are the successive waves of Evolution which have come forth from the [[Logos]]."{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/3}}}}]]
The theosophical concept of Evolution suppose spiritual development of the Mankind will attain the fullness of the stature of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus|Christ]], etc. of the prize of the high calling of God in Christianity.{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=324}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}}

The authors the book proclaimed "when the Human Kingdom is traversed, and man stands on the threshold of His superhuman life, a liberated Spirit", seven paths open before Him for His choosing: He may enter into the blissful omniscience and omnipotence of [[Nirvana]], with activities far beyond our knowing, to become, perchance, in some future world an [[Avatara]], or godlike Incarnation; this is sometimes called, "taking the [[Dharmakaya]] vesture". He may enter on "the Spiritual Period" — a phrase including unknown meanings, among them probably that of "taking the [[Sambhogakaya]] vesture". He may become part of that treasure-house of spiritual forces on which the Agents of the [[Logos]] draw for Their work, "taking the [[Nirmanakaya]] vesture". He may remain a member of the [[Great White Brotherhood|Occult Hierarchy]] which rules and guards the world in which He has reached perfection. He may pass on to the next Chain, to aid in constructing its forms. He may enter the majestic Angel – Deva-Evolution. He may give Himself to the immediate service of the Logos, to be used by Him in any part of the [[Solar System]], His Servant and Messenger, who lives but to carry out His will and do His work over the whole of the system which He controls.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=12}}

== Criticism ==
A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote in his thesis that ''The Canadian Theosophist'', a magazine published at [[Toronto]], announced a series of articles in which "parallel passages from the writings of Mrs. Blavatsky and the ''[[Mahatma Letters]]'' on one side, and from the books of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater, on the other (''Man: whence, how and whither'' included), gave specific evidence bearing on the claims of perversion of the original theories by those whom they call [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophists]]."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=330}}{{refn|group=note|Thomas stated, "Many, many have doubtless been turned away from genuine Theosophy after being exposed to the obvious gibberish of 'Leadbeaterism' and not being aware of the difference."{{sfn|Thomas}}}}

John Prentice in an article ''Clairvoyant Research'' criticized the book of the authors. He proclaimed that the material for the [[Peru]]vian lives in ''Man: whence, how and whither'' (Ch. XI) had been lifted out of Garcilaso de la Vega's ''Royal Commentaries on the Yuccas of Peru'' (written in 1609 and published in English translation in 1638, 1869 and 1871).{{sfn|Prentice|1923}}

Joseph Fussell wrote about "abnormal and preposterous claims" published by Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Fussell|1914}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=630–31}}

[[Helena Roerich]] stated that Leadbeater's books are a mix of "false and ugly" statements and some fragments of truth: one of the [[Mahatma|Great Masters]] supposedly called the book ''Man: Whence, How and Whither'' as "a work which devoid of knowledge, honesty and beauty."{{sfn|Рерих|2001}} She wrote: "The book by Besant and Leadbeater is particularly awful, therein is described the lives supposedly the Great Masters and some their pupils, namely: Besant, Leadbeater... I've never seen anything equal to this tasteless blasphemy and falsehood."{{sfn|Рерих|1993|p=45}}

Professor [[Olav Hammer]] stated that Leadbeater's claims about past lives "were increasingly used to buttress power struggles." He wrote, "Those who supported the controversial Leadbeater were recorded as having had important roles in the past, while his opponents were depicted as villains."
{{sfnm|Washington|1995|1p=129|Hammer|2003|2p=474}} In his thesis Hammer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How can Leadbeater's readers know that his clairvoyant results really are 'records' and 'information', rather than delusions or deliberate fabrications? His response is feeble, 'there is no assurance. The investigators themselves are certain &lt;...&gt; of the difference between observation and imagination'."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=485|Hammer|2003|2p=474}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alice Bailey]] stated that the book published at Adyar by Besant and Leadbeater was "psychic in his implications and impossible of verification". In her ''Unfinished Autobiography'' she wrote that it proved to her the "untrustworthiness" of Leadbeater's writings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Books were being published at Adyar by Mr. Leadbeater that were psychic in their implications and impossible of verification,  carrying a strong note of astralism. One of his major works, ''Man: Whence, How and Whither,'' was a book that proved to me the basic untrustworthiness of what he wrote. It is a book that outlines the future and the work of the Hierarchy of the future, and the curious and arresting thing to me was that the majority of the people slated to hold high office in the Hierarchy and in the future coming civilisation were all Mr. Leadbeater's personal friends. I knew some of these people—worthy, kind, and mediocre, none of them intellectual giants and most of them completely unimportant."{{sfn|Bailey|2013|loc=Ch. IV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term '''Neo-Theosophy''' is a term, originally derogatory, used by the followers of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] to denominate the system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] ideas expounded by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] following the death of Madame Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely Theosophical by many Theosophists around the world. 

==Overview==
After Blavatsky died in 1891, [[William Quan Judge]] became involved in a dispute with [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Annie Besant]] over Judge allegedly forging letters from the Mahatmas. As a result, he ended his association with Olcott and Besant during 1895 and took most of the Society's American Section with him. He managed his new organization for about a year until his death in [[New York City]], whereupon [[Katherine Tingley]] became manager. The organization originating from the faction of Olcott and Besant is based in India and known as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society - Adyar]], while the organization managed by Judge is known nowadays simply as the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|Theosophical Society]], but often with the specification, "international headquarters, [[Pasadena, California]]."  The ''Theosophical Society - Adyar'' is the group denounced as ''Neo-Theosophy'' by those who are followers of William Q. Judge and the original teachings of Madame Blavatsky; they do not accept what they regard as the ''Neo-Theosophical'' teachings of Annie Besant, Henry Olcott, and [[C. W. Leadbeater]]. 

The term ''Neo-Theosophy'' was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912 in a book called ''Neo Theosophy Exposed'', the second part of an earlier book called ''The Theosophical Society and its Esoteric Bogeydom''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, Jesper Aagaard Petersen, ''Controversial New Religions'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-515682-X}}  Page 292&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1924, Margaret Thomas published a book called ''Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy''. This book, now available online,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/index.htm Theosophy vs. Neo-Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; presents a detailed critical comparison of Blavatskyian Theosophy and Neo-Theosophy.

[[G. R. S. Mead]] who was also highly critical of the clairvoyant researches of Besant and Leadbeater, remaining loyal to Blavatskyian Theosophy,&lt;ref&gt;by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], Clare Goodrick-Clarke  ''G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest'' North Atlantic Books {{ISBN|1-55643-572-X}} Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; also used the term Neo-Theosophy to refer to Besant's movement.  For him "Theosophy" meant the wisdom element in the great world religions and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos, ''The Celestial Tradition: A Study of Ezra Pound's the Cantos'' , Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-88920-202-8}} Page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the term Neo-Theosophical came to be used outside Theosophical circles to refer to groups formed by former Theosophists as well as groups whose central premises borrow heavily from Blavatskyian Theosophy. Robert S. Ellwood, in his 1973 book ''Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America'' referred to organizations that had been formed by former Theosophists as "devolutions of Theosophy" and included in his survey "Neo-Gnostic groups and Neo-Rosicrucian groups [...] the [[Anthroposophy]] of [[Rudolf Steiner]], [...] [[Alice Bailey]]'s groups, ([[Guy Ballard]]'s) [["I AM" Activity]] and [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref&gt; Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., "Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America", Prentice-Hall, 1973 {{ISBN|0-13-773317-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book, ''Alternative Altars'' (1979) Professor Ellwood added;

{{quote|Alice Bailey (1880 - 1949), founder of the Arcane School and the Full Moon Meditation Groups, and Guy Ballard (1878 - 1930), of the "I AM" movement, are representative of those who have started activities based on new and special communications from Theosophical Masters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., Alternative Altars: Unconventional and Eastern Spirituality in America, University of Chicago Press, 1979 {{ISBN|0-226-20618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The author Daryl S. Paulson associates "neo-Theosophy" with Alice Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;Daryl S. Paulson, "The Near-Death Experience: An Integration of Cultural, Spiritual, and Physical Perspectives", ''Journal of Near-Death Studies'', Springer, Netherlands, ISSN 0891-4494 (Print) 1573-3661 (Online) Issue Volume 18, Number 1 / September, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other neo-Theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]], who introduced theosophical teachings to Latin America.  [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of (and influenced by) the leading edge of the theosophical movement, which in turn influenced [[Anton LaVey]]'s [[LaVeyan Satanism|Satanism]], [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Scientology]], [[Wicca]], and the modern [[New Age]] and [[New Thought]] movements. (Alice Bailey introduced the term ''New Age'').&lt;ref&gt;See Neville Drury. "Why Does Aleister Crowley Still Matter?" Richard Metzger, ed. ''Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult.'' Disinformation Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Neo-Theosophists today include  [[Benjamin Creme]] and Douglas Baker.

'''''PM/Evening Magazine''''' is a television series with a news and entertainment format. It was [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to stations throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rahner |first=Mark |url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/television/2009113645_johncurley24m.html |title=Television &amp;#124; John Curley, 'Evening Magazine' host, signs off |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most areas, ''Evening/PM Magazine'' was broadcast from the late 1970s into the late 1980s.

==Origins==
During the summer of [[1976 in television|1976]], [[KPIX]] in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], a [[CBS]] affiliate then owned by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse (Group W) Broadcasting]], premiered a local weeknight television news and entertainment series titled '''''Evening: The MTWTF Show'''''. The show was designed to add localism as suggested by the newly enacted "[[Prime Time Access Rule]]." At its inception, the rule was created by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to give back the half-hour preceding primetime (7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. in the [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Standard Time Zone|Pacific]] time zones; 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. in the [[Central Standard Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Standard Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones) to local network-affiliated stations in the [[Media market|top fifty television markets]], prohibiting them from accepting network-originated programming (and later on, syndicated reruns of network programs) in that time slot.

===KPIX's ''Evening Magazine''===
KPIX's ''Evening Magazine'' was first hosted by San Francisco radio personality [[Jan Yanehiro]], journalist [[Steve Fox (journalist)|Steve Fox]] and Detroit news anchor and reporter Erik Smith. According to the tenth anniversary special, Smith lasted 13 weeks before heading back to Detroit and returning to [[WXYZ-TV]], where he remained until 2010. It was the first of a new breed of television show shot totally on videotape, rather than the then-standard 16mm film, taking advantage of new minicam technology. The format called for the local hosts to have on-location wraparounds (in and around their local communities) and introduce short feature stories about ordinary and interesting people doing extraordinary and quite newsworthy things.

===Expansion===
At the time, Westinghouse owned four other stations around the country, and with the success of ''Evening Magazine'' in the San Francisco market, it was expanded to their other properties. Soon, Group W stations in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] ([[WJZ-TV]]), [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] ([[WBZ-TV]]), [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] ([[KYW-TV]]), and [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] ([[KDKA-TV]]) were all doing their own local versions of the ''Evening'' format. The show's format allowed the stations to share their feature stories among each other. For example, a feature that aired in San Francisco could also be shown in Baltimore, and vice versa. The success of the format on the Group W stations gave the company management a bigger idea. Group W decided to expand and syndicate the format to other markets where they didn't own stations. The first market that was interested in producing their own ''Evening'', [[KING-TV]] in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], already had a program on the air called ''Evening Magazine'', which airs on that station to this day. However, Group W came up with another title that could be cleared in other markets: '''''PM Magazine'''''.

At the end of the 1970s, with ''Evening'' and ''PM'' now all over the country, Group W Productions created a large production office in San Francisco at 855 Battery Street.  This was on the bottom floor of KPIX-TV.  Dick Crew was the National Executive Producer along with the following production staff:  Dick Newton, Sally Jewett, Andrew Schorr, Melanie Chilek, Bill Geddie, Diane Heditsian, John Norton, Larry Emsweller, Vanita Cillo, Jim Ziegler, David Baxter, Mellen O'Keefe, Gary Cooper and Joe Tobin. Their function was to watch all of the stories being produced by the new local ''PM'' and ''Evening Magazine'' stations and create a weekly "national reel" for stations to run in local markets. Depending on local station budgets they could produce as much or as little feature material as they wanted, but still have a local show starring local talent. The cooperative production model created by ''Evening/PM'' remains unique to this day.

===Breeding ground for television on-air and production talent===
''Evening/PM'' was also a "breeding ground" for television on-air and production talent. [[Matt Lauer]], [[Tom Bergeron]], [[Nancy Glass]], [[Leeza Gibbons]], Henry Tenenbaum and Jerry Penacoli were among those who became well-known because of their work with the ''PM/Evening'' programs. In Pittsburgh, KDKA-TV's broadcast of ''Evening Magazine'' featured a young [[Dennis Miller]] providing a "humorous" closing piece, similar to [[Andy Rooney]]'s commentary on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. In its more than a decade run, the show's local market producers traveled all over the country and the world, producing fun and memorable television. ''PM Magazine'' was a launching point for the career of actor-meteorologist [[Mike Randall (entertainer)|Mike Randall]], who co-hosted the Hartford version from 1982 to 1983.

===Departments===
Two long features were augmented each day by a block of "departments", featuring special tips for daily living—generally, two or three departments were featured in each program, each with a different host. In the early 1980s, "Captain Carrot" presented the "Self" department, on healthier living; Judi Sheppard Missett presented "[[Jazzercise]]" in the "Exercise" department; Dr. James Wasco presented medical issues in the "Health" department; [[Friedman Paul Erhardt|Chef Tell]] gave new food ideas in the "Cooking" department; the "animal" department featured [[Joan Embery]] and animals from the [[San Diego Zoo]]; Fred McBurney hosted "Outdoor Leisure" featuring tips related to hunting &amp; fishing; and in the "Travel" department, Linda Harris visited various parts of the globe.

===Special editions===
Occasionally, ''PM Magazine'' would feature a prime-time "Special Edition" special, focusing on a single subject for an entire hour. These specials were hosted not by local hosts, but by more-well-known personalities, such as [[Bill Rafferty]], who hosted a 1980 special edition on "Mating and Dating in the '80s"; and a 1982 "Star-Studded Super Special" hosted by [[Robert Guillaume]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Decline==
The number of stations carrying ''PM Magazine'' began to decline in the middle- to late-1980s for a variety of reasons.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Some industry insiders have placed a great deal of the blame on Group W Television, which handled both distribution of the franchise as well as national advertising sales for the local editions. The initial arrangements between Westinghouse and stations which subscribed to the ''PM Magazine'' format were done so on a "barter" basis, where the local affiliate and the national distributor shared an even split of advertising time and revenue. But by the mid-1980s Group W increased the program's franchise fees, and also took more advertising time within the program, thereby reducing the local affiliates' ability to make money with local spots, some by as much as 20 percent. With fewer local commercial spots to sell, and increasing production costs on the affiliate end, the ''PM Magazine'' format appeared less attractive.

By [[1990 in television|1990]], when Group W decided to cancel the format, ''Evening/PM'' had been edged out in many of its local time slots in favor of tabloid TV news–investigation programs, many with little or no local content. Shows such as ''[[A Current Affair (US TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', ''[[Hard Copy]]'', and ''[[Inside Edition]]'', along with the lighter-edged ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' filled up the prime time access available spots and ended ''Evening/PM'''s run, although KPIX would resurrect its own version of ''Evening Magazine'' once again, this time in the mid-1990s. During this run, one of the hosts was [[Mike Rowe (television host)|Mike Rowe]], who has since moved on to host several cable-TV series, including ''[[Worst Case Scenarios (TV series)|Worst Case Scenarios]]'' and ''[[Dirty Jobs]]'', as well as narrating ''[[American Chopper]]'' and ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. KPIX continued to air its version of ''Evening Magazine'' weeknights before CBS's prime time programs up until [[2005 in television|2005]], when the show's name was changed to ''Eye on the Bay'', and the program's hosts also changed after a short transition.

'''Pierre Desproges''' (May 9, 1939 – April 18, 1988) was a [[France|French]] [[humorist]]. He was born in [[Pantin]], [[Seine-Saint-Denis]]. According to himself, he made no significant achievements before the age of 30. From 1967 to 1970, he worked as: life insurance salesman, opinion pool investigator, "lonely hearts" [[columnist]], [[horse racing]] forecaster, and sales manager for a styrofoam beam company.   

From 1970 to 1976, he worked for the newspaper ''[[L'Aurore (1944 newspaper)|L'Aurore]]''. Starting in 1975, he became a "reporter" on ''Le petit rapporteur'' (The Little Snitch), a satirical TV show hosted by [[Jacques Martin (TV host)|Jacques Martin]] . He caught the public's attention with unconventional interviews of celebrities, among them novelists [[Françoise Sagan]] or [[Jean-Edern Hallier]].

He appeared for the first time on stage at the Olympia theater during a [[Thierry Le Luron]] show. Among other things, he became very famous for his ''Chroniques de la haine ordinaire'' (Chronicles of Ordinary Hatred), a 1986 radio show.  

In the 1980s, he appeared daily on ''Le tribunal des flagrants délires'' (a pun on the French term "flagrant délit" meaning red-handed), a comedy show where celebrities were judged in mock-trials. Desproges held the part of the prosecutor for more than two years, a part for which his verve, his scathing humour and his literary erudition were ideally suited.

In 1982, he created ''La minute nécessaire de Monsieur Cyclopède'', a series of shorts for TV, where he played an omniscient professor. He answered to metaphysical and nonsensical questions such as "How to make King Louis XVI fireproof?", proved that [[Beethoven]] was not deaf but stupid, and explained why the improbable encounter between the [[Venus de Milo]] and [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|Saint Exupéry]]'s '[[The Little Prince|Petit Prince]]' was a fiasco. Each episode ended with the catchphrase: ''"Étonnant, non ?"'' ("Astonishing, isn't it?")

In 1984, he had his first stand-up show at the Théâtre Fontaine. In 1986, his second stand-up, ''Pierre Desproges se donne en spectacle'' was presented at the Théâtre Grévin. He started work on a third stand-up, and the drafts were ultimately published in 2010.

In 1987, doctors discovered he had inoperable lung cancer in an advanced stage, and his relatives, in agreement with the doctors, decided to hide the condition from him, so he could spend his final days quietly. He died in 1988, from a disease he had bitterly laughed at time and time again, often saying "I won't have cancer: I'm against it". He is buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in [[Paris]]. His epitaph reads: ''"Pierre Desproges est mort d'un cancer, étonnant, non ?"'' ("Pierre Desproges died of cancer, astonishing, isn't it?")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25597">The '''pre-Adamite hypothesis''' or '''pre-adamism''' is the [[theological]] belief that humans (or intelligent yet non-human creatures) existed before the biblical character [[Adam]]. Pre-adamism is therefore distinct from the conventional Jewish, Christian or Muslim belief that Adam was the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|first human]]. Advocates of this hypothesis are known as "pre-Adamites", along with the humans who they believe existed before Adam.

==Early development==
[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]]  ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' contains two chapters indicating a debate between Christians and pagans over human origins: Book XII, chapter 10 is titled "Of the falseness of the history that the world hath continued many thousand years" and the title of book XVIII, chapter 40 is "The Egyptians' abominable lyings, to claim their wisdom the age of 100,000 years". The titles indicate that Augustine saw pagan ideas concerning both the history of the world and the chronology of the human race as incompatible with the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. Augustine’s position on this matter was supported by most rabbis and by the church fathers, who generally dismissed views on the antiquity of the world as myths and fables not requiring any considered refutation.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, 1992, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==900 – 1700==
In early [[Islam]], a common belief held that mankind is actually the successor of other intelligent creatures such as [[Jinn]] and [[Hinn (mythology)|Hinn]]. Medieval Muslim traditions often referred to the Jinn as ''pre-Adamites'',&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-815-65070-6}} page 39&lt;/ref&gt; depicted as human-like in various ways. Although the notion of Jinn as pre-adamites was generally accepted, the idea that before the known [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] there lived other humans was a controversial one. From the mid-ninth century onwards the idea appeared, that [[God in Islam|God]] created several Adams each of whom presides over an era lasting around 50.000 years. Although these conceptions was regarded as heretic by most Muslims, it was widely accepted by [[Ismailism|Ismailis]] and [[Sufism|Sufis]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone ''Islam, the Ancient Near East and Varieties of Godlessness: Collected Studies in Three Volumes, Band 3'' BRILL 2016 {{ISBN|978-9-004-31931-8}} page 230-231&lt;/ref&gt; 

A book titled ''Nabatean Agriculture'', written or translated by [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] in 904, collated texts about the activities and beliefs of Arabic groups such as the [[Nabataeans]], in defence of [[Babylonia]]n culture against [[Islam]]. The book discussed the ideas that people lived before Adam, that he had parents, and that he came from [[India]].{{sfn|Livingstone|2011|p=7}}{{sfn|Popkin|1987|p=28}}

The [[Jews|Jewish]] poet [[Yehuda Halevi]] wrote his [[Kitab al Khazari]] between 1130 and 1140, featuring a discussion where the King of the [[Khazars]] questioned three theologians (a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[Christian]], and a [[Muslim]]) which was the true religion, and raised the challenge that people in [[India]] said they had buildings and antiquities which were [[Dating Creation|millions of years old]]. The rabbi responded that his faith was unshaken, as the Indians lacked "a fixed form of religion, or a book concerning which a multitude of people held the same opinion, and in which no historical discrepancy could be found." The rabbi dismissed Indians as dissolute, unreliable people, whose claims could be ignored. Later in the book, Halevi rejected the ''Nabatean'' claims as these people did not know of the [[revelation]] in [[Scripture]], and he dismissed Greek theories of an eternal world. In his conclusion, Halevi maintained that Adam was the first human in this world but left open other possibilities: "If, after all, a believer in the Law finds himself compelled to admit an eternal matter and the existence of many worlds prior to this one, this would not impair his belief that this world was created at a certain epoch, and that Adam and Noah were the first human beings."{{sfn|Popkin|1987|pp=27–28}}

The claims in ''Nabatean Agriculture'' were also disputed by [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) in ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]''. He attributed the concepts to the [[Sabians]] and said they were just legends and mythology which deviated from monotheism though drawing on Jewish sources, but in refuting the speculations, he circulated an outline of the ideas among other scholars:{{sfn|Livingstone|2011|pp=7–8}} "They deem ''Adam'' to have been an individual born of male and female like any other human individuals, but they glorify him and say that he was a prophet, the envoy of the moon, who called people to worship the moon. and there are compilations of his on how to cultivate the soil." He noted the claim that Adam came from India, and went on to Babylon.{{sfn|Popkin|1987|pp=29–30}}

The presence of a belief in the existence of men before Adam among the [[Familia Caritatis|Familists]], a religious community in [[Friesland]], was noted by John Rogers in 1578.&lt;ref&gt;Almond, 1999, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1591, [[Giordano Bruno]] argued that, because no one could imagine that the [[Jews]] and the [[Ethiopia]]ns had the same ancestry, God must have either created separate Adams or that Africans were the descendants of pre-Adamic races.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th-century French [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Isaac La Peyrère]], because of his influence on subsequent thinkers and movements, is usually credited with formulating the pre-Adamite theory. In his ''Prae-Adamitae'', published in Latin in 1655, La Peyrère argued that Paul's words in {{bibleref2|Romans|5:12-14|NIV}} should be interpreted to mean that "if [[Adam]] sinned in a morally meaningful sense there must have been an Adamic law according to which he sinned. If law began with Adam, there must have been a lawless world before Adam, containing people."&lt;ref&gt;Almond, 1999, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to La Peyrère, there must have been two creations; first the creation of the [[Gentiles]] and then the creation of Adam, who was the father of the [[Hebrews]]. The existence of pre-Adamites, La Peyrère argued, explained [[Cain]]'s taking of a wife and the building of a city after [[Cain and Abel|Abel]]'s murder in the [[Book of Genesis]]. This account of human origins became the basis for 19th century theories of [[polygenism]] and modern [[racism]].{{cn|date=February 2014}}

Some{{who|date=February 2014}} date the origins of the racial theory precisely to 24 April 1684, when [[François Bernier]] distinguished four or five [[race (human classification)|race]]s (with no [[hierarchical]] distinction between them) in an article titled ("A new division of the Earth, according to the different species or races of men who inhabit it") published in the ''[[Journal des sçavans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The full title of the paper was "Nouvelle Division De La Terre, pour les differente Especes ou Races d'hommes qui l'habitent, envoyée par un fameux voyageur à M. l'Abbé de la **** à peu prés on ces termes", ''Journal des sçavans'', 24 April 1684, pp. 133-140. The title is slightly different in the 1685 reprint in ''Journal des sçavans pour l'année M.DC.XXXIV'', pp. 148-155 - see Boulle, 2003, pp. 11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of widespread theological opposition to the pre-Adamite theories of his friend La Peyrère, Bernier published his paper anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, 2003, pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of Enlightenment==
{{See also|Curse and mark of Cain}}
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], pre-Adamism was adopted widely as a challenge to the biblical account of human origins.{{cn|date=October 2018}} In the 19th century, the idea was welcomed by advocates of [[white supremacy|white superiority]]. A number of racist interpretive frameworks involving the early chapters of Genesis arose from pre-Adamism. Some pre-Adamite theorists held the view that Cain left his family for an inferior tribe described variously as "white [[Mongols]]" or that Cain took a wife from one of the inferior pre-Adamic peoples.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

== In Sufism ==
Various Sufis, especially [[Sultan Bahu]], a famous 17th-century mystic of the [[Qadiriyya]], a [[Sufi]] order, advocated this theory. In one of his writings, he wrote, "Once God said to the Prophet "O Muhammad I created an Adam before I created your father Adam, whom I gave a life of thousand years. Then I created fifteen thousand Adams all of whom I gave a life of ten thousand years. After that I created your Adam."&lt;ref&gt; Ain ul Faqr by [[Sultan Bahu]], p. 285 &lt;/ref&gt;

According to that statement, the pre-Adamic era lasted for 150,100,000 years.

==1800 – present==
===Racist pre-Adamism===
In 19th century Europe, pre-Adamism was attractive to those intent on demonstrating the inferiority of non-Western peoples, and in the [[United States]], it appealed to those attuned to racial theories who found it unattractive to contemplate a common history with non-whites.

Scientists such as [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]], [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[Samuel George Morton|Samuel G. Morton]] rejected the view that non-whites were the descendants of Adam. Morton combined pre-Adamism with [[craniometry|cranial measurements]]. As Michael Barkun explains:
{{quote|In such an intellectual atmosphere, pre-Adamism appeared in two different but not wholly incompatible forms. Religious writers continued to be attracted to the theory both because it appeared to solve certain [[exegesis|exegetical]] problems (where did Cain's wife come from?) and exalted the spiritual status of Adam's descendants. Those of a scientific bent found it equally attractive but for different reasons, connected with a desire to formulate theories of racial difference that retained a place for Adam while accepting evidence that many cultures were far older than the few thousand years that humanity had existed, according to the biblical chronology. The two varieties differed primarily in the evidence they used, the one relying principally on scriptural texts and the latter on what passed at the time for [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, 1996, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1860, [[Isabelle Wight Duncan|Isabella Duncan]]&lt;ref&gt;Some editions of the book are attributed to Mrs George John C. Duncan.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''Pre-Adamite Man, Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its Inhabitants, Told by Scripture &amp; Science'', a mixture of [[geology]] and scriptural interpretation. The book was popular among a number of geologists because it mixed biblical events with science. She suggested that the pre-Adamites are today's [[angel]]s. Since they were without [[sin]], for sin did not enter the world until Adam disobeyed God, there was no reason for them not to have been at least [[rapture]]d into [[heaven]], anticipating what would again occur with the [[Second Coming|second coming of Jesus Christ]]. Duncan also believed that some angels had sinned and fallen from [[Heaven]], which caused them to become [[demon]]s. Duncan supposed that such an upheaval would leave geological scars on the earth. The concept of [[ice age]]s, pioneered by [[Louis Agassiz]], seemed to provide evidence of such events, drawing the line between the pre-Adamic era and the modern one, which she posited began about 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Isabella Duncan, Pre-Adamite Man, Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its Inhabitants, Told by Scripture &amp; Science, 1860&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Civil War]], Southerners were increasingly receptive to arguments that supported their belief in black inferiority. In 1867, [[Buckner H. Payne]], under the pen name Ariel, wrote a pamphlet, ''The Negro: What is His Ethnological Status?'' He argued that the Negro is a pre-Adamic beast of the field (specifically, a higher order of monkey), which was preserved on [[Noah's Ark]]. In 1891, William Campbell, under the pen name "Caucasian", wrote in ''Anthropology for the People: A Refutation of the Theory of the Adamic Origin of All Races'' that the non-white peoples were not descendants of Adam and therefore "not brothers in any proper sense of the term, but inferior creations" and that [[polygenism]] was the "only theory reconcilable with scripture."

Following Payne, Campbell viewed the [[flood geology|Great Flood]] as a consequence of intermarriage between the white (Adamic) and nonwhite (pre-Adamic) peoples "the only union we can think of that is reasonable and sufficient to account for the corruption of the world and the consequent judgement."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Harvey, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lester A Hoyle wrote a book in 1875, ''The Pre-Adamite, or who tempted Eve?'' He claimed that there had been five distinct creations of races, and only the fifth, the white race, of which [[Adam]] was the father, had been made in God’s own image and likeness.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and pre-Adamism, the [[Vanderbilt University]] [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolutionist]] and [[geology|geologist]] [[Alexander Winchell (geologist)|Alexander Winchell]] argued in his 1878 tract, ''Adamites and Preadamites'', for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race, on the basis that the Negroes were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 2003, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish lawyer [[Dominick McCausland]], a Biblical literalist and anti-Darwinian polemicist, maintained the theory to uphold the Mosaic timescale. He held that the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] were descended from Cain and that the "Caucasian" race would eventually exterminate all others. He maintained that only the "Caucasian" descendants of Adam were capable of creating civilisation, and he tried to explain away the numerous non-"Caucasian" civilisations by attributing them all to a vanished "Caucasian" race, the Hamites.&lt;ref&gt;Dominick M'Causland, The Builders of Babel, 1871; Patrick Maume “Dominick McCausland and Adam’s Ancestors: an Irish Evangelical responds to the Scientific Challenge to Biblical Inerrancy” in Juliana Adelman and Eadaoin Agnew (eds) Science and Technology in Nineteenth-Century Ireland (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, [[Charles Carroll (racist)|Charles Carroll]] wrote ''The Negro a Beast; or, In the Image of God''. He concludes in the book that the [[white race]] was made in the image and likeness of God and that Adam gave birth to only the white race, and Negros are pre-Adamite beasts, who could not possibly have been made in God's image and likeness because they are beastlike, [[Immorality|immoral]] and [[Beauty#Ugliness|ugly]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Carroll The negro a beast"; or, "In the image of God"; the reasoner of the age, the revelator of the century! The Bible as it is! The negro and his relation to the human family! The negro not the son of Ham, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races, such as blacks, did not have souls. Carroll believed that race mixing was an insult to God and spoiled God's racial plan of creation. According to Carroll, the mixing of races had also led to the errors of [[atheism]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600 – 2000'', 2006, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish millennialist George Dickison wrote ''The Mosaic Account of Creation, As Unfolded in Genesis, Verified by Science'' in 1902. The book mixed science with a scientifically enhanced reading of Genesis and lists geological discoveries that showed that men existed before Adam had been created and that Earth was much older than the 6000-year-old span of the Adamic race. Dickison welcomed scientific discoveries from fossil evidence and the palaontological record and used them as evidence for pre-Adamism.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 – 2000, 2006, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Kardec]], the founder of [[Spiritualism]] taught [[polygenism]] and that the earth was populated "from time immemorial" and that the Adamic race has "pushed all other races forward".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kardecpedia.com.br/en/study-guide/888/genesis-the-miracles-and-the-predictions-according-to-spiritism/3907/genesis/chapter-xi-spiritual-genesis/the-adamic-race&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oconsolador.com.br/linkfixo/bibliotecavirtual/ingles/Genesis.pdf Genesis&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine known as [[British Israelism]], which developed in [[England]] in the 19th century, also sometimes included a pre-Adamic worldview but that was a minority position. The model viewed pre-Adamites as a race of inferior bestial creatures apart from Adam, who was the first white man and consequently the first son of God. In the narrative, [[Satan]] seduces Eve, and the resulting offspring is a hybrid creature, Cain. Later, Cain flees to [[East Turkestan]] to establish a colony of followers intent on realizing the Devil’s plan for domination of the earth. A further elaboration of this myth involved the identification of the [[Jews]] with the [[Canaanites]], the putative descendants of Cain, but the [[eponym]]ous ancestor of the Canaanites is not Cain but [[Canaan]]. It followed that if the [[tribe of Judah|tribes of Judah]] were supposed to have intermarried with Cain’s descendants, the Jews were both the offspring of Satan and the descendents of sundry nonwhite pre-Adamic races.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barkun, Religion and the racist right: the origins of the Christian Identity movement, pp. 150–172&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, British Israelism developed into the aggressively [[anti-Semitic]] [[Christian Identity]] movement in which the Jews were "mongrelized" [[serpent seed]].

===Non-racist pre-Adamism===
Non-racist pre-Adamism can be traced back to [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], an [[occultist]]. Paschal was of [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry and was a spokesman against [[slavery]]. Paschal believed in Pre-Adamism and wrote ''Pre-Adamite Man: Demonstrating The Existence of the Human Race Upon the Earth 100,000 Thousand Years Ago!'' under the name Griffin Lee in 1863. The book was a unique contribution towards pre-Adamism because it was not based on only biblical grounds. Randolph used a wide range of sources to write his book from many different world traditions, [[esoteric]]a and ancient religions. In the book, Paschal claims that Adam was not the first man and that pre-Adamite men existed on all continents around the globe 35,000 to 100,000 years ago. His book is different from many of the other writings by other pre-Adamite authors because Randolph claimed that the pre-Adamites were civilised men, but other pre-Adamite authors argued that the pre-Adamites were beasts or (not fully human) [[hominids]].&lt;ref&gt;Paschal Beverly Randolph, Pre-Adamite man: demonstrating the existence of the human race upon the earth 100,000 thousand years ago!, 1863&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Adamite theories have also been held by a number of mainstream Christians such as the [[Congregational Church|Congregational]] evangelist [[R. A. Torrey]] (1856–1928), who believed in the [[Gap creationism|Gap Theory]] and that pre-Adamites had survived into the present day.

[[Gleason Archer]] was a believer in pre-Adamism. He wrote in his 1985 book, ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction'', "To revert to the problem of the [[Pithecanthropus]], the [[Swanscombe]] man, the [[Neanderthal]] and all the rest (possibly even the [[Cro-Magnon|Cro-magnon]] man, who is apparently to be classed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', but whose remains seem to date back at least to 20,000 B.C.) it seems best to regard these races as all prior to Adam’s time, and not involved in the Adamic covenant. We must leave the question open, in view of the cultural remains, whether these pre-Adamic creatures had souls (or, to use the trichotomic terminology, spirits)." 

Gleason went on to assert that only Adam and his descendants were infused with the breath of God and a spiritual nature corresponding to God himself, and he said that all mankind subsequent to Adam’s time must have been literally descended from him. However, he retains the concept of pre-Adamic races (such as the [[Cro-Magnon]] man), and says: "They may have been exterminated by God for unknown reasons prior to the creation of the original parent of the present human race".&lt;ref&gt;Archer, G. Jr., A Survey of Old Testament Introduction, Revised edition, Moody Press, Chicago, pp. 204–205, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grigg |first=Russell |url=http://creation.mobi/article/453 |title=Pre-Adamic man: were there human beings on Earth before Adam? |publisher=Creation.mobi |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, such ideas have been promoted by [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] and [[Derek Prince]] among [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[John Stott]] among [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and [[Old Earth Creationism|Old Earth creationist]] [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Taylor |url=http://www.creationmoments.com/content/pre-adamic-man |title=Pre-Adamic Man |publisher=Creation Moments |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Velikovsky]] was a believer in pre-Adamism. He wrote ''In the Beginning''. In the book, Velikovsky describes catastrophes that had occurred before those described in his first book, ''[[Worlds in Collision]]''. In the first section, his chapter ''The Pre-Adamite Age'' discusses pre-Adamism. He wrote that the "talmudic-rabbinical tradition believed that before Adam was created, the world was more than once inhabited and more than once destroyed." Moreover, he wrote that according to the evidence from many different traditions, Adam and Eve were not a single human pair and there must have been many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varchive.org/itb/ecadam.htm |title=The Pre-Adamite Age |publisher=Varchive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 1990s academic shift towards postmodernism, the Journal dropped its militant stance to emphasize instead culturalist "issues of gender, race, sexuality, imperialism, and class, stretching the boundaries of historical analysis to explore Western and non-Western histories".&lt;ref name="Muse"/&gt; 

''[[The New Criterion]]'' describes ''RHR'' as "a publication that plainly states it 'rejects conventional notions of scholarly neutrality and 'objectivity,' and approaches history from an engaged, critical, political stance.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/radicalhistory-klehrhaynes-1940 "Radical History" by Harvey Klehr &amp; John Earl Haynes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The journal has recently distinguished itself by publishing a series of interviews with (several historians) exploring the relationship in their work between historical scholarship and political commitment."&lt;ref&gt;''Professors, Politics, and Pop'', by Jon Wiener, 1991, p. 207"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the editors described "the journal's recent move toward a more overtly political discussion of historical topics".&lt;ref&gt;''Radical History Review: Liberalism and the Left'', by RHR Collective&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''National Lampoon Radio Dinner''''' is a comedy album from ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' that was first released in 1972. The humor on the album was very much steeped in the [[popular culture|pop culture]] of the era and includes such subjects as game shows ("Catch It and You Keep It"), the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]] ("Profiles in Chrome", where the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] nominate a [[Pontiac GTO]] to run for office while then-president [[Richard Nixon]] counters by transforming into a car himself), and  popular music parodies such as "[[Deteriorata]]" (a parody of [[Les Crane|Les Crane's]] "[[Desiderata]]") and "Pull the Tregros", a parody of [[Joan Baez]].  
 
The latter subject also includes several references and sketches about the solo careers of the former members of [[the Beatles]]. Among these are "Teenyrap", in which two teenagers discuss [[George Harrison]]'s [[Concert for Bangladesh]]; and "Magical Misery Tour (Bootleg Record)", a parody of [[John Lennon]]'s [[primal therapy]]-inspired songwriting style, with its lyrics, including the repeated cry of "Genius is pain!", taken directly from Lennon's famous 1970 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview. [[Melissa Manchester]] made a brief speaking appearance as "[[Yoko Ono]]" on the latter track. Other Beatles-related satire are references to [[Paul McCartney]]'s single "[[Give Ireland Back to the Irish]]", where an Irish tenor begins to sing the song and is repeatedly shot, and the "[[Paul is Dead]]" hoax.

The album was originally set to be released on [[RCA Records]], but the company balked at a track called "David and Julie", a highly off-color bit about [[David Eisenhower|David]] and [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie Eisenhower]]. National Lampoon refused to cut the piece and took the album to [[Blue Thumb Records|Blue Thumb]] instead, but were met with the same objection. Lampoon relented and the album was released without the offending bit.&lt;ref name="RS #120"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=October 26, 1972 |title=Record Censored, Lampoon to Tour |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |volume= |issue=120 |pages=16–18 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientists agree that [[religiosity]] is not an independent personality trait, but something that can have the effect of personality traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael C|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=9780123741295|location=Oxford, UK|pages=260–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing religiosity through the lenses of differing personality characteristics provides a relatively empirical way to study a difficult concept. Over time, the act of being religious has been a consistent behavior across almost every culture, and thus provides evidence that our personality can help explain the seeming predisposition of religious people.

With the ability to use modern, empirically tested personality measures, researchers can link results with religiosity. In linking personality measures with religion, it is possible to quantitatively study results, which can provide insight into how and why religion is such an important element of being human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion, Personality, and Social Behavior|year=2014|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|url=http://www.psypress.com/books/details/9781848726659/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more research is needed to definitively say that there is a correlation between certain personality characteristics and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by [[Raymond F. Paloutzian]], Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality |year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=253-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five-factor model of personality==
The [[five-factor model]] of personality is currently accepted as a comprehensive model of personality.&lt;ref name=Digman&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Digman | first1 = J.M. | year = 1990 | title = Personality structure: Emergence of the five-factor model | url = |journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 417–440 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.002221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-factor model (FFM) identifies five broad traits underlying the many narrower traits that can be used to describe personality.  The identified traits are: 1) extraversion, the quantity and intensity of one's interpersonal interactions 2) neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and hostility 3) conscientiousness, the persistence, organization, and motivation exhibited in goal-directed behaviors 4) agreeableness, the quality of one's interpersonal interactions along a continuum from compassion to antagonism 5) openness, the proactive seeking and appreciation of new experiences. The idea behind the big five personality characteristics that makes them compatible to religious study is that each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The personality puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393933482|pages=243–244|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In having the ability to separate each essential trait from the other, it is possible to study each personality characteristic and how it relates to religiosity.

The idea of studying the [[psychology of religion]] through a personality lens is not a new idea, however.  There has been research to both support and refute the ability of personality traits to explain religious or spiritual involvement. Research using [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]]'s model has found that religiosity in general is associated with low openness to experience, as well as low [[psychoticism]],&lt;ref name="psychology of religion"&gt;{{cite journal|first= Robert A.|last=Emmons|author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The Psychology of Religion|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2003|volume=54|pages=377–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024|pmid=12171998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factor associated inversely with agreeableness and conscientiousness.&lt;ref name=Saroglou/&gt; A review of studies examined the relations between the FFM and measures of religiosity, spiritual maturity, religious fundamentalism, and extrinsic religion. General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the big five traits.&lt;ref name=Saroglou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion and the five-factors of personality: A meta-analytic review.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2002|pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a weak positive association with extraversion, and a very small but significant relationship with low openness to experience. This same study also found that the two different concepts of religiosity and spirituality both involve an overall compassionate attitude towards others and positively correlates with agreeableness. Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and with low neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher agreeableness, and lower neuroticism and lower openness to experience. Because of these factors, it was also seen that more religious people seem to be altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael|publisher=Nikki Levy|year=2018|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|location=125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AS, United Kingdom|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. All of these relationships between personality and religion were small. This finding does not necessarily support the concept of personality for being the specific reason for religiosity, however this correlation with the FFM can lead to more in depth research on the topic.

===Strengths and weaknesses===
As previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is the how empirically tested, and accurate the measure actually is in accordance to personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=P|last2=McCrae|title=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|journal=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strength is that the big five is an excellent starting point for beginning to look at links between personality and religiosity because it is simply laid out. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters.  For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piedmont|first=R|title=Strategies for using the five factor model of personality in religious research|journal=Journal of Psychology and Theology|volume=27|pages=338–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more advances in research using the FFM to study religiosity and spirituality come, there will be a clearer cut answer as to whether there is a significant place for the FFM in studying religious behavior.

==Attachment theory==
[[Attachment Theory]] is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality.  The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and depending on the type of attachment, personality and future relationships will be influenced accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and loss: Separation, anxiety and anger|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind how the theory relates to the psychology of religion is that these future relationships can be with the particular god, or higher power.

In attachment theory, there have been three attachment styles identified: 1)secure style- confidence in the availability of attachment figures during times of need 2)avoidant style- insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs 3) anxious-ambivalent style- view of others as being reluctant to get close to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research varies in explaining which type of attachment style yields the individual's particular relationship with God.  For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents will translate into a secure attachment to God, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=L|title=God as a substitute attachment figure: a longitudinal study of adult attachment style and religious change in college students.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|pages=961–973|doi=10.1177/0146167298249004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research has showed that there is a compensatory effect, or the need of people to make up for something that is lacking.  For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1572309229|pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
The idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study.  The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed.  There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results.  The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.

==Object relations theory==
[[Object relations theory]]'s roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects).  The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kernberg|first=O|title=Structural derivatives of object relationships|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|pages=236–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals.  In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply.  One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.

In this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rizzuto|first=A|title=The birth of the living god|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
An important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical.  This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=S |author2=Wood, J |author3=Garb, H|title=The scientific status of projective tests|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|year=2000|doi= 10.1111/1529-1006.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject.  That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study.  By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.

== Religious struggles and personality ==
Research has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on [[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five Factors of Personality]], as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;http://sites.nd.edu/lapseylab/files/2016/08/Grubbs_etal_SelfStruggleAndSoul_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119916300013?via%3Dihub|title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11166-013-9174-8|title=Risk aversion and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and life satisfaction ==
Research done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Individual Differences in Personality|last1=Ashton|first1=Michael C|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|edition=Third|pages=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Marta|last2=Hayward|first2=R. David|date=October 1, 2009|title=Relgion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: The Role of Government Regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/70/3/285/1652126|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=285–310|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself. More research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==
The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the "judging" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/573-the-personality-types-of-christians-and-atheists&lt;/ref&gt;  ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1957.tb00074.x|title=EVIDENCE BEARING ON USE OF THE MYERS‐BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR TO SELECT PERSONS FOR ADVANCED RELIGIOUS TRAINING: A PRELIMINARY REPORT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, although popular, is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=David|title=Measuring the MBTI... And Coming Up Short|journal=Journal of Career Planning &amp; Placement|issue=Fall 1993|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religiosity and paranormal beliefs ==
Most religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits.

== Religion as a personality characteristic ==
While there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example,  has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|date=September 2, 2011|title=Believing, Bonding, Behaving, and Belonging - The Big Four Religious Dimensions and Cultural Variation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022111412267|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=42|pages=1320–1340|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photograph of paper book sculpture aka the 'poetree'.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first sculpture to be found, known as the 'poetree']]
The '''Scottish book sculptures''' are a group of book sculptures that were contrived to be "found" in Scotland between 2011 and 2013. The sculptures are on topics mostly concerning Scottish literature and poetry, and are made out of old books by an anonymous female paper sculptor.

The initial group of book sculptures was a group of ten elaborate sculptures that were left around various cultural locations in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, between March and November 2011, as gifts to the cultural institutions and people of the city.&lt;ref name=GdnDec11&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh book sculptures turn the page |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/dec/01/edinburgh-book-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity of the artist is unknown, although notes with some of the sculptures referred to the artist as 'she'.  The sculptures were made from old books and were accompanied by gift labels which praised literacy and the love of words, and argued against library and other arts funding cuts.  An eleventh sculpture was presented to author [[Ian Rankin]], whose works featured prominently in many of the other sculptures. The ten Edinburgh sculptures were toured through Scotland in an exhibition in late 2012.&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh's mysterious book sculptures go on tour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2012/jul/31/scotland-poetry-book-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Robyn|last=Marsack|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptor was then commissioned to produce five more book sculptures to be hidden in secret locations around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, which commenced in November 2012. Despite the commission, the artist has maintained her anonymity.

The sculptor also made another gift sculpture in December 2012, which she anonymously presented to the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], already the previous recipient of two of her earlier works.

In May 2013 a new sculpture, featuring three eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdbox, was left in the Scottish Poetry library; this was followed by three baby birds in a nest, left at Leith Library. 
In 2014 a flutter or swarm of butterflies from an open book sculpture was left in aid of the [[Macmillan Cancer Support|Macmillan charity]]. This sculpture was bought privately but is intending to tour for a not-for-profit basis in 2015.

==2011 Edinburgh sculptures==
These are listed in the order of their discovery. In the first ten cases, the person who deposited the sculptures was not noticed, and some of the sculptures were found several days after they had been put in place.  The eleventh was a gift to author [[Ian Rankin]].

===First sculpture===
The first sculpture was found on Tuesday 2 March 2011 on a table in the [[Scottish Poetry Library]].&lt;ref name=GdnMar11&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery 'poetree' is a symbol of library love Anonymous reader leaves a delicate gift to the Scottish Poetry Library |url=https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2011/mar/03/edinburgh-scottish-poetry-library-tree-gift-mystery|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=3 March 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised a tree with intricately fashioned branches and leaves, standing on a thick leather-bound old book.  At the base of the tree was a paper egg, broken in half and with the inside lined with gold, in which were a scatter of individual words, which could be put together to make "A Trace of Wings", a poem by [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]].&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite news|title=Mysterious paper sculptures |url=http://thisiscentralstation.com/featured/mysterious-paper-sculptures/|work=Central Stn|first=Chris|last=Scott|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was accompanied by a tag, addressed to @byleaveswelive, the name of the Library's Twitter account.  "By leaves we live" is a [[Patrick Geddes]] quote about the idea that you reap what you sow.

The note on the tag read: "It started with your name [https://twitter.com/byleaveswelive @byleaveswelive] and became a tree.… … We know that a library is so much more than a building full of books… a book is so much more than pages full of words.… This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. a gesture (poetic maybe?)".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The sculpture was nicknamed the "poetree" by the staff at the Library, and despite national publicity, the identity of its maker remained unknown.&lt;ref name=GdnMar11/&gt;

===Second sculpture===
The second sculpture was found in late June 2011&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; at the [[National Library of Scotland]], a "delicately crafted"&lt;ref name=GdnDec11/&gt; gramophone and a coffin fashioned from a copy of Edinburgh-based author [[Ian Rankin]]'s book ''[[Exit Music]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/natlibscot @natlibscot] – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. (&amp; against their exit)".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Third sculpture===
Later on in June 2011 a third sculpture was anonymously deposited, this time at the box office of the [[Edinburgh Filmhouse]].&lt;ref name=GdnJune11&gt;{{cite news|title=Real-life Ian Rankin mystery of 'reverse heist' sculptures Series of intricate paper artworks linked to Rebus author's work left around Edinburgh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/30/real-life-ian-rankin-mystery-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This one comprised "a complex scene in a paper cinema; punters arrayed on seats watching men and horses coming alive from the screen and charging outwards."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;  One of the audience had Ian Rankin's face, and was holding a bottle of [[Caledonian Brewery|Deuchars IPA]].&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/filmhouse @filmhouse] – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. and all things *magic*".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; A quote from [[Francis Ford Coppola]], "I think cinema, movies, and magic have always been closely associated" was pasted onto the sculpture.&lt;ref name=GdnJune11/&gt;

===Fourth sculpture===
The fourth sculpture was found on a windowsill at the [[Scottish Storytelling Centre]].  As it lay in a part of the building that does not have much footfall, it may have lain undiscovered at the location for a while, and so its place in the gift chain is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Scotland&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh’s mysterious book sculptures to go on display|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/edinburghs-mysterious-book-sculptures-to-go-on-display|work=Scotland|date=August 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises a dragon hatching from an egg on a nest of feathers.  It is made from a copy of Ian Rankin's book, ''[[Knots and Crosses]]''.&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/scotstorycentre @scotstorycentre] – A gift in support of libraries, books, works, ideas….. Once upon a time there was a book and in the book was a nest and in the nest was an egg and in the egg was a dragon and in the dragon was a story….."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Fifth sculpture===
The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]].  The fifth sculpture was left on one of the signing tables in the festival bookshop.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;&lt;ref name=GdnAug11&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery sculptures appear at Edinburgh book festival |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/24/edinburgh-book-festival-sculptures?CMP=twt_gu|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It comprised a tea tray bearing a cup of tea on a cake stand, a cupcake, a used teabag and a (real) old book. The teabag was filled with cut out letters, on the tag of which were the words "by leaves we live" (the Twitter name of the Scottish Poetry Library account referenced in the first sculpture). On the top of the tea in the teacup was a spiral swirl of words which read "Nothing beats a nice cup of tea (or coffee) and a really good BOOK", and on the tray next to the cupcake: "except maybe a cake as well".

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "To [https://twitter.com/edbookfest @edbookfest] 'A gift' This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…… &amp; festivals xx".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Sixth sculpture===
The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]]. The sixth sculpture was secreted about the [[City of Literature|Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature]] information stand in the entrance tent.&lt;ref name=GdnAug11/&gt;  It shows a man sitting under a tree.  It is made from an [[Everyman's Library]] edition of ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'' by [[James Hogg]].&lt;ref name=GdnAug11/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "To [https://twitter.com/edincityoflit @edincityoflit] 'A gift' LOST (albeit in a good book) This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. “No infant has the power of deciding….. by what circumstances (they) shall be surrounded.. [[Robert Owen]]".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Seventh sculpture===
The seventh sculpture was found on 30 August 2011 on a bookshelf at [[Central Library, Edinburgh|Edinburgh Central Lending Library]].  It comprises a magnifying glass on a stand on top of a (real) old book.  Some words on the book are also shown in the lens of the magnifying glass: "When I go in I want it bright, I want to catch whatever is there in full sight".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For Central Library 'A Gift' [https://twitter.com/Edinburgh_CC @Edinburgh_CC] This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. Libraries are expansive".  The word 'expensive' has had the E crossed out and replaced with an A. The tag also notes, "Words on book – [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]]".

===Eighth sculpture===
The eighth sculpture was found on 23 November 2011&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite news|title=Final chapter in book sculpture mystery revealed|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/723/final_chapter_in_book_sculpture_mystery_revealed|work=Edinburgh Council|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], where the first sculpture was found in March 2011. The staff were first alerted to its presence by a note which the sculptor had left in the guest book: "Hopefully next time I’ll be able to linger longer – I’ve left a little something for you near Women’s Anthologies X. In support of Libraries, Books, Words and Ideas…."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; The sculpture was found on a bookshelf. The sculpture comprised two parts: an elaborate cap made of a wing of finely cut paper feathers, and a pair of gloves with 'bumblebee' stripes.

The note accompanying the sculptures was written on both sides. It described the inspiration for the sculptures, a quote from the poem "Gifts"&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt; by Scottish poet [[Norman MacCaig]]:  "To @ByLeavesWeLive....... The gifts 'Gloves of bee's fur, cap of the Wren's Wings.......' Norman McCaig .... maybe sometimes impossible things... In support of Libraries, Books, Words Ideas...." and "10/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

A longer note accompanying the piece made clear that this sculpture was the last in a series of ten sculptures:

"It's important that a story is not too long ……does not become tedious ……. 'You need to know when to end a story,' she thought. Often a good story ends where it begins. This would mean a return to the Poetry Library. The very place where she had left the first of the ten. Back to those who had loved that little tree, and so encouraged her to try again …….and again. Some had wondered who it was, leaving these small strange objects. Some even thought it was a ‘he’! ……. As if!  Others looked among Book Artists, rather good ones actually…….  But they would never find her there. For though she does make things, this was the first time she had dissected books and had used them simply because they seemed fitting…. Most however chose not to know….. which was the point really. The gift, the place to sit, to look, to wonder, to dream….. of the impossible maybe…….  
A tiny gesture in support of the special places…. So, here, she will end this story, in a special place … A Poetry Library …. where they are well used to 'anon.' But before exiting …a few mentions. There could be more, because we have all colluded to make this work……. Just a few though. 
* the twitter community who in some strange way gave rise to the idea in the first place
* [https://twitter.com/chrisdonia @chrisdonia] who gave the story a place, a shape and some great pictures
* and not least [https://twitter.com/beathhigh @Beathhigh] whose books and reputation have been shamelessly utilised in the making of a mystery …….
…… But hold on. Someone’s left behind a pair of gloves and a cap……….?
Cheers Edinburgh It’s been fun! X"&lt;ref name=GdnDec11/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The revelation that this was the tenth sculpture caused some concern, as only eight were known of at this point.  It was feared that the other two might have been lost or stolen or even simply thrown away by someone who didn’t realise what they had found.

===Ninth sculpture===
The ninth sculpture was found on 24 November 2011 at the [[National Museum of Scotland]], where it had been placed on the plinth under a stag skeleton.  It comprised a [[tyrannosaurus rex]] bursting out of a copy of [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. Small human figures with weapons were amongst the shredded leaves of the book.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/ntlmuseumsscot @NtlMuseumsScot] A Gift Your friends at @edbookfest suggested you might like this. …. In support of libraries, books, words, ideas and those places that house our treasures……". and "9/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Tenth sculpture===
This sculpture was the eighth in the gift chain, but was the last to be found, on 24 November 2011.  It was found at the [[Writers' Museum]] in Edinburgh, on top of the donations box in the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] room.  It comprises a moonlit street scene, and is fashioned from a copy of Ian Rankin's second Rebus novel, ''[[Hide and Seek (Ian Rankin novel)|Hide and Seek]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  It bore the words "commingled out of Good and evil", which is a quote from Stevenson's ''[[Jekyll and Hyde]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "[https://twitter.com/curatoremg @CuratorEMG] A Gift 'The stories are in the stones' Ian Rankin In support of Libraries, Books, Words, Ideas …… and Writers." and "8/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Eleventh sculpture===
Although the artists had said that the series comprised ten sculptures, on 25 November 2011 an eleventh was delivered to the Edinburgh Bookshop, an independent booksellers, addressed to Ian Rankin.

The sculpture comprises two skeletons sitting on a coffin lid; the open coffin is cut out of a (real) old book.  The skeletons are drinking and smoking, and listening to a record on a portable record player. The record sleeve reads "The Impossible Dead/Ian Rankin/Some Secrets Never Die" and the coffin lid reads "R.I.P. 13/10/11".  13 October 2011 was the publishing date of Rankin's novel ''[[The Impossible Dead]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For @Beathhigh A Gift "… something in us never dies" ([[Robert Burns|R. Burns]] 1790) In support of those who turn ideas into words, words into books …… &amp; of course books into libraries." and "11/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

@Beathhigh is Ian Rankin's Twitter account name.

==Reaction==
The sculptures, and the mystery over the identity of their creator, made local, then national and international news.&lt;ref name=SPLJuly12&gt;{{cite news|title=Gifted: The Edinburgh Book Sculptures on Tour 2012|url=http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/connect/blog/gifted-edinburgh-book-sculptures-tour-2012|work=Scottish Poetry Library|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of December 2012, the identity of the creator has still not been revealed.

The ten Edinburgh sculptures were brought together in December 2011 for a one night private exhibition at the [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12/&gt;

The Edinburgh sculptures were sent on a small 'mini tour' of Scotland between 17 August and 8 December 2012, appearing at Aberdeen Central Library, Dundee Central Library, [[Wigtown Book Festival]], Mitchell Library, Glasgow, [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] and the Scottish Poetry Library.&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt; In the book ''giftED''&lt;ref name=Birlinn&gt;{{cite news|title=GiftED II? - The Literary Banksy Strikes Again|url=http://birlinnbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/gifted-ii-literary-banksy-strikes-again.html|work=Birlinn Books|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was published in time for the tour, the sculptor wrote that at the heart of the project was "a woman, who had been a girl, whose life would have been less rich had she been unable to wander freely into libraries, art galleries and museums. A woman who, now all grown, still wants access to these places and yes, wants them for her children...".&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12/&gt; The photographs in the book are by Chris Scott.

In July 2012 it was reported that a documentary about the sculptures, featuring Ian Rankin and [[Rory Bremner]], is being made.&lt;ref name=SPLJuly12/&gt;

After the tour concluded the original ten sculptures were sent back to their original locations with the bespoke plinths made for the exhibition with the intention that they continue to be accessible to the public.

==2012: Flowers==
In August 2012 the sculptor left fifty paper flower sculptures around the site of the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]], each with the [[Oscar Wilde]] quote "… freedom, books, flowers and the moon" and on the reverse "A Gift For You" and a limited edition number of /50.&lt;ref name=Birlinn/&gt;

==2012: Five Book Week Scotland sculptures==
In November 2012 it was announced that the sculptor had been approached via an anonymous email account and had agreed to make five more sculptures that were to be hidden around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, and that the finders would be given another small sculpture as a prize. Online clues to their whereabouts were released, one a day between 26 and 30 November 2012. Each sculpture was found on the day the clue was released; the person to reach it first each day received a paper sculpture trophy in the shape of a teacup, themed on the book and reading "A winning cop and a good book - the perfect combination" on the top.

===First sculpture===
The first was found on 26 November 2012 at [[Glasgow School of Art]]. It is a book sculpture inspired by [[Alasdair Gray]]'s classic novel ''[[Lanark: A Life in Four Books]]''.&lt;ref name=BBCDec12&gt;{{cite news|title=New chapter for mystery book sculptures|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20466495|work=BBC|date=26 November 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finder's prize was a sculpture of a small teacup with elements of the ''Lanark'' theme.&lt;ref name=SBT&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Sculptures: The Full Set|url=http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/book-sculptures-the-full-set|work=Scottish Book Trust|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lanark'' sculpture is now displayed next to the Glasgow School of Art shop during opening hours.

===Second sculpture===
The second sculpture was found at the [[Robert Burns Birthplace Museum]] in [[Alloway]], and the sculpture was based on the Robert Burns poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O' Shanter]]" - which is set in Alloway. The finder's prize was a teacup featuring a horse's tail, a reference to the poem. The sculpture is on display at the Museum.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Third sculpture===
The third sculpture was found at the ''Am Politician'' pub on the [[Eriskay|Isle of Eriskay]], where the nine pupils of the Eriskay Primary School found the sculpture based on the [[Compton Mackenzie]] novel ''[[Whisky Galore (novel)|Whisky Galore]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a bottle labelled 'whisky galore' on the top. The sculpture is on display at the pub.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Fourth sculpture===
The fourth sculpture was found at [[J M Barrie]]'s birthplace in [[Kirriemuir]], and was based on ''[[Peter Pan]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a hook-tipped spout.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Fifth sculpture===
The fifth sculpture was found at the [[Scottish Seabird Centre]], [[North Berwick]], and was based on [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]’s ''[[Treasure Island]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a palm tree on the top.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

==2012: Another gift==
In November 2012 a third sculpture was given to the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], with the instructions that the box in which it was held was not to be opened until 7 December 2012 - the last day of the exhibition of the original ten. Built upon a copy of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s poetry collection [[A Child's Garden of Verses]] it featured a girl sitting under a tree, wearing a crown and reading a book, while the facing page shows Stevenson's poem, "To My Mother".

In the tree are the words, "You in a garden green" and "With me were king and"; on the girl's crown is the word "Queen". On the trunk of the tree are the words, "Were hunter, soldier, tar" and the inside of the small book reads, "And all the thousand things that children are". Some bunting dangling from the tree read "But time, which none can bind, While flowing fast away, leaves love behind." These are all lines from Stevenson's poem, "To Willie And Henrietta".

The note accompanying the sculpture read: " .... For the Love of Books.   Every ending marks a new beginning."&lt;ref name=SPLDec12&gt;{{cite news|title=Day Seven of the SPL advent calendar - The final book sculpture|url=http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/connect/blog/day-seven-spl-advent-calendar-final-book-sculpture|work=Scottish Poetry Library|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013: Preparing to fly==
In May 2013 a new sculpture was left in the Scottish Poetry library. This comprises three blue paper eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdhouse; the nest is on a platform with threads that allow it to be lifted out - the [https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisdonia/8958718010/ instructions] that came with it say, "Nest can sit at bottom, hang midway or be outside birdbox - it's yours now!" The box has images and text on either side with gold leaf in places.
The eggs are threaded together with slips of paper which read, "Preparing to start", "Sleeping in the woods" and "Life's little things"; the eggs have the words, "nest-egg", "new moon" and "great ovation" stuck to them. The tag reads simply, "Preparing to Fly 1/3  In support of libraries, words, book, ideas ........ x".

In June 2013 [[Leith Library]] received a sculpture of three baby birds in a nest, addressed both to the library itself ([https://twitter.com/leithlibrary @leithlibrary]) and to their Reader in Residence Emily Dodd ([https://twitter.com/auntyemily @auntyemily]), only the second time one of the sculptures has been addressed to a person.  Included with the book sculpture was a quote from A.A.Milne "It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like 'what about lunch?'.  In support of libraries, books, words, ideas. Preparing to Fly 2/3".

==2014: Butterflies On The Move==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
As part of the Macmillan Art Exhibition called 'Inspired' held in Bonhams, Edinburgh, an intricate work of butterflies emerging from a book was delivered, anonymously. This book sculpture was auctioned to raise funds for this charity{{which?|date=October 2017}}. It was bought by the Mackenzie family{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of Edinburgh, who decided to tour this 'Butterflies' sculpture on a not-for-profit basis so that a wider audience could see it. The idea was that the generosity of the artist and the story should continue to inspire others, especially youngsters and those that had not yet been able to experience the 'book sculpture library tour' in Edinburgh. The Butterflies sculpture visited the following locations: The War Poets library, Edinburgh Napier University; BBC Scotland, Pacific Quay; Killin library, Killin; John Gray Library, East Lothian; Kirkwall library, Orkney; Glasgow Museum's Resource Centre, South Nitshill, Glasgow; Abbotsford House, Borders; Crighton  Library, Dumfries; Aberdeen Central Library, Aberdeen. The sculpture's tour finished in the Scottish Parliament and was commented upon by [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]s and the First Minister. A 'time for reflection' parliamentary speech was given by Dr Colin Mackenzie, thanking the artist for her generosity and inspiration. 

During the tour the artist offered to collaborate with members of the public who sent in their own paper butterflies.

In January 2015 the artist gave an email interview to the BBC, in which she hinted that more sculptures were to come: "What makes you think 'Butterflies' is my most recent sculpture?".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30697553&lt;/ref&gt;

==The final curtain==

In March 2015 the artist announced that the time had come "to draw time on the project". The last sculpture would be a collaboration with the public. A request was made for the public to make their own butterflies before 31 July 2015. These butterflies would be made into a final sculpture.

== 2016: The Butterfly Tree and Lost Child==
The final paper sculpture was a collaboration with the general public in response to the Butterfly On The Move Tour. Butterflies flew in from all over the world and from all different age groups of contributors. The resulting sculpture was a 6'6' high tree with butterflies as 'leaves'. The tree was supported by a 'lost child'. The sculpture appeared at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August, 2016. A hand illustrated book was left with the sculpture. It tells the fictional story of the Butterfly Tree and how it reached out and comforted the Lost Child.
The artist intends to remain unknown.

The '''Seuso Treasure''' or '''Sevso Treasure''' ({{lang-hu|Seuso-kincsek}}; {{lang-hr|Seusovo blago}}), is a [[hoard]] of [[silver]] objects (14 items) from the late [[Roman Empire]]. The first pieces appeared on the market in [[London]] in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]]. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of [[Lebanon]]. It was put up for sale in [[New York City]] in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of [[Hungary]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Lebanon]] made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. [[Scotland Yard]] still has an open case on the matter.

The origin and [[provenance]] of the treasure are likely known, but not publicly acknowledged. There is much scientific evidence to indicate that the hoard was first acquired in the 1970s after the murder of a Hungarian soldier, who discovered the treasure during illicit digging at an established archaeological site in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Time Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide/series-119/episode-3 |title=Time Team Specials – The Mystery of the Roman Treasure – Channel 4 |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2014 [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]] announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been bought by Hungary.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20140326_Orban_Magyarorszag_visszaszerezte_a_Seuso#rss |title=Orbán: Magyarország visszaszerezte a Seuso-kincset |publisher=hvg.hu |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/03/26/3101774/hungary-buys-back-7-roman-era.html?sp=/99/109/ |title=Hungary buys back 7 Roman-era silver trays, jugs|publisher=idahostatesman.com |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister described it as "Hungary's family silverware".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbj.hu/budapest/sevso-treasure-hungarys-family-silverware-returned_77609 |title=Sevso Treasure, "Hungary's family silverware," returned |publisher=Budapest Business Journal |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 the remaining seven artifacts also got back to Hungary, for a sum of €28 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20170712_Baan_hetek_ota_itthon_van_a_Seusokincs_a_TEK_hozta_haza |title=Baán: Hetek óta itthon van a Seuso-kincs, a TEK hozta haza |publisher=HVG |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The [[treasure trove]] consists of 14 large decorated silver vessels and the copper cauldron which contained them, and has been dated to the late 4th or early 5th century AD. Most notable is a large dish, 70&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and weighing nearly 9&amp;nbsp;kg, which bears the inscription:

: ''Hec Sevso tibi durent per saecula multa''
: ''Posteris ut prosint vascula digna tuis''

: May these, O Seuso, yours for many ages be
: Small vessels fit to serve your offspring worthily.

==Discovery==
[[File:Sümegh józsef 02.jpg|thumb|right|190px|József Sümegh, who is claimed to have found the treasure around 1975–76 near Polgárdi]]The hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from [[Vienna]] was offered for sale in London. Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]].&lt;ref name="ATG"&gt;[http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no Antiques Trade Gazette] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001509/http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no |date=2007-09-29 }}, 30 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]] for $10&amp;nbsp;million. When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], described as being from "what was once the province of [[Phoenicia]] in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]".

=== Legal wrangling ===
The sale was halted when documentation was thought to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon each made claims of ownership. Hungarian authorities claim that the treasure was discovered by a young soldier, József Sümegh, in around 1975–76 near the town of [[Polgárdi]] in central Hungary. Sümegh's dead body was found in a nearby cellar in 1980. The official investigation at the time determined that he had committed suicide, but later the police came to the conclusion that he had been killed.&lt;ref name = "Múlt-Kor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mult-kor.hu/cikk.php?id=20036&amp;pIdx=2 |title=Helyi divattal igazolják a Seuso-kincsek eredetét – Hírek – Múlt-kor történelmi magazin |publisher=mult-kor.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 the criminal investigation is still ongoing.&lt;ref name = "HVG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon.bunugy/20120803_seuso_gyilkossag |title=Bűnügy: Bors: újra nyomoz az NNI a Seuso-kincseket megtaláló Sümegh meggyilkolása ügyében – HVG.hu |publisher=hvg.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yugoslavia's case was based on claims that the treasure had been originally found on 30 June 1960, in the village of [[Barbariga, Croatia|Barbariga]] in [[Istria]] (present-day [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; The village is some 20 kilometres north of the city of [[Pula]], an important city in Roman times. According to local witnesses, the treasure had been discovered in old trenches in a nearby [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) compound.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; In the 1980s the JNA gave permission to local archeologists, led by [[Vesna Girardi-Jurkić]], to further excavate the site. According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports of army excavations, the 14 known artefacts were only a small part of a much larger treasure trove as it took soldiers and police brought to the site six days to list all the items found at the site. However, very few details of the project were ever released to the public as the alleged site was entirely within a military area closed off to civilians.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; Yugoslav archaeologists' efforts eventually failed to provide any conclusive evidence for the treasure's origin, although the soil residue found on the artefacts was proved to match the samples of soil from the area.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; After the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] the newly independent Croatia pressed on with the case and included the results of the soil analysis in its formal ownership claim to a New York court.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peritz|first1=Romina|title=Borba za neprocjenjivo Seusovo blago|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/borba-za-neprocjenjivo-seusovo-blago-%E2%80%98do-zadnjeg-smo-vjerovali-da-jehrvatsko%E2%80%99/988673/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hyppolitus készlet.jpg|thumb|The Hippolytus set]]

In November 1993, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] rejected the claims, and found no case for removing it from the possession of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement (a trust established by the Marquess of Northampton).&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 203 A.D.2d 167, 610 N.Y.S.2d 263 (1994); ''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 232 A.D.2d 616, 648 N.Y.S.2d 25 (1st Dep't 1996).)&lt;/ref&gt; The silver was locked away in a bank vault while further legal proceedings followed. The Marquess sued his solicitors [[Allen &amp; Overy]] for damages in relation to advice given during the purchase of the silver, and that case was settled out of court in 1999 for a reported £15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1999, in written answers to questions in the [[House of Lords]], the British government confirmed that it had no further interest in the case and confirmed the decision not to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Stationery"&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=United Kingdom|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|title=Sevso Case: Decision not to Prosecute|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|date=25 June 1999|column=WA111|access-date=2018-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012090039/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|archive-date=2006-10-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian claim of possession is likely justified by the fact that on one of the main plates, the "Hunting Plate", an inscription is to be seen. It reads "Pelso", the Roman name for [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary; the lake is just west of the alleged place of discovery.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law|author1=Gibbon, K.F. |author2=American Council for Cultural Policy|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813536873 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PigTNxl30ZgC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also near to the lake, in 1873 a Roman [[tripod]] (later restored, upon which it was discovered that it is a quadripod) was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Seuso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands. It is housed in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/11/the-curse-of-the-sevso-silver/302331/|title=The Curse of the Sevso Silver – The Atlantic|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
In September 2006, London auctioneer [[Bonhams]] announced that it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a sale by private treaty or by auction at a future date.&lt;ref name="ATG" /&gt; A spokesman for the [[Minister of Education (Hungary)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] of Hungary, which still claims it, said it had informed British authorities that it must not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.hu/culture/history/news/D999_news_200486.html "Sevso Treasure Up For Sale" at culture.hu – Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture.]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn]], particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|admission to the European Union]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61012w0001.htm ''Hansard''] 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition on 17 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/afrontpage/pdf/tancurrent.pdf Art Newspaper], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2393777,00.html Times] and [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1924109,00.html Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vadász tál - Seuso kiállítás, Országház (3).JPG|thumb|right|The "Hunting plate" in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]]]

In March 2007, ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' reported that a further "187 silvergilt spoons, 37 silvergilt drinking cups, and 5 silver bowls", previously unknown, but part of the original hoard, were reputed to exist.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=581 |title=The silver missing from the Sevso hoard? |publisher=theartnewspaper.com |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research presented in February 2008 by the Hungarian archaeologist Zsolt Visy strengthened the view that the origin of the treasure may be the Lake Balaton region of Hungary.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/blog/lisa-westcott/sevso-treasure.htm |title=Archaeology of the Sevso Treasure &amp;#124; Current Archaeology  |publisher=archaeology.co.uk|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Channel 4]] archaeology programme ''[[Time Team]]'' aired a [[Time Team (specials)#2008|special on the treasure]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="channel4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide |title=Time Team Specials – Episode Guide – Channel 4  |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme presented Hungary's evidence for the likely origin of the hoard being near the town of [[Polgárdi]]. The Marquess of Northampton withdrew from planned participation in the programme and Channel 4 was not given permission to film the treasure, held in a vault at Bonhams auctioneers in London.

==Return to Hungary==
On 26 March 2014, [[Viktor Orbán]], the Hungarian prime minister, announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been returned to Hungary, for a sum of €15 million.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2" /&gt; The seven artifacts were put on temporary display at the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] on 29 March 2014. On 12 July 2017, the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Hungarian PM]] announced that another seven pieces had been brought back to Hungary, and will be displayed together with the seven items returned to Hungary in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20170712_orban_seuso_kincs_hazakerult#rss |title=Orbán: Hazakerült a Seuso-kincsek további hét darabja |publisher=hvg.hu |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The items will be moved to the Budapest [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] by 2018, where they are intended to be a centrepiece of the new museum's quarter.

'''''The Astronomer''''' is a painting finished in about 1668 by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]]. It is oil on canvas, {{convert|51|x|45|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and is on display at the [[Louvre]], in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref name="louvre"&gt;{{cite web

Portrayals of scientists were a favourite topic in 17th-century Dutch painting&lt;ref name="louvre" /&gt; and Vermeer's oeuvre includes both this astronomer and the slightly later ''[[The Geographer]]''. Both are believed to portray the same man,&lt;ref name="viewdeelft"&gt;{{cite book

The astronomer's profession is shown by the celestial globe (version by [[Jodocus Hondius]]) and the book on the table, the 1621 edition of [[Adriaan Metius]]'s ''Institutiones Astronomicae Geographicae''.&lt;ref name="viewdeelft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vermeer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldvermeer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welu" &gt;{{cite journal | author = Welu, James |year = 1986 | title = Vermeer's Astronomer: Observations on an Open Book | journal = Art Bulletin |volume = 68 |  pages = 263–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically, the volume is open to Book III, a section advising the astronomer to seek "inspiration from God" and the painting on the wall shows the [[Finding of Moses]]—Moses may represent knowledge and science ("learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians").&lt;ref&gt;Acts 7:22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==
[[File:Catalogus of naamlyst van schilderyen, met derzelven pryzen p 242.jpg|thumb|left|75px|1720 catalog listing the work.]]
[[File:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Johannes Vermeer]], ''[[The Geographer]]'' 1668-69 oil on canvas; 53×47 cm. Steadelsches Kunstinstitut, [[Frankfurt, Germany]]. ''The Geographer'' used the same model and other elements as ''The Astronomer''.]]
The provenance of ''The Astronomer'' can be traced back to 27 April 1713, when it was sold at the Rotterdam sale of an unknown collector (possibly {{Interlanguage link multi|Adriaen Paets|nl|3=Adriaen Paets (1657-1712)}} or his father, of Rotterdam) together with ''[[The Geographer]]''. The presumed buyer was [[Hendrik Sorgh]], whose estate sale held in Amsterdam on 28 March 1720 included both ''The Astronomer'' and ''The Geographer'', which were described as ‘Een Astrologist: door Vermeer van Delft, extra puyk’ (An [[Astrology|Astrologist]] by Vermeer of Delft, topnotch) and ‘Een weerga, van ditto, niet minder’ (Similar by ditto, no less).

Between 1881 and 1888 it was sold by the Paris art dealer [[Léon Gauchez]] to the banker and art collector [[Alphonse James de Rothschild]], after whose death it was inherited by his son, [[Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild]]. In 1940 it was seized from his hotel in Paris by the [[Nazi]] ''[[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] für die Besetzten Gebiete''{{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} after the German invasion of France. A small [[swastika]] was stamped on the back in black ink. The painting was returned to the Rothschilds after the war, and was acquired by the French state as giving in payment of inheritance taxes in 1983&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oZyV38q6Wt4C&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=vermeer+astronomer+inheritance+tax&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2Myv2sRhS&amp;sig=owzWTLpkk5zwNCUPtVOO894LH3M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GfVdTZPrGcfogQeKubyCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=vermeer%20astronomer%20inheritance%20tax&amp;f=false Lottman, Herbert R.

[[Image:Vasnetsov Frog Princess.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Viktor Vasnetsov]], ''The Frog Tsarevna'', 1918.]]

'''The Frog Princess''' is a [[fairy tale]] that has multiple versions with various origins. It is classified as type 402, the animal bride, in the [[Aarne–Thompson|Aarne–Thompson index]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 224, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale of this type is ''[[Doll i' the Grass]]''.&lt;ref name="ashliman"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0402.html Animal Brides: folktales of Aarne–Thompson type 402 and related stories]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian language|Russian]] variants include the ''Frog Princess'' or ''[[Tsarevna]] Frog'' (''Царевна Лягушка'', ''Tsarevna Lyagushka'')&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|Russian Wonder Tales/The Frog-Tzarevna|The Frog-Tzarevna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also '''Vasilisa the Wise''' (''Василиса Премудрая'', ''Vasilisa Premudraya''); [[Alexander Afanasyev]] collected variants in his ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]''. [[Andrew Lang]] included an Italian variant titled '''The Frog''' in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Violet Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/055.htm "The Frog"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italo Calvino]] included another Italian variant from Piedmont, '''The Prince Who Married a Frog''', in ''[[Italian Folktales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 438 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he noted that the tale was common throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 718 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgios A. Megas included a Greek variant, '''The Enchanted Lake''', in ''Folktales of Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 49, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The [[Monarch|king]] (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a [[frog]]. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to-be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess.

In Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Out-everywhere-Tales-new-world/dp/0888994028 Out of the Everywhere: New Tales for Canada, Jan Andrews]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivan Bilibin 054 full.jpeg|thumb|250px|Illustration to ''The Frog Tsarevna'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]
In the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocratic and wealthy [[merchant]]. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled girl who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying [[Koschei]]. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with [[Baba Yaga]], whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a [[bird]]. The prince catches her, she turns into a [[lizard]], and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] sister, he catches her and no [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|transformations]] can break her free again.

In some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along.

==Variants==
This tale is closely related to ''[[Puddocky]]'' and its variants, in which a king sets three tasks to his sons to determine which is best suited to rule the country, and a transformed frog helps the youngest prince.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1939 Soviet film directed by [[Aleksandr Rou]], is based on this plot. It was the first large-budget feature in the [[Soviet Union]] to use fantasy elements, as opposed to the [[Socialist realism|realistic]] style long favored politically.&lt;ref&gt;James Graham, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html Baba Yaga in Film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1953 the director [[Mikhail Tsekhanovsky]] had the idea of animating this popular national fairy tale. Production took two years, and the premiere took place in December, 1954. At present the film is included in the gold classics of "[[Soyuzmultfilm]]". &lt;!-- In 1960 it won the "Silver Oak Leaf" prize on the [[IFF]] in Mar del Plata (Argentina).  SEE TALK PAGE, "Mar del Plata".--&gt;
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1977 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1977 Soviet animated film is also based on this fairy tale.
* In 1996, a animated Russian version based on an in-depth version of the tale in the film "Classic Fairy Tales From Around the World" on VHS. This version tells of how the beautiful Princess Vasilisa was kidnapped and cursed by the evil wizard Kashay to make her his bride and only the love of the handsome Prince Ivan can free her.
* Taking inspiration from the Russian story, Vasilisa appears to assist Hellboy against Koschei in the 2007 [[comic book]] ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]''.
* The Frog Princess was featured in ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', where it was depicted in a country setting. The episode features the voice talents of [[Jasmine Guy]] as Frog Princess Lylah, [[Greg Kinnear]] as Prince Gavin, [[Wallace Langham]] as Prince Bobby, [[Mary Gross]] as Elise, and [[Beau Bridges]] as King Big Daddy.

'''The Funny Manns''' is an [[United States|American]] [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television]] program that first appeared in 1961. It was hosted by [[Cliff Norton]] and featured re-edited [[public domain]] [[silent movie]]s, much as [[Jay Ward]]'s show [[Fractured Flickers]] did. There are 130 black &amp; white episodes produced for NBC. The show was co-produced by [[Nick Nicholson (producer)|Nick Nicholson]], who sometimes performed on the show's skits with Norton. It was broadcast by the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The program would always begin with Cliff Norton as some type of handyman, whether it was a painter, repairman, or even a plumber, and as he began dialog, he would use the lines "I learned everything I know from my (Uncle/Father/etc.)," and "Alright, who's the funny man?" Then, it would cut to the edited silent films. 

The silent stars appearing on the show included [[Snub Pollard]], Poodles Hanneford, [[Billy Bevan]], [[Oliver Hardy]] (minus his partner, [[Stan Laurel]]) and a young [[Mickey Rooney]], billed as "Mickey McGuire".

[[File:Piero della Francesca 042 Flagellation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.00|[[Piero della Francesca]], ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.]]
This article about '''the development of themes in Italian Renaissance painting''' is an extension to the article [[Italian Renaissance painting]], for which it provides additional pictures with commentary. The works encompassed are from [[Giotto]] in the early 14th century to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgement]]'' of the 1530s.

The themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution- what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a [[Medieval]] painter. Certain characteristic elements of [[Renaissance]] painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element.

==Themes==
The ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]] (above) demonstrates in a single small work many of the themes of Italian Renaissance painting, both in terms of compositional elements and subject matter. Immediately apparent is Piero's mastery of perspective and light. The architectural elements, including the tiled floor which becomes more complex around the central action, combine to create two spaces. The inner space is lit by an unseen light source to which Jesus looks. Its exact location can be pinpointed mathematically by an analysis of the diffusion and the angle of the shadows on the coffered ceiling. The three figures who are standing outside are lit from a different angle, from both daylight and light reflected from the pavement and buildings.

The religious theme is tied to the present. The ruler is a portrait of the visiting Emperor of [[Constantinople|Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;John VIII Palaeologus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flagellation]] is also called "scourging". The term "scourge" was applied to the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Outside stand three men representing those who buried the body of Christ. The two older, [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathaea]], are believed to be portraits of men who recently lost their sons, one of them to plague. The third man is the young disciple [[St. John the Evangelist|John]], and is perhaps a portrait of one of the sons, or else represents both of them in a single idealised figure, coinciding with the manner in which Piero painted angels.

==Elements of Renaissance painting==
Renaissance painting differed from the painting of the Late Medieval period in its emphasis upon the close observation of nature, particularly with regards to human anatomy, and the application of scientific principles to the use of perspective and light.
&lt;!---NOTE RE FORMAT: These galleries are carefully arranged in a 4 per row format. This has been done in order to facilitate comaparisons between adjacent paintings, both horizontally and vertically. In other words, they are laid out with the same care as the curator empoys in a realworld gallery exhibition. Please do not return them to the "single row" format, as it is counterproductive to this particular article.---&gt;

===Linear perspective===
The pictures in the gallery below show the development of linear perspective in buildings and cityscapes. 
* In [[Giotto]]'s fresco, the building is like a stage set with one side open to the viewer.
* In [[Paolo Uccello]]'s fresco, the townscape gives an impression of depth.
* [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' was painted with carefully calculated mathematical proportions, in which he was probably assisted by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].
* [[Fra Angelico]] uses the simple motif of a small [[loggia]] accurately drafted to create an intimate space.
* [[Gentile Bellini]] has painted a vast space, the [[Piazza San Marco]] in [[Venice]], in which the receding figures add to the sense of perspective.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] did detailed and measured drawings of the background Classical ruins preparatory to commencing the unfinished ''Adoration of the Magi''.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] created an exceptionally complex and expansive setting on three levels, including a steeply descending ramp and a jutting wall. Elements of the landscape, such as the church on the right, are viewed partly through other structures.
* [[Raphael]]'s design for ''Fire in the Borgo'' shows buildings around a small square in which the background events are highlighted by the perspective.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Landscape===
The depiction of landscape was encouraged by the development of linear perspective and the inclusion of detailed landscapes in the background of many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s of the 15th century. Also through this influence came an awareness of [[atmospheric perspective]] and the observation of the way distant things are affected by light. 
* Giotto uses a few rocks to give the impression of a mountain setting.
* Paolo Uccello has created a detailed and surreal setting as a stage for many small scenes.
* In [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''Deposition of the Body of Christ'', the desolate rocky landscape echoes the tragedy of the scene.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s landscape has a sculptural, three-dimensional quality that is suggestive of a real physical space. The details of the rocks, their strata and fractures, suggest that he studied the [[geology|geological]] formations of the red [[limestone]] prevalent in areas of Northern Italy.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] sets the grim scene of the ''[[Crucifixion (Antonello da Messina)|Crucifixion]]'' in contrast to the placid countryside which rolls into the far distance, becoming paler and bluer as it recedes.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] has created a detailed landscape with a pastoral scene between the foreground and background mountains. There are numerous levels in this landscape, making it the equivalent of Ghirlandaio's complex cityscape (above).
* [[Perugino]] has set the ''Adoration of the Magi'' against the familiar hilly landscape of [[Umbria]].
* Leonardo da Vinci, displays a theatrical use of [[atmospheric perspective]] in his view of the precipitous mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] at the foothills of the [[Alps]] in Northern Italy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Light===
Light and shade exist in a painting in two forms. Tone is simply the lightness and darkness of areas of a picture, graded from white to black. Tonal arrangement is a very significant feature of some paintings. [[Chiaroscuro]] is the modelling of apparent surfaces within a picture by the suggestion of light and shadow. While tone was an important feature of paintings of the Medieval period, chiaroscuro was not. It became increasingly important to painters of the 15th century, transforming the depiction of three-dimensional space.
* [[Taddeo Gaddi]]'s ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' is the first known large painting of a night scene. The internal light source of the picture is the angel.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting, daylight, which appears to come from the actual window of the friary cell which this fresco adorns, gently illuminates the figures and defines the architecture.
* In his [[Histories of the True Cross|''Emperor's Dream'']], [[Piero della Francesca]] takes up the theme of the night scene illuminated by an angel and applies his scientific knowledge of the diffusion of light. The tonal pattern thus created is a significant element in the composition of the painting.
* In his ''[[Agony in the Garden (Bellini)|Agony in the Garden]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]] uses the fading sunset on a cloudy evening to create an atmosphere of tension and impending tragedy.
* In [[Domenico Veneziano]]'s formal portrait, the use of chiaroscuro to model the form is slight. However, the painting relies strongly on the tonal contrasts of the pale face, mid-tone background and dark garment with patterned bodice for effect.
* [[Botticelli]] uses chiaroscuro to model the face of the sitter and define the details of his simple garment. The light and shadow on the edge of the window define the angle of the light.
* The suggested authorship of this early-16th-century portrait {{Clarify |reason=Unclear which painting; refer to by name|date=October 2018}} includes [[Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio]], [[Mariotto Albertinelli]] and [[Giuliano Bugiardini]]. The painting combines many of the lighting effects of the other works in this gallery. The form is modelled by the light and shade, as if by a setting sun, which gives an element of drama, enhanced by the landscape. The tonal pattern created by the dark garment, the white linen and position of the hand is a compositional feature of the painting.
* In [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]'', elements of the painting, including the corners of the model's eyes and mouth, are disguised by shadow, creating an air of ambiguity and mystery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Anatomy===
While remaining largely dependent upon topographic observation, the knowledge of anatomy was advanced by Leonardo da Vinci's meticulous dissection of 30 corpses. Leonardo, among others, impressed upon students the necessity of the close observation of life and made the drawing of live models an essential part of a student's formal study of the art of painting. 
* [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifixion]]'', extensively destroyed by flood in 1966, shows the formal arrangement, with curving body and drooping head that was prevalent in late Medieval art. The anatomy is strongly stylised to conform with traditional iconic formula.
* [[Giotto]] abandoned the traditional formula and painted from observation.
* [[Massacio]]'s figure of Christ is foreshortened as if viewed from below, and shows the upper torso strained as if with the effort of breathing.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Deposition'' the artist, while not attempting to suggest the brutal realities of the crucifixion, has attempted to give the impression of death.
* In [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''Baptism'', the robust figure of Jesus is painted with a simplicity and lack of sharply defined muscularity that belies its naturalism.
* The figure of Jesus in this painting, which is the combined work of [[Verrocchio]] and the young Leonardo, has in all probability been drafted by Verrocchio. The contours retain the somewhat contorted linearity of Gothic art. Much of the torso, however, is thought to have been painted by Leonardo and reveals a strong knowledge of anatomical form.
* Leonardo's picture of St. Jerome shows the results of detailed study of the shoulder girdle, known from a page of drawings.
* [[Michelangelo]] used human anatomy to great expressive effect. He was renowned for his ability in the creation of expressive poses and was imitated by many other painters and sculptors.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Realism===
The observation of nature meant that set forms and symbolic gestures which in Medieval art, and particularly the Byzantine style prevalent in much of Italy, were used to convey meaning, were replaced by the representation of human emotion as displayed by a range of individuals. 
*In this ''Resurrection'', [[Giotto]] shows the sleeping soldiers with faces hidden by helmets or foreshortened to emphasise the relaxed posture.
*In contrast, [[Andrea Castagno]] has painted a life-sized image of the condotierre, Pippo Spano, alert and with his feet over the edge of the painted niche which frames him.
*[[Filippo Lippi]] in this early work shows a very naturalistic group of children crowding around the Virgin Mary, but looking with innocent curiosity at the viewer. One of the children has [[Down syndrome]].
* [[Masaccio]] depicts the grief resulting from loss of innocence as [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from the presence of God.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] painted several versions of ''[[Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina)|Ecce Homo]]'', the tormented Christ as he was presented to the people by the Roman Governor. Such paintings usually show Christ in a tragic but heroic role, minimising the depiction of suffering. Antonello's depictions are starkly realistic.
* In his ''[[Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead christ]]'', [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] has here depicted the dead body of Jesus with daring foreshortening, as if the viewer were standing at the end of the slab.
* In this detail from a larger painting, Mantegna shows a little child, wearing a tummy-binder and holey slippers, turning away and chewing its fingers while the infant Christ is circumcised.
* [[Giorgione]] paints a natural and unglamorised portrait of an old woman, unusual in its depiction of her illkempt hair and open mouth with crooked teeth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Figure composition===
Among the preoccupations of artists commissioned to do large works with multiple figures were how to make the subject, usually narrative, easily read by the viewer, natural in appearance and well composed within the picture space. 
* [[Giotto]] combines three separate narrative elements into this dramatic scene set against the dehumanising helmets of the guards. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays [[Jesus]] to the soldiers by kissing him. The High Priest signals to a guard to seize him. Peter slices the ear off the high priest's servant as he steps forward to lay hands on Jesus. Five figures dominate the foreground, surrounding Jesus so that only his head is visible. Yet by skillful arrangement of color and the gestures of the men, Giotto makes the face of Jesus the focal point of the painting.
* In ''The Death of Adam'', [[Piero della Francesca]] has set the dying patriarch so that he is cast into relief against the black garment worn by one of his family. His importance to the story is further emphasised by the arch of figures formed around him and the diagonals of the arms which all lead to his head. p
* ''The Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'' is a remarkably cohesive whole, considering that it was begun by [[Masaccio]], left unfinished, vandalised, and eventually completed by [[Filippino Lippi]]. Masaccio painted the central section.
* [[Pollaiuolo]], in this highly systemised painting, has taken the [[cross-bow]] used by the archers in the foreground, as the compositional structure. Within this large triangular shape, divided vertically, he has alternated the figures between front and back views.
* [[Botticelli]]'s long, narrow painting of ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Mars and Venus]]'' is based on a W with the figures mirroring each other. The lovers, who shortly before were united, are now separated by sleep. The three small fawns who process across the painting hold the composition together.
* [[Michelangelo]]s mastery of complex figure composition, as in his ''[[Deposition (Michelangelo)|The Entombment]]'' was to inspire many artists for centuries. In this panel painting the figure of Christ, though vertical, is slumped and a dead weight at the centre of the picture, while those who try to carry the body lean outwards to support it.
* At first glance, [[Signorelli]]'s ''Fall of the Damned'' is an appalling and violent jumble of bodies, but by the skilful placement of the figures so that the lines, rather than intersecting, flow in an undulating course through the picture, the composition is both unified and resolved into a large number of separate actions. The colours of the devils also serve to divide the picture into the tormentors and the tormented.
* ''The Battle of Ostia'' was executed by [[Raphael]]'s assistants, probably to his design. The foreground of the painting is organised into two overlapping arched shapes, the larger showing captives being subdued, while to the left and slightly behind, they are forced to kneel before the Pope. While the Pope rises above the second group and dominates it, the first group is dominated by a soldier whose colour and splendid headdress acts like a visual stepping stone to the Pope. At the edges of this group two stooping figures mirror each other, creating a tension in which one pushes away from the edge of the painting and the other pulls upward at its centre.

==Major works==

===Altarpieces===
Through the Renaissance period, the large [[altarpiece]] had a unique status as a commission.  An altarpiece was destined to become a focal point, not only visually in the religious building it occupied, but also in the devotions of the worshippers. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''Madonna of the Rocks'', now in the [[National Gallery, London]] but previously in a chapel in [[Milan]], is one of many images that was used in the petitioning of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] against plague. The significance of these images to those who commissioned them, who worshipped in their location, and who created them is lost when they are viewed in an art gallery.

* The two ''Enthroned Madonnas'' by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] demonstrate the variations on a theme that was formalised and constrained by tradition. Although the positions of the Madonna and Child are very similar, the artists have treated most of the features differently. Cimabue's throne is front-on and uses perspective to suggest its solidity. The angels, their faces, wings and haloes, are arranged to form a rich pattern. The gold leaf detailing of the Madonna's garment picks out the folds in a delicate network. The Child sits regally, with his feet set at the same angle as his mother's.
* In Duccio's ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'', the largest of its kind at 4.5 metres high, the throne is set diagonally and the Child, much more of a baby despite his gesture, sits diagonally opposed to his mother. While the positioning of the kneeling angels is quite simplistic, they have a naturalism in their repeated postures and are varied by the beautiful colour combinations of their robes. On the Madonna's robe the gold border makes a meandering line, defining the form and contours, and enlivening the whole composition with a single decorative detail.
* [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Ognissanti Madonna]]'' is now housed in the same room of the [[Uffizi]] as Cimabue's and Duccio's, where the advances that he made in both drawing from the observation of nature, and in his use of perspective can be easily compared with the earlier masters. While the painting conforms to the model of an altarpiece, the figures within it do not follow the traditional formula. The Madonna and Child are solidly three-dimensional. This quality is enhanced by the canopied throne which contributes the main decorative element, while gold borders are minimised. The angels, which mirror each other, each have quite individual drapery.
* A hundred years later, [[Masaccio]], still within the constraints of the formal altarpiece, confidently creates a three-dimensional figure draped in heavy robes, her chubby Christ Child sucking on his fingers. The lutes played by the little angels are both steeply foreshortened.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting the figures lack the emphasis on mass of Masaccio's. Angelico was renowned for his delicacy in depicting the Madonna. The appeal of such paintings is demonstrated in the way the adoring angels are clustered around. As in Masaccio's painting, the Madonna's halo is decorated with [[pseudo-kufic]] script, probably to suggest her [[Middle Eastern]] origin.
* In the hands of [[Piero della Francesca]] the formal gold frame is transformed into a classical niche, drawn in perfect linear perspective and defined by daylight. The assorted saints cluster round in a natural way, while the Madonna sits on a realistic throne on a small podium covered by an [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental carpet]], while the donor [[Federico da Montefeltro]] kneels at her feet. A concession to tradition is that the Madonna is of a larger scale than the other figures.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]]'s painting, while on one hand, the figures and the setting give the effect of great realism, Bellini's interest in Byzantine icons is displayed in the hierarchical enthronement and demeanour of the Madonna.
* The [[Milan]]ese painter [[Bergognone]] has drawn on aspects of the work of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and Bellini to create this painting in which the red robe and golden hair of Catherine of Alexandria are effectively balanced by the contrasting black and white of Catherine of Siena, and framed by a rustic arch of broken bricks.
* In [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Madonna della Vittoria]]'', the Madonna may occupy the central position, framed in her garlanded gazebo, but the focus of attention is [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] whose achievements are acknowledged not only by the Madonna and Christ Child but by the heroic saints, Michael and George.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] abandoned any sort of formal canopy and surrounded the Madonna and Child with the grandeur of nature into which he set the figures in a carefully balanced yet seemingly informal trapezoid composition.
* The ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'' by [[Raphael]] uses the formula not of an altarpiece but the formal portrait, with a frame of green curtains through which a vision can be seen, witnessed by [[Pope Sixtus II]] for whom the work is named. The clouds around the Virgin are composed of cherubic faces, while the two iconic cherubs so beloved with the late 20th century fashion for angels, prop themselves on the sill. This work became the model for [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and many other painters.
* [[Andrea del Sarto]], while using figures to a very natural and lifelike effect, abandons in the ''Madonna of the Harpies'' practical reality by setting the Madonna on a Classical plinth as if she were a statue. Every figure is in a state of instability, marked by the forward thrust of the Madonna's knee against which she balances a book. This painting is showing the trends that were to be developed in [[Mannerism|Mannerist painting]].

===Fresco cycles===
The largest, most time-consuming paid work that an artist could do was a scheme of [[fresco]]es for a church, private palace or commune building. Of these, the largest unified scheme in Italy which remains more-or-less intact is that created by a number of different artists at the end of the Medieval period at the [[Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi]]. It was followed by [[Giotto]]'s Proto-Renaissance scheme at Padua and many others ranging from [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel]] for the [[Medici]] to [[Michelangelo]]'s supreme accomplishment for [[Pope Julius II]] at the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Sistine Chapel]]. 
* [[Giotto]] painted the large, free-standing [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] with the '' [[Life of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Life of Christ]]''. Breaking from medieval tradition, it set a standard of naturalism.
* The two large frescoes of ''Allegories of Good and Bad Government'' painted by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] for the Commune of Siena are completely secular and show detailed views of a townscape with citizens, emphasising the importance of civic order.
* By contrast, [[Andrea di Bonaiuto]], painting for the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s at the new church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], completed a huge fresco of ''the Triumph of the Church'', which shows the role of the church in the work of [[Salvation]], and in particular, the role of the Dominicans, who also appear symbolically as ''the Hounds of Heaven'', shepherding the people of God. The painting includes a view of [[Florence Cathedral]].
* [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]] collaborated on the [[Brancacci Chapel]] fresco cycle which is most famous for Masaccio's lifelike innovations, Masolino's more elegant style is seen in this townscape which skillfully combines two episodes of ''the Life of St. Peter''.
* [[Piero della Francesca]]'s fresco cycle in the church of [[San Francesco, Arezzo]], closely follows the Legend of the True Cross as written by [[Jacopo da Varagine]] in the '' [[Golden Legend]]''. The pictures reveal his studies of light and perspective, and the figures have an almost monolithic solidity.
* [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel|fresco cycle for the private chapel]] of the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Medici Palace]] is a late work in the [[International Gothic]] style, a fanciful and richly ornamental depiction of the Medici with their entourage as the [[Three Wise Men]].
* The elaborate cycle for the [[House of Este]]'s [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] at Ferrara, executed in part by [[Francesco del Cossa]], was also fanciful in its depictions of Classical deities and Zodial signs which are combined with scenes of the life of the family.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s paintings for the Gonzaga also show family life but have a preponderance of highly realistic elements and skillfully utilise the real architecture of the room they decorate, the mantelpiece forming a plinth for the figures and the real ceiling pendentives being apparently supported on painted pilasters.
* While in the Brancacci Chapel, historians seek to identify the faces of Masaccio, Masolino and perhaps Donatello among the apostles, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] at the [[Sassetti Chapel]] makes no attempt to disguise his models. Each fresco in this religious cycle has two sets of figures: those who tell the story and those who are witness to it. In this scene of ''the Birth of the Virgin Mary'', a number of the noble women of Florence have come in, as if to congratulate the new mother.
* ''[[The Punishment of the Sons of Korah]]'' by [[Botticelli]] is one of episodes the ''Life of Moses'' series, which, together with ''The Life of Christ'', was commissioned in the 1480s as decoration to the [[Sistine Chapel]]. The artists [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] all worked on the carefully designed and harmonious scheme.
* [[Michelangelo]]'s painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which he executed alone over a period of five years, with narratives from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], prophetic figures and the Ancestors of Christ, was destined to become one of the most famous artworks in the world.
* Simultaneously, [[Raphael]] and a number of his assistants painted the papal chambers known as ''[[Raphael Rooms]]''. In ''[[The School of Athens]]'' Raphael depicts famous people of his day, including Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante and himself, as philosophers of ancient Athens.

==Subjects==
Devotional images of the ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' were produced in very large numbers, often for private clients. Scenes of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'',  or ''Lives of the Saints'' were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the ''[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]]'' and ''the Passion of Christ''. ''The Last Supper'' was commonly depicted in religious refectories.

During the Renaissance an increasing number of patrons had their likeness committed to posterity in paint. For this reason there exists a great number of Renaissance portraits for whom the name of the sitter is unknown. Wealthy private patrons commissioned artworks as decoration for their homes, of increasingly secular subject matter.

===Devotional paintings===

====The Madonna====
These small intimate pictures, which are now nearly all in museums, were most often done for private ownership, but might occasionally grace a small altar in a chapel.

* ''The Madonna adoring the Christ Child with two Angels'' has always been particularly popular on account of the expressive little boy angel supporting the Christ Child. Paintings of [[Filippo Lippi]]'s such as this were to particularly influence [[Botticelli]].
* [[Verrocchio]] separates the Madonna and Christ Child from the viewer by a stone sill, also used in many portraits. The rose and the cherries represent spiritual love and sacrificial love.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is superficially very like that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both the mother and the child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The foreshortened elbow of the Child as he reaches for his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's ''Doni Tondo''.
* The figures placed at opposing diagonals seen in this early ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a compositional theme that was to recur in many of his works and be imitated by his pupils and by Raphael.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] was influenced by [[Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. The gold cloth in this painting takes the place of the gold leaf background. The arrangement is formal, yet the gestures, and in particular the mother's adoring gaze, give a human warmth to this picture.
* [[Vittore Carpaccio]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is very unusual in showing the Christ Child as a toddler fully dressed in contemporary clothing. The meticulous detail and domesticity are suggestive of [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
* [[Michelangelo]]'s Doni Tondo is the largest of these works, but was a private commission. The highly unusual composition, the contorted form of the Madonna, the three heads all near the top of the painting and the radical foreshortening were all very challenging features, and Agnolo Doni was not sure that he wished to pay for it.
* [[Raphael]] has skillfully set opposing forces into play, and united the Madonna and Child with a loving gaze.

===Secular paintings===

====Portraits====
During the latter half of the 15th century, there was a proliferation of portraits. Although the subjects of some of them were later remembered for their achievements or their noble lineage, the identities of many have been lost and that of even the most famous portrait of all time, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', is open to speculation and controversy.

* The advantage of a profile portrait such as [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''[[Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]'' is that it identifies the subject like a facial signature. The proportions of the face, the respective angles of the forehead, nose and brow, the position and shape of the eye and the set of the jaw remain recognisable through life. Moreover, once a profile likeness has been taken, it can be used to cast a medal or sculpt an image in relief.
* [[Pollaiuolo]] has conformed to the formula, emphasising this young woman's profile with a fine line which also defines the delicate shape of her nostrils and the corners of her mouth. But he has added a three-dimensional quality by the subtle use of [[chiaroscuro]] and the treatment of the rich Florentine brocade of her sleeve.
* [[Alesso Baldovinetti]], on the other hand, has used the profile of this strong-featured girl to create a striking pattern of a highlighted contour against the darker background. The background is a lively shape adding to the compositional structure of the painting. The little black fillet on her forehead responds to the dynamic pattern of the embroidered sleeve.
* [[Botticelli]]'s portrait, although turned to three-quarter view with strong tonal modelling, has much to do with Baldovinetti's painting in its striking arrangement of shapes in the red garment, the hat and the dark hair and the pattern that they form against the background.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s portrait, some years earlier than Botticelli's, bears it a passing similarity. But this painting does not rely heavily on the skilful arrangement of clearly contoured shapes. Antonello has used the advantages of oil paint, as against Botticelli's [[tempera]], to achieve a subtle and detailed likeness in which the bushy eyebrows, the imperfections of the skin and the shadow of the beard have been rendered with photographic precision.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]]'s tempera portrait of [[An Old Man and his Grandson|an old man with his grandson]] combines the meticulous depiction of the old man's enlarged nose and parchment-like skin with a tenderness usually reserved for portrayals of ''The Madonna and Child''. Ghirlandaio takes this analogy further by setting the scene against a window and landscape.
* [[Pintoricchio]]'s portrait of a boy sets him high in the picture frame, reducing his scale in proportion to the area in contrast to the usual way of showing adults. The painting is set against a landscape such as used by Leonardo and Bellini. Pinturicchio's main fame lay in his skillfully characterised portraits like this.
* In the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' Leonardo employed the technique of ''sfumato'', delicately graded chiaroscuro that models the surface contours, while allowing details to disappear in the shadows. The technique gives an air of mystery to this painting which has brought it lasting fame. The beautiful hands become almost a decorative element.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s portrait of the elected Duke of Venice has an official air and could hardly be more formal. Yet the face is characterised with what one might hope for in the Doge, wisdom, humour and decisiveness. Although a more elaborate painting, it has much in common with Baldovinetti's sense of design.
* The subject of [[Titian]]'s portrait is unknown, and its considerable fame rests solely on its beauty and unusual composition in which the face is supported and balanced by the large blue sleeve of quilted satin. The sleeve is almost the same colour as the background; its rich tonality gives it form. The white linen of the shirt enlivens the composition, while the man's eyes pick up the colour of the sleeve with penetrating luminosity.
* Superficially, [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s portrait has many of the same elements as Titian's. But it is handled very differently, being much broader in treatment, and less compelling in subject. The painting has achieved an imediacy, as if the sitter has paused for a moment and is about to return to what he is doing.
* [[Raphael]], in this much-copied portrait of [[Pope Julius II]], set a standard for the painting of future popes. Unlike the contemporary portraits here by Bellini, Titian and del Sarto, Raphael has abandoned the placement of the figure behind a shelf or barrier and has shown the Pope as if seated in his own apartment. Against the green cloth decorated with the keys of [[St. Peter]], the red velvet papal garments make a rich contrast, the white beard being offset by the pleated white linen. On the uprights of the chair, the acorn finials are the symbol of the Pope's family, the ''[[della Rovere]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====The nude====
These four famous paintings demonstrate the advent and acceptance of the nude as a subject for the artist in its own right. 
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'', the nude figure, although central to the painting, is not of itself the subject. The subject of the painting is a story from [[Classical mythology]]. The fact that the Goddess Venus rose naked from the sea provides justification for the nude study that dominates the centre of the work.
* Painted thirty years later, the exact meaning of [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s picture is unclear. Had the subject been painted by an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter, it would be quite unnecessary to ascribe a meaning. But in this Renaissance work, there is the presence of a mirror, an object that is usually symbolic and which suggests an allegory. The young lady's nakedness is a sign not so much of seduction, as innocence and vulnerability. However, she decks herself out in an extremely rich headdress, stitched with pearls, and having not one, but two mirrors, sees only herself reflected endlessly. The mirror, often a symbol of prophecy, here becomes an object of vanity, with the young woman in the role of [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].
* [[Giorgione]]'s painting possibly predates Bellini's by ten years. It has always been known as ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|The Sleeping Venus]]'' but there is nothing in the painting to confirm that it is, indeed, Venus. The painting is remarkable for its lack of symbolism and the emphasis on the body simply as an object of beauty. It is believed to have been completed by Titian.
* [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', on the other hand, was painted for the pleasure of the Duke of Urbino, and as in Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', painted for a member of the Medici family, the model looks directly at the viewer. The model may very well have been the mistress of the client. Venus of Urbino is not simply a body beautiful in its own right. She is an individual and highly seductive young woman, who is not in the nude state indicative of heavenly perfection, but is simply naked, having taken off her clothes but left on some of her jewellery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Classical mythology====
Paintings of classical mythology were invariably done for the important salons in the houses of private patrons. Botticelli's most famous works are for the Medici, Raphael painted ''Galatea'' for Agostino Chigi and Bellini's ''[[Feast of the Gods (Bellini)|Feast of the Gods]]'' was, with several works by Titian, in the home of [[Alfonso I d'Este]]

* [[Pollaiuolo]]'s ''Hercules and the Hydra'' typifies many paintings of mythological subjects which lent themselves to interpretation that was both Humanist and Christian. In this work good overcomes evil, and courage is glorified. The figure of Hercules has resonances with the Biblical character of [[Samson]] who also was renowned for his strength and slew a lion.
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', Wisdom,&lt;!---don't delete this capital---&gt; personified by Athena, leads the cowering Centaur by the forelock, so learning and refinement are able to overcome brute instinct, which is the characteristic symbolised by the centaur.
* [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]'', though Classical in origin, has a specifically Christian resonance that would have been recognised by those who were familiar with the story. It is about the nature of love. While all around her aspire to earthly love and succumb to the arrows shot by the trio of cupids, Galatea has chosen spiritual love and turns her eyes to Heaven.
* Three large works remain that were painted for a single room for the Este by [[Filippo Bellini|Bellini]] and his successor [[Titian]]. Of these, Titian's ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' represents a moment in a narrative. The other two paintings are jolly drinking scenes with a number of narrative elements introduced in a minor way, in order that characters might be identifiable. This painting does not appear to have any higher allegorical sentiment attached to it. It appears to be simply a very naturalistic portrayal of a number of the ancient gods and their associates, eating, drinking and enjoying the party.

'''Yuri Mikhailovich Lotman''' ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий Миха́йлович Ло́тман}}, {{lang-et|Juri Lotman}}; 28 February 1922 – 28 October 1993) was a prominent literary scholar, [[semiotician]], and [[cultural history|cultural historian]], who worked at the [[University of Tartu]]. He was a member of the [[Estonian Academy of Sciences]]. He was the founder of the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]]. The number of his printed works exceeds 800 titles. His archive (which is now kept at the [[University of Tallinn]] and at the [[Tartu University Library]]) which includes his correspondence with a number of Russian intellectuals, is immense.

==Biography==
Yuri Lotman was born in the [[Jewish]] intellectual family of lawyer Mikhail Lotman and [[Sorbonne]]-educated dentist Aleksandra Lotman in [[Petrograd]], [[Russian SFSR|Russia]]. His elder sister Inna Obraztsova graduated from [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|Leningrad Conservatory]] and became a composer and lecturer of musical theory, his younger sister Victoria Lotman was a prominent cardiologist, and his third sister Lidia Lotman was a scholar of Russian literature of the second half of the 19th century on staff at the Institute for Russian Literature of the [[Russian Academy of Science]] ([[Pushkin House]]) (she lived in Saint-Petersburg).

Lotman graduated from secondary school in 1939 with excellent marks and was admitted to [[Leningrad State University]] without having to pass any exams. There he studied philology, which was a choice he made due to Lidia Lotman's university friends (actually he attended university lectures in philology whilst he was still at secondary school). His professors at university were the renowned lecturers and academicians – [[Grigory Gukovsky|Gukovsky]], [[Mark Azadovsky|Azadovsky]], [[Boris Tomashevsky|Tomashevsky]] and [[Vladimir Propp|Propp]]. He was drafted in 1940 and  during [[World War II]] served as a radio operator in the artillery. Demobilized from the army in 1946, he returned to his studies in the university and received his diploma with distinction in 1950. His first published research papers focused on Russian literary and social thought of the 18th and 19th century.

Unable to find an academic position in Leningrad due to [[anti-Semitism]] (he was unable to apply for a PhD program), Lotman went to [[Estonia]] in 1950 and from 1954 began his work as a lecturer at the Department of Russian language and literature of [[Tartu University]] and later became head of the department.

In the early '60s Lotman established academic contacts with a group of structuralist linguists in Moscow, and invited them in the first Summer School on Secondary Modeling Systems, that took place in [[Kääriku]] from 19th to 29 August 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://mobile.dspace.ut.ee/handle/10062/17420|title=Программа и тезисы докладов в летней школе по вторичным моделирующим системам : 19-29 авг. 1964 г.  [Programme and proceedings of the summer school on secondary modeling systems: 19-29 August 1964]|last=|first=|publisher=Tartu University|year=1964|isbn=|editor-last=Lotman|editor-first=Yuri|location=Tartu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group gathered at the first summer school later developed into what is now known as the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]]. Among participants of the summer school, and later members of the Tartu–Moscow school, were such names as [[Boris Uspensky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[Isaak I. Revzin]] and Georgii Lesskis. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the [[semiotics of culture]].

This school is widely known for its journal ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'', published by [[Tartu University Press]] (formerly in Russian as "Труды по знаковым системам") and currently the oldest semiotics journal in the world (established in 1964). Lotman studied the [[theory of culture]], Russian literature, history, [[semiotics]] and [[semiology]] (general theories of signs and sign systems), semiotics of cinema, arts, literature, robotics, etc. In these fields, Lotman has been one of the most widely cited authors. His major study in Russian literature was dedicated to [[Pushkin]]; among his most influential works in semiotics and structuralism are «Semiotics of Cinema», «Analysis of the Poetic Text» and «The Structure of the Artistic Text». In 1984, Lotman coined the term [[semiosphere]].
In 1991 he received the Gold Medal of Philology, the highest award for a philological scholar.&lt;ref&gt;http://insop.org/index.php?p=1_8_Ancient-Medal-Winners&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuri Lotman's wife [[Zara Mints]] was also a well-known scholar of Russian literature and  Tartu professor. They have three sons:
*[[Mihhail Lotman]] (born 1952) is professor of semiotics and literary theory at [[Tallinn University]], is active in politics and has served as a member of the [[Riigikogu]] (Estonian Parliament) as a member of the conservative [[Res Publica Party]].
*[[Grigori Lotman]] (born 1953) is an artist.
*[[Aleksei Lotman]] (born 1960) is a biologist, since 2006 he has also been a politician and a member of parliament for the [[Estonian Greens]] party (2007-2011).
