===Security compromise===
In December 2001, Lamo was praised by [[Worldcom]] for helping to fortify their corporate security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=FBI reportedly hunting Adrian Lamo|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/05/fbi_reportedly_hunting_adrian_lamo/|work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, he broke into the internal computer network of ''The New York Times'', added his name to the internal database of expert sources, and used the paper's [[LexisNexis]] account to conduct research on high-profile subjects. ''The New York Times'' filed a complaint, and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15-month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15 a.m. on September 9, after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. He re-surrendered to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in New York City on September 11, and pleaded guilty to one felony count of [[computer crime]]s against [[Microsoft]], [[LexisNexis]], and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 8, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Noah|last=Shachtman|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/01/61831|title=Adrian Lamo Cuts Deal With Feds|work=Wired|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Poulsen|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/7771|title=Lamo Pleads Guilty to Times Hack|website=Securityfocus.com|date=January 8, 2004|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Lamo was sentenced to two years probation, with six months to be served in home detention, and ordered to pay $65,000 in restitution.&lt;ref name=Sentence/&gt; He was convicted of compromising security at ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref&gt;

When challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was: "Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves". When approached for comment during his criminal case, Lamo frustrated reporters with [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]], such as "Faith manages"&lt;ref&gt;

At his sentencing, Lamo expressed remorse for harm he had caused by his intrusions. The court record quotes him as adding: "I want to answer for what I have done and do better with my life."&lt;ref&gt;

He subsequently declared on the question and answer site Quora that: "We all own our actions in fullness, not just the pleasant aspects of them." Lamo accepted that he had committed mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quora.com/How-often-do-criminals-hand-themselves-in/answer/Adri%C3%A1n-Lamo "Adrián Lamo's answer to How often do criminals hand themselves in? – Quora"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA controversy===
[[File:Adrian Lamo bus station.jpg|thumb|right|Lamo in [[San Francisco]] in 2006]]
On May 9, 2006, while 18 months into a two-year probation sentence, Lamo refused to give the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] a blood sample, which they had demanded in order to record his [[DNA]] in their [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] system.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to his attorney at the time Lamo had a religious objection to giving blood but was willing to give his DNA in another form. On June 15, 2007, lawyers for Lamo filed a motion citing the [[Book of Genesis]] as one basis for Lamo's religious opposition to the giving of blood.

On June 20, 2007, Lamo's legal counsel reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] whereby Lamo would submit a [[cheek swab]] in place of the blood sample.&lt;ref&gt;

===WikiLeaks and Manning===
{{See also|Chelsea Manning}}
In February 2009, a partial list of the anonymous donors to the WikiLeaks not-for-profit website was leaked and published on the WikiLeaks website. Some media sources indicated at the time that Lamo was among the donors on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Wikileaks+Forced+to+Post+Its+Own+Secrets/article14328.htm|title=Wikileaks Forced to Post Its Own Secrets|website=DailyTech|access-date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wikileaked&gt;{{cite web|last=Singel|first=Ryan|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wikileaks-force/|title=Wikileaks forced to leak its own secret info (Wired)|website=Wired.com|access-date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamo commented on his [[Twitter]] page, "Thanks WikiLeaks, for leaking your donor list&amp;nbsp;... That's dedication."&lt;ref name=wikileaked /&gt;

In May 2010,&lt;ref name=wiredIntAnarrest&gt;{{cite web|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/leak/|title=U.S. Intelligence Analyst Arrested in Wikileaks Video Probe &amp;#124; Threat Level|publisher=Wired.com|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamo reported to U.S. Army authorities that Chelsea Manning claimed to have leaked a large body of classified documents, including 260,000 classified United States diplomatic cables.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/world/08leaks.html|work=The New York Times|first=Elisabeth|last=Bumiller|title=Army Leak Suspect Is Turned In, by Ex-Hacker|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamo stated that Manning also "took credit for leaking" the video footage of the [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike]], which has since come to be known as the "[[Collateral Murder#Leaked video footage|Collateral Murder]]" video.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Lamo stated that he would not have turned Manning in "if lives weren't in danger&amp;nbsp;... He was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as he could, and just throwing it up into the air."&lt;ref name=wiredIntAnarrest /&gt; WikiLeaks responded by denouncing Lamo and ''Wired Magazine'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]] as "notorious felons, informers &amp; manipulators", and said: "journalists should take care."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

According to Andy Greenberg of ''[[Forbes]]'',&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/firewall/2010/08/01/stealthy-government-contractor-monitors-u-s-internet-providers-says-it-employed-wikileaks-informant/|title=Andy Greenberg: Stealthy Government Contractor Monitors U.S. Internet Providers, Worked With Wikileaks Informant, August 1, 2010|website=Blogs.forbes.com|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamo was a volunteer "adversary characterization" analyst for Project Vigilant, a Florida-based semi-secret government contractor, which encouraged him to inform the government about the alleged WikiLeaks source. The head of Project Vigilant, Chet Uber, claimed, "I'm the one who called the U.S. government&amp;nbsp;... All the people who say that Adrian is a narc, he did a patriotic thing. He sees all kinds of hacks, and he was seriously worried about people dying."&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt;

Lamo was criticized by fellow hackers, such as those at the [[Hackers on Planet Earth]] conference in 2010, who labeled him a "[[Informant|snitch]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Sanjiv (July 22, 2010).

"According to [[Eric Corley|Emmanuel Goldstein]], who organized the panel discussion, 90 percent of the conference was anti-Lamo."&lt;/ref&gt; Another commented to Lamo, following his speech during a panel discussion, saying: "From my perspective, I see what you have done as treason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/7/27/wikileaks_is_not_one_personwe_are|title="WikiLeaks Is Not One Person...We Are All the Threat" – Hacker Magazine Editor Says WikiLeaks Is Bigger Than Julian Assange|publisher=Democracynow.org|date=July 27, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] called Lamo "a very disreputable character", and said it was not right to call him a financial contributor to WikiLeaks, since Lamo's monetary support amounted to only [[United States dollar|US$]]20 on one occasion. Assange said it was "mischievous to suggest the individual has anything to do with WikiLeaks."&lt;ref name=assangewiki&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/WikiSecrets-Julian-Assange-Full.html|title="WikiSecrets" Julian Assange Full Interview Footage|website=Wikileaks.org|date=May 24, 2011|access-date=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamo characterized his decision to work with the government as morally ambiguous, but objectively necessary, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "There were no right choices that day, only less wrong ones. It was cold, it was needful, and it was no one's to make except mine," adding to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Ed Pilkington: "There were hundreds of thousands of documents&amp;nbsp;– let's drop the number to 250,000 to be conservative&amp;nbsp;– and doing nothing meant gambling that each and every one would do no harm if no warning was given."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Greenwald, Lamo, and ''Wired'' magazine===
Lamo's role in the Manning case drew criticism from [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. Greenwald suggested that Lamo lied to Manning by turning Manning in, and then lied after the fact to cover up the circumstances of Manning's confessions.&lt;ref name=gg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald places the incident in the context of what he calls "the Obama administration's unprecedented war on whistle-blowers".&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; Greenwald's critique of ''Wired'' has drawn a response from that magazine which suggests that Greenwald is writing disingenuously: "At his most reasonable, Greenwald impugns our motives, attacks the character of our staff and carefully selects his facts and sources to misrepresent the truth and generate outrage in his readership."&lt;ref name=wiredgg&gt;{{cite news|last=Hansen|first=Evan|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/greenwald/|title=Putting the Record Straight on the Lamo–Manning Chat Logs &amp;#124; Threat Level|work=Wired|date=December 31, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article about the Manning case, Greenwald mentions ''Wired'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]]'s 1994 felony conviction for computer hacking, suggesting that "over the years, Poulsen has served more or less as Lamo's personal media voice."&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; Greenwald is skeptical of an earlier story written by Poulsen about Lamo's institutionalization on psychiatric grounds, writing: "Lamo claimed he was diagnosed with [[Asperger's syndrome]], a somewhat fashionable [[autism]] diagnosis which many stars in the computer world have also claimed."&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; In an article entitled "The Worsening Journalistic Disgrace at Wired", Greenwald claimed that ''Wired'' was "actively conceal[ing] from the public, for months on end, the key evidence in a political story that has generated headlines around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/27/wired|title=The worsening journalistic disgrace at Wired|work=Salon|date=December 27, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Anonymous===
Lamo had been critical of media coverage of the hacker collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], saying that media outlets have over-hyped and mythologized the group.&lt;ref name="IBT"/&gt; He also said that Anonymous is not the "invulnerable" group it is claimed to be, and he can see "no rational point in what they're doing."&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/344388/20120523/adrian-lamo-snitch-anonymous-bradley-manning-wikileaks.htm|title=EXCLUSIVE: Hacker Adrian Lamo Who Betrayed Wikileaks' Manning Turns Fire on Anonymous|author=Gianluca Mezzofiore|date=May 23, 2012|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
On August 22, 2002, Lamo was removed from a segment of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' when, after being asked to demonstrate his skills for the camera, he gained access to NBC's internal network.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; NBC was concerned that they broke the law by taping Lamo while he (possibly) broke the law. Lamo was a guest on ''[[The Screen Savers]]'' five times beginning in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;

''[[Hackers Wanted]]'', a documentary film focusing on Lamo's life as a hacker, was produced by [[Trigger Street Productions]], and narrated by [[Kevin Spacey]].&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/hackers-wante/|title=Lost Hacking Documentary Surfaces on Pirate Bay &amp;#124; Threat Level|publisher=Wired.com|date=May 21, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on the 2003 hacking scene, the film features interviews with [[Kevin Rose]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref name=film /&gt; The film has not been conventionally released. In May 2009, a video purporting to be a trailer for ''Hackers Wanted'' was allegedly leaked to or by the Internet film site Eye Crave.&lt;ref&gt;

Lamo also appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[Fox News]], ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', and repeatedly on [[KCRA-TV]] News as an expert on netcentric crime and incidents. He was interviewed for the documentaries ''[[We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks]]'' and ''[[True Stories: WikiLeaks – Secrets and Lies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lamo wrote the book ''Ask Adrian'', a collection of his best Q&amp;A drawn from over 500 pages of Quora answers, which have so far received nearly 30,000,000 views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/profile/Adri%C3%A1n-Lamo|title=Adrián Lamo|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
In the mid-1990s, Lamo volunteered for the gay and lesbian media firm [[PlanetOut Inc.]]&lt;ref name=HacksSquats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.04/hacker_pr.html|title=Wired 12.04: The Homeless Hacker v.

In a 2004 interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', an ex-girlfriend of Lamo's described him as "very controlling", alleging "he carried a [[electroshock weapon|stun gun]], which he used on me".

Lamo said in a ''Wired'' article that, in May 2010, after he reported the theft of his backpack, an investigating officer noted unusual behavior and placed him under a [[5150 (involuntary psychiatric hold)|72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold]], which was extended to a nine-day hold.

'''Al-Quds Brigades''' ({{lang-ar|سرايا القدس}}, ''Saraya al-Quds'' meaning ''[[Jerusalem]] Brigades'') is the armed wing of the [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] [[Islamist]]&lt;ref name=ANS-indiscriminateTerrorAttacks /&gt;&lt;ref name=ICEJ-terropristsLeader_killed /&gt; organization [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] (PIJ),&lt;ref name=ME&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metimes.com/International/2009/01/05/the_next_dangerous_phase_of_the_gaza_war/2749/ |date=January 4, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-06 |title=The Next Dangerous Phase of the Gaza War |author=Olivier Guit |publisher=Middle East Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116035124/http://www.metimes.com/International/2009/01/05/the_next_dangerous_phase_of_the_gaza_war/2749/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The al-Quds Brigades were founded in 1981 by [[Fathi Shaqaqi]] and [[Abd Al Aziz Awda]] in Gaza,&lt;ref name="ANS-indiscriminateTerrorAttacks"/&gt; and were active in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]], especially in the town of [[Jenin]]. Extensive operations against its infrastructure carried out by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] resulted in severe losses to the group, and it appeared significantly weakened by 2004 in that region.&lt;ref name=ANS-indiscriminateTerrorAttacks&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestinian Islamic Jihad -- al-Quds Brigades|url=http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/Listedterroristorganisations/Pages/PalestinianIslamicJihad.aspx|website=Australian National Security|publisher=Australian Attorney-General's Department|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICEJ-terropristsLeader_killed /&gt;

On March 1, 2006 [[Abu al-Walid al-Dahdouh]], a commander of the group's military wing, was targeted and killed by a bomb or missile as he drove past the Palestinian finance ministry. On August 30, 2006 the West Bank leader of the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]'s  military wing, al-Quds Brigades, [[Hussam Jaradat]], was shot and killed by undercover [[Israel Defense Forces]] in the city of Jenin.&lt;ref name=ICEJ-terropristsLeader_killed&gt;{{cite web|title=IDF uncovers massive tunnel near Gaza fence Four terrorists killed in Gaza City clashes|url=http://nir.icej.org/news/headlines/idf-uncovers-massive-tunnel-near-gaza-fence|website=icej.org|publisher=The International Christian Embassy Jerusalem|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The al-Quds Brigades' parent organization, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, is devoted to the establishment of an Islamic state, and the settlement of Palestinians in what it considers their rightful homeland within the geographic borders of the pre-1948 [[Mandatory Palestine|British-mandated Palestine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">'''Amandla'''--Festival of Unity—was a [[world music]] [[festival]] held at [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1979/7/10/harvard-opens-stadium-for-african-aid/?print=1 Harvard Stadium] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on July 21, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobmarley.com/amandla-festival-of-unity-1979/ "Amandla: The Festival of Unity, 1979"], bobmarley.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmett G. Price, III, Tammy Kernodle, Horace Maxille (eds), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nVxgs_E57_EC&amp;pg=PR44&amp;lpg=PR44&amp;dq=amandla+festival+1979&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hFKtj9k2aZ&amp;sig=kfGgtUO9vkw4iFmlZpqiFRgEXEA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjowc3R1oLOAhWJI8AKHdWmBqkQ6AEIvgIwNQ#v=onepage&amp;q=amandla%20festival%201979&amp;f=false "A Timeline of Significant Moments in African American Music"], ''Encyclopedia of African American Music'', Greenwood, 2011, p. xliv.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the concert were to support and celebrate the liberation of Southern Africa as well as the ongoing efforts of people in Boston to end racism in their families, schools, workplaces and communities.

{{Wikisource4|original speeches held at the|'''[[s:Amandla Festival Speeches|Amandla Festival]]'''}}

The word "Amandla" is from the South-African [[Zulu language]] and means "power", "strength" or "energy". The headline performance was [[reggae]] superstar [[Bob Marley]] and his band [[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|The Wailers]]. Marley made several short speeches during his [[encore (concert)|encore]] when he powerfully blamed the [[system]] and urgently claimed Africa's unity and freedom. Those onstage speeches were unusual for Marley, as he normally was threatened with censorship when speaking openly about the system's failure and [[marijuana]] smoking, as he did at the Amandla Festival.

Among the Festival's key organizers were Janet Axelrod, Reebee Garofalo, Janine Fay, Shelley Neill, George Pillsbury and Kazi Toure.

Other performers were soul legend [[Patti LaBelle]], jazz pianist [[Eddie Palmieri]], drummer [[Babatunde Olatunji]], drummer Yaya Diallo, the South African band [[Jabula]], the Art of Black Dance and comedian [[Dick Gregory]] who gave a speech before Marley's performance.  [[Mel King]], a long-time Boston community activist and outspoken opponent of apartheid, was the emcee.

Bob Marley and the Wailers were the last musical act to be signed.  They signed on to perform a mere 3 weeks before the scheduled festival.  The performance almost did not happen because Al Anderson broke the neck of his guitar during rehearsal.  The band, just minutes before their scheduled performance, refused to go on.  One of the festival organizers drove into [[Harvard Square]] to "The Instrument Exchange" and purchased a guitar for $600.  An interesting note: no municipal police were allowed within the stadium during the festival.  The concert organizers had Boston residents trained in crowd security over a period of six months.

'''Central Plains Water''', or, more fully, the Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme, is a large-scale proposal for water diversion, damming, reticulation and [[irrigation]] for the Central Plains of [[Canterbury, New Zealand]]. Construction started on the scheme in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/canterbury-irrigation-project-making-progress-2014110418#axzz3Or1f99jn&lt;/ref&gt;

The original proposal involved diversion of water, the construction of a storage dam, tunnels and a series of canals and water races to supply water for irrigation to an area of 60,000 hectares on the [[Canterbury Plains]].  Water will be taken from the [[Rakaia River|Rakaia]] and [[Waimakariri River]]s. 

In June 2010, resource consents for the scheme were approved in a revised form without the storage dam. From 2010 to 2012, the resource consents were under appeal to the Environment Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme originated as a feasibility study jointly initiated and funded by [[Christchurch]] City Council and [[Selwyn District]] Council.

The Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme is contentious. It is opposed by community, recreation and environment groups, some city and regional councillors, and some corporate dairying interests. The scheme is supported by [[Christchurch]] City Council and Selwyn District Council staff and some councillors, irrigation interests, consultants, farming interests, and more recently, some corporate dairying interests.

==Scope==
[[Canterbury Regional Council]] has summarised the scope of the Central Plains Water enhancement scheme as follows;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecan.govt.nz/Resource+Consents/Central+Plains+Water+Trust.htm Central Plains Water Trust] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315071824/http://www.ecan.govt.nz/Resource+Consents/Central+Plains+Water+Trust.htm |date=15 March 2007 }} Canterbury Regional Council Resource Consents webpage. Retrieved 6 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'The applicants propose to irrigate 60,000 hectares of land between the Rakaia and Waimakariri Rivers from the Malvern foothills to State Highway One. Water will be abstracted at a rate of up to 40&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s from two points on the Waimakariri River and one point on the Rakaia River. The water will be irrigated directly from the river and via a storage system. The proposal includes a 55 metre high storage dam within the Waianiwaniwa Valley and associated land use applications for works within watercourses.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The proposed dam would be about 2 kilometres long, with a maximum height of 55 metres, with a base width of about 250 metres, and 10&amp;nbsp;m wide crest, with a capacity of 280 million cubic metres. The dam would be 1.5 kilometres north east of the town of Coalgate.&lt;ref&gt;URS (2006), Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme: Assessment of Environmental Effects for Resource Consent Applications to Canterbury Regional Council, [http://www.cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section3.pdf Section 3, page 3.18] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083741/http://www.cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section3.pdf |date=21 February 2007 }}, Prepared for Central Plains Water Trust, 23 June 2006, 42156547.66140 \ AEE R001C, by URS New Zealand Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; The two rivers and the reservoir would be connected by a headrace canal, 53 kilometres long, 5 metres deep and 30 metres wide (40–50 metres including embankments).&lt;ref&gt;URS (2006), Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme: Assessment of Environmental Effects for Resource Consent Applications to Canterbury Regional Council, [http://www.cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section3.pdf Section 3, page 3.24] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083741/http://www.cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section3.pdf |date=21 February 2007 }}, Prepared for Central Plains Water Trust, 23 June 2006, 42156547.66140 \ AEE R001C, by URS New Zealand Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Water would be delivered to farmers via 460 kilometres of water races, ranging in width from 14 to 27 metres, including the embankments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section3.pdf Section 3 Description of the Proposed Activities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929002851/http://www.cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section3.pdf |date=29 September 2011 }}, pages 3–36 to 3-50, URS (2006), Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme: Assessment of Environmental Effects for Resource Consent Applications to Canterbury Regional Council, Prepared for Central Plains Water Trust, 23 June 2006, Project Manager; Walter Lewthwaite, Project Director; Cliff Tipler, Authors; Mark Mabin, Cliff Tipler, Walter Lewthwaite, Klaus Ohlbock, Daniel Murray, Matthew Gardner, 42156547.66140 \ AEE R001C, by URS New Zealand Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A brief history==
{{main article|Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme Timeline}}
In 1991, Christchurch City Council and the Selwyn District Council, in their annual planning process, agree on a feasibility study on irrigation of the Central Plains. The two councils provide a budget and set up a joint steering committee.  In 2000, the steering committee contracts consulting firm URS New Zealand Limited to prepare a scoping report. In late 2001, the steering committee applies for [[resource consent]] to take 40&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s of water from the [[Rakaia River]] and the [[Waimakariri River]]. In January 2002, the steering committee releases the feasibility study and seeks to continue the project.

In 2003, the Central Plains Water Trust was set up to apply for resource consents, and the Trust establishes a company, Central Plains Water Limited, to raise funds from farmers via a share subscription. In 2004 Central Plains Water Limited issued a share prospectus and the share subscription is over-subscribed. In November 2005, further consent applications for land and water use were lodged with Canterbury Regional Council and Central Plains Water Limited becomes a 'requiring authority'. In June 2006,  further consent applications for land use and a notice of requirement, the precursor to the use of the Public Works Act to compulsorily acquire land, are lodged with Selwyn District Council.

In July 2007, the trustees of Central Plains Water Trust informed Christchurch City Council that they had run out of money to fund the lawyers and consultants needed for the consent and notice of requirement hearings. Christchurch City Council gave approval for Central Plains Water Limited to borrow up to $4.8 million from corporate dairy farmer Dairy Holdings Limited. The hearing to decide the resource consent applications and submissions and the notice of requirement commenced on 25 February 2008.

In September 2012, Selwyn District Council approved a loan of $5 million to Central Plains Water Limited for the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Supporters==
The Central Plains Water enhancement scheme has had a small but influential group of supporters, some of whom have been involved as steering committee members, trustees and company directors. The supporters have included development-minded council politicians, council staff with water engineering backgrounds,  directors of council-owned companies, farmer representatives and consultants. The advancement of the scheme appears to have coincided with career moves and business interests of some of these supporters.

The initial membership of Central Plains Water Enhancement Steering Committee consisted of Councillor Pat Harrow (Christchurch City Council) and Councillors Christiansen and Wild (Selwyn District Council)&lt;ref name="archived.ccc.govt.nz"&gt;[http://archived.ccc.govt.nz/Council/Proceedings/2000/February/StrategyResources/CentralPlainsIrrigationSteeringCommittee.pdf Report of Central Plains Irrigation Steering Committee] to Christchurch City Council Strategy and Resources Committee, 14 February 2000.

The estimate was $NZ409.6 million for a scheme area of 60,000 hectares, or $6,826 per hectare irrigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/F7E394A7-9AD4-4C51-AEED-C6E5F9E657F8/0/10Walter_James_Lewthwaite__BOE__31_1_08_final.pdf Brief of evidence of Walter James Lewthwaite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014233514/http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/F7E394A7-9AD4-4C51-AEED-C6E5F9E657F8/0/10Walter_James_Lewthwaite__BOE__31_1_08_final.pdf |date=14 October 2008 }}, dated 31 January 2008, paragraph 260.

==The feasibility study stage==

The constitution and terms of reference for the Central Plains Water Enhancement Steering Committee was approved on 14 February 2000.&lt;ref name="archived.ccc.govt.nz"/&gt; The terms of reference had these two objectives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* to execute feasibility studies into the viability and practicality of water enhancement schemes in the Central Plains area,..
* is to undertake feasibility studies for the Central Plains area sufficiently detailed to allow decisions on the advisability of proceeding to resource consent applications and eventual scheme implementation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The feasibility studies also had a required level of detail:&lt;blockquote&gt;The level of detail of these studies shall be sufficient to allow decisions to be made by the Councils on the advisability of proceeding to resource consent applications and scheme implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archived.ccc.govt.nz/council/proceedings/2000/february/StrategyResources/Clause9Attachment.pdf Constitution and Terms of Reference] of the Central Plains Water Enhancement Special joint committee.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By February 2001, the steering committee had identified 27 tasks that would be necessary to complete the feasibility study. The list of tasks is comprehensive; it included the assessment of economic effects, benefits, environmental effects, social effects, cultural effects, risks, planning, land accessibility, and environmental and technical feasibility, and consentability. Item 23 was specifically entitled 'Land Accessibility'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archived.ccc.govt.nz/Council/Proceedings/2001/March/Minutes22February2001.pdf Supplementary report by the Chairman of the Strategy and Resources Committee], 22 February 2001, Report by Allan Watson to Strategy and Resources Committee.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2002 the Central Plains Water Enhancement Steering Committee presented the URS feasibility report and their own report to a joint meeting of the two 'parent' Councils. On 18 February 2002 the reports were presented to the Strategy and Finance committee of the Christchurch City Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/Agendas/2002/February/StrategyFinance/CentralPlainsWaterEnhancementSteeringCommitteeQuarterlyReport.pdf Central Plains Water Enhancement Steering Committee Quarterly Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018094411/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/Agendas/2002/February/StrategyFinance/CentralPlainsWaterEnhancementSteeringCommitteeQuarterlyReport.pdf |date=18 October 2008 }} to Strategy and Finance committee, 18 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conclusion; page 9.14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"that a water enhancement scheme for the Central Plains can be built, is affordable, will have effects that can be mitigated, and is therefore feasible"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Steering Committee's conclusion was much less firm.&lt;blockquote&gt;"the affordability, bankability and consentability of the proposed scheme has been proved to a degree sufficient to give the [[Selwyn District]] Council and Christchurch City Councils confidence to proceed with the project to the next stage."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Steering Committee had not provided a full conclusion on a number of issues from the list of 27 feasibility study tasks. They had instead simply moved the resolution of a number of the important issues from the feasibility study stage to a new stage to be called 'concept refinement'. The issues to be dealt with later were;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/Agendas/2002/February/StrategyFinance/Clause12Attachment.pdf Central Plains Water Steering Committee Report on Feasibility Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195214/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/Agendas/2002/February/StrategyFinance/Clause12Attachment.pdf |date=24 July 2011 }}, 31 pages, **Embargoed until 10:30 am, Thursday 7 February 2002**&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court actions with other competing abstractors==
Central Plains Water Trust has been in some lengthy litigation with Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited and Synlait. The three entities have resource consents or applications for resource consents to take the same water - the remaining water from the Rakaia and Waimakariri Rivers, allocated for abstraction by the Rakaia Water Conservation Order or the Waimakariri Rivers Regional Plan. The issue before the courts is 'who has first access to limited water? The first to have consent granted? The first to file an application to take water? The first to file all necessary applications? The first to have replied to requests for information so that the application is complete and therefore 'notifiable'? The cases have been appealed up to the Supreme Court.

===Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited===

On 28 January 2005, [[Ngāi Tahu]] Properties Limited had applied for competing resource consents to take 3.96 m³/s of water from the [[Waimakariri River]] and use it for irrigation of 5,700 hectares of land to the north of the Waimakariri River. On 17 September 2005 the Ngai Tahu applications were publicly notified. A hearing before independent commissioners was held in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watere.org.nz/NR/rdonlyres/52E318FC-A5A8-4DBB-A178-6FFCEB4EF5C8/0/ngaidecision.pdf Ngai Tahu Properties Limited]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - Decision by Commissioners Philip Milne and Dr Brent Cowie, 21 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 and 27 June 2006, [[Ngāi Tahu]] Properties Limited sought a declaration from the [[Environment Court]] that their application to take water from the Waimakariri River had 'priority' over the 2001 CPWT application and therefore could be granted before the CPWT application.

On 22 August 2006, the Environment Court released a decision that Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited had priority to the remaining 'A' allocation block of water from the Waimakariri River over the Central Plains Water Trust application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watere.org.nz/NR/rdonlyres/B25AB4D0-210C-457F-BF57-6A28705195A6/0/NgaiTahuDecision.pdf Ngai Tahu Property Limited]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Decision No.c104/2006, Principal Environment Judge R J Bollard.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Plains Water Trust then appealed the decision to the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] on the grounds that as they had applied first their priority to the water should be upheld, in spite of the fact that a decision would be some time in the future. The High Court agreed with the Environment Court that priority to a limited resource went to the applications that were ready to be 'notifiable' first, not the applicant who applied first. That decision confirmed that Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited would be able to take water under their consents from the Waimakariri River at a more optimal minimum flow than any later consent granted to Central Plains Water Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZHC/2006/1482.html Central Plains Water Trust v Ngai Tahu Properties Limited and anor] HC CHCH CIV 2006-409-2116 [2006] NZHC 1482 (1 December 2006), In the High Court Of New Zealand Christchurch Registry CIV 2006-409-2116.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Central Plains Water Trust appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal and the case was heard on 28 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/0909B178-D842-4C2D-AC5D-E6E49D0F78AE/0/CPWOpeningLegalSubmissionsweb.pdf Legal submissions on behalf of Central Plains Water Trust and Central Plains Water Limited]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, paragraphs 71 &amp; 72, Ed Wylie Q.C., K.G.

==The corporate dairying connection==
In May 2007, confidential minutes from the March board meeting of Central Plains Water Limited were leaked to media. The minutes stated that the councils (Christchurch and Selwyn District) must agree to a 'bail out' loan or the scheme would be 'killed'. Central Plains Water later confirmed that the corporate dairy farming company, Dairy Holdings Limited, was prepared to offer a large loan to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  |title=CPW scheme sails into turbulent waters |first=Beck |last=Eleven |newspaper=The Press |date=6 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dairy Holdings Limited operates 57 dairy farms and is owned by [[Timaru]] millionaire [[Allan Hubbard (New Zealand)|Allan Hubbard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatustandard/4272105a6410.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913102635/http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatustandard/4272105a6410.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 September 2012 |title=Dairy Holdings accepts $30m offer |first=Tina |last=Law |newspaper=The Press |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=7 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fonterra]] board member Colin Armer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonterra.com/wps/wcm/connect/fonterracom/fonterra.com/Our+Business/Fonterra+at+a+Glance/Board+of+Directors/ View Full Profile Colin Armer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213062632/http://www.fonterra.com/wps/wcm/connect/fonterracom/fonterra.com/Our+Business/Fonterra+at+a+Glance/Board+of+Directors/# |date=13 December 2007 }}, Fonterra website.

On 5 June 2007, Christchurch City Council was informed that Central Plains Water Limited had 'a shortfall of $NZ1 million' and had run out of money needed to pay for the expenses of the impending hearings on the applications for the various [[resource consent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/proceedings/2007/June/CnclCover5thExtraordinary/CentralPlainsWaterTrust.pdf 'Central Plains Water Trust'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017100745/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/proceedings/2007/June/CnclCover5thExtraordinary/CentralPlainsWaterTrust.pdf |date=17 October 2008 }}, Author: Peter Mitchell, Report for the Christchurch City Council agenda Extraordinary Meeting, Tuesday 5 June 2007, at 3pm in the Council Chamber, Civic Offices.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2007, the Christchurch City Council authorised two Council general managers to approve loan agreements for CPWL to borrow up to a maximum of $4.8 million, subject to the Central Plains Water Trust continuing to 'own' the resource consents, as required by the April 2003 Memorandum of Understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/proceedings/2007/June/CnclCover14th/councilminutes7june2007.pdf Minutes of an extraordinary meeting of the Christchurch City Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018212632/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/proceedings/2007/June/CnclCover14th/councilminutes7june2007.pdf |date=18 October 2008 }}, held at 3pm on Tuesday 5 June 2007 and (meantime having been adjourned) reconvened at 11am on Thursday 7 June 2007, public excluded.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Ben Dingle, a director of the competing dairying company, Synlait, also questioned the community benefit of the Central Plains project, as the main benefits of irrigation schemes (increased land values and higher-value land-uses) flow to the landowners who have access to the water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominion.co.nz/thepress/4112534a13135.html Fights and rights over Canterbury's water]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Peter Luke, The Press, 30 June 2007.

A report to the Christchurch City Council meeting of 13 December 2007 gives the details of the final loan arrangements. On 19 October 2007, two Council general managers signed the loan agreement with Dairy Holdings Limited. The amount initially borrowed from Dairy Holdings Limited is $NZ1.7 million out of a maximum of $4.8 million. The law firm Anthony Harper had certified that the loan was not contrary to the Memorandum of Agreement as the [[resource consent]] applications were not used as security. However, the loan agreement grants a sub-licence from CPWL to Dairy Holdings Limited to use the CPW water consents by taking water for irrigation from the [[Rakaia River]]. The sub-licence will start from the date the consents are granted to the date that the whole scheme is operational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Council/proceedings/2007/December/CnclCover13th/CentralPlains%20Water.pdf 'Item 5.

A resource consent is specifically declared by the [[Resource Management Act 1991]] not to be real or personal property.&lt;ref&gt;Section 122(1) ''Resource Management Act'' 1991 (New Zealand)&lt;/ref&gt; Resource consents are not 'owned'; they are 'held' by 'consent holders'.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Resource Management Act'' 1991 (New Zealand) specifically refers to 'consent holders'. See Sections 120(1)(a), 122, 124, 127, 128, 129, 130, 132, 136, and 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Plains Water Trust applications for resource consents may not have been technically used as security for the loan from Dairy Holdings Limited. However, the Christchurch City Council report clarifies that Dairy Holdings Limited, will now get the benefit of the first use of water from the Rakaia River, under the loan arrangement. That benefit will flow from the date the consents are granted, which will be some years before any of the 'ordinary' farmer shareholders in CPWL receive water, once the full scheme is constructed.

The concept of guaranteed public 'ownership' of the resource consents by Central Plains Water Trust, is somewhat of a fiction, given that a private company, Central Plains Water Limited, has an exclusive licence to operate the consents to take and use water for irrigation, and particularly given that Central Plains Water Limited has already granted a sublicence for the Rakaia River water to Dairy Holdings Limited.

==Environmental effects==
The proposed scheme has a number of [[Environmental degradation|environmental effects]]. The dam would result in a loss of habitat for the endangered [[Canterbury mudfish]]. The dam would also affect amenity and landscape values, especially for the settlement of Coalgate. Water abstraction from the rivers will have an effect on [[ecology]] and other natural characteristics. The intensification of farming as a result of water being made available by the scheme has led to fears of increased [[nitrate]] contamination of the [[aquifer]]s.

===Canterbury mudfish habitat===
The [[Canterbury mudfish]] is a native freshwater fish of the galaxiid family that is found only in Canterbury. It is an acutely threatened species that is classified as 'Nationally Endangered'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/tsrp51.pdf New Zealand mudfish (Neochanna spp.) recovery plan] (Northland, black, brown, Canterbury and Chatham mudfish). 2003. Department of Conservation Threatened Species Recovery Plan 51. 25 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, staff of the [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]] (NIWA), were engaged by Central Plains to survey fish populations in the Waianiwaniwa River catchment as part of the investigation into the potential dam site. The survey identified a large and abundant population of Canterbury mudfish that had previously been unknown. NIWA concluded that the dam would be problematic for the mudfish as their habitat would be replaced by an unsuitable reservoir and the remaining waterways would be opened to predatory eels.&lt;ref&gt;Glova, G.; Duncan, M.; Henderson, R.; Kelly, D.; Walsh, J. 2001. 'Central Plains water enhancement: an assessment of potential environmental effects'. NIWA Client Report: CHC01/85.&lt;/ref&gt; Although NIWA did no further work for Central Plains Water, much of NIWA's fish survey was included in the assessment of effects on the environment prepared by URS New Zealand Limited. However, a new approach to the effects on the mudfish was included. Mitigation of the loss of habitat would be further evaluated following consultation with the Department of Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;URS (2006), Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme: Assessment of Environmental Effects for Resource Consent Applications to Canterbury Regional Council, [http://www.cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section8.pdf Section 8, page 8.40, para 8.6.5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014034036/http://www.cpw.org.nz/pdf06/Section8.pdf |date=14 October 2008 }}, Prepared for Central Plains Water Trust, 23 June 2006, 42156547.66140 \ AEE R001C, by URS New Zealand Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, and in January and February 2007, University of Canterbury researchers surveyed the Waianiwaniwa Valley for mudfish. The fish identified ranged from young recruits to mature adult fish, indicating a healthy population. Canterbury mudfish occur in at least 24 kilometres of the Waianiwaniwa River. Also, sites in the Waianiwaniwa Valley accounted for 47% of all fish database records known for Canterbury mudfish  (based on mean [[catch per unit effort]]). Therefore, it was concluded that the Waianiwaniwa catchment is the most important known habitat for this species.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, J. S., Norton, D. A. &amp; McIntosh, A. R.

'New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research', 2007, Vol. 41: 309-316, The Royal Society of New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; Forest and bird's expert witness, Ecologist Colin Meurk concluded that the Waiainiwaniwa catchment  "represents the largest known Canterbury mudfish habitat and is substantially larger than any other documented mudfish habitats.  A rare combination of conditions makes the Waianiwaniwa River a unique ecosystem and creates an important whole catchment refuge for the conservation of this 
nationally threatened species".&lt;ref&gt;Statement of evidence of Colin Douglas Meurk on behalf of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, para 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Angus McIntosh, Associate Professor of Freshwater Ecology in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury, presented evidence on behalf of the Department of Conservation. He disagreed with the CPW evidence on mudfish. He made three conclsuions:
* The Waianiwaniwa Valley population of Canterbury mudfish (''Neochanna burrowsius'') is the largest and most important population of this nationally endangered fish in existence.
* The construction of the dam in the Waianiwaniwa Valley will eliminate the natural population and mudfish will not be able to live in the reservoir or any connected streams.
* CPW's proposed measures to mitigate the loss of the Waianiwaniwa population of Canterbury mudfish are inadequate to address the significance and characteristics of the mudfish population that would be lost and are largely undocumented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/E705B735-4254-4EEA-B97D-1B4E86A68AF6/0/HearingEvidenceAngusMcIntosh.pdf Hearing Evidence - Angus McIntosh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016031419/http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/E705B735-4254-4EEA-B97D-1B4E86A68AF6/0/HearingEvidenceAngusMcIntosh.pdf |date=16 October 2008 }} Statement of evidence of Angus Ronald McIntosh on behalf of the Director General of Conservation, May 2008.

===Council Officer’s reports===
The summary Canterbury Regional Council report, by Principal Consents Advisor Leo Fietje, did not make a formal recommendation to either grant or decline the applications. However, it concluded, that on the basis of the applicant's evidence and the officer's reviews to date, that some adverse effects cannot be avoided, remedied or mitigated. Uncertainty remains over fish screens, natural character of the Waimakariri River, terrestrial ecology, and effects on lowland streams. Increased nitrate-nitrogen concentrations are considered significant. The loss of endangered [[Canterbury mudfish]] habitat due to the dam is considered to be a significant adverse effect. The report notes that any recommendations are not binding on the hearing panel, and that they may reach different conclusions on hearing further evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/CD6D02AA-B9BF-43E8-BED8-2D081FFE9D1A/0/001SelwynDistrictCouncils42AOfficerReport.pdf Section 42A Officer s Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016080659/http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/CD6D02AA-B9BF-43E8-BED8-2D081FFE9D1A/0/001SelwynDistrictCouncils42AOfficerReport.pdf |date=16 October 2008 }}, Date of Hearing: 25 February 2008, Report of Leo Fietje. Retrieved 2 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The summary Selwyn District Council report, by Nick Boyes of Resource Management Group Ltd, recommended declining both the Notice of Requirement and the applications for land use consents. The report also noted that any recommendation was not binding on the hearing panel, and they may reach different conclusions on hearing further evidence. Several reasons for the recommendation were given. CPW has relied on ten management plans to mitigate adverse effects, but has not provided draft copies of any such plans.  Insufficient information was provided, despite formal requests, for the Selwyn District Council witnesses to assess the significance of the social effects, the effects on archaeological and heritage values, effects on wetlands and terrestrial ecology, effects on water safety, and the effects on Ngai Tahu statutory acknowledgment areas. The cost-benefit-analysis, which was critical to the farmer-uptake and investment in, and therefore the viability of, the scheme, was considered to lack robustness and to overstate benefits and understate costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/CD6D02AA-B9BF-43E8-BED8-2D081FFE9D1A/0/001SelwynDistrictCouncils42AOfficerReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016080659/http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/CD6D02AA-B9BF-43E8-BED8-2D081FFE9D1A/0/001SelwynDistrictCouncils42AOfficerReport.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2008 |df=dmy }} Section 42A Officer s Report, Prepared by Nick Boyes on behalf of the Selwyn District Council, for Notices of Requirement by Central Plains Water Limited and Applications for Resource Consent by the Central Plains Water Trust. 31 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CPW evidence===
In resource consent hearings the burden of proof generally falls on the consent applicant to satisfy a hearing panel that the purpose of the Resource Management Act is met by granting rather than refusing consent. Also, a burden of proof lies on any party who wishes a hearing panel (or the Environment Court) to make a determination of adverse or positive effects. A 'scintilla' of probative evidence may be enough to make an issue of a particular adverse effect 'live' and therefore requiring rebuttal if it is not to be found to be established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmla.org.nz/_downloads/RMLA%20August-06_LR.pdf Carrying the burden: Considering the appropriate evidential tests in resource management decisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014041701/http://www.rmla.org.nz/_downloads/RMLA%20August-06_LR.pdf |date=14 October 2008 }}, By Claire Kirman, Ellis Gould and Catherine Somerville, Chapman Tripp, Resource Management Journal, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Officers' reports, in noting several adverse effects, have moved the burden of proof for rebuttal onto the witnesses for Central Plains Water Trust.

The opening legal submission for Central Plains Water Trust summarised their technical evidence and concluded that any adverse effects of the scheme will either be adequately mitigated or will be insignificant in light of the positive economic benefits of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/0909B178-D842-4C2D-AC5D-E6E49D0F78AE/0/CPWOpeningLegalSubmissionsweb.pdf Legal submissions on behalf of Central Plains Water Trust and Central Plains Water Limited]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Ed Wylie Q.C., K.G.

===Interim decision to decline dam===
On 3 April 2009, the Commissioners released a minute stating that consents to dam the Wainiwaniwa River were unlikely to be granted and that the hearing would be resumed on 11 May 2009 to decide whether to proceed with a proposal not including water storage. The minute requested legal submissions on that point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecan.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/B8197B52-39E8-4376-8914-960D3C2A5FF6/0/MinuteCommissioners01Apr2009.pdf Minute of the Commissioners]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 1 April 2009, Canterbury Regional Council website.

By the end of June 2010, six appeals of the decision had been lodged with the [[Environment Court of New Zealand|Environment Court]]. Central Plains Water Trust lodged one of the appeals as applicant in order to change some consent conditions which limit the taking of water to 12 hours a day. [[Christchurch City Council]]'s appeal was because it considered to much water would be taken from the [[Waimakariri River]] which may affect Christchurch's water supply. [[Fish and Game New Zealand|Fish and Game's]] appeal was motivated by concern over the [[Waimakariri River]] take and 'inadequate' fish screening conditions. [[Ngāi Tahu]]s appeal concerned the [[Waimakariri River]] take and the legality of the change in scope of the consents granted from what had been applied for. Other appellants were a member of the Deans family and some extractors of river gravel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch/3863496/Council-appeals-flawed-decision |title=Council appeals 'flawed' decision |newspaper=The Press |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand Limited |accessdate=29 June 2010 |date=29 June 2010 |first=David |last=Williams }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7229">Three '''Commonwealth Deputy Secretaries-General''' assist the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] in running the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], which is the central institution of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  They are assigned an aspect of the Commonwealth's function to address particularly: one to economic affairs, one to political affairs and the other to corporate affairs.

They are elected by the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]], like the Secretary-General.  However, as their terms overlap with those of the Secretary-General, and don't coincide with [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]s (CHOGMs), the Heads of Government are represented through their respective [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioners]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="Doxey"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doxey |first=Margaret |date=January 1979 |title=The Commonwealth Secretary-General: Limits of Leadership |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=67–83 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/2617133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the Secretariat only engaged two Deputy Secretaries-General, whilst the Corporate Affairs portfolio was overseen by an Assistant Secretary-General. This changed in 2014 with the appointment of Gary Dunn from [[Australia]] to the post. However, by the end of March 2017, references to the role and Dunn had been removed from the Secretariat's website, indicating that the role may have been abolished though no announcement had been made to that effect.

In addition to Dunn, the two Deputy Secretaries-General are Deodat Maharaj for Economic Affairs and Development from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and Josephine Ojiambo for Political Affairs from [[Kenya]] since 2014 and 2015 respectively.

== Biography ==

=== Beginnings ===
At 26 years old she began her life as an [[activist]] in 2000 with the now-defunct foundation "Amigos por la Vida" in the city of [[Guayaquil]]. In this [[volunteering|volunteer]] organization, she was initially the [[Secretary]] of the Foundation´s president. After a year, she began to connect with other [[NGO]] youth groups. She championed with other young [[LGBTI]] the processes related to sexual orientation and [[HIV/AIDS]] in the first bill of youth, promoted at the time by the "house of youth" of the old ministry of "social welfare" of Ecuador.

After several years, she directly contacted the Kimirina Corporation to participate as a field researcher in the "Needs Assessment" in transgender populations&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/siluetax/docs/info_diagnostico_schorer_1_ Draft Haya Uma] Diagnosing the needs of the transgender population in 2008 - In Spanish. Retrieved August 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which would reaffirm their hypothesis of the situational state of transgender people in those years. The results of the study were shown publicly after a year.

She developed [[LGBT rights in Ecuador|LGBT activist rights in Ecuador]] while she was in college studying Commercial Engineering, which she left in her 2nd year due to bullying at the various companies where she worked.

=== Community-based organization ===
In 2006, with the support of "transgender project" of Quito, she created in the city of Guayaquil the community-based organization (CBO): "Future Community", an organization that focuses on specialized local activism for gender identity. This proposal arose from the confusion and the need of its founders to separate the issues: [[sexual orientation]]  and gender identity. The organization failed after six months due to "GayPatriarchy - gaytriarcado" (a term coined by Diane Rodriguez in 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://gkillcity.com/index.php/fuck-you-curuchupa/725-diane-rodriguez-las-trans-en-ecuador-no-vivimos-en-democracia Gkill City], Extensive interview with Diane Rodriguez, where the term "Gaytriarcado - GayPatriarchy" arises - In Spanish. Retrieved August 8, 2013 .&lt;/ref&gt;) that illegitimated their work.

=== Silueta X ===
After serving for 26 years,  she created the girl group "Silhouette X" ([[Silueta X]]), whose name comes from the questioning before the system Kish - Straight. The activities of this group had such an impact that they had an interview in the ''Daily Spectator''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/internacional/articuloimpreso114628-fue-raza-ahora-el-sexo  Journal El Espectador of Colombia], "It was race, sex now, by Juan Camilo Maldonado - In Spanish. Retrieved August 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Colombia]] that discussed trans and intersex activism in Ecuador.

In 2010 the project "Social inclusion of young [[transgender]] people to be trained in micro-enterprises, decreasing [[poverty]], [[prostitution|sex work]] and proliferation [[HIV/AIDS]]" was approved, which gave the opportunity to legally register the organization and pass the "Girl Group Silhouette X" to "[[Silueta X]] Association".

=== Kidnapping ===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2016}}
In February 2012, she was kidnapped for four hours after leaving the "[[Silueta X]]" offices. The [[criminals]] knew Diane Rodriguez and her work. The event was strategically planned, and four months later she received a call indicating that the next time she would not go unscathed.

The financial loss was not a serious injury compared with the attempts to [[rape]] she suffered{{clarify|date=September 2016}}. This experience almost cost her her life, was reported in the respective state attorney general's office of the city of [[Guayaquil]]. She suffered from [[PTSD]] for almost two months.

== Activism ==

=== Incidence work ===
In 2008, while working in the "Hotel Oro Verde" of Guayaquil, she was unexpectedly fired by the hotel chain. Although it was the 3rd company that had done this to Diane Rodriguez, she had never filed a legal complaint due to a lack of knowledge of the laws, which allowed her to file a legal complaint against the company for employment discrimination. It is speculated that it was employment discrimination because the day before the group [[Silueta X]] developed a panel with the Kimirina Corporation and the "Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion of Ecuador" entitled: "Increasing [[HIV/AIDS]] awareness in transgender youth" and the event "the transgender and their capabilities", held at the zonal government of Guayaquil. The events were covered by various media and Diane Rodriguez publicly participated (at that time as a [[transvestite]]). Diane Rodriguez followed a legal process to sue the hotel, creating a precedent in the [[Ecuador]], in which an LGBT individual filed a discrimination lawsuit against a private company.{{reference_needed|date=September 2016}}

The legal battle continued until 2009. Rodriguez was not seeking damages or compensation, but only to be reinstated to her old job as a cashier, and have her gender identity respected at work. Public hearings from the [[ombudsman]] and the hotel were prolonged, but indicated that they could not accept it because her self-identification as a woman did not match her legal identity as Benedict Luis Rodriguez Zambrano.{{reference_needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Legal advocacy ===
The legal requirements of the hotel to reinstate her to work drove her to implement the campaign: "Females with Female Names", unleashing the legal implications of trans issues interest in this country. With the "Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador" of 2008 in its favor; which first entered the "[[gender identity]]" initiates a legal complaint against the "civil status" because it denies the request to change their names from male to female.

Her second [[legal]] battle resulted in her favor, after several internal adjustments of the "Civil Registration" with the [[Ombudsman]] in February 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniverso.com/2009/03/07/1/1445/57F0EA89F0B1405185AAE883673D4C24.html Daily El Universo], "Transgender with new identity" - In Spanish.

Retrieved August 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in transgender identity. A [[law]] was created to establish access for transgender, transsexual and intersex people to change their names masculine to feminine or vice versa .

After partially meeting the legal demands of the hotel company, she continued with the first filed legal complaint, ignoring the change of its female names for later testify in open court, that the hotel had economic problems and were downsizing. This stalled the process of the employment discrimination complaint because they could not incorporate it to work, by economic arguments. The hotel promised to locate another company for Diane Rodriguez, but that never materialized. Later, another complaint was presented to the Ombudsman's Office, where it was found that the hotel, months after the legal process, was in search of new cashiers to work in the same hotel company. The case continues and is still open, and there is no legal resolution from the Ombudsman's Office of Ecuador.

Completing this year, through a protective action against the Civil Registration, other legal process starts on this occasion to demand recognition of their female gender identity, sponsored by the Ombudsman's Office. However, months after she was denied the action for defense by the first civil court. The judicial record of the complaint, after this result, instead of continuing to the provincial court, stagnates when dilated by the Ombudsman's Office, lost her case for sex change in the identity card, after a couple years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlaantonelli.com/notis-12072010-juez-ecuador-niega-cambio-sexo-citando-biblias.htm Digital Journal - Carla Antonelli - In Spanish].

Similarly, institutional programs to combat so-called "gender violence" contribute to a naturalization of the relationship between violence and masculinity, masking their own violence to marital and family structures (which are further reinforced by the demands of gay marriage)».&lt;ref&gt;[http://lasdisidentes.com/2012/06/27/entrevista-a-beatriz-preciado-por-jesus-carrillo/ The Dissidents - Art Collective, In Spanish] Interview with Beatriz Preciado by Jesus Carrillo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7912">'''Econocracy''' defines a society in which improving the economy has become the main purpose of politics and economic policymaking has become a [[Technocracy|technocratic]] process.

The term econocrat was first coined by [[Peter Self]] in 1976 to describe those with the professional training that qualifies them in the eyes of society as an expert on the [[economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Self, Peter (1976), ''Econocrats and the Policy Process: Politics and Philosophy of Cost-benefit Analysis''. Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term Econocracy was then developed by several different writers in 2016 to talk about how the economy and economists themselves have come to play a central role in modern societies.

== Definition ==

Earle, Moran and Ward-Perkins argue in their book [[The Econocracy (book)|''The Econocracy: The perils of leaving economics to the experts'']] that an econocracy has the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Earle, Joe; Moran, Cahal; Ward-Perkins, Zach (2016), ''The Econocracy: The perils of leaving economics to the experts''. Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A society in which a wide range of political goals are defined and valued in terms of their effect on the economy. 
*The economy is believed to be a distinct system with its own logic.  
*This system requires experts to manage it and so economic policymaking increasingly becomes a technocratic process.

== Relation to democracy ==

In an econocracy politicians prioritise management of the economy and subordinate other policy areas to economic considerations. The perceived competency on the economy of political parties is in turn a key indicator of electoral success. In an econocracy a broad range of activities from the arts, education, health and literature are justified as valuable because they contribute positively to the economy.

Econocracy undermines [[Participatory democracy|participatory]] and [[deliberative democracy]] because it delegates decision-making to economic experts and because public discourse is jargon-heavy and expert-led.  For example, in the UK, only 12% of respondents in a [[YouGov]] poll believe that politicians and the media talk about economics in a way that is accessible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecnmy.org/about/, last retrieved July 7th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In another poll, less than 40% of respondents could correctly identify the definitions of [[Gross Domestic Product|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]] and of [[quantitative easing]], given a list of possible answers.&lt;ref&gt;Post-Crash Economics/Yougov, ‘YouGov / Post Crash Economics Society Survey Results’, 27th - 28th January 2015. Available at: https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/1h0dojy3oj/PostCrashEconomicsSocietyResults_150128_economics_W.pdf, accessed on July 7th, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Relevant to econocracy, globally economics is dominated by a particular perspective often called [[neoclassical economics]]. The pluralism in economics movement has highlighted the narrowness of much teaching and research in economics and sought to demonstrate how this lack of intellectual diversity has harmful effects on democracy and social welfare. Many economists reject this claim and seek to demonstrate the intellectual diversity within economics.&lt;ref&gt;See for example https://www.ft.com/content/74cd0b94-4de6-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0?mhq5j=e2 and http://www.res.org.uk/view/art2Apr15Comment.html, both accessed on July 7th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Econocracy may be compatible with forms of procedural democracy provided citizens have the requisite level of economic knowledge to make an informed choice about which political parties or individuals best represent their economic interests. The quality of public discourse and public education on economics are important factors in whether this criterion is met.

== History of econocracy ==
The roots of econocracy can be traced back to the [[Economy#invention of the economy|invention of the economy]] in the 1930s. The increase in the power of the state to collect information led to the creation of GDP. This in turn led to the impression that the economy could be accurately measured and controlled. [[Second World War|World War Two]] then brought economists to prominent positions within policy, as they used their mathematical skills to help with the war effort, with this then continuing after the war, as evidence by the creation of the [[Council of Economic Advisors]] in the US and the [[Government Economic Service]] in the UK, as well as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] on an international level. Over time politicians also began to focus their messages increasingly around their effect on the economy, with the mentions of ‘the economy’ in winning party manifestos in the UK going from once in 1950 to 59 times in 2015, as well as famous campaign messages based around it, such as [[It's the economy, stupid|“it’s the economy, stupid”]] in [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|1992 Presidential Campaign]].

== Econocracy and elites ==
The concept of a ‘new professional econocracy’ has been used to describe the increasing proportion of leaders in society who have educational or professional experiences of economics or related disciplines such as accounting and business studies.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Aeron (2017), ''The New Professional Econocracy and the Maintenance of Elite Power'', cf. https://doi.org/10.1177/0032321716674023&lt;/ref&gt; Econocracy, it is argued, advantages contemporary elites in several ways. First, it links disparate elite sectors and institutions together by providing a common ideology, language and policy framework. Second, it operates as a form of governmentality, providing a system of tools, practices and mechanisms to effect a top-down ‘rule by numbers’. Finally, it enables elites to move across sectors and networks more easily. It also facilitates short-term gaming of systems and evasion of long-term accountability.

In terms of membership economics is narrow. For example, in the UK only 1 in 4 academic economists are women, and the ratio is similar for students.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, Victoria, ''Is economics a sexist science?'', Times Higher Education, 15 September 2015. Available at: https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/is-economics-a-sexist-science (accessed 13 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2010 [[Royal Economic Society]] survey found that 82% of UK respondents were white. Furthermore, of 75 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] winners in economics only two were not white and one was a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Blanco , Laura and Mumford, Karen, Royal Economic Society Women’s Committee Survey on the Gender and Ethnic Balance of Academic Economics 2010, report, Royal Economics Society, October 2010, 20. Available at: http://www.res.org.uk/SpringboardWebApp/userfiles/res/file/Womens%20Committee/Biennial%20Report/Womens%20Committee%202010%20survey%20report%202010.pdf (accessed 13 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Econocracy and the rise of populist movements ==
High-profile political events in 2016 appeared to in many ways challenge the legitimacy of economic expertise. Both in Donald Trump’s victorious campaign to become President of the United States and particularly in the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, large proportions of the public ignored economists’ warnings against such decisions. This has been explained by some as showing that people no longer have trust in expertise&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8339, retrieved on July 7th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; (and is linked to the idea of [[Post-Truth Politics|post-truth politics]]) and by others as caused by economists message simply not getting through to people (due to a supposedly partisan media).&lt;ref&gt;https://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/ge2017-why-economic-facts-will-be.html, retrieved on July 7th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigeria]] is a middle-income, [[mixed economy]] and [[emerging market]], with expanding manufacturing, financial, service, communications, technology and entertainment sectors. It is ranked as the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|30th-largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|23rd-largest in terms of purchasing power parity]]. It is the largest economy in Africa; its re-emergent manufacturing sector became the largest on the continent in 2013, and it produces a large proportion of goods and services for the [[West Africa]]n subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.kpmg.com/Africa/en/IssuesAndInsights/Articles-Publications/General-Industries-Publications/Documents/Manufacturing%20sector%20report%202015.pdf |title=Manufacturing Sector Report, 2015: Manufacturing in Africa |year=2015 |publisher=[[KPMG]] |access-date=18 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927185014/http://www.kpmg.com/Africa/en/IssuesAndInsights/Articles-Publications/General-Industries-Publications/Documents/Manufacturing%20sector%20report%202015.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] is 11 percent, which is 8 percent below the 2012 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/06/nigeria-gdp-idUSL6N0MY0LT20140406 |title=UPDATE 2-Nigeria surpasses South Africa as continent's biggest economy |access-date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously hindered by years of mismanagement, economic reforms of the past decade{{When|date=April 2017}} have put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential. Nigerian GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) has almost tripled from $170 billion in 2000 to $451 billion in 2012, although estimates of the size of the [[informal sector]] (which is not included in official figures) put the actual numbers closer to $630 billion. Correspondingly, the GDP per capita doubled from $1400 per person in 2000 to an estimated $2,800 per person in 2012 (again, with the inclusion of the informal sector, it is estimated that GDP per capita hovers around $3,900 per person). (Population increased from 120 million in 2000 to 160 million in 2010). These figures were to be revised upwards by as much as 80% when metrics were to be recalculated subsequent to the rebasing of its economy in April 2014.{{Update inline|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=nws&amp;q=nigeria+rebasing+gdp|title=nigeria rebasing gdp - Google Search|publisher=|access-date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although oil revenues contribute 2/3 of state revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/77886786-0fc9-11e7-b030-768954394623|title=Subscribe to read|website=www.ft.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil only contributes about 9% to the GDP. Nigeria produces only about 2.7% of the world's oil supply (in comparison, [[Saudi Arabia]] produces 12.9%, [[Russia]] produces 12.7% and the [[United States]] produces 8.6%).&lt;ref&gt;[[Petroleum#Production|- World Petroleum Production]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the petroleum sector is important, as government revenues still heavily rely on this sector, it remains a small part of the country's overall economy.

The largely subsistence agricultural sector has not kept up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now{{When|date=April 2017}} imports some of its food products, though mechanization has led to a resurgence in manufacturing and exporting of food products, and the move towards food sufficiency. In 2006, Nigeria successfully convinced the [[Paris Club]] to let it buy back the bulk of its debts owed to them for a cash payment of roughly US$12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/3223/|title=Resolving Nigeria's Debt Through a Discounted Buyback|work=Center For Global Development|access-date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Citigroup]] report published in February 2011, Nigeria will have the highest average GDP growth in the world between 2010 and 2050. Nigeria is one of two countries from Africa among 11 [[3G (countries)|Global Growth Generators]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/willem-buiter-3g-countries-2011-2?slop=1 |title=FORGET THE BRICs: Citi's Willem Buiter Presents The 11 "3G" Countries That Will Win The Future |publisher=businessinsider.com |date=22 February 2011 |access-date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In 2014, Nigeria changed its economic analysis to account for rapidly growing contributors to its GDP, such as telecommunications, banking, and its film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21600685-nigerias-suddenly-supersized-economy-indeed-wonder-so-are-its-still-huge|title=Africa’s new Number One|author=|date=|work=Economist.com|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Nigeria achieved a milestone agreement with the Paris Club of lending nations to eliminate all of its bilateral external debt. Under the agreement, the lenders will forgive most of the debt, and Nigeria will pay off the remainder with a portion of its energy revenues. Outside of the energy sector, Nigeria's economy is highly inefficient. Moreover, human capital is underdeveloped—Nigeria ranked 151 out of countries in the United Nations Development Index in 2004—and non-energy-related infrastructure is inadequate.

From 2003 to 2007, Nigeria attempted to implement an economic reform program called the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS). The purpose of the NEEDS was to raise the country's [[standard of living]] through a variety of reforms, including macroeconomic stability, [[deregulation]], [[liberalization]], [[privatization]], transparency, and accountability.

The NEEDS addressed basic deficiencies, such as the lack of freshwater for household use and irrigation, unreliable power supplies, decaying infrastructure, impediments to private enterprise, and corruption. The government hoped that the NEEDS would create 7 million new jobs, diversify the economy, boost non-energy exports, increase industrial capacity utilization, and improve agricultural productivity. A related initiative on the state level is the State Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (SEEDS).

A longer-term economic development program is the United Nations (UN)-sponsored National Millennium Goals for Nigeria. Under the program, which covers the years from 2000 to 2015, Nigeria is committed to achieving a wide range of ambitious objectives involving poverty reduction, education, gender equality, health, the environment, and international development cooperation. In an update released in 2004, the UN found that Nigeria was making progress toward achieving several goals but was falling short on others.

Specifically, Nigeria had advanced efforts to provide universal primary education, protect the environment, and develop a global development partnership.

A prerequisite for achieving many of these worthwhile objectives is curtailing endemic corruption, which stymies development and taints Nigeria's business environment. President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s campaign against corruption, which includes the arrest of officials accused of misdeeds and recovering stolen funds, has won praise from the [[World Bank]]. In September 2005, Nigeria, with the assistance of the World Bank, began to recover US$458 million of illicit funds that had been deposited in Swiss banks by the late military dictator Sani Abacha, who ruled Nigeria from 1993 to 1998. However, while broad-based progress has been slow, these efforts have begun to become evident in international surveys of corruption. In fact, Nigeria's ranking has consistently improved since 2001 ranking 147 out of 180 countries in [[Transparency International]]'s 2007 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].

The Nigerian economy suffers from an ongoing [[Nigerian energy supply crisis|supply crisis in the power sector]]. Despite a rapidly growing economy, some of the world's [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|largest deposits of coal, oil and gas]] and the country's status as Africa's largest oil producer only 40% of Nigeria's population is connected to the energy grid whilst power supply difficulties are experienced around 60% of the time.

NOTES:

The US dollar exchange rate is an estimated average of the official rate throughout a year, and does not reflect the parallel market rate at which the general population accesses foreign exchange. This rate ranged from a high of 520 in March 2017 to a low of 350 in August 2017, due to a scarcity of forex (oil earnings had dropped by half), and to speculative activity as alleged by the Central Bank. All the while the official rate was pegged at 360.

Per capita income (as % of USA) is calculated using data from estimates in the PPP link above, and from census estimates, based on growth rates between census periods. For instance 2017 GDPs were 1,125 Billion (Nigeria) vs. 19,417 Billion (USA) and populations were estimated at 320 million vs 190 million. The ratio is therefore (1125/19417) / (190/320), which roughly comes to 0.0975. These are estimates and are intended to get a feel for the relative wealth and standard of living, as well as the market potential of its middle class.

For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 1 USD to 314.27 [[Nigerian naira|Nigerian Naira]] (as of 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=USD&amp;To=NGN|title=XE: Convert USD/NGN.

Current GDP per capita of Nigeria expanded 132% in the sixties reaching a peak growth of 283% in the seventies. But this proved unsustainable and it consequently shrank by 66% in the Eighties. In the Nineties, diversification initiatives finally took effect and decadal growth was restored to 10%. Although GDP on a PPP basis did not increase until the 2000's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factfish.com/statistic-country/nigeria/gross%20domestic%20product%20per%20capita,%20constant%202005%20us%20$|title=factfish Gross domestic product per capita, constant 2005 US $ for Nigeria|website=factfish.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the GDP was composed of the following sectors: agriculture: 40%; services: 30%; manufacturing: 15%; oil: 14%.&lt;ref name="National Bureau of Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng |title= News 2012|publisher=Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics|access-date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the GDP was composed of the following sectors: agriculture: 18%; services: 55%; manufacturing: 16%;  oil: 8% &lt;ref name="Product Report NBS" /&gt;

In 2005 Nigeria's inflation rate was an estimated 15.6%. Nigeria's goal under the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) program is to reduce inflation to the single digits. By 2015, Nigeria's inflation stood at 9%. In 2005, the federal government had expenditures of US$13.54 billion but revenues of only US$12.86 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of 5%. By 2012, expenditures stood at $31.61 billion, while revenues was $54.48 billion.

== Economic sectors ==

===Agriculture===
{{Further information|Agriculture in Nigeria}}

[[File:Nigerian farmers.jpg|thumb|300px|Nigerian farmers in the [[Middle Belt]] (2006). 30% of Nigerians are employed in agriculture.&lt;ref name="same name"&gt;Olomola Ade S. (2007) “Strategies for Managing the Opportunities and Challenges of the Current Agricultural Commodity Booms in SSA” in Seminar Papers on Managing Commodity Booms in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Publication of the AERC Senior Policy Seminar IX. African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), Nairobi, Kenya&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Nigeria [[List of countries by agricultural output|ranks sixth]] worldwide and first in Africa in farm output. The sector accounts for about 18% of GDP and almost one-third of employment. Nigeria has 19 million head of cattle, the largest in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201405160659.html|title=Nigeria to Increase Beef Consumption to 1.3 Million Tonnes By 2050 - Adesina|author=|date=16 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2017|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Nigeria is no longer a major exporter, due to local consumer boom, it is still a major producer of many agricultural products, including: cocoa, groundnuts (peanuts), rubber, and palm oil. [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] production, mostly from obsolete varieties and overage trees has increased from around 180,000 tons annually to 350,000 tons.

Major agricultural products include [[Cassava production in Nigeria|cassava]] (tapioca), corn, cocoa, millet, palm oil, peanuts, rice, rubber, sorghum, and yams. In 2003, livestock production, in order of metric tonnage, featured eggs, milk, beef and veal, poultry, and pork, respectively. In the same year, the total fishing catch was 505.8 metric tons. Roundwood removals totaled slightly less than 70 million cubic meters, and sawnwood production was estimated at 2 million cubic meters. The agricultural sector suffers from extremely low productivity, reflecting reliance on antiquated methods. Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, so that the country, which once exported food, now imports a significant amount of food to sustain itself. However, efforts are being made towards making the country food sufficient again.

===Oil===
{{Further information|Petroleum industry in Nigeria}}
Nigeria's proven [[oil reserves]] are estimated to be {{convert|35|Goilbbl|m3}}; natural gas reserves are well over {{convert|100|Tcuft|km3}}. Nigeria is a member of the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC). The types of [[crude oil]] exported by Nigeria are [[Bonny light oil]], [[Forcados crude oil]], [[Qua Ibo crude oil]] and [[Brass River crude oil]]. Poor corporate relations with indigenous communities, vandalism of oil infrastructure, severe ecological damage, and personal security problems throughout the [[Niger Delta]] oil-producing region continue to plague Nigeria's oil sector.

Efforts are underway{{When|date=April 2017}} to reverse these troubles. A new entity, the [[Niger Delta Development Commission]] (NDDC), has been created to help catalyze economic and social development in the region. The U.S. remains Nigeria's largest buyer of crude oil, accounting for 40% of the country's total oil exports; Nigeria provides about 10% of overall U.S. oil imports and ranks as the fifth-largest source for U.S. imported oil.

The United Kingdom is Nigeria's largest trading partner followed by the United States. Although the trade balance overwhelmingly favors Nigeria, thanks to oil exports, a large portion of U.S. exports to Nigeria is believed to enter the country outside of the Nigerian government's official statistics, due to importers seeking to avoid Nigeria's tariffs. To counter smuggling and under-invoicing by importers, in May 2001, the Nigerian government instituted a full inspection program for all imports, and enforcement has been sustained.

On the whole, Nigerian high tariffs and non-tariff barriers are gradually being reduced,{{When|date=April 2017}} but much progress remains to be made.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The government also has been encouraging the expansion of foreign investment, although the country's investment climate remains daunting to all but the most determined.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The stock of U.S. investment is nearly $7 billion, mostly in the energy sector. [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] are the two largest U.S. corporations in offshore oil and gas production. Significant exports of liquefied natural gas started in late 1999 and are slated to expand as Nigeria seeks to eliminate gas flaring by 2008.

The pump price of P.M.S. currently{{When|date=April 2017}} stands at around ₦145 at fueling stations across Nigeria. An initial increase in the price of petrol (Premium Motor Spirit) from around ₦65 to ₦140 triggered by the removal of fuel subsidies on January 1, 2012, triggered a total strike and massive protests across the country. Then President [[Goodluck Ebele Jonathan]] later reached an agreement with the [[Nigerian Labour Congress]] and reduced the pump price to 97 naira. The pump price was further reduced by 10 naira to 87 naira in the run-up to the 2015 general elections. However, after the elections of [[Muhammadu Buhari]], the fuel subsidies was removed again, and the pump price increased again, despite the fall in oil price.
 
Since the fall in oil prices in 2015 and 2016, the government exchange rate policy has limited devaluation of the naira due to inflation concerns by the President Muhammadu Buhari.&lt;ref name="Can you spare a dollar"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21695065-how-make-hard-currency-shortage-worse-can-you-spare-dollar|title=Can you spare a dollar?|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pulse.ng/local/buhari-why-president-should-devalue-naira-chuba-ezekwesili-video-id4824955.html|title=Buhari: Why President should devalue naira – Chuba Ezekwesili [VIDEO]|last=Sotubo|first='Jola|website=pulse.ng|access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
Nigeria [[List of countries by GDP sector composition|ranks 27th]] worldwide and first in Africa in services' output.

Since undergoing severe distress in the mid-1990s, Nigeria's banking sector has witnessed significant growth over the last few years{{When|date=April 2017}} as new banks enter the financial market.

Private sector-led economic growth remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, including the need to duplicate essential infrastructure, the lack of effective due process, and nontransparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting. While corrupt practices are endemic, they are generally less flagrant than during military rule, and there are signs of improvement. Meanwhile, since 1999 the Nigerian Stock Exchange has enjoyed strong performance, although equity as a means to foster corporate growth is being more utilized by Nigeria's private sector.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}

====Transport====
{{main article|Transport in Nigeria}}

[[File:Lagos Life goes on.jpg|thumb|300px|Minibuses in Lagos]]
Nigeria's publicly owned transportation infrastructure is a major constraint to economic development. Principal ports are at [[Lagos]] ([[Apapa]] and [[Tin Can Island]]), [[Port Harcourt]] (Onne), and [[Calabar]].

Extensive road repairs and new construction activities are gradually being implemented as state governments, in particular, spend their portions of enhanced government revenue allocations.

Five of Nigeria's airports (Lagos, [[Kano]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Enugu]] and [[Abuja]]) currently ply international destinations. The [[Nigerian Airforce]] began a new airline called United Nigeria, with a [[Boeing 737-500]] in 2013. There are several domestic private Nigerian carriers, and air service among Nigeria's cities is generally dependable.

===Overseas remittances===
A major source of foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria are [[remittances]] sent home by Nigerians living abroad.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.ng"&gt;[http://www.tribune.com.ng/business/tribune-business/item/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy  "Remittances from diaspora Nigerians as lubricant for the economy", [[Nigerian Tribune]], 8 September 2014.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317150032/http://www.tribune.com.ng/business/tribune-business/item/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy |date=17 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 17.5 million Nigerians lived in foreign countries, with the UK and the USA having more than 2 million Nigerians each.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.ng"/&gt;

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], Nigeria witnessed a dramatic increase in [[remittances]] sent home from overseas Nigerians, going from USD 2.3 billion in 2004 to 17.9 billion in 2007, representing 6.7% of GDP. The United States accounts for the largest portion of official remittances, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Spain and France. On the African continent, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Libya and South Africa are important source countries of remittance flows to Nigeria, while China is the biggest remittance-sending country in Asia.

==Labour force==
In 2015, Nigeria had a labour force of 74 million. In 2003, the unemployment rate was 10.8% overall; by 2015, unemployment stood at 6.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.punchng.com/business/business-economy/only-4-67-million-nigerians-are-unemployed-nbs/ | title=Only 4.67 million Nigerians are unemployed —NBS | publisher=The Punch Newspaper | date=15 May 2015 | access-date=17 May 2015 | author=Onuba, Ifeanyi | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526214618/http://www.punchng.com/business/business-economy/only-4-67-million-nigerians-are-unemployed-nbs/ | archivedate=26 May 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) a union umbrella organization, has called six general strikes to protest domestic fuel price increases. However, in March 2005 the government introduced legislation ending the NLC's monopoly over union organizing. In December 2005, the NLC was lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage for federal workers. The existing minimum wage, which was introduced six years earlier but has not been adjusted since, has been whittled away by inflation to only US$42.80 per month.

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigrants]] residing in Nigeria has more than doubled in recent decades – from 477,135 in 1991 to 971,450 in 2005. The majority of immigrants in Nigeria (74%) are from neighbouring [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and that this number has increased considerably over the last decade, from 63% in 2001 to 97% in 2005.

===Human capital===
{{Further information|Education in Nigeria}}
The [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) shows in 2012 that Nigeria is ranked 156 with the value of 0.459 among 187 countries. As of 2015, Nigeria's HDI is ranked 152nd at 0.514. The comparative value for Sub-Saharan Africa is 0.475, 0.910 for the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/USA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119004452/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/USA.html |archivedate=19 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 0.694 for the world average.

The value for the education index is 0.457, compared to the average in the US of 0.939. The expected years of schooling in Nigeria is 9.0 (16.00 in the US), while the mean years of schooling for adults over 25 years is 5.2 years (12.4 years in the US). Additionally, Nigeria is also facing a relatively high inequality, worsening the problem regarding the formation of human capital. The income distribution for the poorest (bottom 10%) is 1.6% while it is 40.8% for the richest (top 10%). Among 114 countries the income distribution places Nigeria respectively in 94th position for the poorest and 17th for the richest.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

== Government policy ==

=== Inflation ===
{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}In the light of highly expansionary public sector fiscal policies in 2001, the government sought ways to head off higher inflation, leading to the implementation of stronger monetary policies by the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) and underspending of budgeted amounts. As a result of the CBN's efforts, the official exchange rate for the Naira has stabilized at about 112 Naira to the dollar. The combination of CBN's efforts to prop up the value of the Naira and excess liquidity resulting from government spending led the currency to be discounted by around 20% on the parallel (non-official) market.

A key condition of the Stand-by Arrangement has been closure of the gap between the official and parallel market exchange rates. The [[Inter Bank Foreign Exchange Market]] (IFEM) is closely tied to the official rate. Under IFEM, banks, oil companies, and the CBN can buy or sell their foreign exchange at government-influenced rates. Much of the informal economy, however, can only access foreign exchange through the parallel market. Companies can hold domiciliary accounts in private banks, and account holders have unfettered use of the funds.

Expanded government spending also has led to upward pressure on consumer prices. Inflation which had almost disappeared in April 2000 reached 14.5% by the end of the year and 18.7% in August 2001. In 2000, high oil prices resulted in government revenue of over $16 billion, about double the 1999 level. State and local governments demanded access to this "windfall" revenue, creating a tug-of-war between the federal government, which sought to control spending, and state governments desiring augmented budgets, preventing the government from making provision for periods of lower oil prices.

In 2016, the black market exchange rate of the Naira was about 60% above the official rate. The central bank releases about $200 million each week at the official exchange rate. However, some companies cite that budgets now include a 30% “premium” to be paid to central bank officials to get dollars.&lt;ref name="Can you spare a dollar"/&gt;

===Gradual reform===
{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}The Obasanjo government supported "private-sector" led, "market oriented" [[economic growth]] and began extensive economic reform efforts. Although the government's anti-corruption campaign was left wanting, progress in injecting transparency and accountability into economic decision-making was notable. The dual exchange rate mechanism formally abolished in the 1999 budget remains in place in actuality.

During 2000 the government's privatization program showed signs of life and real promise with successful turnover to the private sector of state-owned banks, fuel distribution companies, and cement plants. However, the privatization process has slowed somewhat as the government confronts key parastatals such as the state telephone company [[NITEL]] and Nigerian Airways. The successful auction of GSM telecommunications licenses in January 2001 has encouraged investment in this vital sector.

Although the government has been stymied so far in its desire to deregulate downstream petroleum prices, state refineries, almost paralyzed in 2000, are producing at much higher capacities. By August 2001, gasoline lines disappeared throughout much of the country. The government still intends to pursue deregulation despite significant internal opposition, particularly from the [[Nigeria Labour Congress]]. To meet market demand the government incurs large losses importing gasoline to sell at subsidized prices.

==Foreign economic relations==
Nigeria's foreign economic relations revolve around its role in supplying the world economy with oil and natural gas, even as the country seeks to diversify its exports, harmonize tariffs in line with a potential [[customs union]] sought by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and encourage inflows of foreign portfolio and direct investment. In October 2005, Nigeria implemented the ECOWAS [[common external tariff]], which reduced the number of tariff bands.

Prior to this revision, tariffs constituted Nigeria's second largest source of revenue after oil exports. In 2005 Nigeria achieved a major breakthrough when it reached an agreement with the Paris Club to eliminate its bilateral debt through a combination of write-downs and buybacks. Nigeria joined the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] in July 1971 and the [[World Trade Organization]] in January 1995.

===External trade===
[[Image:2006Nigeria exports.PNG|thumb|450px|Nigeria's exports in 2006.]]
[[File:Nigeria Export Treemap (2011).png|450px|thumb|A proportional representation of Nigeria's exports.]]
In 2005, Nigeria imported about US$26 billion of goods. In 2004 the leading sources of imports were China (9.4%), the United States (8.4%), the United Kingdom (7.8%), the Netherlands (5.9%), France (5.4%), Germany (4.8%), and Italy (4%). Principal imports were manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, and food and live animals.

In 2005, Nigeria exported about US$52 billion of goods. In 2004, the leading destinations for exports were the United States (47.4%), Brazil (10.7%), and Spain (7.1%). In 2004 oil accounted for 95% of merchandise exports, and cocoa and rubber accounted for almost 60% of the remainder.

In 2005, Nigeria posted a US$26 billion trade surplus, corresponding to almost 20% of gross domestic product. In 2005, Nigeria achieved a positive current account balance of US$9.6 billion. The Nigerian currency is the [[naira]] (NGN). As of mid-June 2006, the [[exchange rate]] was about US$1=NGN128.4. In recent years, Nigeria has expanded its trade relations with other developing countries such as India. Nigeria is the largest African crude oil supplier to India — it annually exports {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} to India valued at US$10 billion annually.

India is the largest purchaser of Nigeria's oil which fulfills 20% to 25% of India's domestic oil demand. Indian oil companies are also involved in oil drilling operations in Nigeria and have plans to set up refineries there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/india-now-nigerias-biggest-crude-oil-buyer/article4917091.ece?homepage=true | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=India now Nigeria's biggest crude oil buyer | date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade volume between Nigeria and the United Kingdom rose by 35% from [[USD]]6.3 billion in 2010 to [[USD]]8.5 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===External debt===
In 2012, Nigeria's external debt was an estimated $5.9 billion and N5.6 trillion domestic - putting total debt at $44 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-s-domestic-external-debts-now-44bn/113910/|title=Nigeria’s Domestic, External Debts Now $44bn, Articles - THISDAY LIVE|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613031521/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-s-domestic-external-debts-now-44bn/113910/|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Nigeria became the first African country to fully pay off its debt owed to the [[Paris Club]]. This was structured as a debt writeoff of approximately $18 billion and a cash payment of approximately $12 billion.

===Foreign investment===
In 2012, Nigeria received a net inflow of US$85.73 billion of [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI), much of which came from Nigerians in the diaspora. Most FDI is directed toward the energy and banking sectors. Any public designed to encourage inflow of foreign capital is capable of generating employment opportunities within the domestic economy. The Nigerian Enterprises Promotion (NEP) Decree of 1972 (revised in 1977) was intended to reduce foreign investment in the Nigerian economy. This type of policy is not relevant in an economy with a rapidly growing force like Nigeria.

Although one may accept the rationale for the promulgation of that decree at that time i.e. to promote indigenous entrepreneurship. But the decree or any exchange control policy that has the potential to discourage foreign investment will not be relevant under the present economic dispensations. The abrogation of the NEP decree was therefore a step in the right direction.

Furthermore, another reason for the low level of foreign investment in Nigeria is political instability. The various coups and counter coups since 1966, the discontentment and politically motivated riots following the long-drawn and inconclusive political engineering of the Babaginda Military Administration, all combined to create an environment not conducive to foreign investment.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is arguably an important source of employment opportunities for developing countries like Nigeria. As a consequence, it is imperative that the federal government promotes a healthy private sector that can earn a reasonable rate of return.

Developing countries that wish to attract FDI flows should consider measures such as establishing a transparent legal framework that does not discriminate between local and foreign investors; adopting liberal foreign exchange regime (e.g., a regime without large gaps between official and market rates); creating simple,investor-friendly regulations and institutions and effectively administering them.

Therefore, the convertibility of naira, the relaxation of the control on remittance of profits and technical fees and the abrogation of the Exchange Control Act of 1962 and the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree of 1989 as spelt out in 1995 Budget are the kind of reforms that can promote the inflow of foreign direct investment a politically stable environment is also of immense importance.

Although Nigeria must grapple with its decaying infrastructure and a poor regulatory environment, the country possesses many positive attributes for carefully targeted investment and will expand as both a regional and international market player. Profitable niche markets outside the energy sector, like specialized telecommunication providers, have developed under the government's reform program. There is a growing Nigerian consensus that foreign investment is essential to realizing Nigeria's vast but squandered potential. European investments are increasing, especially since Belgian consultancy companies such as [[Genco]] are exploring the Nigerian market.

Companies interested in long-term investment and joint ventures, especially those that use locally available raw materials, will find opportunities in the large national market. However, to improve prospects for success, potential investors must educate themselves extensively on local conditions and business practices, establish a local presence, and choose their partners carefully. The Nigerian Government is keenly aware that sustaining democratic principles, enhancing security for life and property, and rebuilding and maintaining infrastructure are necessary for the country to attract foreign investment.

The stock [[market capitalisation]] of listed companies in Nigeria was valued at $97.75 billion on 15 February 2008 by the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]].

===Swiss Banks to return Abacha Funds===
The Swiss foreign ministry says it has done all it can to ensure that funds stolen by the late Nigerian dictator [[Sani Abacha]] were used properly in his homeland. The authorities were responding to allegations that $200 million (SFr240 million) of $700 million handed back by the [[Swiss Banks]] to Nigeria had been misappropriated.

An '''electoral college''' is a set of [[Voting|elector]]s who are selected to elect a [[candidate]] to a particular office. Often these represent different organizations, political parties, or [[entity|entities]], with each organization, political party or entity represented by a particular number of electors or with [[vote]]s weighted in a particular way. The system can ignore the wishes of a general membership.

==Origins of electoral colleges==

{{see |elective monarchy |Prince-elector}}
[[Ancient Germanic law|Early Germanic law]] stated that the German king led only with the support of his nobles.  Thus, [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] needed to be elected by his [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] nobles before becoming king of [[Asturias]], and so did [[Pepin the Short]] by Frankish nobles in order to become the first Carolingian king.  While most other Germanic nations had developed a strictly hereditary system by the end of the first millennium, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] did not, and the King of the Romans, who would become, by papal coronation, Holy Roman Emperor or at least Emperor-elect, was elected by the college of [[prince-elector]]s from the [[late Middle Ages]] until 1806 (the last [[Imperial election|election]] took place in 1792).

In the [[Christian Church|Church]], both the clergy and [[laity]] elected the bishop or presiding [[presbyter]]. However, for various reasons, such as a desire to reduce the influence of the state or the laity in ecclesiastical matters, electoral power became restricted to the clergy and, in the case of the [[Western Church|Church in the West]], exclusively to a college of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the cathedral church. In the [[Pope]]'s case, the system of people and clergy was eventually replaced by a college of the important clergy of Rome, which eventually became known as the [[College of Cardinals]]. Since 1059, it has had exclusive authority over [[Papal conclave|papal selection]].

In the 19th century and beyond, it was usual in many countries that voters did not directly vote the members of parliament. In [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] for example, in 1849–1918 the voters were ''Urwähler'' (original voters), appointing with their vote a ''Wahlmann'' (elector). The group of electors in a district elected the deputy for the Prussian [[Prussian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Such [[indirect election|indirect suffrage]] was a means to steer the voting, to make sure that the electors were "able" persons. For electors, the requirements were usually higher than for the original voters. The left wing opposition was very much opposed to indirect suffrage. {{citation needed|reason=this whole paragraph needs to be cited|date=November 2016}}

Even today in the Netherlands, the deputies of the First Chamber are elected by the provincial parliaments. Those provincial parliaments form the electoral colleges for the First Chamber elections; the lists of candidates are national.

==Modern electoral colleges==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015|talk=Anchor}}
Countries with complex regional electorates may elect a [[head of state]] by means of an electoral college rather than a [[direct election|direct popular election]]. 

=== Holy See ===
{{main|Holy See}}
In the sovereign [[Holy See]], with the [[Vatican City]] as sovereign territory, the [[College of Cardinals]] elects the [[pope]] in a [[papal conclave]].

{{main|United States Electoral College}}
The United States Electoral College is an example of a system in which an [[executive president]] is [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vSlx-_Z408C&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to World Politics: Conflict and Consensus on a Small Planet|last=Collin|first=Richard Oliver|last2=Martin|first2=Pamela L.|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442218031|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with electors representing the [[U.S. state|50 states]] and the [[federal district]]. Each state has a number of electors equal to its Congressional representation (in both houses), with the non-state [[District of Columbia]] receiving the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/provisions.html|title=Presidential Election Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electors generally cast their votes for the winner of the popular vote in their respective states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html|title=Who are the Electors?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several states where this is not required by law. In the United States, 270 electoral votes are currently required to win the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html#no270|title=What happens if no presidential candidate gets 270 Electoral votes?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worldwide ===
"Colleges" of electors play a role in elections in other countries, albeit with electors allocated in ways differing from the United States. In Germany, the members of the federal parliament together with an equal number of people elected from the state parliaments constitute the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]], that exists for the only purpose of electing the (non-executive) head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/elections/federal_convention/ The Federal President and the Federal Convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104065515/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/elections/federal_convention |date=4 January 2015 }} – retrieved on 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in India the members of the both houses of parliament together with weighted votes from the members of the state legislative assemblies constitute an [[Electoral College (India)|electoral college]] that elects the head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend84.htm Constitution of India 84th Amendment] – retrieved on 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the (non-executive) [[President of Italy|head of state]] is elected by the members of both houses of [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] in joint session, together with delegates elected by the [[Regions of Italy|Regional Councils]] to ensure the representation of minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries with electoral college systems include [[Elections_in_Burundi|Burundi]], [[Elections_in_Estonia|Estonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/constitution.php?gid=81910 Constitution of Estonia, section 79] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302162354/http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/constitution.php?gid=81910 |date=2 March 2008 }} – retrieved on 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kazakhstan]], [[Madagascar]], [[Presidential Electoral College|Myanmar]], [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Elections_in_Trinidad_and_Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttparliament.org/Docs/constitution/ttconst.pdf Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago, section 28] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408204828/http://www.ttparliament.org/Docs/constitution/ttconst.pdf |date=8 April 2008 }} – retrieved on 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elections_in_Vanuatu|Vanuatu]]. Both the [[French Senate]] and the [[Seanad Éireann]] (Senate) in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are chosen by electoral colleges.

[[Ecclesiastic]]al electoral colleges abound in modern times, especially among Protestant and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches]]. In the Eastern rite churches, all the bishops of an [[autocephalous]] church elect successor bishops, thus serving as an electoral college for all the [[episcopal see]]s.{{citation needed|date = December 2014}}

==Former electoral colleges==
Historical examples of electoral colleges include [[Finland]]'s, which elected the country's [[President of Finland|president]] between 1919 and [[Finnish presidential election, 1988|1988]]. The electoral college was replaced by direct elections (consisting of [[two-round voting]]) since [[Finnish presidential election, 1994|1994]] and by a simultaneous reduction of presidential power. 

During [[Brazil]]'s military rule period, the president was elected by an electoral college comprising senators, deputies, state deputies, and lawmakers in the cities. The electoral college was replaced with a [[two-round system]] [[direct election]] in [[Brazilian presidential election, 1989|1989]], after the restoration of democracy. 

[[Argentina]] had an electoral college established by its original [[Constitution of Argentina|1853 Constitution]], which was used to elect its president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=7070 The Constitution of Argentina of 1853, 32nd to 63rd Articles] – retrieved on 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was [[Argentine Constitution of 1949|amended in 1949]] and the electoral college was replaced with direct elections by popular vote used in the elections of [[Argentine general election, 1951|1951]]. After the [[Revolución Libertadora]] the 1957 reform repealed the 1949 Constitution and the electoral college was used again in the elections of [[Argentine general election, 1958|1958]] and [[Argentine general election, 1963|1963]].  The elections of [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973]] and [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973]] used direct elections by popular vote and a not used [[two-round system]] according to the ''Temporary Fundamental Statute'' enacted by the [[Argentine Revolution|military junta]] in 1972. The elections of [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983]] and [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989]] used again the electoral college. The constitution was amended in 1994 and the electoral college was replaced with direct elections by popular vote, using a two-round system since [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995]]. 

[[Paraguay]] had an electoral college established by the [[Constitution of Paraguay|1870 Constitution]], which was used to elect its president. The constitution was amended in 1940 and the electoral college was replaced with direct elections by popular vote since [[Paraguayan general election, 1943|1943]].

[[Chile]] had an electoral college established by the [[Constitution of Chile|1828 Constitution]], which was used to elect its president in the elections from [[Chilean presidential election, 1829|1829]] to [[Chilean presidential election, 1920|1920]]. The constitution was [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|amended in 1925]] and the electoral college was replaced with direct elections by popular vote since [[Chilean presidential election, 1925|1925]].

In [[France]], the president was elected by the legislature from 1875 to 1954. The [[French presidential election, 1958|first presidential election]] of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] which elected [[Charles de Gaulle]] was the only presidential election where the winner was determined via an electoral college. The electoral college was replaced after the [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|1962 referendum]], with direct elections by popular vote, using a Two-round system since [[French presidential election, 1965|1965]]. 

In [[Spain]], during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] period (1931-1936/39) the President was elected by an electoral college comprising the Parliament members and an equal number of democratically elected members ("compromisarios"). 

Another type of Electoral College was used by the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] to choose its leader between 1983 and 2010. The college consisted of three sections: the votes of Labour [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s; the votes of [[affiliated trade union]]s and [[socialist societies]]; and the votes of individual members of [[Constituency Labour Parties]].&lt;ref&gt;Labour Party Rule Book rule 4B.2c – quoted in [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03938.pdf House of Commons Research Note SN/PC/3938: Labour Party Leadership Elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227050518/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03938.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }} retrieved 6 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in United States history, state legislatures were essentially electoral colleges for both the U.S. Senate and even the federal Electoral College itself. Prior to [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1913]], U.S. state legislatures appointed U.S. senators from their respective states, and prior to 1872, U.S. presidential electors were in many cases chosen by state legislatures (though most states had switched to popular elections for electors by 1824). Because state legislatures had so much influence over federal elections, state legislative elections were frequently proxy votes for either the Senate or the presidency. The famed 1858 [[Lincoln–Douglas debates]], reputedly held during a U.S. Senate campaign in Illinois, actually occurred during an election for the Illinois state legislature; neither Lincoln's nor Douglas' names appeared on any ballot. During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] used an [[Electoral College (Confederate States)|Electoral College]] that was functionally identical to that of the United States; it convened just once, in 1861, to elect [[Jefferson Davis]] as president.

{{Elections}}

'''Electoral geography''' is the analysis of the methods, the behavior, and the results of elections in the context of [[geography|geographic]] space and using geographical techniques. Specifically, it is an examination of the dual interaction in which geographical traits of a territory affect the political decisions, and the geographical structure of the election system affects electoral results. The purpose of the analysis is to identify and understand driving factors and the electoral characteristics of territories in a broad and integrative manner.&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;[[John A. Agnew|Agnew, John]]. 1996. “Mapping politics: how context counts in electoral geography”. In Political Geography, Volume 15, Issue 2, pp. 129-146. Elsevier: London, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
{{main|Elections}}
Elections serve as the central political expression and exercise of power within democratic states,&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, Martin, Jones, Rhys, and Woods, Michael. 2006.  “Democracy, participation and citizenship”. In An Introduction to Political Geography: Space, Place and Politics, Second Edition, pp. 137-157. Routledge: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and conducting elections in democracies requires the translation of the political decisions of the distributed voting public into resulting “seat” representation of the various constituencies, except in the cases of [[Knesset|Israel]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] which each have only a single constituency.&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Johnston02"&gt;[[Ron Johnston (geographer)|Johnston, Ron]]. 2002. “Manipulating maps and winning elections: measuring the impact of malapportionment and gerrymandering”. In Political Geography, Volume 21, pp. 1-31. Elsevier: Atlanta.&lt;/ref&gt; It is philosophically accepted that in a democracy, each vote is equally valid amongst all other votes and thus each eligible voter casts only one equally valued vote.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; However, disproportionality and bias towards specific voting groups arise in the construction of artificial constituency boundaries in that political parties and policies are unevenly and inaccurately represented in the aggregate results amongst the electoral regions when compared to the popular vote.&lt;ref name="Johnston02" /&gt;

===Electoral constituencies===
{{main|Electoral district}}
The territorial unit with boundary distinctions in representative elections is commonly termed the constituency, district, or precinct, and serves as both a region for the tabulation and study of the electoral result.  These boundaries are defined in various methods, which are unique to each state, and can cause alterations or skewing of aggregate vote results and by extension the true decision of the electorate.

===Election mechanics===
Electoral geographers require the knowledge of the local and statewide laws and procedures for conducting elections, though it has been claimed that it is not within their purview to attempt to correct any observed flaws.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;Prescott, J.R.V. 1959. “The Function and Methods of Electoral Geography”. In Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Volume 49, Issue 3, pp. 296 – 304. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.: Hoboken.&lt;/ref&gt; The details of voting or the parameters of the election in various states or in constituencies within the state are critical factors, which affect the levels of participation and can characterize the outcome.  The mechanics of an election are fully described through identifying the pattern of constituencies, franchise qualifications and changes, and the method of the election.  The patterning of constituencies is related to the spatial orientation and drawing of boundaries as detailed previously.  The franchise qualifications define the eligible voter bloc, the electorate, and thus determine the range of relevant, critical issues, which apply to those who vote in an election, and alterations in enfranchisement can greatly alter the nature of the electorate and the outcome of the election.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; The methods of election are critical to analyzing the results, as it is impossible to adequately assess the proportionality of representation or validity of an electoral outcome without understanding how votes are cast and counted.  For example, single-vote, winner take all systems can greatly disenfranchise minority voters as their selection is ultimately irrelevant in a two-party dominant system.&lt;ref name="Johnston02" /&gt; However, in systems which employ proportional voting or ranked voting techniques, the extreme minorities receive greater opportunity for representation.

==Electoral distortion and bias==
Regardless of the means by which boundaries are drawn, including by non-partisan or independent governmental associations, bias in electoral regions can always be observed.  The United Kingdom serves as an example as the constituencies are established by a non-partisan commission and yet bias toward Labour has been observed in general elections since 1979.&lt;ref name="Johnston02" /&gt;

===Gerrymandering===
{{main|Gerrymandering}}
Gerrymandering is a selective drawing of constituency boundaries in order to alter the results of an election.&lt;ref name="Johnston02" /&gt; The popular or numerical election results within a [[constituency]], [[precinct]], or [[electoral district]] can be distorted by the act of gerrymandering. Common alterations to election results caused by gerrymandering are:
* Splitting or dilution of the concentrations of votes for one party so as to make that party the minority in a large portion of the constituencies in conjunction
*Concentrating the votes of one party into a selected few constituencies such that many of their votes are ‘[[wasted vote|wasted]]’, while creating many constituencies with only slight majorities in favor of the other party
* Placing two or more [[incumbent]]s of one party within a single revised constituency, thus removing control of seats for that party
* Creating "winner takes all" [[multi-member district]]s with one party in the majority

===Malapportionment===
{{main|Malapportionment}}
Malapportionment is unequal and disproportionate representation electoral systems with multiple constituencies.  It is a violation of the democratic principle of “one person, one vote” in that constituency boundaries enclose populations of various size, which means that the votes of people in regions of lower population have greater representation per vote than those in regions with a higher population.&lt;ref name="Johnston02" /&gt; The effect of malapportionment is observed when equivalent percentages of the total vote results in different numbers of seats for each party due to one party having greater control in smaller constituencies and another in larger constituencies.&lt;ref name="Johnston02" /&gt;

==Geographic context==
The spatial distribution and variation of the voting populace in conjunction with the demographic characteristics and delineation of voting regions provide a geographic context for the analysis of elections.  Along with purely physical characteristics, distribution of economic resources, lines of communication, governmental and party platforms, and gender, ethnic, or class groups creates an interwoven fabric of people and opinion, which is accounted for in electoral analysis.&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt; A population settles for various social, economic, and cultural reasons which create a defined contour of both population density and related political opinion.&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt; However, this contour is not a static condition and changes in electoral results must be considered with respect to the change in the type of people and not just the change in their chosen politics.  The distribution of politics has been attributed to various factors, one of which is described as a convergence of external stimuli.&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt; These stimuli can come in the form of state-supplied information, local cultural norms, religious affiliations, economic opportunity, and media presentation of issues.  The degree of effect for each particular stimulus is then a result of the susceptibility of a particular geography.  For example, policy dealing with the governmental treatment of an urban population would have greater importance to those in a territory with an urban densities and a far smaller importance in a sparser region.&lt;ref name="Morrill"&gt;Morrill, Richard, Knopp, Larry and Brown, Michael. 2007. “Anomalies in red and blue: Exceptionalism in American electoral geography”. In Political Geography, Volume 26, pp. 525-553. Elsevier: Atlanta.&lt;/ref&gt; A state or its political organizations has some power to affect these stimuli and are therefore considered as a contributing factor in the changes of election outcomes.

===Physical contour===
Electoral geography considers the way in which the [[Physical geography|physical]] characteristics of a territory directly affect the population and thus the election decision of these people.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; The geographic location and associated natural factors are directly related to the potential in a specific region for political development&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; and have an additional relationship with the electoral processes and policy decisions of the region.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; The study of electoral results has been shown to identify the regions of specific politics and the relative cohesion amongst these similar regions.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; Regions which share large numbers of physical or demographic characteristics, or both as these two factors are related,&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt; will demonstrate significant similarities in voting participation and patterns of outcome.

===Economics, communications, and infrastructure===

The economic development within a given region is also related to the development of its politics and the issues which are important to the electorate.  A state with disproportionate economic development will necessarily come under pressure from the poorer constituencies to take action to redistribute wealth and level the economic prosperity, which will be observable in the electoral results.&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt; The range and availability of communication and issue awareness can affect perception of issues and skew rational decision making.  If a populace is generally unaware of the implications of policy decisions they are less able to make informed decisions and are more readily manipulated by candidate or party claims and marketing techniques, which can make analysis difficult as no predictable rationale may exist for voting outcomes.

===Culture, demographics, and political parties===
Background information detailing the established political parties, issues being contested in an election, and the mechanics of the election process also help to contextualize and understanding contributing factors in each individual election.  Over time these factors may be changed as parties are formed or disbanded and policy issues are brought to vote or become obsolete, which can explain the shifting appearance of the electoral result over a period of time.  The governmental and party platforms serve as categories into which voters are forced to classify themselves&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; even though it is likely that no one party platform accurately captures the entirety of the opinions held by a voter.&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt; This makes consideration of the party platform or recent party activities critical in understanding the changes or stability of electoral results over space and time.  Gender, ethnic, and class disparity can cause voting that is related to shared background qualities and experience as opposed to political opinions.&lt;ref name="Morrill" /&gt; This means that candidates from a particular area or common ethnicity can receive votes from the citizens of that area irrespective of their party affiliations or national because of their shared experience and mutual acquaintance.  This has been referred to as the “friends and neighbors effect”.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

===Determinism===
{{main|Geographic determinism}}
There is a distinction amongst geographers between considering the effect of geography to be fully deterministic and merely having only a partial effect amongst other effects.  Deterministic electoral geography would result in predictable results regardless of candidate or proposed policy as the sum of physical geographic traits would entirely control voting decisions.  This interpretation has been widely rejected by geographers.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; Instead, it is more fully accepted that geography plays some role in conjunction with other cultural and interpersonal effects.  The “neighborhood effect” is an observed altering of electoral results due to the tendency of people who are spatially close to vote similarly because of daily interactions.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Arguments against determinism also rely on observed anomalies in voting results.  An example arises in comparing results of presidential elections in the United States to the expectation of favoring Democratic or Republican candidates in urban or rural locations respectively or the expectations for preference on the county scale based on racial composition with minority groups favoring the Democratic party.&lt;ref name="Morrill" /&gt; The results indicate that anomalies occur in distinct voting areas where the Republican or Democratic candidate won counties that had opposite characteristics of their traditionally carried counties. These anomalies are attributed to the historical, economic, and cultural geographies which serve to override the territory traits that were used to predict the electoral results.&lt;ref name="Morrill" /&gt; In this way voters are motivated by factors outside their geography to vote in a way that is unexpected and often even contrary to their individual interests.

===Electoral mapping===
The spatial variations of support for particular policies are routinely mapped in order to pictorially represent the electoral geography of a territory, which can allow for the recognition of patterns of location.&lt;ref name="Agnew" /&gt; Ron Johnston&lt;ref name="Johnston02" /&gt; considers the entire process and outcome of the election through the examining lens of territory maps.  He claims that electoral results are the outcome of superimposing the map of cultural, economic, religious, and demographic characteristics with the determined map of electoral districts and applying the issues on the ballot.  The selection of mapping paradigms using color, patterning, brightness or darkness effects is employed in order to visually detail aspects and characteristics of interest in elections, such as voter participation, intensity of support, population density, and constituency boundaries which may not easily be noticed by considering words and numbers.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; An example of a mapping paradigm is observed in United States elections in recent history, wherein results in favor of Democratic candidates are marked by coloring the constituency blue and using red for results in favor of Republican candidates.&lt;ref name="Morrill" /&gt; This has been used to a wide degree and is thus readily acknowledged by United States citizens in the media and academic display of election results. However, the variations in electoral results over a territory or place cannot be directly equated to the land areas represented by mapping as the voting populace is the subject of interest and study in electoral geography and not the particular territory they live on during a given election.  Human movement is an ongoing progress, which consistently redefines the distributions of policy preference and thus the associated election decisions.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; Thus the passage of time must be incorporated in electoral analysis through the duality of Electoral geography also deals with the alterations of election results in a given place over an extended time interval encompassing many elections. This effect can be mapped using various techniques which help to show changing opinions and changing populations in the constituencies of the state over a time interval.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; Electoral geography relies upon detailed and accurate mapping techniques with appropriate contextualization and background knowledge in order to successfully visualize and analyze the results of an election.

==World electoral geographies==

===Canada===
{{main|Canadian political culture}}
{{see also|regions of Canada}}
Canadian electoral geography is typified by a high degree of [[political regionalism]], with most disputes interpreted as conflicts between provinces or regions.  Notably, [[class consciousness]] is quite low in Canada as compared to the former mother country, Britain.

Because of the disparity in the population size of the various provinces, their importance in electoral geography varies substantially.  As well some provinces are small enough and similar enough to their neighbours that they vote similarly, while others are large enough to have considerable internal divisions.  The smaller [[Atlantic Provinces]] might be considered as unit, but Ontario might be subdivided between the urban, suburban, rural, and remote regions, or between [[Northern Ontario|north]], [[Southern Ontario|south]], [[Eastern Ontario|east]], and [[Western Ontario|west]], or into more specific regions like the [[Golden Horseshoe]] or the [[Greater Toronto Area]].

In federal politics, a winning coalition must be composed of various sub-regions, identified not only by place but by ideology.  A winning coalition might include Western social conservatives, suburban Ontario moderates, and Quebec soft nationalists (Brian Mulroney, [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984]], [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988]]), or Ontario moderates, Quebec federalists, and most of Atlantic Canada (Jean Chretien, [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993]], [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997]], [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000]]), or most of the West and Atlantic Canada, plus rural and suburban Ontario (Stephen Harper, [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011]]).

When the main parties are not seen to serve the interest of a particular region, protest parties or movements often emerge.  This has included several [[Quebec nationalist]] parties, parties arising from the phenomenon called [[Western alienation]], and the [[Maritime Rights Movement]]. Partly for this reason, Canada has typically had a [[multi-party system]] for much of its history rather than the [[two-party system]] that is typical of [[first past the post]] elections.  This has in turn led to several [[minority governments in Canada]].

Regionalism in Canada is such that is also notable ''within'' provinces on the stage of provincial elections.  There is considerable distinction between the [[politics of Montreal]] and those of [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean|the Saguenay]] or [[Gaspé Peninsula|the Gaspe]], and likewise between the [[Lower Mainland]] and the [[BC Interior]].

===United Kingdom===
In the present [[United Kingdom]], electoral geography is studied extensively and has been compared to the method in the United States of elections and regionalization, by employing UK methods of [[Cleavage (politics)|class cleavage]], where the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] tends to be favoured by the white-collar class and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] by the UK’s working class.&lt;ref name="Johnston05"&gt;Johnston, Ron. 2005. “Anglo-American Electoral Geography: Same Roots and Same Goals, but Different Means to Ends?”. In Professional Geographer, pp.&amp;nbsp;580–587. Blackwell Publishing: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the methods of sectionalism in the UK and the US places emphasis on location; instead of basing support for a party by class, the US does so by location. In the UK, some areas are more heavily populated than others, giving differences in population relating to the geography of each individual voting district.

In the UK, to extinguish regional identity, [[England]] was divided into nine regions.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, David. Elections and Voters in Britain. Palgrave Macmillan: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought&lt;ref name="Johnston05" /&gt; that people who congregate seem to vote alike, rather than voting on one’s own opinions. This is what is known as the "neighborhood effect".&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Even with nine distinct regions, the voting patterns are seemingly disproportionally divided between the two dominant parties. This forces researchers to question what causes regional differences in voting outcomes.

The voting method in the UK differs from that of the United States. To produce an outcome, "all voting takes place in the context of a particular electoral system. There has to be some agreed way of aggregating votes to produce a result. Votes indicate individuals’ preferences and in the public elections these have to be translated into seats by some formula".&lt;ref name="Johnston05" /&gt; This formulaic approach ends in an outcome giving a translated number of seats for each party in Parliament.

England is not alone in selecting its electoral system. “… A cross-national study found seventy different systems in twenty-seven democracies.”&lt;ref&gt;Demko, George, K. and Wood, William, B. Reordering the World. 1994. Westview Press: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing which system a government will use, great consideration has to be made. A serious question arises during this process; What should this election be designed to achieve?  General answers have been:
* To enable the representation of voters’ opinion in rough proportion to their strength in the electorate
* To allow for the representation of geographically defined areas
* To decisively confer power on a team of leaders or a party.”
Voter awareness in terms of the reasoning, motivation, and methods of an election are critical for shoring up public support for the legitimacy of elections and elected officials.

===Russia===
{{main|Electoral geography of Russia}}
The electoral geography of Russia is marked by the obvious territorial cleavages between North and South, urban and rural territories, etc. One phenomenon of territorial cleavages in electoral preferences in Russia is known as the "red belt" (compact located regions with high support for the Communist Party).

In the first democratic elections in the history of contemporary Russia it was noticed that liberal and democratic politicians had much higher support in the northern regions, whereas the south of Russia appeared more conservative.

Both capitals in Russia - Moscow and the "northern capital" Saint Petersburg - significantly differ in electoral results from the rest of the country. Only in these cities is there strong electoral support of liberal and democratic politicians. Support for United Russia is less than in other regions.

===United States===
{{main|Red states and blue states}}

The electoral geography of the United States is a description of regional political differences, which in recent years has been popularized by the red and blue paradigm to pictorially represent Republican and Democratic Election results.  The presence of a two-dominant party system creates a great potential for disenfranchisement of minority voters and their opinions.  Qualities of “northeasterliness”, “westerliness”, and “southerliness”, which constitute the expectations for Democratic, Republican, and volatile Republican voting results, have been used in order to understand and define the political landscape.&lt;ref name="Morrill" /&gt; However, culturally driven anomalies in this general expectation have been observed.

Debate has been common in recent elections in regards to the election of the President of the United States via the electoral college.  The debate stems from the fact that the electoral college is a malapportioned body.,&lt;ref&gt;Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"2006 Census estimates".

During the history of '''Canadian''' politics, eleven '''minority governments''' have been elected at the federal level. There have also been two minority governments resulting from governments being replaced between elections, for a total of thirteen federal minority governments in twelve separate minority parliaments. There have been historical cases where the governing party had fewer than half of the seats but had the support of independents who called themselves members of the party; these cases are not included, as there was never any serious chance of the government falling.

In a minority situation, governments must rely on the support of other parties to stay in power, providing less stability than a [[majority government]]. At the federal level no minority government (excepting the odd case of the 14th) has lasted a standard four-year term. Most minority governments have lasted less than two years. The average duration of completed minorities in Canada is 479 days or approximately 1 year, 140 days counting only that part of the 14th Parliament that was a minority, or 1 year, 207 days counting the entire duration of it.

In addition to the minorities below, the [[2nd Canadian Parliament]] was a minority for 56 days under prime minister [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] after he took power from Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] following the [[Pacific Scandal]]. However, this event is generally not noted because Parliament was never in [[parliamentary session|session]] while Mackenzie was in power. The eleventh federal [[minority parliament]] was elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]].

In the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world, minority governments are referred to as [[hung parliament]]s.

==Alexander Mackenzie==
[[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] replaced [[Sir John A. Macdonald]] in 1873 after the latter was involved in the [[Pacific Scandal]]. Mackenzie became the prime minister of a minority government, but he immediately called an election in which he then won a majority.

==William Lyon Mackenzie King==

[[File:Chambre des Communes 1925.png|thumb|Liberal minority after the 1925 election]]

*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921]]: 0. Term of office 1,339 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/compilations/parliament/DurationMinorityGovernment.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; (Due to seat fluctuations, the government was not in a minority for the entire duration of the parliament.)
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925]]: 23. Term of office 204 days.

Liberal minority after the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 election]]. Initially the Liberal Party had the exact number of seats required for a majority. It maintained that majority until December 1923 when it lost two seats in by-elections returning it to a minority. It continued as a minority until November 1924 when the Liberals gained a seat in a by-election and became a majority again. Therefore, although this particular Parliament lasted for 3 years and 7 months, for only about half of that time (one year and ten months) was it an actual minority Parliament.

Liberal minority after the [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925 election]]- This was a truly minority Parliament throughout its life. The election resulted in the incumbent Liberal government of Mackenzie King being reduced to 101 seats in the House of Commons, while the opposition Conservatives actually took the most seats (116). All others won 26 seats, 24 of them won by the Progressives. King chose to carry on in government and face the new Parliament seeking its confidence. From January to July 1926, King’s government sustained such confidence with the support of most of the Progressives (although in many cases only by one or two votes). On June 26, after virtually losing control of the House and sustaining a loss on a sub-amendment to a censure motion and facing a final vote on the main censure motion, King asked the Governor-General for a dissolution and was refused. King therefore immediately resigned and the Conservative leader Arthur Meighen agreed to form a government which itself, although larger, was also a minority one. However, a few days later on July 1, 1926, the new Meighen minority government was defeated on a matter of confidence (by one vote). Meighen then requested and obtained a dissolution from the Governor-General. Therefore, the Parliament arising from this election was throughout a minority one.

===Quasi-minorities===
After the [[Canadian federal election, 1926|1926 election]], the Liberal party proper was seven seats short of a majority. However eight MPs were elected as [[Liberal-Progressive]] members and usually voted with the Liberals giving the government a working majority.

As well, following the [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945 election]] the official Liberal candidates did not win a majority of seats leaving the King government five seats short of a majority. However, the election of eight "Independent Liberal" MPs, most of whom did not run as official Liberals because of their opposition to [[conscription]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]), as well as one Liberal-Progressive, gave the King government an effective working majority in parliament. Most of the Independent Liberal MPs joined (or re-joined) the Liberal caucus following [[World War II]] when the conscription issue became moot.

==Arthur Meighen==

*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1926]]: 8. Term of office 88 days.
[[Arthur Meighen]] led two short lived [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] governments. The first was a majority at the end of 13th parliament, [[Canadian federal election, 1917|elected in 1917]] under the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] ticket. The second government was a minority in 1926. Meighen's conservatives won a plurality of the seats in the previous [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925 election]], however a government was instead formed via an agreement between the Liberals and Progressives. After King's Liberals had lost the progressives' support he requested parliament to be dissolved by then governor general, [[Julian H.G. Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Lord Byng]], resulting in the [[King-Byng Affair]]. The resulting conflict caused King to shortly resign as prime minister, and Byng subsequently appointed Meighen as prime minister. On July 1, 1926, a week after Byng appointed him prime minister, Meighen lost a [[motion of no confidence|confidence vote]] in the House of Commons resulting in the [[Canadian federal election, 1926|1926 election]].

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Not elected as such

==John Diefenbaker==
[[File:Chambre des Communes 1957.png|thumb|Tory minority after the 1957 election]]
[[File:Chambre des Communes 1962.png|thumb|Tory minority after the 1962 election]]
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1957|1957]]: 22. Term of office 294 days.
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1962|1962]]: 17. Term of office 304 days.
After many decades of Liberal rule, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], led by [[John Diefenbaker]], unexpectedly won a minority government in the [[Canadian federal election, 1957|1957 election]]. Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]], sensing the mood of the nation, stepped aside and let Diefenbaker govern. Diefenbaker needed the support of the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] and three independents to get any legislation passed. This minority lasted only a few months. The seminal moment was [[Lester Pearson]] announcing to Diefenbaker that because of the slight decline in economic performance, and the fact that the Liberals had won the popular vote, he should hand power back to the Liberals. Diefenbaker, in a rage, launched a two-hour speech condemning the Liberals, and revealing a document from the previous government predicting the economic decline. Diefenbaker would soon call an [[Canadian federal election, 1958|election]], and win the largest majority government in Canadian history.

The Diefenbaker government ended badly with party infighting, a poor economy and controversies over relations with the United States during the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]. In the [[Canadian federal election, 1962|1962 election]], the Tories won only a minority. This time, the momentum was with the Liberals and the imploding Tories were all but incapable of governing due largely to a split in Diefenbaker's [[Canadian Cabinet|Cabinet]] over the deployment of [[Bomarc Missile Crisis|Bomarc missiles]] in Canada. The government was defeated in the House on a confidence issue on February 5, 1963, forcing the [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963 federal election]] which the Tories lost.

==Lester B. Pearson==
[[File:Chambre des Communes 1963.png|thumb|Liberal minority after the 1963 election]]
[[File:Chambre des Communes 1965.png|thumb|Liberal minority after the 1965 election]]
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963]]: 5. Term of office 1 year, 182 days/548 days.
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965]]: 2. Term of office 2 years, 230 days/960 days.
In the [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963 election]], the Liberals, led by [[Lester B. Pearson]], were also unable to win a majority. The next 548 days were productive ones, however, as a close working relationship between the Liberals and the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) resulted in the introduction of [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada's health care system]], the [[Canadian flag]], and the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. In 1965, Pearson asked [[Georges Vanier|the Governor General]] to dissolve Parliament in an attempt to win a majority, but the make up of parliament after the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 election]] remained almost exactly the same, leading to almost three more years of a productive alliance between the Liberals and NDP.

Canada's constitutional convention dealing with minority governments was altered in 1968 when Pearson's government was unexpectedly defeated on a [[Matter of Confidence|matter of confidence]]. While this should have led to an immediate [[dissolution of parliament]], none of the parties were ready, and Pearson was in the process of being replaced as leader of the Liberals. By mutual agreement among the party leaders, a new motion was passed that retroactively declared that the budgetary matter on which the government was defeated was not a matter of confidence, setting a new precedent.

==Pierre E. Trudeau==
[[File:Chambre des Communes 1972.png|thumb|Liberal minority after the 1972 election]]
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972]]: 23&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Term of office 1 year, 221 days/586 days.
In the [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 election]], the Liberals under [[Pierre Trudeau]] won only two seats more than the Tories. It was the second election for Trudeau as party leader. However, even though the Liberals entered the election strong in the polls, the [[Trudeaumania]] buzz had all but ended, and the party was further damaged by a weak economy. With few issues to campaign on, and one of the weakest campaigns in Canadian history, they were again forced to rely on the NDP to remain in power. In this instance, the NDP demanded the creation of [[Petro-Canada]] among other things to support the Liberals. The government fell on May 8, 1974, on a sub-amendment to the budget (thus a question of confidence). The Trudeau Liberals won a large [[majority government]] in the resulting [[Canadian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]].

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Speaker was elected as independent

==Joe Clark==
[[File:Chambre des Communes 1979.png|thumb|Tory minority after the 1979 election]]
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 1979|1979]]: 6. Term of office 273 days.
To improve his situation slightly, Clark supported the selection of Liberal member James Jerome, House Speaker in the 30th Parliament, to serve as speaker once again, and this was seconded by Opposition Leader Pierre Trudeau. (Starting in 1986, the speaker was elected in a secret ballot vote by the members of the house.)

While the Liberals had had first the Progressives and later the NDP to support them in minority situations, the Progressive Conservatives had little experience attracting support as a minority government. Seven months after the [[Canadian federal election, 1979|1979 election]] which ended 11 years of Trudeau Liberal government, the Tory government of Joe Clark was defeated in motion of no confidence in the government and its [[budget]] moved by [[Bob Rae]] of the NDP and supported by the Liberals.

Clark might have prevented this defeat had his government agreed to support the [[Quebec]] based [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit Party]] in its bid to maintain official party status—the party's seat total had fallen to six seats as a result of the 1979 election. However, Clark had hoped to follow the precedent set by Diefenbaker and pledged to "govern as if" he had a majority and then advance to a majority government through a new election without having to make deals with smaller parties. He also wished to win seats in Quebec in his own right and saw the conservative, populist Social Credit Party as an obstacle rather than a potential partner. As a result of Clark's refusal to extend recognition to Social Credit its MPs abstained in the [[Motion of No Confidence|Non-Confidence vote]] that brought down the Clark government on December 13, 1979, a defeat caused by the Social Credit abstention and the absence of a handful of Tory MPs due to illness or travel. The dissolution was portrayed as a blunder and the budget Clark fought [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 election]] on was unpopular with voters. On February 18, 1980, the PCs were defeated by the Trudeau Liberals who were elected to a [[majority government]].

==Paul Martin==
[[Image:Elec2004.PNG|thumb|Liberal minority after the 2004 election]]
*Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004]]: 20. Term of office 1 year, 125 days/490 days.
Although the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] was initially expected to be easy for Martin to win a fourth consecutive Liberal majority government, during the campaign many began instead to predict a far closer result. Mostly due to the [[Liberal Party of Canada sponsorship scandal|sponsorship scandal]], polls started to indicate the possibility of a minority government for the Liberals, or even a minority Conservative government, which in turn created speculation of coalitions with the other parties. Towards the end of the campaign, the Liberals were running attack ads against the Conservatives. In the end, the Liberals fared better than the final opinion polls had led them to fear, but not well enough to win a majority.

On May 10, 2005, a motion was passed by the [[Parliamentary opposition|opposition]] parties in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] to instruct a committee to call for the dissolution of the government. The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and [[Bloc Québécois]] defeated the Liberals and the NDP by 153 votes to 150. Although the motion was technically nothing more than a procedural instruction to a committee, the Conservatives and Bloc demanded the resignation of the government. There is ongoing debate between parties and constitutional experts as to whether or not this was a [[No confidence motion|vote of no confidence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/05/10/confidence-vote050510.html CBC news&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2005, the House voted on two budget bills, deemed unquestionable matters of confidence. With the support of two independents and Conservative MP [[Belinda Stronach]]—who [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to the Liberals and was appointed [[Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development]], becoming a member of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Liberal cabinet]]—the result of the vote was a tie, which was broken in favour of the government by the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House of Commons]], resulting in a vote of 153–152.

On November 24, 2005, the opposition Conservatives introduced a [[motion of no confidence]]. The motion was seconded by the NDP. On November 28, the government was defeated by a margin of 171 to 133, having been defeated by the united opposition forces (Conservatives, NDP, and Bloc Québécois). In the early morning of November 29, 2005, Martin went to [[Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] to ask for the [[dissolution of parliament]] and a [[Canadian federal election, 2006|January 23, 2006, election]].

==Stephen Harper==
[[Image:Canada 2006 Federal Election seats.svg|thumb|Conservative minority after the 2006 election]]
[[Image:Canada 2008 Federal Election seats.svg|thumb|Conservative minority after the 2008 election]]
* Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006]]: 30. Term of office 2 years, 207 days/937 days.
* Seats short of a majority [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008]]: 12. Term of office 2 years, 4 months, 9 days/859 days.

Although several public opinion polls predicted that the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election]] would result in either a strong Conservative minority or a slight majority, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] enjoyed a last-minute surge but were unable to overtake the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]]. However, the surge did result in the smallest minority government in Canadian history, with the smallest percentage of government seats ever and the largest number of seats short of a majority. All parties held the balance of power, the Liberal party with 102 seats, the Bloc Québécois with 51 seats, and the NDP with 29 seats. [[André Arthur]], a popular radio host from [[Quebec City]], was the only [[Independent (politics)|independent]] elected. As Liberal [[Peter Milliken]] was reelected as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]], the Conservatives now effectively held a minority only 29 seats short of a majority as the Speaker traditionally votes only to break a tie and always in favour of the status quo. Thus, the Conservatives held a majority together with any one of the opposition parties, assuming no defections. This status was changed midway through the 39th parliament, when maverick MP [[Garth Turner]] was ousted from the Conservative caucus for allegedly violating "caucus confidentiality".

[[Stephen Harper]] led a minority Conservative government and was sworn in as Prime Minister on February 6. From March 18 to December 2, 2006, [[Bill Graham (Canadian politician)|Bill Graham]] was the interim leader of the Liberal party. Paul Martin resigned as leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] on March 18 in order to quell any rumours that he might run in any future election. [[Stéphane Dion]] won the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|leadership convention]] on December 2, and from then served as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|leader of the opposition]].

Initial results of the 2006 election indicated that the Conservatives would fall 31 seats short of a majority. However, after the election but before the new Parliament took office, Liberal [[David Emerson]] [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to join the Conservatives and Stephen Harper's cabinet amidst some controversy. This increased the size of the Conservative caucus to 125 seats, only 30 seats short of a majority.

Parliament was dissolved on September 7, 2008, ending the longest running minority government between the return of writs and dissolution. On October 14, Harper's Conservative Party was [[Canadian federal election, 2008|re-elected]] with a plurality of seats, though still 12 seats short of a majority. It is the first time since Pearson's 1965 minority that a minority government was re-elected as such.

The 40th Parliament was dissolved following the government's defeat in a motion of no confidence, however the Conservatives were reelected to a majority government on May 2, 2011. Excluding the odd case of the 14th Parliament, Harper led the government through two longest lasting federal minority governments in Canadian history, and was also the first prime minister to win a federal election (by majority or minority) after winning two minority governments (consecutive or not).

'''Machen Florida Opportunity Scholar Program''' is a need-based scholarship at the [[University of Florida]]. The objective of the scholarship is to retain these particular students and have them graduate at rates equal to or greater than the standard undergraduate population on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fos.ufsa.ufl.edu/ About the Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Bernie Machen 2006.jpg|thumb|235px|right|[[Bernie Machen]] the founder of the scholarship at the [[University of Florida]].]]
This program is designed to provide financial support for first-generation, financially disadvantaged students working toward a bachelor's degree. The first need-based scholarship was dispersed in the summer of 2006, and during the 2006-2008 academic years $3.6 million has been given to students at the University of Florida.

In 2008, Coach [[Urban Meyer]] and Coach [[Billy Donovan]] agreed to lead the charge to raise $50 million to help support and fund this scholarship on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uff.ufl.edu/Scholarships/FOS/ Meyer &amp; Donovan to raise funding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401011152/http://www.uff.ufl.edu/Scholarships/FOS/ |date=2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090107/NEWS/901070992/1021/NEWS05?Title=Will_Meyer_donate_big_payday_to_UF_scholarship_fund___ ''Gainesville Sun'' article about the scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objective ===

This scholarship was designed for First-generation students that have unique needs and financial challenges.  The Florida Opportunity Scholars Program was created by President [[Bernie Machen]] to increase the opportunities for academically prepared first-generation students to attend the university with having to struggle with financial burdens. For examples:books and fees, meal and housing, transportation, miscellaneous expenses are all covered by this scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=14646 UF Coaches lead the charge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Franc-Garde''' ({{lang-en|Free Guard}}) was the armed wing of the [[France|French]] [[Milice]] (Militia) and was taken alone or alongside German forces in major battles against the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] from late 1943 to August 1944.

==History==
The creation of the Franc-Garde was announced on 30 January 1943 and it was deployed June 2 of the same year in [[Calabria]] camp near [[Vichy]] with Jean de Vaugelas serving as its commander. This group was successful in its recruitment because the volunteers were promised a salary of 3,600 francs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living with the Enemy|last=Ott|first=Sandra|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781107178205|location=Cambridge|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1944, the auxiliary group swelled to 131 men,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and it was mostly composed of young fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Riviera at War: World War II on the Côte d'Azur|last=Kundahl|first=George|publisher=I.B. Tauris &amp; Co. Ltd|year=2017|isbn=9781784538712|location=London|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once it saw action, the Franc-Garde immediately became the most important connecting link to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Persecution and Rescue: The Politics of the “Final Solution” in France, 1940-1944|last=Seibel|first=Wolfgang|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2016|isbn=9780472118601|location=Ann Arbor|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its members were also documented serving in the [[Battle of Berlin|1945 battle of Berlin]], taking part in the defense of the city's government district.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Milice also used the group as a recruitment ground for volunteers who will serve in the [[Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts|Waffen SS]], particularly those that would be deployed in the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|SS Charlemagne Division]]. This recruitment earned the Milice light arms that were used within France. 

Its field of action, initially confined to the former free zone, was formally extended to the former occupied zone as of January 27, 1944. His role was to support the national revolution undertaken by the Vichy government in predominantly involved in policing, but also assisting, inter alia, the clearing of bombed cities. In the words of Secretary General of the French Militia, Joseph Darnand, in his keynote address January 30, 1943, the Franc-Garde should be "educated and technically prepared to fight to be always ready to maintain the order ". It was his review: The Assault.

The Franc-Garde consisted of two parts: 
#Free-Standing Garde, cantoned and unpaid, and
#the franc-Garde volunteer, whose members, militiamen ordinary screened, could be mobilized through precise and timely action when summoned.

The first two were trained thirty piloted in cities where dissent was the most active: Lyon and Annecy. The names of thirty hundred and should not be misled on the real effective. For example, the trentaine d'Annecy, became hundred, had only 72 men in May 1944. According to the Information Service of the French Committee of National Liberation in February 1944, the Franc-Garde men gathered in 1687, a cohort in Vichy, a hundred in Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse, and thirty in each of forty-five departments of the south. In any case, even with the mobilization of volunteers in the spring and summer 1944, the size of the Franc-Garde never exceeded 4,000 men.

In principle, any intervention by the Free Guard should be preceded by a verbal or written requisition sent by the prefect to the officer commanding the unit required, which was not always the case in practice.

In October - November 1944, facing the advance of allied troops, thousands of militiamen (10 to 15 000 active militants) left the national territory. Among them, about 2,500 franc-gardes were declared fit to fight:

* 1800 were sent to the camp [[Lager Heuberg]]&lt;ref&gt;See entry of one fallen or deceased soldier of the "Marsch-Btl. Franc Garde" in the following two lists. First list: Kriegsgraeber Ehrenfriedhof A, B, C, E Nr. B 58, Friedhofsamt Tuebingen, and second list: Oeffentliche Kriegsgraeberliste vom 11. Januar 1954, Friedhofsamt Tuebingen.&lt;/ref&gt; near the city of [[Ulm]] in Germany where they were located within the 57th SS Infantry Regiment, formed by survivors of the [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|LVF]], and in the 58th SS Infantry Regiment formed by survivors of the Sturmbrigade Frankreich, in the context of the 33rd SS Grenadier Division Charlemagne.
* 500 others formed a battalion of infantry, under the direct command of the naval officer Carus, former head of staff of the Militia, who will fight Italian partisans alongside the fascists [[Italian Social Republic|RSI]] in Northern Italy.

==Organization and equipment==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-107-24, Frankreich, Einsatz gegen die Resistance.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Resistance captured by the milice.]]
The Franc-Garde consisted of volunteers (typically enrolled after a year's membership in the Militia), aged 18 to 45 years old, who lived in barracks and were paid based on the official salary of a sergeant of the Police National.

* Organisation:
** main (hand) consisting of a chief and four men;
** dizaine (ten) (corresponding to the combat group);
** trentaine (thirty) a small section - in principle at least one in each capital of province;
** centaine (hundred) a small company - in principle at least one in each capital city region. There were two types:
*** "normal" - traveling on foot or bicycle and
*** "mobile" - with motorbikes, cars and trucks;
** cohorte (cohort) a small battalion of three hundred;
** Centre (center) a small regiment of several cohorts.
* Uniform:

The Francs-Gardes, the only militia in uniform, adopted the dark blue dress Alpine model 1941 ("ski" trousers worn with gaiters and boots, jacket and belt, khaki shirt, black tie, beret tilted to the left).

The symbol of a white Greek letter [[gamma]], on black, was used in a metal badge worn in the right buttonhole and in an embroidered badge on the beret. In combat situations, usually in the fight against the guerrillas, the Franc-garde could wear an [[Adrian helmet]].

* Armament:

Because of the reluctance of the German Army, the Franc-Garde was only slowly and gradually armed. Its officers had pistols from the outset, but it was not until autumn 1943, following the upsurge in attacks against its members, that the Franc-Garde received some pistols recovered from British drops to the Resistance. In January 1944 the Franc-Garde was authorized to draw on stockpiles of arms built up after the military armistice, and in March 1944 it was authorized to form a section of machine guns and mortars to participate in the attack on the wooded country of [[Glières]]. Finally, each Ten was equipped with two [[Sten]] submachine guns, the French [[MAC 24/29]] machine gun and [[MAS 36]] rifles. Following a German refusal, the Franc-Garde could never get heavy weapons, artillery or armored vehicles.

In 1944, a Franc-Garde school was set up in Poitiers.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Henri Calmon, Occupation, Résistance et Libération dans la Vienne en 30 questions , Geste éditions, coll.

The '''General Directorate of Security''' (''Direção-Geral de Segurança'') or '''DGS''' was a Portuguese criminal police body between 1969 and 1974.

Although their duties include, in addition to state security, the supervision of foreigners, border control, and the fight against illegal trafficking of migrants, historically the DGS was essentially a political police responsible for repression and without judicial control, of all forms of political opposition to the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]].

The DGS was created in 1969 to succeed to the International and State Defense Police ([[PIDE]]), by Decree-Law no. 49 401, of November 24, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dre.pt/pdf1sdip/1969/11/27500/16641666.PDF ecree-Law no. 49 401, of November 24, 1969]&lt;/ref&gt; of the government of [[Marcello Caetano]].&lt;ref&gt;Darren Palmer, Michael M. Berlin, Dilip K. Das (2012); ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=KHhMlV51XSAC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Dire%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Geral+de+Seguran%C3%A7a&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wFanUtuGFOSw0QWTsIBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Dire%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Geral%20de%20Seguran%C3%A7a&amp;f=false Global Environment of Policing]'', page. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

It was disbanded in the continent and islands in 1974, following the [[Carnation Revolution|Revolution of April 25]], by Decree-Law no. 171/74 of April 25. In overseas territories it continued to exist until 1975, with the designation of "Military Intelligence Police".

'''Henry Ford''' (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American [[captain of industry]] and a [[business magnate]], the founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]], and the sponsor of the development of the [[assembly line]] technique of [[mass production]].

Although Ford did not invent the automobile or the assembly line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life of Henry Ford |url=http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005164558/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 5, 2001 |accessdate=November 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle-class Americans could afford. In doing so, Ford converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into a practical conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century. His introduction of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] automobile revolutionized transportation and American [[industry]]. As the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with "[[Fordism]]": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a [[Franchising|franchise]] system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the [[Ford Foundation]] and arranged for his family to control the company permanently.

Ford was also widely known for his [[pacifism]] during the first years of [[World War I]], and for promoting [[antisemitic]] content, including ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' through his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' and the book ''[[The International Jew]]'', having an influence on the development of [[Nazism]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].

==Early life==
Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in [[Greenfield Township, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp www.hfmgv.org The Henry Ford Museum: ''The Life of Henry Ford''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024223215/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp |date=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[William Ford (businessman)|William Ford]] (1826–1905), was born in [[County Cork]], Ireland, to a family that was originally from [[Somerset]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of Ford in Ireland Family Crest and Name History|url=http://www.ford.ie/AboutFord/CompanyInformation/HistoryOfFord}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Mary Ford (née Litogot; 1839–1876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of Belgian immigrants; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings were Margaret Ford (1867–1938); Jane Ford (c. 1868–1945); William Ford (1871–1917) and Robert Ford (1873–1934).

His father gave him a pocket watch in his early teens. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 22–24; Nevins and Hill, ''Ford TMC'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; At twenty, Ford walked four miles to their [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church every Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Harold "They Made America" Little, Brown and Company. New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was devastated when his mother died in 1876. His father expected him to eventually take over the family farm, but he despised farm work. He later wrote, "I never had any particular love for the farm—it was the mother on the farm I loved."&lt;ref&gt;Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 24; Edward A. Guest "Henry Ford Talks About His Mother," ''American Magazine'', July 1923, 11–15, 116–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ford left home to work as an apprentice [[machinist]] in Detroit, first with James F. Flower &amp; Bros., and later with the [[Detroit Dry Dock]] Co. In 1882, he returned to Dearborn to work on the family farm, where he became adept at operating the [[Westinghouse Farm Engine|Westinghouse portable steam engine]]. He was later hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] to service their steam engines. During this period Ford also studied bookkeeping at [[Goldsmith, Bryant &amp; Stratton Business College]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Watts |title=The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century |publisher=Random House, Inc. |year=2006 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LIDyU91YMHAC|isbn=978-0307558978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Henry Ford 1888.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford in 1888&lt;br /&gt;
(aged 25)]]
Ford married Clara Jane Bryant (1866–1950) on April 11, 1888, and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Widow of Automobile Pioneer, Victim of Coronary Occlusion, Survived Him Three Years|quote=Friday, Sept. 29 (Associated Press) Mrs. Clara Bryant Ford, 84&amp;nbsp;year-old widow of Henry Ford, died at 2 A. M. today in Henry Ford Hospital. A family spokesman said her death was the result of an acute coronary occlusion.|agency=Associated Press|date=September 29, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one child: [[Edsel Ford]] (1893–1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edsel Ford Dies in Detroit at 49. Motor Company President, the Only Son of Its Founder, Had Long Been Ill.|quote=Edsel Ford, 49-year-old president of the Ford Motor Company, died this morning at his home at [[Grosse Pointe]] Shores following an illness of six weeks.|agency=Associated Press|date=May 26, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1891, Ford became an engineer with the [[Edison Illuminating Company]]. After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he named the [[Ford Quadricycle]]. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615125140/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html |date=June 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was introduced to [[Thomas Edison]]. Edison approved of Ford's automobile experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, completing it in 1898.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;Ford R. Bryan, [http://hfha.org/HenryFord.htm "The Birth of Ford Motor Company"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829193220/http://hfha.org/HenryFord.htm |date=August 29, 2012 }}, Henry Ford Heritage Association, retrieved August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by the capital of Detroit [[lumber baron]] William H. Murphy, Ford resigned from the Edison Company and founded the [[Detroit Automobile Company]] on August 5, 1899.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than Ford wanted. Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

With the help of [[C. Harold Wills]], Ford designed, built, and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. With this success, Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the [[Henry Ford Company]] on November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; In 1902, Murphy brought in [[Henry M. Leland]] as a consultant; Ford, in response, left the company bearing his name. With Ford gone, Murphy renamed the company the [[Cadillac Automobile Company]].&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

Teaming up with former racing cyclist [[Tom Cooper (driver)|Tom Cooper]], Ford also produced the 80+ horsepower racer "999" which [[Barney Oldfield]] was to drive to victory in a race in October 1902. Ford received the backing of an old acquaintance, [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]], a Detroit-area coal dealer.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; They formed a partnership, "Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd." to manufacture automobiles. Ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile, and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by [[John F. Dodge|John]] and [[Horace E. Dodge]] to supply over $160,000 in parts.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Sales were slow, and a crisis arose when the Dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment.

===Ford Motor Company===
[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Harvey Firestone]]. [[Fort Myers, Florida]], February 11, 1929.]]

In response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept a portion of the new company.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Ford &amp; Malcomson was reincorporated as the [[Ford Motor Company]] on June 16, 1903,&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; with $28,000 capital. The original investors included Ford and Malcomson, the Dodge brothers, Malcomson's uncle [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]], Malcolmson's secretary [[James Couzens]], and two of Malcomson's lawyers, John W. Anderson and [[Horace Rackham]]. Ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], driving {{convert|1|mi|km}} in 39.4 seconds and setting a new [[land speed record]] at {{convert|91.3|mph|km/h|abbr=off}}. Convinced by this success, the race driver [[Barney Oldfield]], who named this new Ford model "[[Ford 999|999]]" in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took the car around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States. Ford also was one of the early backers of the [[Indianapolis 500]].

====Model T====
The [[Model T]] was introduced on October 1, 1908. It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|825|1908|r=-1}}}} today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bak, ''Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire'' (2003) pp. 54–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford created a huge publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed—several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees [[Clarence Avery]], [[Peter E. Martin]], [[Charles E. Sorensen]], and [[C. Harold Wills]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1954) 1:387–415&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]])

[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913]]

Sales passed 250,000 in 1914. By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1976, pp. 41–59&lt;/ref&gt; (Using the consumer price index, this price was equivalent to $7,828.08 in 2015 dollars.)
[[File:1924-1925 Ford - T Roadster, Coimbatore (1).jpg|thumb|A 1926 Ford T Roadster on display in India]]
By 1918, half of all cars in America were Model Ts. All new cars were black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black".&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage p. 72].&lt;/ref&gt; Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908).

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] asked Ford to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] from Michigan in 1918. Although the nation was at war, Ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Watts, pp. 243–48&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was defeated in a close election by the Republican candidate, [[Truman Newberry]], a former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]].

Henry Ford turned the presidency of Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918. Henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son. Ford started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value. (He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) The ruse worked, and Ford and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1920s, sales of the Model T began to decline due to rising competition. Other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars, which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the Model T. Despite urgings from Edsel, Henry refused to incorporate new features into the Model T or to form a customer credit plan.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:409–36&lt;/ref&gt;

====Model A and Ford's later career====
By 1926, flagging sales of the Model T finally convinced Ford to make a new model. He pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son. Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p223"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was the successful [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]], introduced in December 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of more than 4&amp;nbsp;million. Subsequently, the Ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor General Motors (and still in use by automakers today). Not until the 1930s did Ford overcome his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned [[Universal Credit Corporation]] became a major car-financing operation.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:459–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford did not believe in accountants; he amassed one of the world's largest fortunes without ever having his company [[audit]]ed under his administration.

====Labor philosophy====

=====The five-dollar wage=====
[[File:Timehenryford.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, January 14, 1935]]
Ford was a pioneer of "[[welfare capitalism]]", designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:508–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford astonished the world in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1914|r=-1}}}} today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers.&lt;ref&gt;Using the [[consumer price index]], this was equivalent to $111.10 per day in 2008 dollars.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cleveland, Ohio]], newspaper editorialized that the announcement "shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Public Image'' p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ford'' 1:528–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 178–94&lt;/ref&gt; Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying male workers.

Detroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's policy proved, however, that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy. He viewed the increased wages as profit-sharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_pp126-130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage pp. 126–30].&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been [[James Couzens|Couzens]] who convinced Ford to adopt the $5-day wage.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Public Image,'' 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Real profit-sharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more, and, importantly, conducted their lives in a manner of which Ford's "Social Department" approved. They frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and (what today are called) [[deadbeat parent|deadbeat dads]]. The Social Department used 50 investigators, plus support staff, to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this "profit-sharing."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Ford's incursion into his employees' private lives was highly controversial, and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects. By the time he wrote his 1922 memoir, he spoke of the Social Department and of the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense, and admitted that "paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. Men need counsel and men need help, often special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside. Without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment."&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage p. 130].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The five-day workweek=====
In addition to raising the wages of his workers, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week,&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1926 it was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Crowther [http://geowords.com/e_/e_readings/ford2.htm Henry Ford: "Why I Favor Five Days' Work With Six Days' Pay"], ''World's Work,'' October 1926 pp. 613–16&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off.) On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325165437/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |archive-date=March 25, 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford had made the decision to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time, and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business, since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods. However, altruistic concerns also played a role, with Ford explaining "It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege."&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

=====Labor unions=====
Ford was adamantly against [[trade union|labor unions]]. He explained his views on unions in Chapter 18 of ''My Life and Work''.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_pp253-266"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage pp. 253–66].&lt;/ref&gt; He thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who, despite their ostensible good motives, would end up doing more harm than good for workers. {{Anchor|No_prosperity_without_productivity}} Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but Ford saw this as self-defeating because, in his view, productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist.

He believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others. Ford also believed that union leaders had a [[perverse incentive]] to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis as a way to maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.

To forestall union activity, Ford promoted [[Harry Bennett]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] boxer, to head the Service Department. Bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J: ''Henry Ford'', pp. 91–92. Moffa Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous incident, on May 26, 1937, involved Bennett's security men beating with clubs members of the [[United Automobile Workers]], including [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Bennett's men were beating the UAW representatives, the supervising police chief on the scene was Carl Brooks, an alumnus of Bennett's Service Department, and [Brooks] "did not give orders to intervene."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|2003|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day photographs of the injured UAW members appeared in newspapers, later becoming known as [[The Battle of the Overpass]].

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was president of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of [[collective bargaining]] agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a ''de facto'' basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p261"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.

The Ford Motor Company was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the UAW. A sit-down strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the [[River Rouge Plant]]. Sorensen recounted&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp266-272"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=266–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that a distraught Henry Ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. In her view, it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp266-272"/&gt; About a year later, Ford told Walter Reuther, "It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant." Reuther inquired, "What do you mean?" Ford replied, "Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now you're in here and we've given you a union shop and more than you got out of them. That puts you on our side, doesn't it? We can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Putting the world together : my father Walter Reuther, the liberal warrior|last=Reuther.|first=Dickmeyer, Elisabeth|date=2004|publisher=LivingForce Pub|isbn=978-0975379219|location=Lake Orion, Mich.|page=63|oclc=57172289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford Airplane Company===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Ford, like other automobile companies, entered the aviation business during [[World War I]], building Liberty engines. After the war, it returned to auto manufacturing until 1925, when Ford acquired the [[Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company|Stout Metal Airplane Company]].

[[File:Ford 4ATF.jpg|thumb|left|Ford 4-AT-F (EC-RRA) of the Spanish Republican Airline, [[L.A.P.E.]]]]
Ford's most successful aircraft was the [[Ford Trimotor|Ford 4AT Trimotor]], often called the "Tin Goose" because of its corrugated metal construction. It used a new alloy called [[Alclad]] that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of [[duralumin]]. The plane was similar to [[Fokker]]'s V.VII-3m, and some say that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured the Fokker plane and then copied it. The Trimotor first flew on June 11, 1926, and was the first successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the [[U.S. Army]]. Ford has been honored by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before it was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the [[Great Depression]].

===Peace and war===

====World War I era====
Ford opposed war, which he viewed as a terrible waste,&lt;ref name="Ford-Bio-A&amp;E"&gt;Henry Ford, Biography (March 25, 1999). ''A&amp;E Television''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michigan History, January/February 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and supported causes that opposed [[military intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i | title=Examining the American peace movement prior to World War I| date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war, and he tried to stop them. In 1915, the pacifist [[Rosika Schwimmer]] gained favor with Ford, who agreed to fund a [[Peace Ship]] to Europe, where World War I was raging. He and about 170 other prominent peace leaders traveled there. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, accompanied him on the mission. Marquis headed Ford's Sociology Department from 1913 to 1921. Ford talked to President Wilson about the mission but had no government support. His group went to neutral Sweden and the Netherlands to meet with peace activists. A target of much ridicule, Ford left the ship as soon as it reached Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Watts|title=''The People's Tycoon''|year=2005|pages=225–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford plants in the United Kingdom produced tractors to increase the British food supply, as well as trucks and aircraft engines. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917 the company became a major supplier of weapons, especially the Liberty engine for airplanes, and anti-submarine boats.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins and Frank Ernest Hill, ''Ford: Expansion and Challenge, 1915–1933'' (1957) pp. 55–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, with the war on and the [[League of Nations]] a growing issue in global politics, President [[Woodrow Wilson]], a Democrat, encouraged Ford to run for a Michigan seat in the U.S. Senate. Wilson believed that Ford could tip the scales in Congress in favor of Wilson's proposed [[League of Nations|League]]. "You are the only man in Michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire," the president wrote Ford. Ford wrote back: "If they want to elect me let them do so, but I won't make a penny's investment." Ford did run, however, and came within 4,500 votes of winning, out of more than 400,000 cast statewide.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Russ. (2002) ''The Ford Century.'' Tehabi Books. {{ISBN|188765688X}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford remained a staunch Wilsonian and supporter of the League. When Wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to promote the League, Ford helped fund the attendant publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Watts|title=''The People's Tycoon''|year=2005|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper Jr, ''Woodrow Wilson: A Biography'' (2009) p. 521&lt;/ref&gt;

====The coming of World War II and Ford's mental collapse====
Ford had opposed America's entry into World War II&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Neil (2001). ''Henry Ford and the Jews: The Mass Production of Hate''. New York: Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars. Ford "insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction"; in 1939 he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of U.S. merchant ships by German submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier war-makers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; The financiers to whom he was referring was Ford's code for Jews; he had also accused Jews of fomenting the First World War.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to World War II and when the war erupted in 1939, he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents. Like many other businessmen of the Great Depression era, he never liked or entirely trusted the Franklin Roosevelt Administration, and thought Roosevelt was inching the U.S. closer to war. However, Ford continued to do business with [[Nazi Germany]], including the manufacture of war [[materiel]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

Beginning in 1940, with the requisitioning of between 100 and 200 French [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] to work as slave laborers, ''[[Ford Germany|Ford-Werke]]'' contravened Article 31 of the 1929 [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; At that time, which was before the U.S. entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany, ''Ford-Werke'' was under the control of the Ford Motor Company. The number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although [[Max Wallace|Wallace]] makes it clear that companies in Germany were not required by the Nazi authorities to use slave laborers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

When [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] sought a U.S. manufacturer as an additional source for the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] engine (as fitted to [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] fighters), Ford first agreed to do so and then [[Rolls-Royce Merlin#Packard V-1650|reneged]]. He "lined up behind the war effort" when the U.S. entered in late 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; His support of the American war effort, however, was problematic.

Once the U.S. entered the war, Ford directed the [[Ford Motor Company]] to construct a vast new purpose-built factory at [[Willow Run]] near Detroit, Michigan. Ford broke ground on Willow Run in the spring of 1942, and the first [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] came off the line in October 1942. At {{convert|3,500,000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}}, it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time. At its peak in 1944, the Willow Run plant produced 650 B-24s per month, and by 1945 Ford was completing each B-24 in eighteen hours, with one rolling off the assembly line every 58 minutes.&lt;ref name=Willowrun&gt;Nolan, Jenny.

Retrieved: August 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford produced 9,000 B-24s at Willow Run, half of the 18,000 total B-24s produced during the war.&lt;ref name="Willowrun"/&gt;

When Edsel Ford died prematurely in 1943, Henry Ford nominally resumed control of the company, but a series of strokes in the late 1930s had left him increasingly debilitated, and his mental ability was fading. Ford was increasingly sidelined, and others made decisions in his name.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; The company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by [[Charles Sorensen]], an important engineer and production executive at Ford; and [[Harry Bennett]], the chief of Ford's Service Unit, Ford's paramilitary force that spied on, and enforced discipline upon, Ford employees. Ford grew jealous of the publicity Sorensen received and forced Sorensen out in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) pp. 522–25&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's incompetence led to discussions in Washington about how to restore the company, whether by wartime government fiat, or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp324–333"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=324–333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing happened until 1945 when, with bankruptcy a serious risk, Edsel's widow led an ouster and installed her son, [[Henry Ford II]], as president.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Brock.

==''The Dearborn Independent'' and antisemitism==
&lt;!--THIS SECTION HEADING WAS DETERMINED, BY CONSENSUS, TO BE THE MOST NEUTRAL IN TONE. DO NOT CHANGE IT TO 'ANTISEMITISM', AS IT WILL BE REVERTED.--&gt;

[[File:1920 International Jew reprint from Dearborn Independent.jpg|thumb|upright|The Ford publication ''[[The International Jew|The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem]]''. Articles from ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'', 1920]]

In the early 1920s, Ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views. At the same time, Ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers, and was not accused of discrimination against Jewish workers or suppliers. He also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Howard P. Segal |title=Recasting the Machine Age: Henry Ford's Village Industries |year=2008 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Ford's closest aide and private secretary, [[Ernest G. Liebold]], purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for Ford, ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. The ''Independent'' ran for eight years, from 1920 until 1927, with Liebold as editor. Every Ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers.

During this period, Ford emerged as "a respected spokesman for right-wing extremism and religious prejudice", reaching around 700,000 readers through his newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Glock, Charles Y. and Quinley, Harold E. (1983). ''Anti-Semitism in America''. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|087855940X}}, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 documentary film ''[[Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story]]'' (written by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Ira Berkow]]) states that Ford wrote on May 22, 1920: "If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball they have it in three words—too much Jew."&lt;ref name="nyblueprint1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyblueprint.com/articles/view.aspx?id=824 |title=Jews and Baseball Is a Film You Should Catch |first=Alan|last=Zeitlin|publisher=The New York Blueprint |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210065732/http://nyblueprint.com/articles/view.aspx?id=824|archivedate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Ford's antisemitic articles from ''The Dearborn Independent'' were issued in four volumes, cumulatively titled ''[[The International Jew|The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem]]'' published by [[Theodor Fritsch]], founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. In a letter written in 1924, [[Heinrich Himmler]] described Ford as "one of our most valuable, important, and witty fighters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allen|first1=Michael Thad|title=The Business of Genocide: The SS, Slave Labor, and the Concentration Camps |date=2002 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|isbn=978-0807826775|pages=14, 290}}  See also, {{cite book |last=Pfal-Traughber|first=Armin|title=Der antisemitisch-antifreimaurerische Verschwörungsmythos in der Weimarer Republik und im NS-Staat|year=1993|publisher=Braumüller|location=Vienna|page=39}}.

[[File:Service Cross of the German Eagle.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Grand Cross of the German Eagle]], an award bestowed on Ford by Nazi Germany]]

On February 1, 1924, Ford received [[Kurt Ludecke]], a representative of Hitler, at home. Ludecke was introduced to Ford by [[Siegfried Wagner]] (son of the composer [[Richard Wagner]]) and his wife [[Winifred Wagner|Winifred]], both [[Nazi]] sympathizers and antisemites. Ludecke asked Ford for a contribution to the Nazi cause, but was apparently refused.&lt;ref&gt;Max Wallace. ''The American Axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the Rise of the Third Reich'', (Macmillan, 2004), pp. 50–54, {{ISBN|0312335318}}. Years later, in 1977, Winifred claimed that Ford had told her that he had helped finance Hitler. This anecdote is the suggestion that Ford made a contribution. The company has always denied that any contribution was made, and no documentary evidence has ever been found. ''ibid'' p. 54. See also [[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Neil Baldwin]], ''Henry Ford and the Jews: The Mass Production of Hate'' (Public Affairs, 2002), pp. 185–89, {{ISBN|1586481630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ford's articles were denounced by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), the articles explicitly condemned [[Pogram|pogroms]] and violence against Jews, but blamed the Jews for provoking incidents of mass violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Henry (2003). ''The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem''. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|0766178293}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; None of this work was written by Ford, but he allowed his name to be used as author. According to trial testimony, he wrote almost nothing. Friends and business associates have said they warned Ford about the contents of the ''Independent'' and that he probably never read the articles (he claimed he only read the headlines).&lt;ref&gt;Watts pp. x, 376–87; Lewis (1976) pp. 135–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Court testimony in a [[libel]] suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, alleged that Ford did know about the contents of the ''Independent'' in advance of publication.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

A libel lawsuit was brought by San Francisco lawyer and Jewish farm cooperative organizer [[Aaron Sapiro]] in response to the antisemitic remarks, and led Ford to close the ''Independent'' in December 1927. News reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature. During the trial, the editor of Ford's "Own Page", William Cameron, testified that Ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline. Cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to Ford for his approval.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, (1976) pp. 140–56; Baldwin pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative journalist [[Max Wallace]] noted that "whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when James M. Miller, a former ''Dearborn Independent'' employee, swore under oath that Ford had told him he intended to expose Sapiro."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American Axis: Ford, Lindbergh, and the Rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Barkun]] observed:

{{quote|That Cameron would have continued to publish such anti-Semitic material without Ford's explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men. Mrs. Stanley Ruddiman, a Ford family intimate, remarked that "I don't think Mr. Cameron ever wrote anything for publication without Mr. Ford's approval."&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, Michael (1996). ''Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement''. UNC Press. {{ISBN|0807846384}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Spencer Blakeslee:

{{quote|The ADL mobilized prominent Jews and non-Jews to publicly oppose Ford's message. They formed a coalition of Jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the Detroit press. Before leaving his presidency early in 1921, [[Woodrow Wilson]] joined other leading Americans in a statement that rebuked Ford and others for their antisemitic campaign. A boycott against Ford products by Jews and liberal Christians also had an impact, and Ford shut down the paper in 1927, recanting his views in a public letter to [[Sigmund Livingston]], ADL.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Spencer (2000). ''The Death of American Antisemitism''. Praeger/Greenwood. {{ISBN|0275965082}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wallace also found that Ford's apology was likely, at least partly, motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of Ford cars.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; Up until the apology, a considerable number of dealers, who had been required to make sure that buyers of Ford cars received the ''Independent'', bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

Ford's 1927 apology was well received. "Four-Fifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to Ford in July 1927 were from Jews, and almost without exception they praised the industrialist."&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{Cite book|first=David I. |last=Lewis |title=The Public Image of Henry Ford: An American Folk Hero and His Company |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1976|isbn=978-0814315538}}, pp. 146–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1937, a Ford statement to the ''Detroit Jewish Chronicle'' disavowed "any connection whatsoever with the publication in Germany of a book known as the ''International Jew''."&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

According to Pool and Pool (1978),&lt;ref name="Pool_and_Pool_1978"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pool|Pool|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's retraction and apology (which were written by others) were not even truly signed by him (rather, his signature was forged by [[Harry Bennett]]), and Ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views, stating in 1940: "I hope to republish ''The International Jew'' again some time."

In July 1938, before the outbreak of war, the German consul at Cleveland gave Ford, on his 75th birthday, the award of the [[Grand Cross of the German Eagle]], the highest medal Nazi Germany could bestow on a foreigner.&lt;ref name='WP'&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford and GM Scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration|date=November 30, 1998 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm|work=Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James D.

(2002). ''Sloan Rules: Alfred P. Sloan and the Triumph of General Motors''. University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0226238040}}, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 1942, Ford wrote a letter to [[Sigmund Livingston]] as the Founder and National Chairman of the [[Anti-Defamation League]].  The purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly, "any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my Jewish fellow citizens." He concluded the letter with "My sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished, hatred of the Jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time."&lt;ref name=Arnstein&gt;"Arnstein &amp; Lehr, The First 120 Years" (Louis A. Lehr, Jr.)(Amazon), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution of ''The International Jew'' was halted in 1942 through legal action by Ford, despite complications from a lack of copyright.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; It is still banned in Germany. Extremist groups often recycle the material; it still appears on [[antisemitic]] and [[neo-Nazi]] websites.

Testifying at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]], convicted [[Hitler Youth]] leader [[Baldur von Schirach]] who, in his role as military governor of [[Vienna]], deported 65,000 Jews to camps in Poland, stated:

Robert Lacey wrote in ''Ford: The Men and the Machines'' that a close Willow Run associate of Ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the [[Nazi concentration camps]], he "was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed, he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious."&lt;ref&gt;Lacey 1986, pp. 218–19; which in turn cites:

==International business==
Ford's philosophy was one of [[Economic nationalism|economic independence]] for the United States. His [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge Plant]] became the world's largest industrial complex, pursuing [[vertical integration]] to such an extent that it could produce its own steel. Ford's goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade. He believed in the global expansion of his company. He believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace, and he used the assembly line process and production of the Model T to demonstrate it.&lt;ref&gt;Watts 236–40&lt;/ref&gt;

He opened Ford assembly plants in Britain and Canada in 1911, and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries. In 1912, Ford cooperated with [[Giovanni Agnelli]] of [[Fiat]] to launch the first Italian automotive assembly plants. The first plants in Germany were built in the 1920s with the encouragement of [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Commerce Department, which agreed with Ford's theory that international trade was essential to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Ford also opened plants in Australia, India, and France, and by 1929, he had successful dealerships on six continents. Ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] jungle called [[Fordlândia]]; it was one of his few failures.

In 1929, Ford made an agreement with the Soviets to provide technical aid over nine years in building the [[GAZ|first Soviet automobile plant (GAZ)]] near [[Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhny Novgorod (Gorky)]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The contract involved the purchase of $30,000,000 worth of knocked-down Ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant's operation, after which the plant would gradually switch to Soviet-made components. Ford sent his engineers and technicians to the Soviet Union to help install the equipment and train the working force, while over a hundred Soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at Ford's plants in Detroit and Dearborn "for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the Company's plants."&lt;ref&gt;

By 1932, Ford was manufacturing one third of all the world's automobiles. It set up numerous subsidiaries that sold or assembled the Ford cars and trucks:

Ford's image transfixed Europeans, especially the Germans, arousing the "fear of some, the infatuation of others, and the fascination among all".&lt;ref&gt;Nolan p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Germans who discussed "Fordism" often believed that it represented something quintessentially American. They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production demonstrated at the Ford Works as a national service—an "American thing" that represented the [[culture of the United States]]. Both supporters and critics insisted that Fordism epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States. As one German explained, "Automobiles have so completely changed the American's mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car. It is difficult to remember what life was like before Mr. Ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation".&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; For many Germans, Ford embodied the essence of successful Americanism.

In ''My Life and Work'', Ford predicted that if greed, racism, and short-sightedness could be overcome, then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on (what today would be called) colonial or [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] models and would truly benefit all peoples.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_pp242-244"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage pp. 242–44].&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.

==Racing==
[[File:Henry Ford and Barney Oldfield with Old 999, 1902.jpg|thumb|Ford (standing) launched [[Barney Oldfield]]'s career in 1902]]

Ford maintained an interest in auto racing from 1901 to 1913 and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver, later turning the wheel over to hired drivers. He entered stripped-down [[Model T]]s in races, finishing first (although later disqualified) in an "ocean-to-ocean" (across the United States) race in 1909, and setting a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) oval speed record at Detroit Fairgrounds in 1911 with driver Frank Kulick. In 1913, Ford attempted to enter a reworked Model T in the [[Indianapolis 500]] but was told rules required the addition of another {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} to the car before it could qualify. Ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently, citing dissatisfaction with the sport's rules, demands on his time by the booming production of the Model Ts, and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity.

In ''My Life and Work'' Ford speaks (briefly) of racing in a rather dismissive tone, as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage p. 50].&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.

Nevertheless, Ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years, and he was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9KOHEPbBBbIC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=henry+ford+Motorsports+Hall+of+Fame+of+America+in+1996#v=snippet&amp;q=Hall%20of%20fame%20henry%20ford|title=The Intellectual Devotional Modern Culture: Revive Your Mind, Complete Your Education, and Converse Confidently with the Culturati|last=Kidder|first=David S.|last2=Oppenheim|first2=Noah D.|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=Rodale|isbn=978-1605297934|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career and death==
When Edsel Ford, President of Ford Motor Company, died of cancer in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency. By this point in his life, he had had several cardiovascular events (variously cited as heart attacks or strokes) and was mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp100_266_et_al"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=100, 266, 271–72, 310–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the directors did not want to see him as President. But for the previous 20 years, though he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had ''de facto'' control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him,&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp325–326"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=325–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he served until the end of the war. During this period the company began to decline, losing more than $10&amp;nbsp;million a month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000000|1943|r=-4}}}} today). The administration of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production,&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp324–333" /&gt; but the idea never progressed.

[[File:Henry Ford grave Ford Cemetery Detroit.JPG|thumb|right|Ford grave, Ford Cemetery]]
His health failing, Ford ceded the company Presidency to his grandson, [[Henry Ford II]], in September 1945 and went into retirement. He died on April 7, 1947, of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] at [[Fair Lane]], his estate in Dearborn, at the age of 83. A public viewing was held at Greenfield Village where up to 5,000 people per hour filed past the casket. Funeral services were held in Detroit's [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Detroit|Cathedral Church of St. Paul]] and he was buried in the Ford Cemetery in Detroit.&lt;ref name="AP-1947.04.08"&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader in Production Founded Vast Empire in Motors in 1903.

&lt;!--On the night of his death, the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] had flooded the local power station and had left Ford's house without electricity. Before going to sleep, Henry and his wife lit candles and oil lamps to light the house. Later that evening, just before dawn, he died.--&gt;

==Personal interests==
A compendium of short biographies of famous [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], published by a Freemason lodge, lists Ford as a member.&lt;ref name="Denslow2004p62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Denslow|2004|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grand Lodge of New York]] confirms that Ford was a Freemason, and was raised in Palestine Lodge No. 357, Detroit, in 1894. When he received the 33rd degree of the [[Scottish Rite]] in 1940, he said, "Masonry is the best balance wheel the United States has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |publisher=MWGLNY |title=Famous Masons |date=January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110010123/http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Ford's pastor, and head of his sociology department, Episcopal minister Samuel S. Marquis, claimed that Ford believed, or "once believed," in [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, Samuel S. ([1923]/2007). Henry Ford: An Interpretation. ''Wayne State University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford published an anti-smoking book, circulated to youth in 1914, called ''The Case Against the Little White Slaver'', which documented many dangers of cigarette smoking attested to by many researchers and luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicolegal.tripod.com/ford1914.htm The Case Against the Little White Slaver]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time smoking was ubiquitous and was not yet widely associated with health detriment, so Ford's opposition to cigarettes was unusual.

===Interest in materials science and engineering===
Henry Ford long had an interest in [[Materials science|materials science and engineering]]. He enthusiastically described his company's adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic R&amp;D work.&lt;ref name="Ford1922pp18_65-67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage 18],[https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage 65–67].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products, especially [[soybean]]s. He cultivated a relationship with [[George Washington Carver]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehenryford.org/explore/stories-of-innovation/visionaries/george-washington-carver/|title=George Washington Carver – Visionaries on Innovation |website=www.thehenryford.org|language=en|access-date=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/george-washington-carver-begins-experimental-project-with-henry-ford|title=George Washington Carver begins experimental project with Henry Ford – Jul 19, 1942 |work=HISTORY.com|access-date=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/197274/|title=George Washington Carver Examining Soy Fiber, Soybean Laboratory at Greenfield Village, 1939 |website=www.thehenryford.org|language=en|access-date=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soybean-based plastics were used in Ford automobiles throughout the 1930s in plastic parts such as car horns, in paint, etc. This project culminated in 1942, when Ford [[Soybean Car|patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic]], attached to a tubular welded frame. It weighed 30% less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel. Furthermore, it ran on grain alcohol ([[ethanol]]) instead of gasoline. The design never caught on.&lt;ref name="Lewis1995"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was interested in [[engineered wood]]s ("Better wood can be made than is grown"&lt;ref name="Ford1922p281"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA281#v=onepage p. 281].&lt;/ref&gt;) (at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas); [[Biofuel|corn as a fuel source]], via both corn oil and ethanol;&lt;ref name="Ford1922pp275-276"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage pp. 275–276].&lt;/ref&gt; and the potential uses of cotton.&lt;ref name="Ford1922p281" /&gt; Ford was instrumental in developing charcoal [[Briquette|briquets]], under the brand name "[[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]]". His brother in law, [[E.G. Kingsford]], used wood scraps from the Ford factory to make the briquets.

In 1927 Ford partnered with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Harvey Samuel Firestone]] (each contributing $25,000) to create the Edison Botanic Research Corp. in Fort Myers, Florida, to look for a native source of rubber.

Ford was a [[List of prolific inventors|prolific inventor]] and was awarded 161 U.S. patents.

===Florida and Georgia residences and community===
Ford had a vacation residence in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] next to that of [[Thomas Edison]], which he bought in 1915 and used until approximately 1930. It is still in existence today and is open as a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.edisonfordwinterestates.org | title=Fort Myers Museums, Attractions, Things to do &amp;#124; Edison Ford Winter Estates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also had a vacation home (known today as the "Ford Plantation") in [[Richmond Hill, Georgia|Richmond Hill]], Georgia which is still in existence today as a private community. Ford started buying land in this area and eventually owned 70,000 acres (110 square miles) there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seibert |first1=David |title=Henry Ford at Richmond Hill |url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/bryan/henry-ford-at-richmond-hill|website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Ford broke ground for a beautiful [[Greek revival]] style mansion on the banks of the [[Ogeechee River]] on the site of a 1730s plantation. The grand house, made of Savannah-gray brick, had marble steps, air conditioning, and an [[elevator]]. It sat on 55 acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens. The house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and the DuPonts. It remains the centerpiece of The Ford Plantation today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordplantation.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ford converted the 1870s-era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed an underground tunnel from there to the new home, providing it with steam. He contributed substantially to the community, building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents.

===Preserving Americana===
Ford had an interest in "[[Americana]]". In the 1920s, Ford began work to turn [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], Massachusetts, into a themed historical village. He moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme, "[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]", from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], Massachusetts, and purchased the historic [[Wayside Inn]]. This plan never saw fruition. Ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of [[Greenfield Village]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], Michigan. It may have inspired the creation of [[Old Sturbridge Village]] as well. About the same time, he began collecting materials for [[The Henry Ford|his museum]], which had a theme of practical technology. It was opened in 1929 as the Edison Institute. Although greatly modernized, the museum continues today.

In his defence, Cunha said that opening the impeachment process was his constitutional duty as chamber president, and the decision to do so was based only on facts related to the budget laws. Cunha said further that he had no personal grievance against the Workers' Party and that Rousseff had signed six decrees for additional spending, which had increased the 2015 federal spending in non-compliance with the annual budget law and without approval of the Congress.&lt;ref name = bargain/&gt;

Rousseff denied any attempted deal to save Cunha in return for stopping her impeachment, and also denied agreements to interfere with the Council of Ethics in exchange for approval of the re-introduction of the CPMF tax (Provisional Tax on Financial Transactions), which was a wish from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cunha claimed he was not aware of any negotiations and that he had never met [[Jaques Wagner]], the supposed intermediary in the alleged negotiations with Rousseff.

===Comments by specialists and public opinion===
Professor Leonardo Avritzer of [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais]] told [[Agência Brasil]] in December 2015 that the political crisis was tied to Rousseff's inability to negotiate with Congress, and that Brazil's fragmented political system (and many [[List of political parties in Brazil|political parties]]) had created an ungovernable government. According to him, the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] confronting Rousseff after the 2014 elections calling for a recount and her disputed campaign accounts, culminating in the impeachment process, had been other major factors in the destabilization of the government. However, political scientist Luciana Veiga stated that, at that time, the process was benefiting Rousseff, who was now free from blackmail and could potentially reorganize her government. Veiga believed that Cunha could be removed from office and that the opposition would try to push the impeachment process of Rousseff in Congress for 2016 in order to mitigate the "electoral ecstasy" and "act of revenge" that were said to be the cause of the impeachment attempt.&lt;ref name= "Terra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/politica/impeachment/impeachment-dependera-do-futuro-de-cunha-na-camara-dizem-cientistas-politicos,4693873b8bb811e15bb298eaea0a3fecd25v5z3i.html

===Fiscal responsibility crimes===
Rousseff issued six unnumbered decrees in 2014 and 2015 that allocated funds to social programs, allegedly for political purposes, without authorization from Congress. These totaled R$18.5&amp;nbsp;billion (US$6.9&amp;nbsp;billion) and were contracted in official financial institutions with neither the necessary legislative authorization, nor targets which complied with the Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (Fiscal Responsibility Law) and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Annual Budgetary Law|pt|3=Lei orçamentária anual}}. To obtain these additional credits, the target of 2014 was reduced by the end of 2014 by R$67&amp;nbsp;billion (US$25&amp;nbsp;billion) at the request of the president. Rousseff allegedly committed similar crimes of fiscal irresponsibility in 2015. She further issued such decrees in the years 2014 and 2015 to authorize the opening credit precisely to, purportedly, allow the provision of additional resources despite it being known that the primary ''superavit'' target in the budget forecast was not being fulfilled, and would not be fulfilled, hence disregarding the Annual Budgetary Law and the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Request for impeachment, pg 13–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fiscal pedaling"===
In 2011 and 2014, Rousseff's government is said to have held illegal credit operations, using funds from the state-owned banks [[Caixa Econômica Federal]] and [[Banco do Brasil]] to finance social programs without officially declaring loans from either of those banks, an example of fiscal pedaling. These transactions were reported in 2015 by the TCU and, according to the report, were undertaken in order to improve the government's chances of re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Request for impeachment, pg 22–38; pg.38: ''Com efeito, como evidenciado em sede de Representação Criminal encaminhada à  Procuradoria Geral da República, ao fazer empréstimos proibidos e não os contabilizar, a Presidente da República poderia até, em tese, ser inclusa nas iras do artigo 299 do Código Penal, que tipifica a falsidade ideológica. A situação resta ainda mais grave, quando se constata que todo esse expediente fora intensificado durante o ano eleitoral, com o fim deliberado de iludir o eleitorado. Daí ser possível falar em verdadeiro estelionato eleitoral.''
&lt;br /&gt;(''In fact, as evidenced by a Criminal Representation sent to the Office of the Attorney General, by illegally taking loans and not accounting for them, the [actions of the] President could, in theory, be included under Article 299 of the Penal Code, which typifies identity fraud. The situation is even more serious if one observes that this procedure was intensified during election year, with the deliberate purpose of deceiving the electorate. Hence it is possible to talk about electoral fraud.'') See talk page for translation discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caixa Econômica Federal and Banco do Brasil operated federal social programs under a government contract at this time. The government would pass the funds necessary to finance the programs through the {{Interlanguage link multi|Secretariat of the National Treasury|pt|3=Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional}} every month. They were obliged to transfer the equivalent values for the equalization of interest rates, expenditures and legal transfers covered under the contract. But the government had not made these reimbursements, and the contracted banks instead funded the programs using their own capital, capital that the government was obliged to reimburse them for, although no loans had been officially filed. The Fiscal Responsibility Law (Article 36) prohibits members of the federal government who control state financial institutions from borrowing from those institutions that they control.&lt;ref name= "SL101"/&gt; The total balance of these liabilities by the end of August 2014 was R$1.74&amp;nbsp;billion (US$740&amp;nbsp;million). Of the total R$7.8&amp;nbsp;billion (US$2.9&amp;nbsp;billion) spent on subsidies in these programs between 2009 and 2014, only R$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion (US$590&amp;nbsp;million) was transferred by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Request for impeachment, pg 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2014, Rousseff sent the Congress [[Bill (law)|PLN]] 362014, to change the {{Interlanguage link multi|Budgetary Directives Law|pt|3=Lei de diretrizes orçamentárias}} in order to modify the rules of the primary ''superavit'' (surplus), and hence showing her knowledge of the fiscal pedaling by taking steps to normalize the accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Request for impeachment, pg 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting in the Chamber committee===
A special committee formed in the Chamber of Deputies voted on 11 April 2016 on the petition's admissibility, at the same time that 37 of the 65 committee members were also facing charges of corruption or other crimes.&lt;ref name=LA/&gt; Testimony by the authors of the request was followed by Rousseff's defense. Meanwhile, street protests both for and against the impeachment occurred throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;

===Senate vote on suspension===
{{Expand section|date= May 2016}}
After it passed out of committee, the full lower house also voted in favor of impeachment, 367 for and 137 against, with 342 necessary for it to pass (7 abstaining, 2 absent).&lt;ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
A CNT/MDA poll published on 8 June 2016, indicated that only 11.3% of Brazilians approved while 28% disapproved of the acting government of President Temer. For 30.2% of respondents, Temer's government is ordinary, while 30.5% gave no answer. The survey also showed that 46.6% of Brazilians believed that the corruption in Temer's government could equal that in Rousseff's government. 28.3% believed that corruption could be less and the remaining 18.6% estimated that it could be even greater. Regarding the lawfulness of the process of impeachment, 61.5% agreed with the conduct of the process, 33.3% answered negatively and 5.2% didn't answer. CNT/MDA polled 2,002 people in 137 municipalities in 25 federative units between 2 and 5 June. CNT/MDA reported the poll as 95% reliable with a 2% margin of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An [[Ipsos]] poll in early July 2016 investigated what outcome most Brazilians were hoping for, with mixed results: 16% of Brazilians preferred Temer in office; 20% said that Rousseff should be acquitted and finish her four-year mandate; and 52% said that whoever assumed the presidency should call new elections for president. However, holding new elections would only be possible with a 3/5 majority in both houses of congress. Alternatively, both could have been removed from office, depending on the outcome of a lawsuit filed in the Superior Electoral Court by the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]], party of Aécio Neves, the defeated candidate in the 2014 presidential elections, whose suit alleged electoral crime by the political alliance of Rousseff-Temer involving donations from the companies implicated in Operation Car Wash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Impeachment trial==
After the Senate vote to suspend Rousseff's presidential powers and duties, subsequent procedure required new citations, new defense, appointing witnesses and producing evidence for preparation of the final report, which first of all had to be reviewed by a committee and then the entire Senate, each requiring a simple majority to confirm that the charges were well-founded. After that, the debate over conviction or acquittal began, requiring a two-thirds majority of the Senate, which proceedings were chaired by [[Ricardo Lewandowski]]. This eventually resulted in Rousseff's permanent removal, the appeal of which was denied by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:José Eduardo Cardozo CEI2016.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;José Eduardo Cardozo, lawyer who represented Rousseff]]

His 370-page filing said that the president had not committed the alleged crimes and that Rousseff's impeachment "was solely and exclusively aimed at ending Operation Car Wash." Cardozo submitted as evidence transcripts of a recorded telephone conversation between {{Interlanguage link multi|José Sérgio Machado|pt|Sérgio Machado (político e empresário)}}, former president of Petrobras subsidiary [[Transpetro]], and Senator [[Romero Jucá]], an influential politician in the PMDB. Published by the newspaper [[Folha de S. Paulo]], the conversation convinced Cardozo that the two were trying to prevent the investigation from widening, due to the risk to both of being caught up in it, and suggested that Rousseff's impeachment could have been part of an agreement aimed at preventing (and possibly later stopping) the Operation Car Wash investigations.{{cn|reason=allegations of criminality require a solid reference even though sourced.|date=May 2017}} Jucá's lawyer said that his client never thought to interfere in Operation Car Wash and that the dialogue did not suggest that he did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Committee meetings===

====Work plan and preliminary requests====
On 25 May 2016, Senator [[Antônio Anastasia]], ''[[rapporteur]]'' of the Special Committee of Impeachment 2016 (CEI 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Anastasia ruled against recorded telephone conversation between Machado and Jucá being introduced into evidence, ruling it irrelevant since the charges against Rousseff were fiscal responsibility crimes and the recording was only an informal conversation and proved nothing in law. Cardozo protested that the facts cited in the recording were a primary question of the investigation, and announced on 3 June that he would appeal the decision to the president of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 7 June, Lewandowski denied the appeal filed by Cardozo to append the recording of Sérgio Machado, citing a precedent that evidence of that type is confidential until the beginning of a formal investigation. Machado was arrested and introduced the recording of the conversation during his interrogation. The subject under appeal had been discussed in prior decisions of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At 2 June meeting, the Committee had established that eight witnesses would be heard for each of the six supplemental budget decrees against Rousseff, both for the prosecution and for the defense, i.e. a total of 48 witnesses for each side, with each decree considered separately. Nunes contended that the six decrees should be considered a single entity, to be added to the so-called "tax pedaling", so that the number of witnesses to be heard could be reduced to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Janaína Conceição Paschoal CEI2016.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Janaína Conceição Paschoal, prosecutor]]

On 8 June, the committee accepted a request by both defense and prosecution reducing to four the number of supplemental budget decrees to be considered in the trial. Thus, the number of witnesses in the process was reduced to forty. Since each charge entitled eight witnesses, the defense of Rousseff could introduce up to 32 witnesses for the four decrees and eight for the "tax pedaling" charge. The prosecution would be entitled to the same number. The decision to reduce the charges was supported by a report produced at the House of Representatives, which considered that two decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress were neutral from a fiscal perspective, once the primary sources and financial expenses listed in the documents were equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Oliveira, procurator of the [[Federal Court of Accounts]] (TCU), said that in April 2015 TCU identified the recidivist fiscal misconduct, so-called "tax pedaling", immediately rejected. There was no previous understanding to modify the rules and the consensus, and every time that the TCU has ruled, it had disapproved the conduct adopted by Rousseff.&lt;ref name= JMO/&gt; He reiterated that the President acted intentionally to borrow from public banks, and acted "coercively" in these operations.

Prosecution witnesses Tiago Alves de Gouveia Lins Dutra and Leonardo Rodrigues Albernaz, both TCU auditors, testified on 13 June. Tiago Dutra said that Rousseff created overdrafts with public banks in 2015 that had already observed in 2014. A TCU report indicated a delay of eleven months in transferring to banks an amount of R$2.6&amp;nbsp;billion, and five months in transferring R$3&amp;nbsp;billion related to the operations.

Former Executive Secretary of the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Luiz Cláudio Costa|pt|3=Luiz Cláudio Costa}}, former Assistant Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Wagner Vilas Boas, Assistant Secretary of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Education, Iara Ferreira Pinho, and Director of the Department of Economic Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Clayton Luiz Montes, all testified on 16 June. According to Luiz Claudio Costa, the supplemental budget decree for the Ministry of Education&lt;ref&gt;The supplemental budget decree for the Ministry of Education was one of the four decrees cited in the impeachment process against President Rousseff.&lt;/ref&gt; was important for the management, enabling several sectors linked to the Ministry, such as universities, institutes and others, to ensure their budget met immediate needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vilas Boas explained that it was not appropriate for the Ministry of Education to evaluate the impact of the credit opening for obtaining the primary balance target. He said that the sectorial authority – in this case the agencies of the Ministry – makes a request for supplemental budget, but that this is subject to policy guidance and technical supervision by the budget agency. Both, Wagner Vilas Boas and Iara Pinho, said they could not give an opinion on the compatibility of the signed supplementary decrees and the current fiscal target since their functions don't allow them to conduct an analysis of the achievement of the target. Concerning these statements, the prosecution pointed out that the technicians were not able to explain specifically the possible crime of responsibility. "The witnesses left show that they are unaware the facts. Our claim is that the evidence shall be excused," said prosecution lawyer, Janaína Paschoal, after the testimony of Iara Pinho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nelson Barbosa said that the additional credit decrees issued by President Rousseff from June to August 2015 did not prevent the fulfillment of the fiscal target approved by Congress in early 2015 and, since it was a supplemental credit that had no impact on the target, was not considered a target of primary balance, but to give more autonomy to the allocation of a value already available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 28 June were heard {{Interlanguage link multi|Maria Fernanda Ramos Coelho|pt}}, former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Agrarian Development; [[Aldo Rebelo]], former Ministry of Defence; [[Luís Inácio Adams]], former [[Attorney General of Brazil|General's Office attorney]]; and Antônio Carlos Stangherlin Rebelo, who was responsible for analysis of supplemental credits on the [[National Justice Council]]. Maria Fernanda said that the delay in the payment of interest rate equalization of the Plan Safra (government's plan to support agriculture) for 2015, did not configure a credit operation, since the non-compliance was not subject to penalty payment in the contract terms. According to former Secretary, the values were only monetarily adjusted. The prosecution lawyer Janaína Paschoal rejected the claims of Maria Fernanda and said that the remuneration per {{Interlanguage link multi|interest rate SELIC|pt|3=taxa SELIC}} (a benchmark interest rate of the Brazilian economy) is a proof that there was a credit operation. The prosecution reiterated that this statement confirmed the infringement materially, she concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The witness hearings ended on 29 June. A total of 44 witnesses were heard, six convened by prosecution and 38 by the defense.
At the end of the witnesses hearings phase, both the prosecution and the defense lawyers said they were confident of their respective theses. Prosecution lawyer Janaína Paschoal criticized the actions of Rousseff's defense because of the large number of witnesses called. Defense lawyer José Eduardo Cardozo also expressed confidence, but said that the process had political undertones and that this might interfere with the result. He also pointed out that some senators refused to question the witnesses because there was already a predetermined outcome prior to the completion of work.&lt;ref name= "final hearings"/&gt;

====Auditors' report====
The board of experts designated at 13 June session, by committee president Raimundo Lira, was heard on 5 July. This board had audited the documents, as requested by the defense and authorized by Lewandowski. They found that the delays in the transfer of payments to the public banks did indeed constitute loans. However, they avoided considering whether the President intended this and said that this judgement should be made by the senators. Also heard were the assistant to the prosecution, Selene Péres Nunes and the assistant to the defense, Ricardo Lodi Ribeiro. Nunes said that there was willful misconduct by the President, since the operations had been concealed via the accounting and the fact that the government had later issued a [[provisional measure]] allowing payment of the debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

#Vote by senators.

====Cross-examination of witnesses====
On 25 August, the prosecution called two witnesses, Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, procurator of the TCU, and author of the report recommending the rejection of the 2014 accounts, and Antonio Carlos Costa D'avila Carvalho Júnior, auditor of the TCU. Oliveira was questioned as an expert, not as an evidentiary, witness, as ruled by Lewandowski, after Cardozo accused Oliveira of making a report based on a biased understanding. He denied this, saying that he only fulfilled a recommendation to adopt a "less tolerant" rule that came from TCU. Oliveira asserted that Rousseff broke budget laws in 2014 and also in 2015. In his status as informant, his complaints could not be considered as evidence, but as technical information.

The next prosecution witness questioned, D'Avila Carvalho, asserted that Rousseff "disguised" the accounting and was responsible for delaying transfers to state banks. Cardozo tried to disqualify this witness, accusing him of bias because he had helped Oliveira to draft the TCU report, "clearly an unethical situation that violates the principle of impartiality." However, Lewandowski overruled this motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File: Dilma Rousseff impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Impeachment trial begins on 25 August 2016]]

Cross-examination continued the next day when the defense called six witnesses: 
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo|pt}}, economist, 
*Geraldo Luiz Mascarenhas Prado, legal advisor, 
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Luiz Cláudio Costa|pt|3=Luiz Cláudio Costa}}, former Secretary of the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]], 
*[[Nelson Barbosa]], former [[Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management|Minister of Planning, Budget and Management]]
*Esther Dweck, former Secretary of Federal Budget
*Ricardo Ribeiro Lodi, Law professor at the [[State University of Rio de Janeiro]]. 

Dweck was found by Lewandowski to have a conflict of interest, since she was being contracted for the office of [[Gleisi Hoffmann]], one of the senators opposed to impeachment. Gonzaga Belluzzo and Ribeiro Lodi testified as [[expert witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Belluzo said that removal of an elected official should require very special care and could only be done in extreme situations, and that the trial wasn't facing one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mascarenhas Prado said that in signing decrees Rousseff had relied on subordinates who vouched for the signings' legality, adding that she "was dismissed for issuing a decree to follow a determination of the National Justice Council".&lt;ref&gt;

Senator [[Cássio Cunha Lima]] refuted this, stating that the crime was not in the expansion of universities and technical schools, but in the lack of congressional authorization for the decrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Barbosa said that decrees provide more leeway for the administration of funds when the budget is limited, and are used by experienced officials. Pro-impeachment senators insisted that the decrees had aggravated the economic crisis facing the country. Barbosa countered that the crisis was due to various internal and external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

She also compared the effort to impeach her to the torture she endured after agents of the military dictatorship arrested and jailed her as an [[Dilma Rousseff#Guerrilla activity, 1968–69|urban guerrilla]]. Rousseff called the impeachment proceedings a new type of coup and evoked the breakdown of Brazilian democracy in the 1960s before the military coup. Senator [[Ana Amélia Lemos]] in reply expressed respect for her personal history but said that the senators were not there to judge her biography, but the actions of her government. She said Rousseff had broken the law by manipulating the budget to hide economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Lawsuits against the Senate judgment====
Rousseff's defense on 1 September 2016 filed a [[writ of mandamus]] with the Supreme Court against the Senate decision to remove her from office,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 September, the defense filed a last appeal of the impeachment. A 493-page piece called for an annulment.

On the other hand, the parties PSDB, [[Democrats (Brazil)|DEM]] and [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|PPS]] also decided to file a ''[[mandamus]]'' at the Supreme Court against the Senate's decision to vote separately on the loss of political rights during the impeachment trial, thereby allowing the former President to later run for public office, as opposed to the laws defining crimes of responsibility and regulating the respective trial process (''impeachment law''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Reactions ===

====International reaction====
In May 2016, just after Senate voted to suspend Rousseff's presidential powers. A [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] editorial voiced support for Rousseff's concerns about the integrity and possible ulterior motives of the politicians who voted for her impeachment, though it considered her defense "debatable".&lt;ref name="nyted"&gt;{{cite news

On 22 August, about a week before the impeachment vote, the Brazilian Senate submitted a letter to the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in response to a complaint from PT, that the impeachment process was an "institutional coup". OAS asked for information about this complaint and the Brazilian Senate stated in the letter that "the constitutional rules were strictly observed, objections raised, and appeals to the Supreme Court were accepted."&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Sentença proferida contra os réus do levante e conjuração de Minas Gerais. Autos da Devassa da Conjuração Mineira.jpg|thumb|Judgment handed down against the defendants, 1792.]]
'''Inconfidência Mineira''' ({{IPA-pt|ĩkõfiˈdẽsiɐ miˈnejɾɐ}}; "[[Minas Gerais]] Conspiracy") was an unsuccessful [[separatist movement]] in [[Brazil]] in 1789. It was the result of a confluence of external and internal causes in what was then a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[colony]]. The external inspiration was the [[History of the United States (1776–1789)|independence]] of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen of the British colonies]] in North America following the [[American Revolutionary War]], a development that impressed the intellectual elite of particularly the [[Captaincies of Brazil|captaincy]] of [[Minas Gerais]]. The main internal cause of the conspiracy was the decline of [[gold mining]] in that captaincy. As [[gold]] became less plentiful, the region's gold miners faced increasing difficulties in fulfilling [[tax]] obligations to the crown. When the captaincy could not satisfy the royal demand for gold, it was burdened with an additional tax on gold, called ''derrama''.

Conspirators seeking independence from Portugal planned to rise up in rebellion on the day that the ''derrama'' was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inconfidência Mineira|url=http://www.suapesquisa.com/historiadobrasil/inconfidencia_mineira.htm|publisher=Inconfidência Mineira|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the conspirators lacked both well-formed plans and an overall leader. Some of the conspirators were [[Republicanism|republicans]], others were [[monarchism|monarchists]]. Some favored the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition]] of [[slavery]], while others judged abolition as impractical at that time. The conspirators did put forth a few economic and social ideas: the promotion of [[cotton]] production, the exploitation of [[iron]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] reserves, a proposal to give incentives to mothers to have many children, and the creation of a citizens' [[militia]].

The conspiracy attracted a great number of military personnel, priests, and intellectuals, as well as the poets [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]] and [[Tomás Antônio Gonzaga]] (1744–1807?). Among the best known participants were [[Tiradentes|Joaquim José da Silva Xavier]], best known as "Tiradentes"; José Álvares Maciel, philosopher and chemistry student; and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco de Paula Freire de Andrade (1756–1792) of the regiment of [[dragoons]]. Tiradentes, who came from Andrade's regiment, was the independence movement's most enthusiastic propagandist.

==Conspirators==

The Inconfidência was inspired by the ideals of the [[france|French]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the successful [[American Revolution]] of 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inconfidência Mineira|url=http://www.suapesquisa.com/historiadobrasil/inconfidencia_mineira.htm|publisher=suapesquisa|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conspirators largely belonged to the white upper class of minerals-rich [[Minas Gerais]]. Many had studied in Europe, especially in the [[University of Coimbra]], and some had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the ''derrama'') was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. The conspirators wanted to create a [[republic]] in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be [[São João del Rei]], and [[Ouro Preto]] would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the [[right to property]] and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact. Eventually, three participants in the independence movement revealed the conspirators' plans to the government, and the rebels were arrested in 1789. Among the movement were the lawyer [[Alvarenga Peixoto]], the poets [[Tomás Antônio Gonzaga]] and [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]], the priest José da Silva de Oliveira Rolim, and the ''[[alférez (rank)|alferes]]'' [[Joaquim José da Silva Xavier]] (a.k.a. "Tiradentes"). After [[Joaquim Silvério dos Reis]] (1756–1792), a member of the conspiracy, informed on the movement before it could take place, Peixoto was captured, arrested, and sent to [[exile]] in the city of [[Ambaca]], in [[Portuguese Angola]], another colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], where he remained until the end of his life.

==Aftermath==
Judicial proceedings against the conspirators lasted from 1789 to 1792. Lieutenant Colonel Freire de Andrade, [[Tiradentes]], José Álvares Maciel, and eight others were condemned to the [[gallow]]s. Seven more were condemned to perpetual [[banish]]ment in [[Africa]], the rest were acquitted. Following the trial [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] the sentences of [[capital punishment]] to perpetual banishment for all except those whose activities involved aggravated circumstances. That was the case for Tiradentes, who took full responsibility for the conspiracy movement and was imprisoned in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he was hanged on 21 April 1792. Afterwards, his body was torn into pieces, which were sent to [[Vila Rica]] in the captaincy of Minas Gerais, to be displayed in the places where he had propagated his revolutionary ideas. The anniversary of his death is celebrated as a [[public holiday|national holiday]] in Brazil.

In 1948 the events were portrayed in a film ''[[Minas Conspiracy (film)|Minas Conspiracy]]'' directed by [[Carmen Santos]].

In 1963, Minas Gerais incorporated as its state flag the one designed by the Inconfidência, with an [[equilateral triangle]] inspired by the [[Holy Trinity]] – albeit supposedly the inconfidentes wanted a green triangle, while Minas' flag uses a red one – and a Latin motto taken out of [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.gov.br/governomg/portal/c/governomg/conheca-minas/5661-nossos-simbolos/26841-bandeira/5146/5044 Minas Flag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215093901/http://www.mg.gov.br/governomg/portal/c/governomg/conheca-minas/5661-nossos-simbolos/26841-bandeira/5146/5044 |date=2012-12-15 }}, Minas Gerais Government {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Monitoring Team (IMT)''' is a monitoring team composed of 60 members headquartered in [[Cotabato City]], [[Mindanao]] of the Philippines to monitor the implementation of peace between the [[Government of the Philippines]] (GPH) and one of the largest rebels in the region, the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) in the [[Moro conflict]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18279">A '''jobless recovery''' or '''jobless growth''' is an economic phenomenon in which a [[macroeconomy]] experiences [[economic growth|growth]] while maintaining or decreasing its level of [[employment]].  The term was coined by the economist Nick Perna in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=INDUSTRY ADOPTS POLITICAL PLANKS FOR NEW DEAL WAR; OLD ORDER IS UPHELD|url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/%22jobless+recovery%22/since1851/allresults/1/allauthors/oldest/|accessdate=10 November 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=6 December 1935|quote=Pay Articles from December 1935 Part 7 - Site Map - The New York ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/10/jobless-recovery-the-new-normal.asp|title=Jobless Recovery: The New Normal Since 1990 {{!}} Investopedia|last=Smith|first=Lisa|date=2010-08-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Economists are still divided about the causes and cures of a jobless recovery: some argue that increased [[productivity]] through [[automation]] has allowed [[economic growth]] without reducing [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16990700|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2010-09-09|title=Automatic Reaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists state that blaming automation is an example of the [[luddite fallacy]]&lt;ref name="easterly"&gt;{{cite book |last=Easterly |first=William |authorlink=William Easterly |title=The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics |year=2001 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn=0-262-55042-3 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that jobless recoveries stem from structural changes in the labor market, leading to unemployment as workers change jobs or industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci9-8.html |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York |title=Has Structural Change Contributed to a Jobless Recovery? |author=Erica L.

Some have argued that the recent lack of job creation in the United States is due to increased [[industrial consolidation]] and growth of [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1003.lynn-longman.html Who Broke America’s Jobs Machine? Why creeping consolidation is crushing American livelihoods.], by Barry C. Lynn and Phillip Longman, ''[[Washington Monthly]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is twofold: firstly, small businesses create most American jobs, and secondly, small businesses have more difficulty starting and growing in the face of entrenched existing businesses (compare [[infant industry argument]], applied at the level of industries, rather than individual firms).

In addition to employment growth, population growth must also be considered concerning the perception of jobless recoveries. Immigrants and new entrants to the workforce will often accept lower wages, causing [[Underemployment equilibrium|persistent unemployment]] among those who were previously employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Camerota Ph.D.|first=Stephen A.|title=A Jobless Recovery?: Immigrant Gains and Native Losses|url=https://cis.org/node/245|publisher=[[Center for Immigration Studies]]|accessdate=2 March 2014|date=October 2004|quote=Between March of 2000 and 2004, the number of unemployed adult natives increased by 2.3 million, while the number of employed adult immigrants increased by 2.3 million.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peri|first=Giovanni|title=Immigration, Labor Markets, and Productivity|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj32n1/cj32n1-4.pdf|publisher=Cato Journal, Vol. 32, No. 1 (Winter 2012).|accessdate=2 March 2014|quote=In this case firms pay immigrants less than their marginal productivity, increasing the firms’ profits.

Surprisingly, the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) does not offer data-sets isolated to the working-age population (ages 16 to 65).&lt;ref name="BLS POP vs EMP"/&gt; Including retirement age individuals in most BLS data-sets may tend to obfuscate the analysis of employment creation in relation to population growth.&lt;ref name="Boomers BLS"/&gt; Additionally, incorrect assumptions about the term, Labor force, might also occur when reading BLS publications, millions of employable persons are not included within the official definition. The Labor force, as defined by the BLS,&lt;ref name="BLS Labor Force"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm#L|work=Labor Force|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2 March 2014|quote=Labor force (Current Population Survey) The labor force includes all persons classified as employed or unemployed in accordance with the definitions contained in this glossary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a strict definition of those officially unemployed (U-3),&lt;ref name="BLS Underutilization"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic News Release|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm|work=HOUSEHOLD DATA Table A-15.

 |quote  = Once again, the baby-boom generation has become a generator of change, this time in its retirement. Moreover, the jobless recovery of the 2001 recession, coupled with the severe economic impact of the 2007–2009 recession, caused disruptions in the labor market. In the first 12 years of the 21st century, the growth of the population has slowed and labor force participation rates generally have declined. As a result, labor force growth also has slowed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the next 10 years will bring about an aging labor force that is growing slowly, a declining overall labor force participation rate, and more diversity in the racial and ethnic composition of the labor force.
 |source = [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ''Monthly Labor Review'', December 2013.&lt;ref name="Boomers BLS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Toossi|first=Mitra|title=Labor force projections to 2022: the labor force participation rate continues to fall|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/article/pdf/labor-force-projections-to-2022-the-labor-force-participation-rate-continues-to-fall.pdf|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|accessdate=1 March 2014|format=PDF|date=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table and included chart depicts year-to-year employment growth in comparison to population growth for those persons under 65 years of age. As such, [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]] retirements are removed from the data as a factor for consideration. The table includes the Bureau of Labor Statistics, [[Current Population Survey]], for the [[Civilian noninstitutional population]] and corresponding Employment Levels, dating from 1948 and includes October 2013, the age groups are 16 years &amp; over, and 65 years &amp; over.&lt;ref name="BLS POP vs EMP"/&gt; The working-age population is then determined by subtracting those age 65 and over from the Civilian noninstitutional population and Employment Levels respectively. Isolated into the traditional working-age subset, growth in both employment levels and population levels are totaled by decade, an employment percentage rate is also displayed for comparison by decade.

When examined, by decade, the first decade of the 2000s, the United States suffered a 95% jobless rate when compared to the added working age population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25317">'''Land reform in Vietnam''' began in the political turmoil following [[World War II]] in which a civil war pitted the communist [[Viet Minh]] against the [[France|French]] colonists and their supporters.  At that time a large percentage of agricultural land was owned by large landowners and the majority of the rural population of Vietnam owned only small plots of land or was landless.  The early success of the [[land reform]] program of the Viet Minh (and their successors, the [[Viet Cong]]), gave the communists a strong base of support among the 80 percent of the Vietnamese people who lived in rural areas. The support of the communists by a large number of rural dwellers was an important factor in determining the outcome of the [[Vietnam War]].

From 1954 to 1975 land reform was on two separate tracks as the country was provisionally divided into two parts: [[South Vietnam]] (The Republic of Vietnam) and [[North Vietnam]] (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam).  Communist North Vietnam and its southern supporters, the Viet Cong, early adopted a policy of confiscating the land of landlords and rich [[peasant]]s and distributing it to poor and landless peasants and later organizing the rural population into collectives.   Capitalistic South Vietnam failed in several land reform endeavors before finally achieving some success with a "Land to the Tiller" program in the early 1970s. The conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam in 1975 ended that program.

Vietnam expert [[Bernard Fall]] said land reform in South Vietnam was as essential to success in the [[Vietnam War]] as "ammunition for [[howitzer]]s."  South Vietnam's ally and financial supporter, the [[United States of America|United States]], either failed to realize the importance of land reform or failed to persuade the South Vietnamese government of its importance. In the words of an American official, "The Americans offered the peasant a constitution; the Viet Cong offered him his land and with it the right to survive."&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. (Aug 1970), "Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam: The Tables Turn," ''Asian Survey'', Vol 10, No 8, p. 751. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Land reform in North Vietnam]] was accomplished from 1954 to 1956 by confiscating and redistributing land owned by landlords to poor and landless peasants.  This program resulted in executions of "landlords and reactionaries," estimated most reliably at 13,500 killed, and resistance, including rioting, in the countryside.  The North Vietnamese government apologized for the excesses and attempted to rectify errors. The communist government of North Vietnam (and after 1975 all of Vietnam) followed up land redistribution by establishing collective farms, but collectivized agriculture failed to result in large gains in agriculture production. Collectives were abandoned after 1988 and agricultural production rose rapidly thereafter.

==French rule==

During the period of [[France|French]] rule of [[French Indochina|Indochina]] (1887-1954) Vietnam consisted of three regions: [[Tonkin]]—the rice-growing area of the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]] valley of northern Vietnam; [[Cochinchina]]—the rice-growing area of the [[Mekong Delta]] of southern Vietnam; and [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]—the connective between the two regions, consisting of a narrow coastal plain and highlands. Tonkin and Annam had difficulty growing enough rice to feed their population and often imported rice from Cochinchina which produced a surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, Edward E. (1983), ''Land Reform in China and North Vietnam'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:North and south vietnam map.jpg|200px|right|North and South Vietnam from 1954 to 1975.]]

Under French rule, French citizens and Vietnamese supporters of the French (mostly [[Roman Catholic]]s), were granted large tracts of land, confiscated or obtained in some manner from its  traditional occupants and owners.  In southern Vietnam, the production of industrial crops for export, notably [[rubber]], began on a large scale.  Vietnam was managed by the French primarily to produce revenue which was attained by exports, taxation and government monopolies.  By the 1930s, one result of French economic exploitation was a serious problem of unequal land distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Cima, Ronald J. ''Vietnam: A Country Study'', Washington: GPO, 1987. http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/16.htm and http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm, accessed 16 Sep 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 80 percent of the population of Vietnam was rural and depended upon agriculture for a livelihood. About one million families—40 percent of the rural population of southern Vietnam—were landless tenants.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. (Nov 1967), "Land Reform in South Vietnam: A Proposal for Turning the Tables on the Viet Cong,'' ''Cornell Law Review, Vol. 53, http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol53/iss1/3, accessed 16 Sep 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Vietnam about 21 percent of the rural population was landless and another 35 percent owned only very small parcels of land.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a total population of Vietnam of around 25 million in 1940, 7 or 8 million people were probably landless peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Cima, http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/16.htm, accessed 16 Sep 2015&lt;/ref&gt;   The country's richest agriculture region, the Mekong delta, was considered one of the five worst areas in the world for the prevalence of landlessness and tenancy among its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. (1970), "Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam: The Tables Turn," ''Asian Survey'', Vol 10, No. 8, p. 753. Downloaded from JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

For the more than 70 percent of the population in the Mekong Delta who were landless or rented land to supplement their small holding, "Rentals were as heavy as any to be found in Asia -- 50 percent of the crop.  The tenant had to provide his own hut, tools, and livestock, and hire supplementary labor at the height of the season....By the time the tenant had discharged all his obligations, his share of the crop was roughly a third of the total."&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman (1967), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Viet Minh==

The Viet Minh—Vietnamese independence movement—fought to gain independence from France after World War II.  They were the dominant political force in many of the rural areas of Vietnam, especially in the north where the French presence was less that in the south.  In 1948, the Viet Minh initiated a modest program of reducing the rent peasants paid to landlords, although they were careful not to offend large landowners and landlords who supported the revolution.  The Viet Minh confiscated land owned by French nationals, "traitors." and landlords who fled to the cities to avoid the civil war in rural areas. The redistributed land was allocated to poor and landless peasants, but the Viet Minh retained control of the ownership of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 155-159&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar [[Jeffrey Race]], who did a grassroots study of the people in one Mekong Delta province, said that "no other [Communist] Party activities had such an immediate and profound impact...the promise of land being one of the principal means of obtaining a core of activists in each village to drive out the government authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Race, Jeremy (1972), ''War Comes to Long An'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 126-128&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the Viet Minh, now in control of 60 to 90 percent of the rural areas of Vietnam, took a bolder approach to expand the land redistribution programs in what was called the rectification movement. They continued the rectification movement after Vietnam was provisionally divided into South Vietnam and North Vietnam as a result of the [[Geneva Accord (Vietnam)|Geneva Accord]] of 1954.  The land reforms carried out in North and South Vietnam bifurcate after 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Vietnam==
{{Main|Land reform in South Vietnam}}
Landlords and rich peasants owned a greater percentage of land in South Vietnam, especially in the rich agricultural land of the Mekong Delta, than in North Vietnam.  Prior to the provisional separation of North and South Vietnam, emperor [[Bao Dai]] in 1953 responded to the Viet Minh program of land redistribution and rent reduction with a decree declaring that rents for land should not exceed 15 percent of the crop.  The decree was unenforceable and rendered null by a failing colonial government and, in any case, contained loopholes that could have been exploited by landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman (1967), p. 27-29&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1954, South Vietnam's ally, the United States, advised the new government of South Vietnam, headed by [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], to undertake "indispensable reforms" including land reform. In response on 8 January 1955, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 2, which capped rental of land at 25 percent of production.  In 1956, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 57 which forbade ownership by an individual of more than {{convert|100|ha|acre}} of rice land and prescribed the conditions and terms under which the excess land expropriated from the rich could be transferred to less-wealthy farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Wurfel, David (Jun 1957), "Agrarian Reform in the Republic of Vietnam," ''Far Eastern Survey'', Vol 26, No. 6, p. 82-83. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the program the government acquired {{convert|422000|ha|acre}} from 1958 to 1961 and distributed {{convert|244000|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dacy, Douglas C. (1986), ''Foreign aid, war, and economic development: South Vietnam 1955-1975,'' Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The land redistributed thus comprised less than 10 percent of the 7.5 million acres of cultivated land in South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman (1967), p. 35; Tyson, James L. (1973), "Land Reform in Vietnam: A Progress Report," ''Asian Affairs'', Vol. l, No. 1, p. 36. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The land reform program implemented under Ordinance 57 was unpopular in the countryside.  The Viet Minh had already divided up the land -- "fairly," in the words of one official.&lt;ref&gt;Race, Jeffrey (1972), ''War Comes to Long An'', Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The government's program was less generous to the majority of farmers than had been the Viet Minh redistribution of land in areas which it controlled.  The amount of land that individuals were permitted to retain was large, farmers were required to pay for land they acquired under the program, and the program was riddled with corruption and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer C., Ed. (1998), ''Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Many rural people believed that the United States army and the government of South Vietnam were on the side of the landlords.  Military operations by the U.S. and South Vietnamese armies to clear communist insurgents from an area would often result in landlords reclaiming land previously abandoned or confiscated and redistributed by the Viet Minh or Viet Cong.

Ordinance 57 resulted in the reverse of what was the objective of land reform advocates: large landowners and landlords increased their influence, especially in the important rice-growing area of the Mekong Delta.&lt;ref&gt;Wurfel, pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance remained in effect until 1970, but was largely unutilized after 1960 as the [[Viet Cong]] insurgents took control or disputed government control of most of the rural areas of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Dacy, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land-to-the-Tiller.''' In 1967, land reform expert [[Roy Prosterman]] revived the idea of land reform in South Vietnam.  Drawing on experience in other countries, Prosterman proposed a "land-to-the-tiller" program to compete "with the Viet Cong for the allegiance of the peasants."  The plan had two main features: (1) all agricultural land in South Vietnam was to be owned by the farmers actually tilling the land, including land previously distributed by the Viet Cong and (2) landlords would be compensated fully for the land taken from them with payment guaranteed by the United States.  Prosterman estimated that the land-to-the-tiller program could be accomplished at a cost of $900 million—less than the Vietnam War was costing the United States each month.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman (1967), pp. 26-44&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 1970, with the Vietnam War still underway, the government of South Vietnam began implementation of the Land-to-the-Tiller program, similar to what Prosterman had proposed. The reform aimed to expropriate land from landlords not personally cultivating the land and giving it to tenant farmers; the landlords were compensated. Individual land holding was limited to 15 hectares. Legal title was extended to peasants who lived in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom land had previously been given by the [[Viet Cong]].&lt;ref name=prosterman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prosterman|first=Roy L.|title=Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam : The Tables Turn|journal=Asian Survey|date=August 1970|volume=10|issue=8|page=751|url=http://staff.washington.edu/sherrye/project/documents/landToTheTiller.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2013|doi=10.1525/as.1970.10.8.01p0027v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S.President [[Richard Nixon]] gave his support to new land reform measures in June 1969 in the [[Midway Atoll|Midway]] communiqué, judging it favorable to the [[vietnamization]] of the conflict.&lt;ref name=prosterman /&gt; In total, the United States financed $339 million of the total $441 million the reform cost.&lt;ref name=brocheux&gt;{{cite book|last=Brocheux|first=Pierre|title=Du conflit d'Indochine aux conflits indochinois|year=2000|publisher=Complexe|location=Bruxelles|isbn=9782870278116|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"By all accounts, the program was highly successful," in the words of one scholar.  By the end of 1973, 953,000 land titles had been distributed to poor or landless farmers and 1,198,000 hectares of land—nearly 40 percent of cultivated land in South Vietnam—had been distributed.  By the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the U.S. estimated that land tenancy had practically disappeared in South Vietnam and that the living standard of farmers had increased by 30 to 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Dacy, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Land-to-the-Tiller program "failed to have a decisive impact [on the Vietnam War] because it was too little, too late."&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, David (2003), ''The Vietnamese War: Revolution and Social Change in the Mekong Delta, 1930-1975,'' New York: Routledge, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;

The rectification campaign begun by the Viet Minh revolutionaries continued under the communist government of North Vietnam from 1954 to 1956. In characteristic communist fashion, the government divided the farmers into social classes: landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants, and landless or nearly landless laborers.  In North Vietnam about one-fourth of agricultural land was owned communally and allocated by the village or hamlet leaders to individual farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Moise (1983), pp. 159-166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land Reform Law of 4 December 1953 called for (1) confiscation of land belonging to landlords who were enemies of the regime; (2) requisition of land from landlords not judged to be enemies; and (3) purchase with payment in bonds.  The land reform was carried out from 1953 to 1956 in five "waves," each larger that the previous and extending to most of the good agricultural land of North Vietnam. Some farming areas did not undergo land reform but only rent reduction and the highland areas occupied by minority peoples were not substantially impacted.  Some land was retained by the government but most was distributed without payment with priority given to Viet Minh fighters and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Moise (1983), pp. 178-181&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of rural people impacted by the land reform program was more than 4 million.  The rent reduction program impacted nearly 8 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Szalontai, Balazs (2005), "Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955-1956", ''Cold War History,'' Vol. 5, No. 4, p. 401. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; North Vietnam had a total population of approximately 15 million people in 1955.

'''Results.'''The land reform program was a success in terms of distributing much land to poor and landless peasants and reducing or eliminating the land holdings of landlords and rich peasants.  However it was carried out with violence and repression primarily directed against large landowners identified, sometimes incorrectly, as landlords. On 18 August 1956, North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] acknowledged the serious errors the government had made in the land reform program. Too many farmers, he said, had been incorrectly classified as "landlords" and executed or imprisoned and too many mistakes had been made in redistributing land.

Severe rioting protesting the excesses of the land reform program broke out in November 1956 in one largely-Catholic rural district.  About 1,000 people were killed or injured and several thousand imprisoned.  North Vietnam initiated a "correction campaign" which by 1958 had resulted in the return of land to many of those harmed by the land reform.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, pp. 237-268&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those imprisoned were released.
 
'''Executions.''' Executions and imprisonment of persons classified as "landlords" or enemies of the state were contemplated from the beginning of the land reform program.  A [[Politburo]] document dated 4 May 1953 said that executions were "fixed in principle at the ratio of one per one thousand people of the total population." That ratio would indicate that communist Vietnam contemplated the execution of about 15,000 "reactionaries and evil landlords" in carrying out the program.&lt;ref&gt;"Politburo's Directive Issued on May 4, 1953, on some Special Issues regarding Mass Mobilization," ''Journal of Vietnamese Studies,'' Vol. 5, No. 2 (Summer 2010), p. 243. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of persons actually executed by communist cadre carrying out the land reform program has been variously estimated. Some estimates of those killed range up to 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lam Thanh Liem (2005), "Ho Chi Minh's Land Reform: Mistake or Crime," http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/vietnam/landreform.html, accessed 4 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Author Bernard Fall estimated executions at 50,000.  Other scholarship has concluded that the higher estimates were based on political propaganda emanating from South Vietnam and that the actual total of those executed was probably much lower.  Scholar Edwin E. Moise estimated the total number of executions at between 3,000 and 15,000 and later came up with a more precise figure of 13,500.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, pp. 205-222; "Newly released documents on the land reform", ''Vietnam Studies Group'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20110420044800/http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html link], accessed 3 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Moise's conclusions were supported by documents of Hungarian diplomats living in North Vietnam at the time of the land reform.&lt;ref&gt;Balazs, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Author Michael Lind in a 2013 book gives a similar estimate of "at least ten or fifteen thousand" executed.&lt;ref&gt;Lind, Michael (2003), ''Vietnam: The Necessary War'', New York: Simon and Schuster, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the correction campaign as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Szalontai, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collective farming==

The ultimate objective of the land reform program of the North Vietnamese government, which became the government of all Vietnam in 1975, was not to achieve equitable distribution of farmland but rather the organization of all farmers into co-operatives in which land and other factors of agricultural production would be owned and used collectively. Farmers to whom land given in the land reform program did not receive title to the land.  The ultimate ownership of the land remained with the State.&lt;ref&gt;Moise, pp. 155-159&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steps after the 1953-1956 land reform were the encouragement by the government of labor exchanges in which farmers would unite to exchange labor; secondly in 1958 and 1959 was the formation of "low level cooperatives" in which farmers cooperated in production.  By 1961, 86 percent of farmers were members of low-level cooperatives. The third step beginning in 1961 was to organize "high level cooperatives", true collective farming in which land and resources were utilized collectively without individual ownership of land. Workers received points for the quality and quantity of work they performed and the points accumulated were used to compute the share each member received of the cooperative's profit or production. This point system deteriorated into a system in which shares were computed only on the basis of hours worked, with no benefit accruing to farmers on the basis of the quality of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Kerkvliet, Bendedict J.

By 1971, the great majority of farmers in North Vietnam were organized into high-level cooperatives.  In former South Vietnam after 1975, however, the collectivization movement was much slower to be implemented.  By 1986, more than 90 percent of farmers in former North Vietnam were organized into cooperatives; by contrast only 5. 9 percent of farmers in the Mekong Delta (Vietnam's "rice bowl") of former South Vietnam were members of cooperatives.  Redistribution of land, begun under the South Vietnamese government, continued with each adult receiving 0.1 to 0.15 hectares and each minor child or elder person receiving .08 to .1 hectare of land.  Collectivization efforts notwithstanding, the family farm remained the basis of agriculture in the Mekong Delta.&lt;ref&gt;Pingali and Vo-Tong Xuan, pp 700-704&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolishment of collective farms==

Rice production per capita under collectivization remained stagnant in northern Vietnam and declined in southern Vietnam. This decline was attributed by scholars to uncertainty and opposition to the attempted collectivization of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Pingali and Vo-Tong Xuan, p. 706&lt;/ref&gt; Rice production usually comprises more than 90 percent of total grain production in Vietnam and in 1978 rice production bottomed out at 9,790,000 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Kenneth B, Wailes, Eric J, Cramer, Gail L., and Nguen Tri Khiem (2002), "Vietnam's Rice Economy: Development and Prospects", ''Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station'', Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas, http://arkansasagnews.uark.edu/968.pdf, accessed 5 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform of the collective farm system began in 1981 in which farmers were permitted to sell their agricultural production after meeting a required level of output for the state. This was a shift from a fixed wage system to a fixed rent system of production.  Although initially production of rice and other crops increased as a result, the government still controlled the distribution of inputs and dictated land use and crop choices. In 1988, to further stimulate agricultural production, the government adopted Resolution 10, which ended most characteristics of the collective farm system. Regulation 10 enabled farmers to lease land from the government for up to 20 years, thus providing security of tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Pingali and Vo-Tong Xuan, pp 706-707&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the government further liberalized the agricultural sector with the adoption of the Land Law which gave land holders the rights of "exchange, transfer, inheritance, lease, and mortgage" of their leased land, The reforms were successful.  Rice production in Vietnam rose from 15,103,000 metric tons in 1987 to 32,554,000 metric tons in 2000. In 1989, Vietnam became a net exporter of rice and later became one of the largest rice exporters in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''et al'', pp. 7, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Left-wing politics''' supports [[social equality]] and [[egalitarianism]], often in opposition to [[social hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=T.

The political terms "Left" and "[[Right-wing politics|Right]]" were coined during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), referring to the seating arrangement in the French [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]]: those who sat on the left generally opposed the [[monarchy]] and supported the revolution, including the creation of a [[republic]] and [[secularization]],&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]]. Use of the term "Left" became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815 when it was applied to the "Independents".&lt;ref&gt;''Realms of memory: conflicts and divisions'' (1996), ed. Pierre Nora, "Right and Left" by Marcel Gauchet, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "wing" was appended to Left and Right in the late 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.europeandefenceleague.com/the-left/|title=The Left|date=2017-06-13|work=European Defence League|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with disparaging intent and "left-wing" was applied to those who were unorthodox in their religious or political views.

The term was later applied to a number of movements, especially [[republicanism]] during the French Revolution in the 18th century, followed by [[socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Maass|first2=Howard|last2=Zinn|title=The Case for Socialism|quote=The ''International Socialist Review'' is one of the best left-wing journals around...|page=164|publisher=Haymarket Books|edition=Revised|year=2010|isbn=978-1608460731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[communism]], [[anarchism]] and [[social democracy]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Schmidt|first2=Lucien|last2=Van der Walt|title=Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism|series=Counter-Power|volume=1|publisher=AK Press|year=2009|page=128|quote=[...] anarchism is a coherent intellectual and political current dating back to the 1860s and the First International, and part of the labour and left tradition|isbn=978-1-904859-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term left-wing has been applied to a broad range of movements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean Francois|last=Revel|title=Last Exit to Utopia|quote=In the United States, the word liberal is often used to describe the left wing of the Democratic party.|page=24|publisher=Encounter Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1594032646}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[civil rights movements]], [[feminist movement]]s, [[anti-war movement]]s and [[environmental movement]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eric|last=Neumayer|title=The environment, left-wing political orientation, and ecological economics|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=51|year=2004|issue=3–4|pages=167–175|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.06.006|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/714/1/EE_51%283-4%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Barry|title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|quote=All surveys confirm that environmental concern is associated with green voting...[I]n subsequent European elections, green voters have tended to be more left-leaning...the party is capable of motivating its core supporters as well as other environmentally minded voters of predominantly left-wing persuasion...|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2002|isbn=978-0415202855}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a wide range of parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/Fleisher/courses/econ508winter06/docs/Democratic_socialism.pdf|title=Democratic socialism|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=3 June 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902085146/http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/Fleisher/courses/econ508winter06/docs/Democratic_socialism.pdf|archivedate=2 September 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/05/green-party-left-uk-politics-caroline-lucas|title=Green party to position itself as the real left of UK politics|author=Fiona Harvey|journal=The Guardian|date=2014-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarnold"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=N.

[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|left|287px|5 May 1789, opening of the [[Estates General of 1789]] in Versailles]]

In politics, the term "Left" derives from the [[French Revolution]], as the anti-monarchist [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] deputies from the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the presiding member's chair in parliament, a habit which began in the French [[Estates General of 1789]]. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century in France]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right]] was between supporters of the French [[Republic]] and those of the [[monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Andrew|last2=Wright|first2=Vincent|title=The government and politics of France|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-415-35732-6|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} The [[June Days Uprising]] during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was an attempt by the Left to assert itself after the [[1848 Revolution (France)|1848 Revolution]], but only a small portion of the population supported this.

In the mid-19th century, [[nationalism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]] and [[anti-clericalism]] became features of the French Left. After [[Napoleon III]]'s [[French coup of 1851|1851 coup]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], [[Marxism]] began to rival radical republicanism and [[utopian socialism]] as a force within left-wing politics. The influential ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'' by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], published in 1848, asserted that all human history is the history of [[class struggle]]. They predicted that a [[proletarian]] revolution would eventually overthrow [[bourgeois]] [[capitalism]] and create a [[classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]], post-monetary [[communist society]]. It was in this period that the word "wing" was appended to both Left and Right.&lt;ref name="oed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107000?redirectedFrom=left-wing#eid|title=Home: Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=''Oxford English Dictionary''|date=|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, many leftists, [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] and [[trade unionist]]s were influenced by the works of [[Thomas Paine]], who introduced the concept of [[asset-based egalitarianism]], which theorises that [[social equality]] is possible by a redistribution of resources.

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (1864–1876), sometimes called the First International, brought together delegates from many different countries, with many different views about how to reach a classless and stateless society. Following a split between supporters of Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]], anarchists formed the [[International Workers' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=Demanding the Impossible — A History of Anarchism|page=9|publisher=Fontana Press|location=London|year=1993|isbn=978-0-00-686245-1|title-link=Demanding the Impossible}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second International]] (1888–1916) became divided over the issue of [[World War I]]. Those who opposed the war, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], saw themselves as further to the left.

In the United States after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the phrase "the Left" was used to describe those who supported trade unions, the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[anti-war movement]].&lt;ref name="Van Gosse 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Gosse|title=The Movements of the New Left, 1950–1975: A Brief History with Documents|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4039-6804-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=JoAnne C.|last=Reuss|title=American Folk Music and Left-Wing Politics|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8108-3684-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in the United States, left-wing and right-wing have often been used as synonyms for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], or as synonyms for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thepage.time.com/2009/03/03/steele-to-gop-fight-for-coleman/?xid=rss-page|title=Steel to gop fight for Coleman|work=Time|date=3 March 2009|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96256/Is_it_Spains_place_to_investigate_Gitmo|title=Is it Spain's place to investigate Gitmo?|publisher=''The Week''|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reported in ''Mother Jones'', 29 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,5982337.story|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Study finds left-wing brain, right-wing brain|date=10 September 2007|accessdate=2 May 2010|first=Denise|last=Gellene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
The following positions are typically associated with left-wing politics.

=== Economics ===
Leftist economic beliefs range from [[Keynesian]] economics and the [[welfare state]] through [[industrial democracy]] and the [[social market]] to [[nationalization]] of the economy and [[Planned economy|central planning]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Glyn, ''Social Democracy in Neoliberal Times: The Left and Economic Policy since 1980'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-19-924138-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] advocacy of a council- and assembly-based self-managed [[anarchist communism]]. During the [[industrial revolution]], leftists supported [[trade union]]s. At the beginning of the 20th century, many leftists advocated strong government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beinhocker|first1=Eric D.|title=The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics|date=2006|publisher=[[Harvard Business Press|Harvard Business School Press]]|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-1-57851-777-0|page=316|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=eUoolrxSFy0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Beinhocker#PPA416,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leftists continue to criticize what they perceive as the exploitative nature of [[globalization]], the "[[race to the bottom]]" and unjust lay-offs. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the belief that government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the people) ought to be directly involved in the day-to-day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the [[center-left]], especially [[social democrat]]s who became influenced by "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" ideology.

Other leftists believe in [[Marxian economics]], which are based on the economic theories of [[Karl Marx]]. Some distinguish Marx's economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx's approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of revolutionary [[socialism]] or his belief in the inevitability of [[proletarian]] revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neo-Marxian Schools|publisher=The New School|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neomarx.htm|accessdate=23 August 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234151/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neomarx.htm|archivedate=16 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munro|first=John|title=Some Basic Principles of Marxian Economics|publisher=University of Toronto|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~munro5/MARXECON.htm|accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics does not exclusively rely upon Marx, but it draws from a range of Marxist and non-Marxist sources. The "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]" or "[[workers' state]]" are terms used by some Marxists, particularly [[Leninist]]s and [[Marxist–Leninist]]s, to describe what they see as a temporary state between the [[capitalist]] state of affairs and a [[communist society]]. Marx defined the proletariat as salaried workers, in contrast to the [[lumpenproletariat]], who he defined as outcasts of society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat|title=Lumpenproletariat|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political relevance of farmers has divided the left. In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx scarcely mentioned the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939251-2,00.html|title=Communists: Marxism Fails on the Farm|journal=Time|date=13 October 1961|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]] believed that it would be rural peasants, not urban workers, who would bring about the proletarian revolution.

[[Left-libertarian]]s, [[libertarian socialist]]s and [[anarchist]]s believe in a [[decentralized]] economy run by [[trade union]]s, [[workers' council]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[Municipality|municipalities]] and [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] and oppose both [[State ownership|state]] and [[Private property|private]] control of the economy, preferring [[social ownership]] and local control, in which a nation of decentralized regions are united in a [[confederation]].

The [[global justice movement]], also known as the [[anti-globalization movement]] or [[alter-globalization]] movement, protests against [[Corporation|corporate]] [[economic globalization]] due to its negative consequences for the poor, workers, the environment and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, ''A Movement of Movements'', New York: Verso, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krishna-Hensel|first=Sai|year=2006|title=Global Cooperation: Challenges and Opportunities in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Juris&gt;{{cite book|last=Juris|first=Jeffrey S.|year=2008|title=Networking Futures: The Movements against Corporate Globalization|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4269-4|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, environmentalism became an increasing concern of the left, with social movements and some unions campaigning over environmental issues. For example, the left-wing [[Builders Labourers Federation]] in [[Australia]], led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place [[Green Bans]] on environmentally destructive development projects.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Burgman, ''Green Bans, Red Union: Environmental Activism and the New South Wales Builders Labourers' Federation'', UNSW Press, Sydney, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Some segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged environmentalism and anti-capitalism into an [[eco-socialist]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Commoner]] articulated a left-wing response to ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred environmentalism, postulating that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, B., ''[[The Closing Circle]]'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation can be seen as a class or equity issue, as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf|title=Poor Bear Burden of Industrialisation|work=[[Blacksmith Institute]]|date=19 October 2007|accessdate=16 April 2016|author=Sanra Ritten|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184856/http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several left-wing or socialist groupings have an overt environmental concern and several green parties contain a strong socialist presence. For example, the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] features an eco-socialist group, [[Green Left (UK)|Green Left]], that was founded in June 2005. Its members held some influential positions within the party, including both the former Principal Speakers [[Siân Berry]] and Dr. [[Derek Wall]], himself an eco-socialist and Marxist academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gptu.net/gleft/greenleft.shtml|title=Green Left homepage|publisher=Gptu.net|accessdate=13 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311004501/http://gptu.net/gleft/greenleft.shtml|archivedate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, some [[Green left]] political parties combine traditional social-democratic values such as a desire for greater economic equality and workers rights with demands for environmental protection, such as the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left|Nordic Green Left]].

Well-known socialist [[Bolivian President]] [[Evo Morales]] has traced [[environmental degradation]] to [[consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/7qwmpn/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-president-evo-morales|title=President Evo Morales|work=[[The Daily Show]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=25 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923114559/http://www.cc.com/video-clips/7qwmpn/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-president-evo-morales|archivedate=23 September 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said: "The Earth does not have enough for the North to live better and better, but it does have enough for all of us to live well".

=== Nationalism and anti-nationalism ===
{{see also|Internationalism (politics)|Left-wing nationalism|Proletarian internationalism}}
The question of [[nationality]] and [[nationalism]] has been a central feature of political debates on the Left. During the French Revolution, nationalism was a policy of the Republican Left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote="An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Left advocated [[civic nationalism]]&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; and argued that the nation is a "daily plebiscite" formed by the subjective "will to live together". Related to "revanchism", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaurès]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barrès]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the "blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the "[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), Léon Gambetta (republican) and [[Eugène Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group. After the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism instead became increasingly associated with the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: "[[Workers of all countries, unite!]]", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.

Proletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Szporluk, Roman. ''Communism and Nationalism''. 2nd. Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; [[racism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last=Solomos|first2=Les|last2=Back|title=Marxism, Racism, and Ethnicity|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=1995|volume=38|issue=3|pages=407–420|doi=10.1177/0002764295038003004|url=http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/solomos.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.602.5843}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[anti-Semitism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|title=Anti-Jewish Pogroms|work=Speeches On Gramophone Records|publisher=|year=1919|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[religion]] as [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them. Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black &amp; Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of "[[Socialism in One Country]]" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the "[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (К вопросам ленинизма). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international "[[permanent revolution]]". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.

European social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.

[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]]. Some left-wing groups in the developing world – such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Naxalites]] in India – argue that the First World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Religion ===
{{see also|Political science of religion|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist socialism|Christian left|Jewish left|Islamic socialism}}
The original French left-wing was [[anti-clerical]], opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; [[Karl Marx]] asserted that "[r]eligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. 1976. ''Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right''. Collected Works, vol. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In Soviet Russia, the [[Bolshevik]]s originally embraced "an ideological creed which professed that all religion would atrophy" and "resolved to eradicate [[Christianity]] as such". In 1918, "ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot" and "children were deprived of any religious education outside the home".&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Today in the [[Western world]] those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].

However, religious beliefs have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].

Other left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.

=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===
{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}
[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. "[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'." (page 40).&lt;/ref&gt; [[women's suffrage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], as well as support for legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], [[cognitive liberty]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]] and the right of women to choose [[abortion]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives, such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.

Various [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the "[[New Left]]". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The United States New Left is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "Old Left".

The New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed "The Establishment" and became known as "anti-Establishment". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as "substitutionism", which was what they saw as the misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could "substitute" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by their contemporaries. Feminist pioneer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was influenced by the radical thinker [[Thomas Paine]]. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality such as the Marxists [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]; anarchists such as [[Virginia Bolten]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]]; and the socialists [[Helen Keller]] and [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campling|first1=Valerie Bryson.

The [[women's liberation movement]] is closely connected to the New Left and other [[new social movements]] that challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. [[Socialist feminism]], as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]]; and [[Marxist feminism]], as with [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the Left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]] and the left wing of mainstream American politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).

The connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Daniel Guérin]] among others.

== Varieties ==
The spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].

In several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Cosseron, Serge (ed.). ''Le dictionnaire de l'extrême gauche''. Paris: [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], 2007. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines left-wing extremism as groups that want "to bring about change through violent revolution rather than through established political processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf|title=Leftwing Extremists Increase in Cyber Attacks|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=3 June 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419052505/http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf|archivedate=19 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the term "[[Chinese New Left]]" denotes those who oppose the current [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] and favour the restoration of more socialist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/74029202-a389-11da-83cc-0000779e2340,s01=1.html|title=China launches 'New Deal' for farmers|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world]], the term New Left refers to cultural politics. In the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1980s, the term "[[hard left]]" was applied to supporters of [[Tony Benn]], such as the [[Campaign Group]] and those involved in the ''[[Labour Briefing|London Labour Briefing]]'' newspaper, as well as Trotskyist groups such as [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] and the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1054337.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Benn's golden anniversary|date=4 December 2000|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, the term "[[soft left]]" was applied to supporters of the [[British Labour Party]] who were perceived to be more moderate. Under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], the British Labour Party rebranded itself as [[New Labour]] in order to promote the notion that it was less left-wing than it had been in the past. One of the first actions of the Labour Party leader who succeeded them, [[Ed Miliband]], was the rejection of the "New Labour" label. However, Labour's voting record in parliament would indicate that under Miliband it had maintained the same distance from the left as it had with Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26743802|work=BBC News|title=MPs approve annual welfare cap in Commons vote|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=John Kampfner|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/labour-back-on-the-right|title=Labour's return to the right|journal=The Guardian|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the election of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as Labour Party leader was viewed by some as Labour turning back toward its socialist roots.

Leftist [[postmodernism]] opposes attempts to supply universal explanatory theories, including Marxism, deriding them as [[Meta-narrative|grand narratives]]. It views culture as a contested space and via [[deconstruction]] seeks to undermine all pretensions to absolute truth. Left-wing critics of post-modernism assert that [[cultural studies]] inflates the importance of culture by denying the existence of an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=59issue%3D105|title=International Socialism: Postmodernism, commodity fetishism and hegemony|publisher=Interet Archive|date=|accessdate=3 June 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125104930/http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=59issue%3D105|archivedate=25 November 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html|title=Noam Chomsky on Post-Modernism|publisher=Internet Archive|date=|accessdate=3 June 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030421013324/http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html|archivedate=21 April 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[physicist]] [[Alan Sokal]] wrote a [[Sokal Affair|nonsensical article]] entitled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|publisher=NYU Physics Department|date=|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''[[Social Text]]'' published the paper in its Spring/Summer 1996 issue, whereupon Sokal publicly revealed his hoax. While this action was interpreted as an attack upon leftism, Sokal (who was a committed supporter of the [[Sandinista]] movement in [[Nicaragua]] during the 1980s) intended it as a critique from within the left.&lt;ref name="physics.nyu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies|publisher=NYU Physics Department|author=Alan D. Sokal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal said he was concerned about what he saw as the increasing prevalence on the left of "a particular kind of nonsense and sloppy thinking [...] that denies the existence of objective realities". Sokal also called into question the usefulness of such theories to the wider left movement, saying he "never understood how [[deconstruction]] was meant to help the working class".&lt;ref name="physics.nyu.edu"/&gt;{{relevance inline|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">The '''Lesotho Liberation Army''' ('''LLA''') was a guerrilla movement in [[Lesotho]], formed in the mid-1970s and connected to both the anti-[[Apartheid]] [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA). It was the armed wing of the [[Basutoland Congress Party]] (BCP), a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political party founded in 1952, which opposed the regime of Prime Minister [[Leabua Jonathan]].

The BCP won the first free [[Lesotho general election, 1970|elections in 1970]], but the ruling [[Basutoland National Party]] declared a state of emergency, annulling the election, dissolving parliament and suspending the constitution. The BCP launched a failed uprising in the government in 1974, which caused [[Ntsu Mokhehle]] to go into exile, from which he led the "external" faction of the BCP and the new armed wing, the Lesotho Liberation Army. The new guerrilla movement was closely connected to the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan-Africanist Congress]] (PAC), a South African militant opposition group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|chapter=Lesotho|title=Compendium of Elections in Southern Africa|url=http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/lesotho-authoritarian-rule-1970-1991-extracted-lesotho-compendium-elections-southern-africa||editor1-last=Lodge|editor1-first=Tom|editor2-last=Kadima|editor2-first=Denis |editor3-last=Pottie|editor3-first=David|publisher=[[Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa]]|pages=92–93|date=2002|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potlako Leballo]], a co-founder of the BCP back in 1952, was a prominent leader to the PAC and its armed wing, and largely responsible for its turn towards [[Maoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bolnick|first=Joel|date=September 1991|title=Potlako Leballo – the Man Who Hurried to Meet his Destiny|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2161572 |journal=[[Journal of Modern African Studies]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=29|issue=03|pages=413–442|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the Azanian People's Liberation Army received 178 [[Sotho people|Basotho]] migrant miners as recruits, who would form the basis of the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA). They were trained in [[Libya]], where the government of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] provided training to the APLA. These recruits were put under the leadership of Matooane Mapefane, who was a senior instructor of the APLA in Libya. The movement was deeply fractured from the start, with factional infighting among the recruits and a lack of discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosenberg|first1=Scott|last2=Weisfelder|first2=Richard F.|date=2013|title=Historical Dictionary of Lesotho|location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]]|page=252|isbn=081-087-982-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first LLA attacks began in May 1979, with a bombing targeting the country's main post office. In 1979 Mokhehle claimed to, in addition to the Libyan-trained troops, possess 500–1000 guerrillas based in the deep mountains of Lesotho. Fighting with the government was intense in 1979–1980, and terrorist attacks by the LLA were frequent over the next few years, with incidents such as the laying of land mines, bombings, mortar attacks, and drive-by shootings. Targets included the [[Leribe Airport]], the [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton Hotel]], policemen, politicians, petroleum and electricity infrastructure, a [[United States]] cultural center, and the [[West Germany|West German]] ambassador's car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jongman|first=Albert J.|date=1988|title=Political Terrorism: A New Guide To Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, And Literature|location=[[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]]|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|page=611|isbn=141-281-566-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanlon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanlon|first=Joseph|date=1986|title=Beggar Your Neighbours: Apartheid Power in Southern Africa|location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|pages=110–111|isbn=085-255-307-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Jonathan, previously a close ally of the Apartheid government in South Africa, gradually started straying from its fold, eventually going as far as aiding the [[African National Congress]]. In response, [[P. W. Botha]] is said to have funded the LLA, despite the massive ideological differences, and allowed the guerrillas to pass through South African territory.&lt;ref name="Hanlon"/&gt; Despite this association, the connection to the Pan-Africanist Congress wasn't cut. A brother of the leading ANC member [[Thabo Mbeki]], Jama (who was involved with the PAC), was killed in Lesotho in 1982 while attempting to assist the LLA. After increased conflict between Lesotho and South Africa, Jonathan was overthrown in a military coup led by [[Justin Lekhanya]], who is alleged to have accidentally funded the LLA after being subjected to a scam.

Ntsu Mokhehle was allowed to return to Lesotho in the early 1990s for peace talks, and the Lesotho Liberation Army was disbanded after the reunification of the Basutoland Congress Party's different factions. The party subsequently won the [[Lesotho general election, 1993|1993 general elections]], and Mokhehle became Prime Minister.

Every election from 1871 to 1986 elected a portion of its MLAs in multi-member constituencies, usually two-member constituencies. Voters in these districts had as many votes as there were seats (block-voting), and generally the party with the most supporters in the district filled all the seats, with no representation left for the others. This generally helped ensure the sitting government's capture of the most seats. (It also makes the "popular vote," the votes cast, not  truly reflective of the sentiment of the voters, due to some voters casting two (or more votes) and others only one.)

Until the 1903 election, British Columbia politics were officially non-partisan – political parties were not part of the official process.&lt;ref name="1871–1986#2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871–1986 |work=Elections British Columbia |publisher=Queen's Printer for British Columbia |location=Victoria |format=pdf |page=6 |date=1988 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first parties to be noticed in BC politics, the Nationalist Party espoused "National Socialism", based on Edward Bellamy's writings, and favoured nationalization of industry. Its candidate Robert Macpherson was elected MLA in 1894 and 1898. &lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of British Columbia, p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

The general non-partisanship changed in the 1898 and 1900 elections with the official listing of party candidates, and federal political parties were recognized in the provincial election of 1903.&lt;ref name="Electoral_History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/index.php/resource-centre/electoral-history-of-bc/ |title=Electoral History of BC |work=Elections BC |publisher=Office of the Legislature of British Columbia |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first elections held along party lines (1903–41) were primarily contested by the [[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative Party]] (which won five elections during this period) and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] (which won six elections). 

For two sessions during and immediately after [[World War II]], the legislature was managed by a coalition government between the Conservatives and the Liberals. The [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]] dominated elections from 1952–86, winning eleven of the twelve elections (the single exception a NDP victory). Provincial politics since 1986 have been dominated by the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) which won both elections held in the 1990s, and by the Liberal Party, which won the 2001 provincial election and the next three elections.

A minority NDP government elected in 2017, supported by the [[Green Party of British Columbia|Greens]], is now in power in BC.

==Absentee voting==
Contemporary elections in British Columbia use a relatively unique system of handling [[absentee ballot]]s.&lt;ref name=absentee&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/absentee-voting-explained-1.4108548 "Absentee voting explained: why B.C. election results won't be final until at least May 22"]. [[CBC News]], May 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; While all jurisdictions in Canada allow for absentee voting through advance communication with the appropriate federal or provincial election agency, British Columbia is unique in allowing same-day absentee voting at any polling station in the province; ballots so cast are not counted locally on election night, however, but are sent to the voter's home riding and counted two weeks after election day.&lt;ref name=absentee/&gt; One important effect of this is that a particularly close race, such as the nine-vote margin that initially separated the main candidates in [[Courtenay-Comox]] in the [[British Columbia general election, 2017|2017 election]], may not have a winner officially declared until the absentee ballots have been counted at the later date;&lt;ref name=absentee/&gt; as well, because the absentee vote tends to favour the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] rather than the [[BC Liberal Party]],&lt;ref name=cosh&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-b-c-s-election-outcome-is-still-uncertain-and-its-all-thanks-to-their-bizarrely-generous-voting-system "Colby Cosh: B.C.’s election outcome is still uncertain. And it’s all thanks to their bizarrely generous voting system"]. ''[[National Post]]'', May 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; a district narrowly won by the Liberals has a higher chance of being flipped by absentee voters than a narrow NDP win does.&lt;ref name=cosh/&gt; 

The system exists both to serve commuters in the [[Greater Vancouver Area]], where requiring people to vote at home frequently forced suburban districts to cope with sudden crowds of late voters at the end of the day, pushing past poll closing time and delaying the counting of the results in those areas, and because the province has a much higher than normal proportion of people who work away from home for long periods in remote [[natural resources]] sites.&lt;ref name=cosh/&gt;

==Summary of results==
The table below shows the total number of seats won by the major political parties at each election since the recognition of political parties in British Columbia provincial elections in 1903.&lt;ref name="1987–2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2002–2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1871–1986#3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871–1986 |work=Elections British Columbia |publisher=Queen's Printer for British Columbia |location=Victoria |format=pdf |pages=91, 99, 109, 115, 123, 139, 149, 159, 173, 183, 193, 203, 213, 221, 243, 265, 275, 285, 293, 303, 311, 321, 331, 339 &amp; 349 |date=1988 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning party's total is shown in bold.

Prior the 1903 election, political parties in British Columbia were not officially recognized in provincial elections. During this period, some candidates declared their support for the administration as "Government" candidates, while those not in support ran as "Non-Government" or Independent candidates. However, these pre-election alignments often did not persist once the House was seated as allegiances would frequently shift.&lt;ref name="1871–1986#2" /&gt;

While there were no official party lines, there were unofficial yet unstable ones. Premiers [[Amor De Cosmos]] and [[Joseph Martin (Canadian politician)|Joseph Martin]] both sat, at various times, in the federal House of Commons as Liberals, while Premier [[Edward Gawler Prior]] sat in the House of Commons as a Conservative. There was also a clear grouping of members who would often sit in opposition to, or in the cabinet of, certain other premiers. De Cosmos and his unofficial Liberals mutually supported each other (i.e. were in each other's cabinets). These premiers included [[John Foster McCreight|McCreight]], [[George Anthony Walkem|Walkem]], [[Robert Beaven|Bevean]], [[Charles Augustus Semlin|Semlin]], and Martin. Meanwhile, Premiers Prior, [[James Dunsmuir|Dunsmuir]], [[John Herbert Turner|Turner]], [[Alexander Edmund Batson Davie|A.E.B. Davie]], [[John Robson (politician)|Robson]], [[Theodore Davie]], [[William Smithe|Smithe]], and [[Andrew Charles Elliott|Elliot]] sat in each other's cabinets or otherwise supported one another; while premiers from one group often sat in opposition to premiers from the other.

Finding that the ability of the Marijuana Reform Party to submit [[petition]]s containing enough signatures to run candidates in statewide elections demonstrated that it enjoyed a modicum of support in the New York State electorate, in 2004 a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|federal appeals court]] ordered the New York state board of elections to recognize the Marijuana Reform Party, allow voters to enroll in it, and to tabulate and make available lists of voters enrolled in the party.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The Marijuana Reform Party was one of several minor parties that fulfilled a role almost unique to New York State politics. New York law allows [[electoral fusion]] &amp;mdash; a candidate can be the nominee of multiple parties and aggregate the votes received on all the different ballot lines.  Several other states allow fusion, but only in New York is it commonly practiced.  In fact, since each party is listed with its own line on New York ballots, multiple nominations mean that a candidate's name can be listed several times on the ballot.

'''Mark Douglas-Home''' (born 31 August 1951) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] author and journalist. He was the [[editing|editor]] of ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' newspaper in Scotland 2000–2005.

==Early life==
Douglas-Home was born on 31 August 1951. The son of Edward Charles Douglas-Home and Nancy Rose Straker-Smith, he was educated at [[Eton College]] and the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], where he was the editor of the then anti-[[apartheid]] student newspaper, ''[[Wits Student]]''.  (An unrepentant Douglas-Home was deported from [[South Africa]] in 1970 by the government of the day, following a series of anti-government cartoons that were deemed offensive by [[Pretoria]].)  He was a reporter for the ''[[North London Weekly Herald]]'', the ''[[Daily Express|Sunday Express]]'', and the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]''.  He went on to work as Scotland Correspondent for ''[[The Independent]]'', news editor and assistant editor for ''[[The Scotsman]]'', deputy editor of the ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', and editor of ''[[The Sunday Times Scotland]]''.

Douglas-Home was appointed editor of ''The Herald'', a nationally-circulated [[broadsheet]] [[newspaper]] in Scotland, in 2000.  During his tenure the paper introduced new daily themed magazines, and continued to sell more than ''The Scotsman''.  It was announced on  1 December 2005 that he was leaving the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/01/pressandpublishing2 |title=Glasgow Herald editor leaves |first=Claire |last=Cozens |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the months before this, budget cuts imposed on the paper by owners [[Newsquest]] and he had been resistant to these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/herald-editor-quits/ |title=Herald editor quits |first=Sarah |last=Lagan |work=Press Gazette |date=2 December 2005 |accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first novel, ''The Sea Detective'', was published by Sandstone Press in May 2011. A new edition was published by Penguin in November 2015. ''The Scotsman'' said it 'raises the bar' for Scottish crime fiction. The sequel, ''The Woman Who Walked Into The Sea'', was described as 'simply intoxicating' by the ''Library Journal'' in the USA.  The third in the series, ''The Malice of Waves'', was published in May 2016. As a journalist, he is best known for having been the [[editing|editor]] of ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' newspaper in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Information2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Information|first=CMP|title=Benn's media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ofgAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 June 2012|year=2004|publisher=Benn Business Information Services|isbn=9780863825545|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The noble title, the [[Earl of Home]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]], belongs to his family, and his cousin, [[David Alexander Cospatrick Douglas-Home, 15th Earl of Home|David Alexander Cospatrick Douglas-Home]] is the current holder. His uncle, the previous holder, was [[Alec Douglas-Home]], a former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].   He is married to Colette Douglas-Home, a psychotherapeutic counselor, who was formerly a journalist and columnist. The couple have two children called Rebecca Douglas-Home and Rory Douglas-Home.

{{Economic systems sidebar |Transition}}
'''Marketization''' or '''marketisation''' is a restructuring process that enables [[state enterprise]]s to operate as market-oriented firms by changing the legal environment in which they operate.&lt;ref&gt;Rolph van der Hoeven, György Sziráczki. ''Lessons from Privatization.'' (1997). International Labour Organization. {{ISBN|92-2-109452-9}} p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

This is achieved through reduction of state subsidies, organizational restructuring of management ([[corporatization]]), [[decentralization]] and in some cases partial [[privatization]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Vickerstaff. ''The Transformation of Labour Relations.'' (1998). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-828979-0}} p.63&lt;/ref&gt; These steps, it is argued, will lead to the creation of a functioning market system by converting the previous state enterprises to operate under market pressures as state-owned commercial enterprises.

==Aspects==

===Marketized solutions of government and market externalities===
Here the government seeks to solve market and government [[externality|externalities]] with market-based [[solution]]s rather than through direct administrative means. Supporters argue that the market externality of [[pollution]] can be addressed through the sale of pollution permits to companies and corporations, thus allowing the market to "see" the information and "realize" the harm done by allowing the market to transmit pollution [[cost]]s to [[society]]. This is presented as an alternative to direct administrative means, whereby the government would use command and control means to direct state enterprises and private firms to comply with the guidelines.

===Marketization of government branches===
This is often described as "competitive federalism" or "limited government". Proponents argue that markets perform better than government administration. Therefore, marketization seeks to make government agencies and branches compete with each other when government branches and agencies are absolutely necessary (i.e. remaining agencies and branches not privatized or liberalized away). For example, supporters argue that a [[voucher]] system for public education would make public schools compete with one another thus making them more accountable and efficient.

==Theory==
Critics of [[globalization]], [[privatization]], and [[liberalization]] have deemed that it is unworkable without major [[government regulation]]s to balance the forces involved. They argue that marketization can result in [[market failure]].

Free Market thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]], [[Friedman]] and [[von Mises]] believe markets can work with far less government regulation.  As they see it, the combination of liberalization, privatization, and marketization ensure that globalization fulfills the promises of peace, prosperity, and cooperation that its liberal scholars and philosophers have promised. Without marketization, supporters argue that government created externalities can distort the information available to the market which in turn makes the market not work as well as it could.

==Examples==
[[Milton Friedman]] offers examples of what marketized government solutions can look like.  Friedman's proposed [[school voucher|education voucher]] system promotes competition between public schools (and private) thus creating a market based solution to educational issues.
See [[Private prison]].

==Marketization of the nonprofit and voluntary sector==

===Overview of nonprofit organizations===
[[Nonprofit organizations]] came to fruition when people began to recognize that society had needs for services rendered by neither the government nor the private sector.  These organizations were created to address these needs.  However, due to their overall missions, it is frowned upon for these organizations to make a profit.  Therefore, by their very nature, their funding sources remain ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Child|first1=Curtis|title=Whither the Turn? The Ambiguous Nature of Nonprofits' Commercial Revenue|journal=Oxford Journals|date=September 2010|volume=89|issue=1|pages=145–161|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0058}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in nonprofits becoming resource dependent and continuing to struggle to find and maintain funding.  This struggle has resulted in marketization of NPOs.

====Rationale behind the marketization of nonprofits====
[[Commercialization]] or marketization (the terms are often used interchangeably in the marketization debate among scholars) occurs when a NPO decides to provide goods or services with the intent of turning a profit.  Nonprofits’ resource dependency often lead them to constantly look for additional, nonconventional for nonprofit, funding.  Factors behind a nonprofits decision to marketize are usually compounded by issues such as increased demand for services, inability to tax, and other funding sources’ inability to cover operational and service costs for the NPO.  In return, the NPO enters into a mixed marketplace and thus begins to compete either with other NPO’s or for-profit entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=Howard P.|title=Competition, Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175–194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2&lt;175::aid-pam4&gt;3.0.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding sources====
Nonprofit organizations have been notoriously plagued with funding issues since their inception. This is due largely in part to the basic concept of nonprofits: to provide a service that neither the government nor the private sector provides a population. Nonprofit organizations receive funding in three ways: 1. Public sources and subsidies; 2. Charitable giving, endowments, major donors; 3. Fee-based services and venture enterprises.

====Public sources and subsidies====
A public source refers to government assistance either through awarded grants or appropriated funding.  Prior to the 1960s, nonprofit organizations relied mostly on fee-for-services and charitable giving.  However, with the political climate changing significantly, it became apparent that society was using nonprofit organizations more than before.  Additionally, governmental entities realized that by entering into a public-private partnership, they could fund nonprofit organizations and essentially hire then to provide services that governments did not want to provide.  Nonprofit organizations began to apply and receive grant awards and appropriations for services.  This trend in funding began to decline in the 1980s under the Reagan administration. With the reduction in funding available from the federal government, nonprofits have become increasingly competitive amongst each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=Howard P.|title=Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175–194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2&lt;175::aid-pam4&gt;3.0.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, grant money often comes with performance measures or quotas that are required to meet in order to maintain funding.  Many nonprofits do not have either the administrative capacity to track this data or the ability to physically meet the performance measures.

====Charitable giving, endowments, and major donors====
Charitable giving, endowments and donations do play a significant role in funding for NPOs.  However, this still does not provide enough funding for NPOs to maintain sustainability and provide adequate services.

====Fee-for-services====
A fee-based service is not a new concept for nonprofit organizations. Prior to the 1960s, nonprofits quite often utilized a fee-for-service model.  This most commonly is seen in nonprofit hospitals.  Additionally, gift shops at museums are another form of revenue often associated with fee-for-service models.

===Perspectives on marketization: A pro/con discussion of current literature===
Literature related to the marketization of the nonprofit and [[voluntary sector]] is broad in scope and enhanced marketization of the sector is the subject of “considerable debate among both scholars and practitioners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=Matthew|title=Theorizing Nonprofit Organizations as Contradictory Enterprises: Understanding the Inherent Tensions of Nonprofit Marketization|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|date=2012|volume=26|issue=1|pages=179–185|doi=10.1177/0893318911423761}}&lt;/ref&gt; One side of the debate asserts potential positive effects from increased marketization and one side engages the idea that primarily negative effects are associated with the integration of commercial ideology within [[nonprofit organization]]s.

====Pro====
Marketization is seen by some to hold the ability to provide positive outcomes for nonprofit organizations. One such potential benefit is the diversification of revenue streams and enhanced financial stability. With commercial and market approaches gaining popularity as alternative or supplementary funding sources, their flexibility and less-restrictive nature as revenue sources are noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Froelich|first1=K.A.|title=Diversification of Revenue Strategies: Evolving Resource Dependence in Nonprofit Organizations|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=1999|volume=28|issue=3|pages=246–268|doi=10.1177/0899764099283002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portions of the literature surrounding nonprofit marketization also consider the positive effects that result from the aforementioned diversified and more sustainable collection of revenue streams.  The ability of market-associated activities to “contribute to an organization’s [[self sufficiency]] and ability to attract and retain staff” is discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Baorong|title=Charity for Profit? Exploring Factors Associated with the Commercialization of Human Service Nonprofits|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=2006|volume=35|issue=1|pages=123–138|doi=10.1177/0899764005282482}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency and effectiveness of organizations utilizing market-based revenue strategies are said to see potential enhancement “by reducing the need for donated funds, by providing a more reliable, diversified funding base”, or by enhancing the overall quality of programs “by instilling [[market discipline]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dees|first1=J. Gregory|title=Enterprising Nonprofits|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1998|pages=55–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Con====
Negative associations between marketization and the nonprofit sector are also present within the literature. One of the main criticisms brought forth against the integration of commercial principles and activities within voluntary organizations is the potential for diversion from the original organization mission. According to Tuckman, a “strong likelihood exists that the missions of nonprofits engaged in commercial activities will grow more ambiguous over time.” The potential tendency of leadership to increasingly look at activities in terms of revenue is also as a result of increased commercial activity is discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=H.P.|title=Competition, Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Public Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175–194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2&lt;175::aid-pam4&gt;3.0.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural organizational changes are also mentioned as a potential negative impact of enhanced commercial activity among nonprofits. From organizational changes necessary to accommodate market-based endeavors, such as growth in “number and scope” of administrative offices that manage profit-seeking efforts, to the “tendency to replace traditional, social problem-focused board members with entrepreneurial, business-oriented individuals,” changes take effort from work directly related to mission accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Froelich|first1=Karen|title=Diversification of Revenue Strategies: Evolving Resource Dependence in Nonprofit Organizations|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=1999|volume=28|issue=3|pages=246–268|doi=10.1177/0899764099283002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from diversion from mission and structural/staffing changes, the literature notes the potential for lost sector legitimacy as the “distinctions between the business, government, and nonprofit sectors continue to blur and their efforts overlap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frumkin|first1=Peter|title=On Being Nonprofit: A Conceptual and Policy Primer|date=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this blurring effect, is the theory that [[civil society]] is at risk as a result of enhanced marketization within the voluntary organizations. Eikenberry and Kluver, in their article entitled, “The Marketization of the Nonprofit Sector: Civil Society at Risk,” describes the idea that marketization trends negatively impact the unique roles nonprofit organizations play within society. Overall, this theory stands on the thesis that marketization “may harm [[democracy]] and [[citizenship]] because of its impact on nonprofit organizations’ ability to create and maintain a strong civil society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eikenberry|first1=Angela|title=The Marketization of the Nonprofit Sector: Civil Society at Risk?|journal=Public Administration Review|date=2004|volume=64|issue=2|pages=132–140|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsibility of nonprofits to those in need is said to become potentially overshadowed by economic and competition-centered values that result from enhanced market-based and commercial activities. Increased desire of voluntary organizations to “secure [[competitive advantage]] in the pursuit of producing individual-level goods and services for those who can afford them,” rather than those defined in the original organizational mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brainard|first1=Lori|title=Toward nonprofit organization reform in the voluntary spirit: Lessons from the Internet|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=2004|volume=33|issue=3|pages=435–457|doi=10.1177/0899764004266021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marketisation and existing Market Theory'''

In considering the applicability of the existing literature on contingency theory and perspectives on competitive advantage to the marketised social care sector in the UK, Dearnaley identified a number of areas in each that restrict its value in analysing and responding to the new market environment: the retrospective nature of theories of competitive advantage and foci on differentiation and cost leadership make these inappropriate for this new marketplace; the intangibility of competitive advantage, and particularly sustainable competitive advantage; the relative inflexibility of classical contingency theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patricia Dearnaley|date=2013-06-07|title=Competitive advantage in the new contrived social care marketplace: how did we get here?|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/HCS-03-2013-0002|journal=Housing, Care and Support|volume=16|issue=2|pages=76–84|doi=10.1108/HCS-03-2013-0002|issn=1460-8790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patricia Dearnaley|date=2013-09-09|title=Competitive advantage in the new contrived social care marketplace: do we need a new theoretical framework?|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/HCS-08-2013-0013|journal=Housing, Care and Support|volume=16|issue=3/4|pages=126–135|doi=10.1108/HCS-08-2013-0013|issn=1460-8790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dearnaley Patricia|date=2014-03-12|title=Competitive advantage in the new social care marketplace: a new theoretical perspective|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/HCS-12-2013-0025|journal=Housing, Care and Support|volume=17|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1108/HCS-12-2013-0025|issn=1460-8790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Armenia|expanded=age4}}

The '''occupation of Western Armenia''' by the [[Russian Empire]] during [[World War I]] began in 1915  formally ended by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. It was sometimes referred to as the '''Republic of Van'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrera|first=Hayden|title=Arshile Gorky: His Life and Work|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781466817081|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aya|first=Şükrü Server|title=The genocide of truth|year=2008|publisher=Istanbul Commerce University Publications|location=Eminönü, Istanbul|isbn=9789756516249|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Defense of Van, Parts 1-2|year=1980|publisher=Central Executive General Society of Vasbouragan|page=125|author=Onnig Mukhitarian, Haig Gossoian}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Armenians, because the occupation imitated in [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. [[Aram Manukian]] of [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] was the ''de facto'' head until July 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: Foreign Dominion to Statehood'', edited by Richard G. Hovannisian.&lt;/ref&gt; It was briefly referred to as "Free [[Vaspurakan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Robert-Jan Dwork Holocaust: A History by Deborah and van Pelt, p 38&lt;/ref&gt; After a setback beginning in August 1915, it was re-established in June 1916. From December 1917, it was under [[Special Transcaucasian Committee|Transcaucasian Commissariat]], with [[Hakob Zavriev]] as the Commissar, and during the early stages of the establishment of [[First Republic of Armenia]], it was included with other [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians|Armenian National Councils]] in a briefly unified Armenia.

This provisional government relied on [[Armenian volunteer units]], forming an administrative structure after the Siege of Van around April 1915.  Dominant representation was from the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]. Aram Manukian,  or "Aram of Van," was the administration's most famous governor.

==Population distribution==
During the [[Defense of Van (1915)|Siege of Van]], there were between 67,792 (according to the 1914 Ottoman population estimates) and 185,000 Armenians (according to the Armenian Patriarch's 1912 estimate) in the [[Van Vilayet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenianhouse.org/bryce/treatment/654-670-annexe.html "The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire 1915-1916" by JAMES VISCOUNT BRYCE, London, T. Fisher Unwin Ltd., 1916]&lt;/ref&gt; In the city of Van itself there were around 30,000 Armenians, but more Armenians from surrounding villages joined them during the Ottoman offensive.

[[File:Turkey in Asia, 1909.jpg|thumb|left|6 Armenian provinces of [[Western Armenia]]. Patten, William and J.E. Homas, Turkey in Asia (with 6 Armenian provinces of Western Armenia), 1903.]]

=== Formation, 1915 ===
The conflict began on April 20, 1915, with Aram Manukian as the leader of the resistance, and it lasted for two months.  In May, the Armenian battalions and Russian regulars entered the city and drove the Ottoman army out of Van.&lt;ref name="Van Resistance"&gt;{{cite book |first = Mihran | last = Kurdoghlian | title = Hayots Badmoutioun (Armenian History) | publisher = Hradaragutiun Azkayin Oosoomnagan Khorhoortee, Athens | pages = 92–93 | year = 1996 |language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Departure from Van ====
July was the second month of self-government under the leadership of Manoukian. Then, the conflict turned against the Armenians.  The Ottoman Army, under Pasha Kerim, launched a counterattack in the Lake Van area and defeated the Russians the [[Battle of Manzikert (1915)|Battle of Malazgirt]] and the [[Battle of Kara Killisse (1915)|Battle of Kara Killisse]].

The Russians retreated eastward. There were as many as 250,000 Armenians crowded into the city of Van.&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire" pp.314-316,&lt;/ref&gt; These people were the escapees from the deportations established by the [[Tehcir Law]]; included were also many who broke away from the deportation columns, as they passed the vicinity on their way to Mosul.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Armenians from this region retreated to the Russian frontier.&lt;ref name="NarrativeofVan"&gt;A.S. Safrastian "Narrative of Van 1915" Journal ''Ararat'', London, January, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

During the counterattack, Manoukian and [[Sampson Aroutiounian]], president of the [[Armenian National Council of Tiflis|Armenian National Council]] of [[Tbilisi]], helped refugees from the region to reach [[Echmiadzin]].&lt;ref name="Echmiadzin"&gt;Arnold Toynbee, ''The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916: Documents Presented to Viscount,'' p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of famine and fatigue, many refugees suffered from diseases, especially [[dysentery]].&lt;ref name="Echmiadzin"/&gt; On 29 December 1915, the [[Dragoman]] of the Vice-Consulate at Van, according to the Armenian Bishop of Erevan and other sources, was able to procure the Caucasus refugees from the region.&lt;ref name="return"/&gt;

==== Return to Van ====
During the winter of 1915, the Ottoman forces retreated once again, which enabled Aram Manukian to return to Van and re-establish his post.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;Arnold Joseph Toynbee "The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916: Documents Presented to Viscount" the section : "MEMORANDUM ON THE CONDITION OF ARMENIAN REFUGEES IN THE CAUCASUS: ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The governor declared strict measures to prevent pillage and destruction of property in December 1915. Some [[threshing machine]]s and [[Gristmill|flour mills]] resumed work in the district so that bakeries could reopen, and the restoration of buildings commenced in some streets.&lt;ref name="return"/&gt;

=== Expansion, 1916 ===
At the turn of 1916, Armenian [[refugee]]s returned to their homes, but the Russian government raised barriers in prevention.&lt;ref name="page31"&gt;Garegin Pasdermadjian, Aram Torossian, "Why Armenia Should be Free: Armenia's Rôle in the Present War" page 31&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1916&amp;ndash;17 about 8,000 to 10,000 Armenians were permitted to inhabit Van.

One report said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Men are going in large numbers; caravans of those returning to the fatherland enter via [[Iğdır]]. Most of the refugees in the Erevan province returned to Van."&lt;ref name="repatriation"&gt;Arnold Toynbee, ''The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916: Documents Presented to Viscount,'' "Repatriation of Refugees: Letter, dated Erevan, March, 1916."&lt;/ref&gt;

The government confiscated Russian properties turning them into [[communal farm]]s and dividing it among Armenian adult males. Over 40% of the population of Van left the city to work on the farms. The Armenian government founded a [[weapon]]s and ammunition industry, and most of the formerly Russian mines were scrapped and used for building projects in Van. The Armenian government tried to impose taxes, but most people ignored the tax collectors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The [[American Committee for Relief in the Near East|Near East relief]] brought relief to the victims of the war and organized in 1916 a Children's Home in Van. Children's Home helped children to learn reading and writing and supplied them nice clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Memories of Eyewitness-Survivors of the Armenian Genocide GHAZAR GHAZAR GEVORGIAN'S TESTIMONY Born in 1907, Van, Armenian valley, Hndstan village&lt;/ref&gt; Near East relief worked in Syria and "several hundred thousand" during the [[Caucasus Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Jay Murray Winter "America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915"  p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russian plans ====
In April 1915, [[Nikolai Yudenich]] reported the following to [[Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov|Count Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov]]:{{quote|The Armenians intend to occupy by means of their refugees the lands left by the Kurds and Turks, in order to benefit from that territory. I consider this intention unacceptable, because after the war, it will be difficult to reclaim those lands sequestered by the Armenians or to prove that the seized property does not belong to them, as was the case after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877&amp;ndash;78]]. I consider it very desirable
to populate the border regions with a Russian element... with colonists from the Kuban and Don and in that way to form a Cossack region along the border.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Lazian (1946), "Hayastan ev Hai Dare" Cairo, Tchalkhouchian, pages 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The agricultural possibilities located off the [[Black Sea]] coastal districts and the upper reaches of the [[Euphrates]] were considered suitable for Russian colonists.&lt;ref&gt;Ashot Hovhannisian, from "Hayastani avtonomian ev Antantan: Vaveragrer imperialistakan paterazmi shrdjanits (Erevan, 1926), pages 77&amp;ndash;79&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Rules for the Temporary Administration of Turkish Areas occupied by the Right of War'' was signed on June 18, 1916, instructing a governorship under the established system of Aram Manukian.

However, the [[February Revolution|February 1917 Revolution]] deposed [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] of the Russian crown, and the new establishment promised to reverse the policies in order to gain support of the Armenians.

=== The settlement, 1917 ===
Approximately 150,000 Armenians relocated to [[Erzurum Vilayet]], [[Bitlis Vilayet]], Mush and [[Van Vilayet]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;''The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: Foreign Dominion to Statehood,'' Richard G. Hovannisian, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Armenians began to build houses and till farmlands in preparation for the 1917 autumn harvest.  The prospect of a new autonomous state seemed favorable for provisional governor Aram Manukian, with the administrative seat favorably located between Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Although military front lines were relatively stable, 1917 marked the year of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. [[Karekin Pastermadjian|Armen Garo]] and others asked for Armenian regulars in the European theater to be transferred to the Caucasus front, a move aimed to increase the stability of the provisional government.

==== Special Transcaucasus Committee ====
The [[Viceroy]]alty of the Caucasus was abolished by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] on March 18, 1917, and all authority, except in the zone of the active army, was entrusted to the civil administrative body called the Special Transcaucasian Committee, or ''Ozakom.'' [[Hakob Zavriev]] was instrumental in having [[Special Transcaucasian Committee|Ozakom]] issue a decree about the administration of the occupied territories. This region was officially identified as ''"the land of Western Armenia"'' and transferred to a civilian rule under Zavriev, who oversaw districts Trebizon, Erzurum, Bitlis, and Van.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient To Modern Times. page 284&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the districts had their own Armenian governor, with Armenian civil officials.

==== National frontline ====
The Russian army in the Caucasus was organized along national and ethnic lines, such as the Armenian volunteer units and [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] on the eve of 1917.&lt;ref&gt;David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, ''Reforming the Tsar's Army: Military Innovation in Imperial Russia from Peter the Great,'' p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Russian Caucasus Army disintegrated, leaving Armenian soldiers to become the only defenders against the Ottoman Army.&lt;ref&gt;''The Armenians: Past and Present in the Making of National Identity,'' ed. Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[front line]] had three main divisions, led respectively by [[Movses Silikyan]], [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Mikhail Areshian]]. Armenian [[Armenian irregular units|partisan]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] detachments accompanied these main units. The Ottomans outnumbered the Armenians three to one on a frontline {{convert|300|mi|km}} long, with high mountain areas and passes.

===Retreat, 1918===
The chairman of the Van Relief Committee (Near East Relief) was [[Kostin Hambartsumian]], who, taking into consideration the general political situation, conveyed the one thousand five hundred orphans of Children's Home of Van to [[Gyumri]] in 1917.

==== Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, March 1918 ====
[[File:Andranikpasha.JPG|right|thumb|March&amp;ndash;April 1918, Governor [[Andranik Ozanian]]]]

A new border was drawn by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], signed between [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] and the Ottoman Empire on March 3, 1918.  The treaty assigned the Van Vilayet alongside the [[Kars Vilayet]], [[Ardahan]], and [[Batumi|Batum]] regions to the Ottoman Empire. The treaty also stipulated that Transcaucasia was to be declared independent.

==== The Resistance, March 1918 ====
The [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians]] (ACEA) representatives on the [[Duma]] joined their colleagues in declaring independence of the Transcaucasus from Russia.

On April 5, head of the Transcaucasian delegation [[Akakii Chkhenli]] accepted the Treaty as a basis for negotiation and wired the governing bodies, urging them to accept this position.&lt;ref name="ric"&gt;Richard Hovannisian "The Armenian people from ancient to modern times" Pages 292-293&lt;/ref&gt; The mood prevailing in Tiflis was very different; the treaty did not create a united block. Armenia acknowledged the existence of a state of war with the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="ric"/&gt; This short-lived Transcaucasian Federation broke up. Once they were free from Russian control, the ACEA declared the inauguration of the '' [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]]''. ACEA did not recognize the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and the Ottoman Empire was opposed to the Democratic Republic of Armenia. The ACEA devised policies to direct the war effort as well as the relief and repatriation of refugees, passing a law organizing the defense of the [[Caucasus]] against the Ottoman Empire, using supplies and munitions left by the Russian army. The Armenian Congress also selected a 15-member permanent executive committee, known as the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians|Armenian National Council]].  The chairman of this committee was [[Avetis Aharonyan]], who  declared that the Administration of Western Armenia was part of the Democratic Republic of Armenia.

The Ottoman Empire's [[Defence minister|War Minister]], [[İsmail Enver|Enver Pasha]], sent the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] to Armenia. Under heavy pressure from the combined forces of the Ottoman army and the Kurdish irregulars, the Armenian Republic was forced to withdraw from [[Erzincan]] to [[Erzurum]]. The [[Battle of Sardarapat]], May 22&amp;ndash;26, 1918, proved that General [[Movses Silikyan]] could force an Ottoman retreat. Further southeast, in Van, the Armenians resisted the Ottoman army until April 1918, while in Van the Armenians were forced to evacuate and withdraw to [[Iran|Persia]]. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]] explains the conditions of their resistance during March 1918: {{Quote|"In the summer of 1918, the Armenian national councils reluctantly transferred from Tiflis to Yerevan, to take over the leadership of the republic from the popular dictator Aram Manukian and the renowned military commander Drastamat Kanayan. It then began the daunting process of establishing a national administrative machinery in an isolated and landlocked misery. This was not the autonomy or independence which Armenian intellectuals had dreamed of and for which a generation of youth had been sacrificed. Yet, as it happened, it was here that the Armenian people were destined to continue [their] national existence."&lt;ref&gt;''The Armenians: Past and Present in the Making of National Identity,'' p. 98, edited by Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan&lt;/ref&gt;|R.G. Hovannisian}}

The [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[Tatars]] sided with the Ottoman Empire and seized the lines of communication, cutting off the Armenian National Councils in [[Baku]] and [[Yerevan|Erevan]] from the National Council in [[Tbilisi]].  The British sent a small military force under the command of Gen. [[Lionel Dunsterville|Lionel Charles Dunsterville]] into Baku, arriving on August 4, 1918.

On October 30, 1918, the Ottoman Empire signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]], and military activity in the region ceased. Enver Pasha's movement disintegrated with the armistice.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, David (1989), ''A Peace to End All Peace,'' The parting of the ways. (Avon Books).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition Efforts===
{{Main|Wilsonian Armenia}}
[[File:Boundary between Turkey and Armenia as determined by Woodrow Wilson 1920.jpg|thumb|Summary of Wilsonian Armenia]]
The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, between the Ottoman Empire and Russian SFSR, included the establishment of Armenia in [[Russian Armenia]]. The Administration for Western Armenia had a setback with the [[Treaty of Batum]], forcing the Armenian borders to be pushed deeper into Russian Armenia.

The [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian Diaspora]] argued that it was natural to extend the borders to Armenian control, since after the Russian Revolution the region was controlled by Armenian volunteer units, and later by Armenia. The Armenian provisional government used as a primary argument ''"the ability to control the region"''.

The majority of the population was becoming Armenian, as the Turkish inhabitants of the region moved to western provinces, this becoming the secondary argument. With the defeat of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, the [[triple Entente]] Powers meant to determine the fate of [[Anatolia]].

During the [[Conference of London]], [[David Lloyd George]] encouraged [[United States|American]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] to accept a mandate for Anatolia, particularly with the support of the [[Armenian diaspora]], for the provinces claimed by the Administration of Western Armenia during its largest occupation in 1916. "Wilsonian Armenia" became part of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]].

The realities on the ground, however, were slightly different. The idea was blocked by both the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] and the [[Treaty of Kars]]. The Treaty of Sèvres was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], and the fight for the ''"Administration for Western Armenia"'' was dropped off the table.

As a continuation of the initial goal, the creation of a "free, independent, and united" Armenia including all the territories designated as Wilsonian Armenia by the Treaty of Sèvres &amp;mdash; as well as the regions of [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Artsakh]], [[Javakheti|Javakhk]], and [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] &amp;mdash; was the main goal of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]].

'''Pachamama Raymi''' refers to a methodology for rural development. It was developed in 1988 in Cusco, Peru.&lt;ref name="pachamamaraymi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pachamamaraymi.org/history-of-pachamama-raymi|title=The history of Pachamama Raymi|publisher=pachamamaraymi.org|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Use==
It is being used in many projects in Latin America and most recently in Europe.&lt;ref name="pachamamaraymi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pachamamaraymi.org/history-transboundary-joint-secretariat-for-the-southern-caucasus-promoting-cooperation-in-nature-conservation|title=Transboundary Joint Secretariat for the Southern Caucasus, Promoting Cooperation in Nature Conservation|publisher=pachamamaraymi.org|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extremely poor rural areas, extreme poverty and environmental degradation are often closely linked. Computer simulations have shown that natural resources can be reclaimed and poverty overcome, if a majority of the population changes management of their natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Facing the challenge of the Andean Zone: the role of modeling in developing sustainable management of natural resources R.A. Quiroz, Ruben Dario Estrada, C.U. Leon-Velarde and H.G.

Changing preventive health practices greatly improves people’s health.

The methodology Pachamama Raymi makes it possible to introduce the required innovations in natural resource management and in preventive health practices simultaneously in a great majority of large populations within three to four years, mobilizing the population to get out of poverty largely through their own means. The methodology uses systemic social management, reinforcing people’s cultural identity, families, communities and working in close cooperation with their local government.&lt;ref&gt;“Accelerated Change in Fighting Poverty, by Willem H. M. Van Immerzeel” and {{cite web |url=http://www.pachamamaraymi.org/methodology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812104209/http://www.pachamamaraymi.org/methodology |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects that use the Pachamama Raymi methodology invest their resources in [[peer learning]] and motivation. The methodology uses contests between families of every village and between the villages of the district with attractive (cash) prizes. The participants in the contests compete in the quality of adoption of the innovations that the project seeks to introduce. Rules and Regulations are used.&lt;ref name="pachamamaraymi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pachamamaraymi.org/folletos/63_rules-and-regulations.families.kl.pdf|date=22 March 2011|title=The District Municipality of Ocongate Invites you to participate in the second contest "Pachamama RAYMI" April 3, 2008|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The contests typically lasts six months. About five to eight successive contests are required to achieve sustainable results.
The contests create a festive spirit in the villages.

'''Pharmacological Calvinism''' is a term of disapproval purporting to describe the disapproving or condemning attitude of some Americans to the use of [[psychiatric medication]]. The term describes a perceived general distrust of drug use for purposes of restoring or attaining pleasure or happiness; that the only legitimate use of drugs is for the purpose of curing or treating illness and disease. The term was first used in 1972&lt;ref&gt;Klerman, G.L. (1972), "Psychotropic hedonism vs. pharmacological Calvinism", ''[[Hastings Cent Rep.]]'' Sep;2(4):1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[psychiatrist]] [[Gerald L.Klerman]] (1929–1992&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Bruce (1992),[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/nyregion/gerald-l-klerman-63-an-expert-on-depression-and-schizophrenia.html?pagewanted=1 “Gerald L. Klerman, 63, an Expert On Depression and Schizophrenia”] (Obit), ''[[The New York Times]]'' (April 5).&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Peter D. Kramer]] defined the concept of [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] Calvinism as "a general distrust of drugs used for non-therapeutic purposes and a conviction that if a drug makes you feel good it must be morally bad".&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Peter (1993), ''Listening to Prozac'', New York City: [[Viking Press|Viking]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Klerman wrote at a time when there was growing [[War on Drugs|public and governmental concern]] about American drug use, both legal ([[tranquilizer]]s) and illegal ([[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[LSD]], etc.)

It has been pointed out that, strictly speaking, Klerman misrepresented [[Calvinism|Calvinist theology]] in his use of this term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand|Menand, Louis]] (2010)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37553">'''R.A.V.E.N. Respecting Aboriginal Values &amp; Environmental Needs''' is a charitable organization that provides financial resources to assist Aboriginal Nations within Canada in lawfully forcing industrial development to be reconciled with their traditional ways of life, and in a manner that addresses global warming or other ecological sustainability challenges.

==Mission==
RAVEN’s mission is to assist [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] in protecting or restoring their traditional lands and resources and addressing critical environmental challenges such as global warming by strategically enforcing their Constitutional rights through the courts in response to unsustainable settlement or industrial exploitation supported by the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SMS VSIP Consulting Inc. |url=http://www.raventrust.com/ |title=News |publisher=Raventrust.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax-exempt status==
RAVEN is a registered Canadian non-profit organization with charitable tax status.  RAVEN's registration number is 85484 0147 RR0001.  The organization also has applied for and received approval of U.S. [[501(c)(3)]] status and is in the final stages of formalizing that.

==Activities and structure==
RAVEN currently campaigns for the [[Beaver Lake Cree Nation]] in support of its legal fight to stop the destruction of their traditional hunting, trapping and fishing lands from exploitation by Alberta [[tar sands]] industries. RAVEN's position is that assisting the Beaver Lake Cree Nation in its efforts to stop the bitumen [[oil sands]] development is a chance to reverse a trend toward destroying the natural systems of the planet. The destruction of the [[boreal forest]] and the wasteful use of energy for the extraction of oil combine to make expansion of the bitumen oil sands one of the greatest threats to the future of our planet.

RAVEN also supports the [http://www.tsilhqotin.ca Tsilhqot’in National Government] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527234513/http://www.xenigwetin.com/ Xeni Gwet'in First Nation] in their legal action against Taseko Mines' Prosperity Project which proposes to turn a pristine lake that is part of the Fraser River watershed into a dump site for mine waste.  RAVEN claims that assisting the Tsilhqot’in Nation is a chance to prevent ecological disaster before it takes place. Teztan Biny (known as Fish Lake by settler communities) is being reviewed to become an industrial dump site for the Taseko Mines Prosperity Project.

RAVEN works in close alliance with the growing movement of eNGOs (environmental non-governmental organizations). The Tsilhqot'in fight to preserve Teztan Biny (Fish Lake) is now a national issue also on the agenda of NGOs such as [[MiningWatch Canada]] and the [[Council of Canadians]]. The practice of turning fresh water lakes into toxic waste dump is a matter that concerns everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Canadians article by National Water Campaigner Meera Karunananthan {{cite web |url=http://www.canadians.org/08/blog.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930222907/http://www.canadians.org/08/blog.html |archivedate=2008-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian federal government is not only allowing for this practice through the recent amendment to Schedule 2 of the Metal, Mining and Effluent Regulations (MMER), but also there are 20 more lakes across Canada facing the same fate as Teztan Biny.

RAVEN's board of directors includes David Williams of Friends of the Nemaiah Valley, Lynn Hunter and Linda Stanton.

==Campaigns==

===Beaver Lake Cree Nation vs. the tar sands===

The Beaver Lake Cree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beaverlakecreenation.ca/ |title=Beaver Lake |publisher=Beaverlakecreenation.ca |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small, impoverished band of 900 people in eastern Alberta, are suing the Canadian federal and Alberta provincial governments to protect the land. They claim that Alberta's tar sands developments are obliterating their traditional hunting and fishing lands in Alberta. The animals, fish, plants and medicine that sustain the Beaver Lake Cree are being destroyed.

In Canada, the rights of Indigenous people are constitutionally protected. Led by Chief Al Lameman, the Beaver Lake Cree Nation is asserting a treaty right to hunt and fish throughout lands where tar sands activity is destroying the forest. This court action seeks an injunction against new developments. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090920151330/http://www.raventrust.com/media/beaverlakecree/blcnstatementofclaimsmall.pdf Beaver Lake Cree’s Statement of Claim] cites more than 17,000 infringements on their treaty rights and in the course of doing so names every major oil company in the world.

Investment in the bituminous sands in northern Alberta – the world’s last great oil field – totals approximately $200 billion. No assessment of the cumulative environmental or cultural damage has been done. It has been argued that this project – unhindered – will destroy a large part of the great boreal forest of North America, will escalate global warming, and will destroy an indigenous way of life. The Alberta government continues to approve projects, such that production of dirty oil will increase from the current {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} to {{convert|3|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} by 2015.

Already vast expanses of the boreal forest have been cut down – causing significant damage to the environment and to the earth’s well-being. The forest is home to a long list of animals, from [[American black bear|black bears]] and [[caribou]] to [[marten]] and [[moose]]. Chief Al Lameman says they can no longer find caribou herds where caribou were abundant just 12 years ago. Moose are also being displaced in large numbers and simply cannot be found. There is evidence the herds are also not self-sustaining – there is not a new calf population to replace the older population of moose.

As the forest is eroded to make way for open mines and in-situ mines, the ‘great lung’ of North America with its rich carbon-storing peat and soil, is disappearing. In its place, rapid growth of carbon emissions threatens to increase the earth’s temperature. Meanwhile, oil sands extraction pollutes the earth with its tailings ponds, pollutes the air with its emissions, and pollutes the water using two to four barrels of water to produce just one barrel of bitumen and creating vast lakes of chemicals that leach into local watersheds.

====Beaver Lake Cree history====
The [[Beaver Lake Cree Nation|Beaver Lake Cree]] is a small Indian community located in eastern Alberta, north-east of Edmonton and just outside Lac La Biche. It currently has approximately 900 members. In the early 19th century, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] built a trading post at Lac La Biche, and the locals hunted, fished and trapped fur to sell to the HBC agents. In the 1870s the Canadian government was involved in a gradual process of treaty making aimed at addressing Aboriginal title and opening up the lands for settlement. By the middle of the decade, food supplies for the plains Cree were running low with a rapid decline in buffalo, and geographical survey crews were running into tensions with the local inhabitants. In July 1875, Cree warriors stopped a telegraph crew at the fork of the Saskatchewan River. In response the Canadian government sent Treaty Commissioner Alexander Morris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otc.ca/LEARNING_RESOURCES/Historical_Biographies/Treaty_5/Alexander_Morris/ |title=Office of the Treaty Commissioner |publisher=Otc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to meet with [[Cree]], [[Chipewyan]] and Salteaux leaders beginning on August 15, 1876.

Discussions lasted for several days and included many pipe ceremonies. The pipe ceremonies were viewed by the Cree people as a mark of the solemnity of the occasion. In the presence of the pipe only the truth could be told and it was understood that promises made as part of such ceremonies would be kept. For their part, the Commissioners invoked the name of the Queen, and made the treaty promises in her name. Beaver Lake's immediate ancestors met with Commissioner Morris at Fort Pitt in September, 1876. There Morris gave this speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… I see the Queen's Councillors taking the Indian by the hand saying we are brothers, we will lift you up, we will teach you, if you will learn, the cunning of the white man. All along the road I see Indians gathering, I see gardens growing and houses building; I see them receiving money from the Queen's Commissioners to purchase clothing for their children, at the same time I see them enjoying their hunting and fishing as before, I see them retaining their old mode of living with the Queen's gift in addition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chief Pay-ay-sis signed Treaty 6. He and the other chiefs surrendered approximately 195,000 square kilometres of land . In return for their land, they were promised that they would be able to hunt and fish to make a living from the land as they had always done, and they were promised that each band member would be paid $5.00 per year.

The promise to pay $5.00 per year to each Cree person has been faithfully kept every year.

The important text of Treaty 6 is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Plain and Wood Cree Tribes of Indians, and all other the Indians inhabiting the district hereinafter described and defined, do hereby cede, release, surrender and yield up to the Government of the Dominion of Canada, for Her Majesty the Queen and Her successors forever, all their rights, titles and privileges, whatsoever, to the lands included within the following limits…
Her Majesty further agrees with Her said Indians that they, the said Indians, shall have right to pursue their avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by Her Government of Her Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such tracts as may from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes by Her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorized therefor by the said Government.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a tension built into the treaty between the Crown’s right to take up land, and the enduring right of the Indians to hunt and fish. In the 19th century the amount of unspoiled land available for hunting and fishing was so huge that no amount of settlement seemed to affect the wildlife populations. For over one hundred years under the treaty there was always a meaningful opportunity to hunt and fish, so conflict between the Crown’s rights and the Indian’s rights did not arise.

But in the last two decades, the tar sands developments have encroached on such huge amounts of land that there is now a conflict between the viability of the treaty rights and the Crown’s right to continue to alienate land.

The law in this situation has recently been expressed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The Crown cannot take up so much land as to compromise the meaningful right to hunt. If game becomes so scarce that the Indians would have to travel too far, and expend too much effort to make the hunting worthwhile, then the treaty right is no longer meaningful. If that decrease in the abundance of fish and wildlife is caused by Crown actions, then the Crown actions can be declared unconstitutional.

====The tar sands and potential impact on the Beaver Lake Cree====
The [[Athabasca oil sands]] deposit represents the second largest known deposit of oil in the world - after Saudi Arabia.  There are estimated to be more than a trillion barrels of oil embedded in the sands, with an estimated {{convert|315|Goilbbl|m3}} considered to be recoverable.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Department of Energy, “Alberta Oil Sands 2006 (updated December 2007,) Edmonton, AB, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Production of synthetic crude oil from the tar sands is well under way – Alberta is producing about {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl|m3}} of dirty oil per day.&lt;ref&gt;Nikiforuk, Andrew, Tar Sands - Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent, Greystone Books, Vancouver, Canada, 2008 (in collaboration with the David Suzuki Foundation). As of December 2007, there were approximately 4,264 oil sands agreements within the province, totaling 64,919 square kilometres. http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/792.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  That amount is expected to double or triple in the next few years, based on recent massive private investment in these projects.

The environmental liabilities that result from the various steps in oil sands extraction and refining process include:
i.	'''Destruction of the boreal forest eco-system'''
ii.	'''Damage to the Athabasca watershed'''
iii.	'''Heavy consumption of natural gas'''
iv.	'''Creation of toxic tailings ponds'''
v.	'''Increased release of greenhouse gases'''

i. '''Destruction of the boreal forest eco-system'''

All of the oil sands leases slated for development are located in the boreal forest.  The boreal forest is particularly valuable for its ability to store large amounts of carbon in its bogs, peat, soil, and trees.  The destruction of boreal forest reduces the earth’s capacity to store carbon and releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as it is destroyed.  The currently proposed oil sands projects, if all were to be activated, would directly remove an area of boreal forest eco-system twice the size of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Sierra Club website, “Tar Sands and the Boreal Forest,” 2006:   http://www.tarsandstimeout.ca/index. php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=36&amp;Item&lt;/ref&gt;  Destruction of the forest eliminates the habitat for birds, fish, and mammals, including caribou, bear, deer, moose, wolves, coyotes, lynx, wolverine, beaver, fisher, marten, muskrat, and squirrels.   Reclamation is not a credible solution.

ii. '''Damage to the Athabasca water shed'''

Two to four and a half barrels of water are required to produce a barrel of oil from the tar sands.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Sierra Club website, “Tar Sands and Water,” 2006:   “http:www.tarsandstimeout.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Item...&lt;/ref&gt; Water is used to create the slurry of bitumen and oil that is heated and processed.  Water is also disposed of through Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage method of extraction where steam is pumped into the ground to cause bitumen to flow into a lower pipe for removal. For every barrel of oil produced approximately one barrel of water is contaminated in the process and deposited into a tailings pond.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;

At present, large water allocations from the Athabasca River are assigned to industrial use. A recent Alberta government report concluded that: “Over the long term, the Athabasca River may not have sufficient flows to meet the needs of all the planned mining operations and maintain adequate instream flows.”&lt;ref&gt;Government of Alberta, Oil Sands Ministerial Strategy Committee, “Investing in our future: Responding to the rapid growth of the oil sands development,” 2006, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of Canada’s largest rivers.

Water impacts threaten fish, wildlife, downstream communities, and transportation in the McKenzie delta.&lt;ref&gt;Sierra Club website, “Living Downstream - Growing Water Concerns in the NWT,” 2006: “http:www.tarsandstimeout.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Item...&lt;/ref&gt; The toxicity of the tailings ponds also represent threats to local aquifers and to the quality of water in the Athabasca River due to the danger of seepage or a sudden and large catastrophic failure of a pond’s enclosure. Already there have been reports of unusually high incidence of certain kinds of cancer in the populations living downstream.&lt;ref&gt;“Oilsands-area hamlet supports whistleblower MD – Physician raised concerns about high cancer rates downstream from oil projects” http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2007/03/05/alberta-doctor-070305.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

iii. '''Heavy consumption of natural gas'''

Natural gas is burned to heat the bitumen in the tar sands in order to extract the liquid oil. The energy equivalent of one barrel of oil in natural gas is needed to produce three barrels of synthetic crude. Producing a barrel of oil from the oil sands requires approximately one thousand cubic feet of natural gas.

Natural gas is a fossil fuel, and when it burns to create heat it adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. But the additional concern is that natural gas releases less carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced than oil does - especially heavy oil, or synthetic crude. So, a relatively clean non-renewable fossil fuel is being burned to create a very dirty fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Polaris Institute website, “Dirty Little Secret: Canada’s Global Warming Engine,” Alberta Tar sands Profile Series, 2007. See also George Monbiot, Heat, Anchor Books, Canadian Edition 2007, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

iv. '''Creation of toxic tailings ponds'''

The “tailings” from the bitumen retrieval and refining processes include sand, silt and clay mixed with leftover hydrocarbons and other toxic substances. Tailings are being created at a rate of 2,000 or so litres per barrel of bitumen, resulting in about 1.8 billion litres of tailings every day. In May 2008, tailings ponds covered approximately 130 km2 of Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;Pembina, Fact or Fiction, at p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tailings ponds include substances of concern for the water quality that discharge to surface waters:
•	salts
•	elevated sodium, chloride, sulphate
•	elevated total dissolved solids, pH, conductivity and alkalinity
•	lower calcium and magnesium (soft water)
•	variable levels of trace metals, including boron, arsenic and strontium
•	elevated ammonia
•	naphthenic acids, phenols, hydrocarbons
•	and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
•	other acute and chronic toxicants&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Grant, Fact or Fiction: Oil Sands Reclamation, Drayton Valley, AB: Pembina Institute, 2008, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, huge ponds sit with very short berms separating them from the Athabasca River. The Athabasca is the source river of the McKenzie watershed – downstream are communities that depend on the river for their water and livelihood. It is the principal source of food fish for Aboriginal communities.

In April 2008, considerable press coverage arose when 500 ducks landed on the Syncrude tailings pond and died. Syncrude did not report the incident and it only became public because of an anonymous tip. Provincial regulations require the use of scarecrows and soundmakers to attempt to divert the birds from the ponds, but these were not functioning at the time. A member of the Sierra Club of Alberta, Jeh Custer, started a private prosecution against Syncrude in 2008. A private prosecution for an environmental office is a legal proceeding where an individual attempts to enforce an environmental statute, in circumstances where the Crown prosecutors fail to do so. Such private prosecutions almost always fail. But they serve to embarrass governments who are not doing their job. On February 10 both Canada and Alberta commenced formal court proceedings against Syncrude for the same offences. If convicted, Syncrude could face a maximum $300,000 fine.

v. '''The release of greenhouse gases'''

There are three main sources of greenhouse gas increases resulting from tar sands extractions:
1.	Release of carbon from the living boreal forest as it is destroyed.
2.	Burning of natural gas, itself a fossil fuel, in the refining process
3.	The carbon released from the bitumen itself.
Because of the huge amount of greenhouse gas release in the process of creating synthetic crude oil, Alberta produces three times more greenhouse gas emissions per capita than the Canadian average and six times the West European average.

The earth’s atmosphere currently contains about 459 ppm CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;Monbiot, Bring on the Apocalypse, Anchor Books, 2008, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; At that elevated level we are now into the danger zone. It is well understood that as the concentrations of CO2 approach 550 ppm there is near certainty that the earth will warm 2 degrees, and will probably warm 3 degrees, an amount of warming that would be fully catastrophic. Over the next 30 years as the tar sands are exploited under current plans, this one source alone will add about 65 ppm of carbon dioxide to earth’s atmosphere. Even if nobody else on earth created carbon dioxide over the next 30 years, exploitation of the tar sands will push the level of CO2 in our atmosphere to 525 ppm. This one source will single-handedly cancel out all worldwide efforts to control climate change. All the good effects of conservation, conversion to solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and other expensive unconventional energy sources will be for nothing, because this one industrial project will continue pushing up the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases. All the planning and sacrifice by the rest of the world will be cancelled out by this one industry.

And, in the course of exploiting the tar sands and destroying the boreal forest, the treaty rights of the Beaver Lake Cree Nation will be rendered meaningless.

====Co-operative Bank supports BLCN with its Toxic Fuels Campaign====
In February 2009, The Co-operative Financial Services announced it was backing the Beaver Lake Cree legal action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co-operativecampaigns.co.uk/toxicfuels/img/cree.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229063404/http://www.co-operativecampaigns.co.uk/toxicfuels/img/cree.pdf |date=December 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the bank's press release, Paul Monaghan, Head of Social Goals and Sustainability at CFS said: “We already know that commercialisation of tar sands risks massive environmental damage. If the Beaver Lake Cree Nation are successful in their ground-breaking legal challenge and other indigenous groups follow, oil companies could also be looking at massive investment damages.” CFS launched its '''Toxic Fuels''' campaign, designed to "combat the shocking global trend of extracting oil from unconventional sources, such as tar sands and shale oil. Such exploitation threatens global efforts to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid dangerous levels of climate change]] and risks local ecological disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operativecampaigns.co.uk/toxicfuels/index.php |title=Co-operative Toxic Fuels |publisher=Co-operativecampaigns.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100331142736/http://www.co-operativecampaigns.co.uk/toxicfuels/beaverCreeNation.php Toxic Fuels campaign] has a direct link to RAVEN in order to provide financial support for the lengthy and costly legal action.

===The Tsilhqot'in fight to save Teztan Biny===
Taseko Mines Ltd. is proposing to develop the Prosperity Mine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tasekomines.com/tko/Prosperity.asp |title=Taseko Mines Limited - New Prosperity - Thu Dec 8, 2011 |publisher=Tasekomines.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a massive open pit gold and copper mine, deep within the traditional territory of the Tsilhqot'in Nation. The proposed Prosperity Mine is located in south central British Columbia, approximately 125&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Williams Lake, on an alpine plateau in the Chilcotin, beneath the rugged glaciated peaks of the Coast Range. The Prosperity Mine, if developed, would be situated in a site of exceptional natural splendor, close to the Nemaiah Valley, Ts'yl-os Provincial Park, and the ?Elegesi Qayus Wild Horse Preserve.

A statement prepared by the Tsilhqot'in National Government and placed on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100714181016/http://www.raventrust.com/projects/fishlaketeztanbiny.html RAVEN website] says: &lt;blockquote&gt;the proposed mine’s two kilometer-wide open pit, tailings pond, waste rock piles, roads, and transmission lines would destroy an entire sub-alpine ecosystem, and most importantly Teztan Biny, a lake sacred to the Tsilhqot'in Nation, and known to others as Fish Lake. Teztan Biny is a beautiful mountain lake which our ancestors have used and managed since time immemorial. Teztan Biny supports a vibrant population (some 85,000) of genetically unique Rainbow Trout that provide a critical food source for the Tsilhqot'in people and local wildlife; including blue-listed species of concern such as Grizzly Bears.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For generations the Tsilhqot'in have gone to Teztan Biny to fish, to set fish traps and nets, hunt and trap, gather medicines, engage in spiritual practices, reconnect with the land, honor their elders, share stories, and foster unity. It is more than a lake to the Tsilhqot'in – it is an integral part of Tsilhqot'in culture, and vital to their cultural continuity and survival. Many non-Aboriginal local residents and tourists also enjoy Teztan Biny for a wide variety of recreational activities. The Tsilhqot'in Nation is neither against development nor against the responsible use of natural resources. In fact, as the traditional keepers of the land for thousands of years, we have successfully balanced the need for sustainable harvesting with long-term preservation. To the Tsilhqot'in people, the destruction of Teztan Biny is an unacceptable use of land and water, incompatible with modern principles of sustainability, and an ill-conceived and shortsighted attempt to inject an industrial project into the heart of our pristine watershed.

For generations the Tsilhqot’in people have gone to Teztan Biny, and the streams and wetlands surrounding it, nourish Fish Creek and the Taseko River, critical habitat areas for Chinook and sockeye salmon. It is here that wild [[salmon]] begin their long journey to the Pacific Ocean via the Chilko, the Chilcotin and ultimately, the Fraser River. Teztan Biny is a vital part of the watershed that supports one of the largest and most productive salmon fisheries in North America. We have deep concerns that any toxic effluents that seep from the mine tailings and waste rock facilities at the proposed mine could negatively impact BC's already threatened Fraser salmon fishery.

Chief [[Marilyn Baptiste]], following in the long tradition of strong Tsilhqot'in leaders, has again taken the Tsilhqot’in claims to court by filing another case seeking a specific declaration of an Aboriginal right to fish in Teztan Biny. She is acting on behalf of our elders, our leaders and future generations. Currently, the Tsilhqot'in Nation Government (TNG) is participating in the environmental assessment process conducted by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/050/details-eng.cfm?evaluation=44811 |title=Canadian Environmental Assessment Registry - Review Panel - Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine Project |publisher=Ceaa.gc.ca |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that our voice is heard. The financial, social and time pressures placed on our government and our people by this process are immense. An independent review panel has been named, and public hearings will take place this summer. The review panel is scheduled to make a recommendation by the fall of 2009. Taseko Mines Ltd. is strongly advocating for an expedited process to ensure construction begins in winter 2010.

====Issues of concern====
Significant environmental and social impacts can be summarized as:

'''1- Reclassification of Fish Lake as a Tailings Pond''' - The proposed mine requires the conversion of a fish bearing lake - Fish Lake also named Tetzan Biny - to a permanent waste rock disposal area, and its upstream watershed as a permanent storage facility for mine tailings and effluent. The destruction of this lake requires federal Cabinet approval in the form of a regulatory amendment to the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER), Schedule 2 &lt;ref&gt;Here is an example of one such amendment: http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2009/2009-02-18/html/sor-dors27-eng.html&lt;/ref&gt; because it would otherwise contravene a critical provision of the Fisheries Act that protects fish habitat. MMER Schedule 2 amendments are highly controversial in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elc.ab.ca/pages/Publications/NewsBrief.aspx?id=820 |title=News Brief - Environmental Law Centre |publisher=Elc.ab.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada is one of the few countries in the world that allows such an industrial practice. More than a dozen lakes and water bodies are currently being considered for this kind of industrial application in Canada. Teztan Biny, which requires to be “Scheduled” under this proposal is considered to be one of the most productive rainbow trout lakes in BC. The proponent suggests that they cannot access the ore body without destroying Fish Lake and proposes creating a replacement lake (to be called “Prosperity Lake”) as a means of compensating for the loss of Fish Lake and upstream and downstream spawning habitat.iv

'''2- Aboriginal Rights and Title''' –The Tsilhqot’in Nation, which comprises six member communities, has lived in the area of the proposed mine since before contact with European settlers, and maintains claims to Aboriginal rights and title throughout the area. In particular, the Tsilhqot’in Nation has already proven its Aboriginal right to hunt and trap in the area of the proposed mine,&lt;ref&gt;Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia, 2007 BCSC 1700&lt;/ref&gt; and is seeking a further court declaration of a specific Aboriginal right to fish at Teztan Biny. The Tsilhqot’in people fish, hunt, trap and gather berries and traditional medicines throughout the area. There is, in effect, no way to build the mine without precluding Tsilhqot’in land use in the affected area. The proposed construction of the mine, irrespective of other issues, pits the economic priority of industrial development against proven and asserted Aboriginal rights and title, and seriously undermines efforts at the reconciliation of the Crown’s assertion of sovereignty with the prior occupation of Aboriginal people on this land.

'''3- Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage''' - Modern industrial scale mining of copper based ore bodies can release heavy metals (ML) and Acid Rock Drainage (ARD), into surface and groundwater. The naturally occurring sulphuric content of rock reacts with exposure to water and air to produce sulphuric acid. Both of these processes are accelerated by the crushing and refining of the ore body through the process of mining. Open pit mining, in particular, requires the processing of tremendous quantities of waste rock and overburden to access the comparatively small grades of ore contained in the deposit. Lastly, the presence of sulphuric acid accelerates the leaching of toxic metals. The entire process is called ML/ARD, and is presently the single greatest adverse environmental effect of mining in accordance with modern industrial standards. The effects of ML/ARD are difficult to predict, and tend to arise decades after the commencement of a mines operation, and can produce lasting, chronic, and sometimes irremediable environmental damage. Often, the corporate entity that developed the mine has ceased to exist by the time problems arise, and the bonding and securities required of the proponent by government are insufficient to remedy or mitigate the damages. The costs are borne by tax payers and local residents and future generations. The Kemess North Joint Review Panel final analysis concluded : “The Panel believes that the creation of a long-term legacy of substantial mine site management and maintenance obligations,lasting for thousands of years, represents a major imposition on future generations.”,&lt;ref&gt;Kemess North Copper-Gold Mine Joint Review Panel Report Summary – September 17, 2007 p.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt; On March 7, 2008, the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia announced that they will accept the recommendation of an independent environmental assessment panel that the proposed Kemess North copper-gold mine should not proceed in its present form.,&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Impact Statement/Application March 2009, Taseko Mines Limited, Volume 1 p.7-4 Prosperity Gold-Copper Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Environment,Fisheries and Oceans Canada |url=http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2005-2009/2008ENV0027-000324.htm |title=Panel Recommendation Accepted On Kemess North Project |publisher=.news.gov.bc.ca |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4-Potential Impacts to the Fraser Basin watershed''' – Fish Lake is at approximately 1400m above sea level, and sits atop a bench between two low mountain tops. The lake, and the site of the proposed mine, waste rock area, and tailings impoundments area, are perched above the Taseko River, which connects downstream with the highly productive salmon-bearing Chilko and Chilcotin Rivers before entering the Fraser River below Williams Lake. Some 240 m tonnes of potentially acid generating waste rock will need to be stored permanently underwater behind a massive dam to be built across the Fish Lake watershed. This structure will need to be maintained in perpetuity, for if the water capping the waste rock was to drain, acid generation in the exposed wasterock would present a serious environmental risk to downstream fisheries. Any inadvertent, accidental or even naturally caused effluent discharge from the tailings dam will inevitably end up in these river systems with potentially catastrophic results to one of BC’s most valuable fish runs. The massive dam and stored effluent and waste rock on the Fish Lake watershed would also pose serious threats for groundwater contamination by mine effluents draining from beneath the impoundment into the rocks and groundwater systems feeding the Taseko River. Any heavy metals stored in dissolved or solid form in the tailings will pose a risk to Taseko River water quality. All of these risks last not only for the mine life but forever, requiring a significant continual investment of inspection and maintenance effort by future generations.

'''5- Free Entry''' – The conflict over land use priorities in the Chilcotin-Cariboo region was generated by a provision in the BC Mineral Tenure Act which permits prospectors, prospective prospectors, and anyone else with a credit card, to stake mineral claims to an area over the internet, and for a few dollars acquire a legally enforceable property interest in the minerals contained within that claim. Upon further application, the mineral claim can be converted to a long term lease with significant proprietary surface rights which are critical to mine development. These “Free Entry” provisions of the Mineral Tenure Act effectively trump the rights of surface rights holders, and in particular the Act does not recognize any other interest in the land, for example the interests of First Nations. While the provisions of the Mineral Tenure Act have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenues for the province and markedly encouraged mineral prospecting and mine development in the short-term, the free entry system precipitates the inevitable conflicts that result where the rights of established land users are trumped by other interests, often pitting local and foreign interests against one another. While land use planning in BC continues to integrate the values and priorities of local interests and stakeholders, the provisions of the Mineral Tenure Act, undermine the devolution.

'''Save Our Children, Inc.''' was a political coalition formed in 1977 in [[Miami, Florida]] to overturn a recently legislated county ordinance that banned discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on [[sexual orientation]]. The coalition was publicly headed by celebrity singer [[Anita Bryant]], who claimed the ordinance discriminated against her right to teach her children [[Ethics in the Bible|biblical morality]]. It was a well-organized campaign that initiated a bitter political fight between unprepared gay activists and highly motivated [[Christian fundamentalist]]s. When the repeal of the ordinance went to a vote, it attracted the largest response of any special election in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]'s history, passing by 70%.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gay rights ordinance re-enacted by Dade County commissioners in 1998; it survived a repeal attempt by the Christian Coalition in 2003. ([http://www.stonewall-library.org/anita/panel20.html Days Without Sunshine:  Anita Bryant's Anti-Gay Crusade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724231455/http://www.stonewall-library.org/anita/panel20.html |date=2010-07-24 }}, Stonewall Library and Archives. Retrieved on October 23, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this vote, a group of gay and lesbian community members formed Pride South Florida, now known as Pride Fort Lauderdale, an organization whose mission was to fight for the rights of the gay and lesbian community in South Florida.

Save Our Children was the first organized [[LGBT rights opposition|opposition to the gay rights movement]], whose beginnings were traced to the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969. The defeat of the ordinance encouraged groups in other cities to attempt to overturn similar laws. In the next year voters in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], [[Wichita, Kansas]], and [[Eugene, Oregon]] overturned ordinances in those cities, sharing many of the same campaign strategies that were used in Miami. Save Our Children was also involved in [[Seattle, Washington]], where they were unsuccessful, and heavily influenced [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]]—a proposed state law in [[California]] that would have made the firing of [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]] public school employees mandatory—that was rejected by California voters in 1978.

Historians have since connected the success of Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although "occasional antigay appeals from the right" existed prior to the campaign, "the [[new right]] struck pure gold in Anita Bryant. A mother, celebrity singer, former Miss America ... the chirpy Bryant was the ideal model for its antigay crusade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gallagher |first1=John |last2=Bull |first2=Chris |title=Perfect Enemies: The Religious Right, the Gay Movement, and  the Politics of the 1990s |year=1996 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/perfectenemies.htm |accessdate=2 September 2018 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years the Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]] developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the [[Moral Majority]] that influenced the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA), [[abortion]], and [[pornography]] were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.

==Background==

On January 18, 1977, the [[Dade County Commission]] approved a law that would outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public services.&lt;ref name="nyt1/18/1977"&gt;"Bias Against Homosexuals is Outlawed in Miami", ''The New York Times'' (January 19, 1977), p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioner [[Ruth Shack]] proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40&amp;nbsp;[[gay bathhouse]]s across the United States, political and gay activist [[Bob Basker]], and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the [[Human Potential Movement]].

===Homosexuality in Miami===

The general attitude about homosexuality in Miami mirrored many other cities across the country. Although gay nightlife in the city had enjoyed the same boisterous existence as other forms of entertainment in the 1930s, by the 1950s, the city government worked to shut down as many gay bars as possible and enacted laws making homosexuality and cross-dressing illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 to 1966, the [[Florida Legislative Investigation Committee|Johns Committee]] of the Florida Legislature actively sought to root out homosexuals in state employment and in public universities across the state, publishing the inflammatory "[[Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida|Purple Pamphlet]]," which portrayed all homosexuals as predators and a dire threat to the children of Florida.  In the 1960s, ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' ran several stories implying the life of area homosexuals as synonymous with [[pimp]]s and [[child molester]]s, and [[CBS]] aired a documentary entitled ''[[CBS Reports: The Homosexuals|"The Homosexuals"]]'' in 1967, warning viewers that young boys were in danger from predatory men.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The public image of homosexuals changed with liberalized social attitudes of the late 1960s. In 1969, the [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in [[New York City]], marking the start of the [[gay rights movement]]. Although gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ [[Metropolitan Community Church]]—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of gay men and lesbians by [[coming out|openly]] gay [[San Francisco]] political activist [[Jim Foster (activist)|Jim Foster]]. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of [[Club Baths]] in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the [[Miami Police Department]] prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the depiction of gay men and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority.&lt;!-- [[ref Miami Herald August 24, 1969 and News August 24 - September 1, 1970]] --&gt; By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40&amp;nbsp;cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians.&lt;ref name="tanasychuk"/&gt;

===Reaction to the ordinance===

When the news of the ordinance proposal was reported in December 1976, a small ripple of protest spread from local churches. Northwest Baptist Church announced it from the pulpit. The news worried one of the church members named [[Anita Bryant]], who was a 36-year-old singer celebrity.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;Matthews, Tom, Fuller, Tony, and Camp, Holly (June 6, 1977). "Battle Over Gay Rights", ''Newsweek'', p. 16–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant began her career as a local child star on a television show in [[Oklahoma City]] and on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]''. Her young life was marked by frequent moves; her parents divorced each other twice, and she often lived in poverty conditions, but she became a [[born again Christian]] at eight years old, and counted her faith and her participation at church as the stabilizing influences in her life.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; As a child, she asked God to make her a star. She was, by her own admission, remarkably driven and ambitious.&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;Kelley, Ken (May 1978). "Playboy Interview: Anita Bryant", ''Playboy'', p. 73–96, 232–250.&lt;/ref&gt; In her older teens she became a [[beauty pageant]] contestant, winning [[Miss Oklahoma]] and second runner-up as [[Miss America]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, she married a Miami [[disc jockey]] named Bob Green and became a professional singer, finding some success with three [[gold record]]s featuring popular, patriotic, and Gospel standards. She performed with the [[Bob Hope Christmas tour]], entertaining troops serving overseas, and sang at President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s funeral in 1973. Since 1969 she had been employed regionally by the [[Florida Citrus Commission]] endorsing Florida orange juice in television commercials. She also advertised for [[Coca-Cola]], [[Tupperware]], [[Kraft Foods]] and [[Holiday Inn]]. Bryant's talent agent was married to Ruth Shack; Bryant had contributed $1,000 to her campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[The Miami Herald praised Shack in an editorial 2 days after the January vote. Another editorial ten days later signed by Bob McMullan contradicted it.]] --&gt;
Initially Bryant kept her concerns low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She wrote a letter to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1977), p. 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in [[parochial school]]s; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1992), p. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of [[child pornography]] by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bryant gave a candid interview to ''Playboy'' magazine, printed in May 1978 where she admitted that she knew of homosexuals in show business, but was unaware of the "nitty gritty" of their sexual behavior until her husband described them to her. She professed being most astonished that they ate each other's sperm, and equated the act with the immorality of destroying the Seed of Life. Bryant also claimed never to have heard of [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s study that estimated one out of five  males had had some sexual contact with another male; or any information about [[homosexual behavior in animals]]. The interviewer, Ken Kelley, wrote a companion piece to the interview, stating that she was impossible to "pigeonhole" due to her deliberate enigmatic persona: "She is a confection of contradictions: pristine nun and gamy tease. Old pro who's paid her dues and wide-eyed waif who's still seeking the jackpot. Guilt-wracked sinner who's terrified of hell and perfervid white knight who's determined to lead mankind on a forced march into paradise. Independent spirit, cowering wife. Chaplain one minute, warden the next. She is a demonstrably intelligent woman who stays steadfastly ignorant." For months Bryant called Kelley just to talk, even though she knew she would not be portrayed favorably in the magazine. Kelley and a few others concluded that Bryant was simply very lonely. (Young, p. 39.)&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

At the time of the commission's vote in January, the boardroom was crowded with people who held some kind of interest in the issue. Busloads of churchgoers arrived from as far away as [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] and picketed outside; there was no corresponding organized show of support for the ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the boardroom, supporters and opposers took the entire allotted time to speak. Bryant reflected most of those opposing the law, telling the Dade County Commission, "The ordinance condones immorality and discriminates against my children's rights to grow up in a healthy, decent community".&lt;ref name="nyt1/18/1977"/&gt; The few members of the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays who were present were stunned, as was Ruth Shack, at the number and force of the hundreds of protesters who filled the commission room, and held placards and pickets outside.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!-- [[ref from Miami Herald]] --&gt; The ordinance passed by a 5-3 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Florida has a long history in LGBT-rights movement |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article5449227.html |accessdate=2 September 2018 |work=Miami Herald |date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dade County ordinance 77-4==

After the ordinance passed, over thirty conservative political professionals and ministers from various faiths met in Bryant and Green's home to discuss a plan to raise publicity and attempt to get at least 10,000 signatures on a petition to force the issue to be decided by a county voter referendum. They approved the name "Save Our Children, Inc.", and voted Bryant their president, Bob Green treasurer and a man named Robert Brake—a devout Catholic with a record of civil rights participation, but increasingly concerned with the liberalization of Miami city politics—its secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, pp. 76, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; With the assistance of a Republican-affiliated advertising executive named Mike Thompson, the coalition eschewed subtlety. They held a press conference where Bryant held a pamphlet about homosexuality she claimed was being distributed at area high schools (a statement she later retracted&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;), and said Dade County homosexuals "are trying to recruit our children into homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Far exceeding the required number of signatures, the coalition delivered more than 64,000 signatures within six weeks demanding a referendum vote, which the commission set for June 7, 1977.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Strategy===
Mike Thompson discovered in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, and that they were a specific danger to children.&lt;ref name="Clendinen, p. 303"&gt;Clendinen, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance "guts the law on the side of the unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?"&lt;ref name="kondracke"&gt;Kondracke, Morton (1980). "Anita Bryant Is Mad About Gays", ''The New Republic'', p. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying "Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach."&lt;ref name="kondracke"/&gt; Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Save Our Children campaign produced a local television commercial showing the "wholesome entertainment" of the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] Parade (which Bryant hosted), contrasting that with highly sexualized images of the [[San Francisco Pride|San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade]], including men in leather harnesses kissing each other, dancing [[drag queen]]s, and topless women. The commercial's announcer accused Miami's gay community of trying to turn Miami into the "hotbed of homosexuality" that San Francisco had become.&lt;ref name="Clendinen, p. 303"/&gt; Full-page newspaper ads were run in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', showing collections of headlines announcing teachers having sex with their students, children in prostitution rings, and homosexuals involved with youth organizations, followed by the question "Are all homosexuals nice? ... There is no 'human right' to corrupt our children."&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Miami was not the first community to overturn a sexual orientation civil rights law, the Save Our Children campaign became a national political cause. Bryant became the focus of the campaign, as noted by her husband that she was the "first person with a name" to become vocal about homosexuality; gay activists agreed, saying that other cities "haven't had a major personality come out and create a witch hunt. People have lost sight of the issue; the controversy has become personality oriented".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Jay (March 27, 1977). "Gay Rights Fight Shaping Up in Miami", ''The Washington Post'', p. A4.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to her, [[Bob Kunst]], who had experience as the publicist of the local municipal soccer team, the [[Miami Toros]], was a familiar name to the local press. Kunst, however, remained determined to act as an individual, often taking opportunities to give his views to the press that were not condoned by the Dade County Coalition on the Humanistic Rights of Gays.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes p. 81,&lt;/ref&gt; He took the view that it was the sexually enlightened stance to pass the ordinance, and those who opposed it were uptight, including, near the end of the campaign, Florida Governor [[Reubin O'Donovan Askew|Reubin Askew]]. He gave interviews addressing sexual liberation for gay and straight people, in which he freely spoke about [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="clendinen301"/&gt;

===Outside help===
[[File:Anita Bryant Sucks Oranges button.jpg|thumb|right|Campaign material was distributed around the country, reflecting the personal role Anita Bryant played in the campaign.]]

Homosexuals in Miami were not well-connected or experienced enough to combat the coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: [[Ethan Geto]] from [[New York City]] and [[Jim Foster (activist)|Jim Foster]] from [[San Francisco]], both of whom were gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often [[closeted]] gay community in Miami.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; When organizations outside of Florida promoted [[boycott]]ing Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men and lesbians.&lt;ref name="clendinen301"&gt;Clendinen, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of [[civil right]]s; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Save Our Children also received help from outside the area. [[North Carolina]] senator [[Jesse Helms]] offered his staff and funding from the [[Congressional Club]], and wrote in his column that he was proud of Bryant: "I have pledged my full support to her ... She is fighting for decency and morality in America—and that makes her, in my book, an all-American lady".&lt;ref name="young38"/&gt; Pastor [[Jerry Falwell]] from [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] lent his support during visits and with the appearance of B. Larry Coy, who served as a marriage counselor to Bryant and Green. Coy and Green took over management of Bryant's ministries.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bryant later accused Coy of working with Green to take over her ministries and control her completely, saying they formed a "devil's triangle" to form a "satanically self-righteous conspiracy" to deprive her of all control, including that of her own conscience. Bryant tried to fire him, to no avail. (Jahr, Cliff [December 1980]. "Anita Bryant's Startling Reversal", ''Ladies Home Journal'', p. 62–68)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months before the referendum vote, Bob Green, speaking for Bryant, vowed to lead her cause in all cities in the United States that protected sexual orientation from discrimination, saying that gay activists waged a "disguised attack on God", and Bryant would "lead such a crusade to stop it as this country has not seen before".&lt;ref&gt;Singer Pledges Anti-Gay Drive Nationwide", ''The Washington Post'' (March 28, 1977), p. D12.&lt;/ref&gt; As information was distributed against the referendum, as much literature was spread expressing local dissatisfaction with Bryant. T-shirts and campaign buttons were produced, showing "Anita Bryant Sucks Oranges" and "Squeeze a fruit for Anita".&lt;ref name="paterson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===

According to [[Florida Atlantic University]] Communications professor Fred Fejes, mainstream newspapers and magazines in the 1970s were hesitant to cover the issues of homosexuality or Christian fundamentalism in detail. Media prided themselves on objective reporting without Biblical judgment and at the same time, reporting was a homophobic profession that suppressed [[coming out|openly]] gay reporters and rarely addressed topics involving homosexuality.&lt;ref name="fejesmedia"&gt;Fejes, p. 101–107.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, during the 1970s fundamentalist Christians began to develop broadcasting over radio and television in the forms of ''[[The 700 Club]]'' run by [[Pat Robertson]], ''[[PTL Club]]'' hosted by [[Jim Bakker|Jim]] and [[Tammy Faye Bakker]], and [[Jerry Falwell]]'s ''[[Old Time Gospel Hour]]''.  These shows originated as praise and worship-oriented, but slowly incorporated political themes interspersed with messages of Christian faith. Bryant's appearances on the ''700 Club'' and the ''PTL Club'' netted the Save Our Children campaign $25,000 in donations, and assured her a position as a national spokesperson for traditional Christian values.&lt;ref name="fejesmedia"/&gt; However, when addressing a secular audience, Bryant was not as successful. During debates with Kunst and Shack she rarely made points that went beyond Bible quotes, and prayed when pressed to provide statistics on homosexuals as child molesters. At another appearance, she broke into "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" to take up time after she had read a pre-written statement. As California was experiencing a drought, Bryant connected it to their tolerance of liberals and homosexuals, and suggested that other morality laws should be enforced, such as those against [[adultery]] and cohabitation out of wedlock. Mike Thompson and Robert Brake soon restricted her to primarily religious shows.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clendinen306-307"&gt;Clendinen, p. 306–307.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the gay community promoted their causes using specialty magazines and newspapers. ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', a bi-weekly magazine, dedicated every issue starting in April 1977 to raising awareness of the battle taking place in Miami. It was run by [[David B. Goodstein|David Goodstein]], a friend of Jim Foster's who had worked with Foster to create the first gay Democratic club in the U.S. in the [[Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club]]. Goodstein warned that the fight would not end in Miami if the gay community lost, as did the local gay-focus newspapers of Boston's ''[[Gay Community News (Boston)|Gay Community News]]'' and San Francisco's ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name="fejesmedia"/&gt; Goodstein also suggested Bryant's primary motivation in her actions was furthering her career, or the beginning of "an organized conspiracy to turn (gays) into America's scapegoats".&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant's star power and her extreme views were highlighted in national news stories. Mainstream news outlets such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Associated Press]] and ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported weekly updates on campaign progress, with smaller local newspapers across the country weighing in their editorial opinions on which side should prevail. Bryant appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Her tone and accusations united gay men and lesbians in cities all over the U.S. In the weeks before the vote, almost $55,000 was raised outside of Florida to oppose Save Our Children.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Foreshadowing the effectiveness of the Save Our Children campaign, on April 13, 1977, the [[Florida Legislature]] voted not to ratify the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA), to the astonishment of those anticipating the vote. The connection between the ERA and ordinance 77-4 was obvious to many. Florida Senator [[Dempsey J. Barron|Dempsey Barron]] vocally opposed passing the ERA, fearing it would legalize [[same-sex marriage]]s, force people to use unisex bathrooms, and that it would harm laws meant to protect families.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Myra (April 14, 1977). "Florida Senate Rejects Equal Rights Amendment", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Organization for Women]] founder and ERA proponent [[Betty Friedan]] expressed her disdain, saying "suddenly you have this red herring in Anita Bryant. Suddenly you have this wave of anti-gay hysteria and then that was preempting the air waves behind the scenes".&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington D.C. mayor [[Marion Barry]], Los Angeles mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], President [[Jimmy Carter]] all expressed support for the ordinance. In ''The Miami Herald'', 51&amp;nbsp;members of [[Dutch Parliament]], ministers, and civil rights advocates from the [[Netherlands]] ran a full-page ad stating "We, from the land of [[Anne Frank]], know where prejudices and discrimination can lead to", advising the voters of Miami-Dade to uphold the ordinance to protect the rights of homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; California [[California State Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] and San Francisco sheriff [[Richard Hongisto]] campaigned respectively for Miami's black community and law enforcement. Hongisto returned to California saying that Save Our Children made an issue of the existence of San Francisco when Thompson referred to the city as "a cesspool of perversion gone rampant" and Bob Green expressed doubt that saving San Francisco was possible.&lt;ref name="clendinen306-307"/&gt; Reverend Jerry Falwell spoke at a rally as the vote neared, telling the audience, "I want to tell you we are dealing with a vile and vicious and vulgar gang. They'd kill you as quick as look at you."&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [[ref Miami Herald May 23, 1977]] --&gt;

===Community attitudes===

Foster and Geto set the public tone of the campaign battling Save Our Children and were determined not to "get down in the gutter with them", refusing to run an ad showing Bryant in a revealing outfit she had worn while performing in 1971, nor run commercials to point out that child molesters were primarily heterosexual. However, they also encountered difficulty when local newspapers refused to run ads that were designed to appeal to Miami's sizable Jewish community, equating Bryant's rhetoric with the same language that many Miami citizens faced during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-eight of Miami's thirty-four rabbis agreed with Bryant and her campaign–the president of the Miami Beach [[B'nai B'rith]] served as an officer of the Save Our Children coalition.&lt;ref name="young38"&gt;Young, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami's Cuban community came together as never before for the campaign, taking the opportunity to register thousands of voters who had never taken part in politics in the city. Bryant actively campaigned to the Cuban community, telling them at a rally, "You came here to get away from one sin ... and it breaks my heart that if Miami becomes another [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] you may have to leave here, too."&lt;ref name="paterson"&gt;Paterson, Bill (June 6, 1977). "Fear Intense on Both Sides of Gay Rights Vote Tuesday", ''The Washington Post'', p. A2.&lt;/ref&gt; A Cuban social worker  suggested the cause was representative of an older generation of Cuban emigres, worried that their children were being lost in the depravity of Miami.&lt;ref name="rich"&gt;Rich, Ruby, Arguelles, Lourdes (Autumn 1985). "Homosexuality, Homophobia, and Revolution: Notes toward an Understanding of the Cuban Lesbian and Gay Male Experience, Part II", ''Signs'', '''11''' (1) p. 120-136.&lt;/ref&gt; Miami's archbishop wrote a letter against the gay rights ordinance, and ordered it to be read aloud in all Catholic churches.&lt;ref name="young38"/&gt;

The response from Miami's black community was more conflicted. ''[[The Miami Times]]'', a widely respected black newspaper, called Bryant's tactics "pure bullshit" and urged local blacks not to vote for anything that would discriminate against anyone. However, black audiences reacted angrily during an appearance featuring Bryant and another with Kunst and white ministers from the [[Metropolitan Community Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the intensely closeted nature of Miami's gay community at that time, many voters who were not swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; they were unable to see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advent of [[second wave feminism]] earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, for the first time in years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, Lindsy (September, 1977). "Anita Bryant on the March,  ''Ms.'', p. 75–78, 100–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election results===
The vote results in a special June election were overwhelming. It was the largest turnout in any special election in the history of Dade County. Voters supported repealing the gay rights ordinance by a margin of more than two to one. Bryant danced a jig when the response was announced, and told reporters "All America and all the world will hear what the people have said, and with God's continued help, we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation which attempt to legitimize a life style that is both perverse and dangerous".&lt;ref name="ayres"&gt;Ayres, B. Drummond, "Miami Votes 2 to 1 to Repeal Law Barring Bias Against Homosexuals", ''The New York Times'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Gay Task Force]] (NGTF) co-director [[Jean O'Leary]] said that the result was "all the evidence anyone could need of the extent and virulence of prejudice against lesbians and gay men in our society".&lt;ref name="ayres"/&gt;

==Response==

In New York City, [[Bella Abzug]], who had introduced the first gay civil rights bill in U.S. Congress in 1974, was awoken at 2 am by people in the street chanting her name. "It was hard not to feel sad for this crowd", Abzug said of the several hundred people below her window. She was optimistic, telling them the defeat would develop a maturity and determination in gay activism.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time that evening, about 3,000 gay men and lesbians spontaneously gathered in what had become the largest gay neighborhood in the United States—[[Castro District|Castro Street]] in San Francisco—furious at the loss in Dade County. The crowd marched around the Castro District, chanting "We Are Your Children!" pulling people out of gay bars to cheers.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Ivan (June 8, 1977). "Angry Gays March Through S.F.", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Local gay activist and future supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] led marchers through a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} course through the city, careful not to stop for too long lest rioting began. He addressed the crowd with a bullhorn: "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force".&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the vote, Jean O'Leary and NGTF co-director [[Bruce Voeller]] said Bryant was doing "an enormous favor" for the gay community by focusing national media attention on discrimination against them.&lt;ref name="oleary"&gt;O'Leary, Jean, Voeller, Bruce, (June 7, 1977). "Anita Bryant's Crusade", ''The New York Times'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks later at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, 250,000&amp;nbsp;people attended, becoming the largest attendance at any gay event in U.S. history to that point. The largest group of the parade held large placards of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Idi Amin]], a [[Cross burning|burning cross]], and Anita Bryant. Other cities also saw greater participation in Gay Pride events. People marching in New York's Gay Pride observance shouted "No more Miamis". Thousands of people attended events in [[Seattle]], [[Boston]], [[Cleveland]], and [[Atlanta]]. [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] observed its first Gay Pride demonstration with 30&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest gay newspaper in [[Australia]] used the Dade County vote as a warning advising gay men and lesbians there to "Get off Your Butts". More than 300&amp;nbsp;people held a vigil at the American embassy in the Netherlands, accusing the U.S. government of failing to protect their citizens' human rights. Four thousand marchers in [[Spain]] were dispersed by rubber bullets. Gay activists in [[Paris]] and [[London]] also warned that similar challenges could occur in their cities.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', conservative columnist [[William Safire]] wrote that Miami's gay activists had been justifiably defeated: "In the eyes of the vast majority, homosexuality is an abnormality, a mental illness, even—to use an old-fashioned word—a sin. Homosexuality is not the 'alternative lifestyle' the gay activists profess; it may be tolerable, even acceptable—but not approvable."&lt;ref name="safire"&gt;Safire, William (June 9, 1977). "Now Ease Up, Anita", ''The New York Times'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Safire, however, tempered the column (titled "Now Ease Up, Anita") cautioning against Bryant's promised nationwide crusade designed to lead to further repeal of homosexuals' "legitimate civil rights".&lt;ref name="safire"/&gt;

A [[Connecticut]]-based charity for unprivileged children named [[Save the Children]] filed an injunction in July 1977 against the Miami coalition to prevent them from using the name, and Bryant from using it as a title for a book she was writing; Save the Children lost donations due to the confusion between the names.&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-Homosexual Group Barred From Use of Name", ''The New York Times'' (July 16, 1977) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, the coalition was known as "Protect the Children" and focused completely on moral legislation against militant homosexuality, pornography, and images of sex and violence on television. It was renamed to Anita Bryant Ministries.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Violence===

Two weeks after the Dade County vote, a gardener who worked for the City of San Francisco named Robert Hillsborough was stabbed 15 times in his face and chest while his attackers chanted "[[Faggot (slang)|Faggot]]" at him. Hillsborough's mother and San Francisco mayor [[George Moscone]] blamed Bryant's rhetoric for his death and 200,000&amp;nbsp;San Francisco residents joined a memorial demonstration for him. Mrs. Hillsborough brought a $5 million civil suit against Anita Bryant claiming Hillsborough's attackers said "Here's one for Anita".&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; She said, "I didn't think much about Anita Bryant's campaign at first. Now that my son's murder has happened, I think about the Bryant campaign a lot. Anyone who wants to carry on this kind of thing must be sick. My son's blood is on her hands."&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant, Green, Mike Thompson and Save Our Children were dismissed from the suit in November 1977.&lt;ref&gt;"Anita Bryant Is Dropped As Defendant in Lawsuit", ''The New York Times'', November 18, 1977. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several suicides were connected to the campaign, including a Cuban gay activist in Miami named Ovidio "Herbie" Ramos, who was stunned at the vehemence against homosexuals. He and several other Cuban gay activists participated in a radio call-in show to hear people say homosexuals should be deported, forced into [[concentration camp]]s, or executed. Ramos shot himself a few days later after telling a friend, "I didn't know they hated us so much".&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Cuban gay activist named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami.&lt;ref name="rich"/&gt; Gay activists in [[New Orleans]] tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, "It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would think I had anything to do with it, but my conscience is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them."&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Duberman calls the equation of homosexuals to child molesters "the most potent weapon in the anti-gay arsenal—and the most impervious to factual refutation". Duberman, Martin (1977), "The Anita Bryant Brigade" in ''We Are Everywhere'' (1997), Routledge. ISBN 0-415-90859-0: After the Dade County vote, columnist George Will asked in Newsweek if the removal of homosexuality as a mental disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was a wise decision. --&gt;

===Economic retaliation===

The economic response to the vote was swift and decisive. Bryant worked only twice during 1977, and lost most of her paid appearances after that. She had recently finished an album named ''There's Nothing Like the Love Between a Man and a Woman''; record companies chose to not distribute it. [[Singer Corporation|Singer Sewing Machines]] canceled negotiations for a television variety show. She was replaced after ten years of hosting the Orange Bowl Parade by [[Rita Moreno]], who was older and who had recently performed in a gay-themed film, ''[[The Ritz (film)|The Ritz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant and Green held a press conference and claimed Bryant was being [[blacklist]]ed, and that a national conspiracy was underway by the nation's homosexuals to deprive her of her livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Hally, Larry (August 1, 2007). "Anita Bryant's Rise and Fall Was Captured During Visits", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the charge "unlikely", and network executives denied gay pressure was behind their decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915719,00.html The Gaycott Turns Ugly], ''Time'', November 21, 1977. Retrieved on November 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant's claim of being blacklisted brought a tide of condemnation against the perceived pressure by gay organizations. Three major newspapers supported Bryant's right to [[free speech]].&lt;!-- [[ref this from the New York Times, Washington Post, and Miami Herald]]--&gt; Years later, she admitted that some of the statements made about her cancellations were exaggerated for effect, but that the tactic worked against her, as more organizations and companies canceled her performances.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1992), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant became the butt of jokes on television shows and film, even by former colleague [[Bob Hope]].&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Everywhere she went in the days after the vote she was met with noisy protests: [[Norfolk, Virginia]]—where demonstrators interrupted her presentation so forcefully she began crying—[[Chicago]], and dozens of other cities. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] claiming they were there to protect her.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a [[Toronto]] religious performance. Although she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 169–169.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Houston]] Bryant was invited to perform for the [[State Bar of Texas|Texas State Bar Association]] two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance at the Hyatt Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500&amp;nbsp;people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number.&lt;ref name="houston"&gt;Fisher, Binnie (June 25, 2004). "Houston's Stonewall Took Place June 16, 1977", ''The Houston Voice'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] walked out and joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never seen so many gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: "If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, we would have had to invent her". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the [[Stonewall riots]].&lt;ref name="houston"/&gt;

The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its commitment to Bryant by stating that it "wholeheartedly support(ed)" her right to free speech, praising her "courageous leadership on a moral issue that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; at one point the U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Citrus Commission, p. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt; The publicity director for the [[Florida Department of Citrus]] told a reporter from the Associated Press, "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose. I wish she would just resign."&lt;ref&gt;"Bryant: Still 'Effective?'&amp;nbsp;", ''The Washington Post'' (June 20, 1977), p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Citrus Commission, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other locations==

In the weeks after the Dade County vote, [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], and [[Palm Beach, Florida]], and [[Austin, Texas]], all rejected ordinances to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] overturned its own rules they had set earlier in the year to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing.&lt;ref name=fejes155-156&gt;Fejes, p. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15&amp;nbsp;years had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Richard, (June 20, 1977). "A 'No' to the Gays", ''Newsweek'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator [[Paula Hawkins]] had also been dismissed.&lt;ref name=fejes155-156/&gt; Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of [[Aspen, Colorado]], [[Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]], [[Iowa City, Iowa]], [[Wichita, Kansas]], and the very liberal [[Eugene, Oregon]] to pass gay rights ordinances.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Minneapolis–St. Paul===

Only three weeks before the voter referendum in Dade County, a state gay rights law to protect homosexuals from discrimination in employment, public services, and housing in [[Minnesota]] was defeated. The loss was due in large part to the efforts of the [[Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]], and once more, caught gay activists completely by surprise. The Twin Cities' gay community was much more active than Miami's; both Minneapolis and St. Paul had passed gay rights laws three years before. State senator [[Allan Spear]]—the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the U.S.—served in St. Paul. Spear called it a "victory for bigots" on the senate floor, then went into his office and cried.&lt;ref name="clendinen316-317"&gt;Clendinen, p. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of guerrilla activists struck Archbishop [[John Roach (bishop)|John Roach]] a week after the vote by throwing a chocolate cream pie at him as he spoke to receive the National Brotherhood Award from the [[National Conference of Christians and Jews]].&lt;ref name="clendinen316-317"/&gt;

Following the pie attack on the archbishop, two of Allan Spear's colleagues invited Anita Bryant to come to St. Paul to overturn their three-year-old gay rights ordinance, and announced Save Our Children would be opening a branch there. Local activists did not think much of their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolis—St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant and her husband were in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras and mashed a [[strawberry rhubarb pie]] in her face. Bryant was stunned and bowed her head as she and Green held hands and prayed for Higgins. She quickly quipped "At least it's a fruit pie." An image of her covered with the pastry appeared on the front page of ''The New York Times'' the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Notes on People," ''The New York Times'' (October 15, 1977) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1977, however, a petition drive was organized by Temple Baptist Church to put St. Paul's ordinance to a citywide vote. Volunteers endured below freezing temperatures to collect more than 7,000&amp;nbsp;signatures; their leader, Richard Angwin, pastor of Temple Baptist reasoned, "I don't want to live in a community that gives respect to homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Angwin used the same strategy as the Miami campaign, tapping the resources of Bryant, Green, and their pastor in Miami. Jerry Falwell held a rally where Bryant was advertised to appear, but Green replaced her at the last minute. At the rally Angwin told the audience "Homosexuality is a murderous, horrendous, twisted act. It is a sin and a powerful, addictive lust."&lt;ref name="Clendinen, p. 327"&gt;Clendinen, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fejes172-173"&gt;Fejes, pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay activists in St. Paul also borrowed from Miami, taking Jack Campbell's donor list and some strategies. However, similar to Miami, many gays and lesbians in St. Paul were hesitant to come out and could not make a solid case for discrimination; most of the activists were from Minneapolis. Gay activists were also split in strategy, much like in Miami. A more mainstream group named the St. Paul Citizens for Human Rights (SPCHR) opted to treat the issue as one of civil and human rights. A more radical group of gays named the Target City Coalition—those who had arranged the pieing of the archbishop—saw the issue as one of sexual liberation and grabbed the most media attention by highlighting some of the more flamboyant parts of the gay community. ''The Advocate'' wrote that they were "the most stoned-out, off-the-wall, bona-fide crackpots yet to appear in the gay rights cause."&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; The Target City Coalition invited Bob Kunst to St. Paul, where he spoke of sexual liberation and the need to reach out to gay youth. Allan Spear, supportive ministers, and other members of SPCHR went on local television to debate the civil rights issue. Reverend Angwin stumped Spear and his cohorts by showing them an advertisement placed by the Target City Coalition in a local gay paper appealing to gay teenagers, that offered them "free prostate rubs."&lt;ref name="fejes172-173"/&gt;

St. Paul's special election day was April 25, 1978. Again, more than the usual number of voters appeared for a special election, who again, overturned the city's gay rights ordinance by more than two to one.&lt;ref name="Clendinen, p. 327"/&gt;

===Eugene, Oregon===

The ordinance that had recently passed in Eugene was met with a different strategy of opposition. Eugene was a college town so liberal the [[Grateful Dead]] spent their summers there. A housewife named Lynne Greene rejected the Biblical rhetoric offered by Bryant and instead argued that since gays already had the protection they needed under the law further legislation was unnecessary. Since homosexuality was a chosen lifestyle, they reasoned, homosexuals were not a minority and needed no protection. Acknowledging the rights of gays would lead the law to give them rights to marry, and adopt children.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Although gay rights advocates worked differently in Eugene, registering many new voters and seeing lesbians significantly working the campaign for the first time, their opposition worked steadily by canvassing neighborhoods. Most of their volunteers were members of conservative churches, and the message was similar to recent campaigns: "Keep it straight. Our children come first," but the Eugene campaign lacked the sensational aspect as those in Miami and St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once more in nearly a two to one margin, the gay rights ordinance was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were not gay simply declined to show up and vote, and those who opposed the ordinance were much more motivated.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wichita, Kansas===

Anita Bryant lent her support to the effort in Wichita, which was led by a minister named Ron Adrian. They used a similar strategy, printing a full-page ad in ''[[The Wichita Eagle]]'' with newspaper clippings connecting gays to child molestation. They raised approximately $50,000 and used the network of churches, local media, and a highly organized grassroots voter registration and mobilization drive. Campaign literature focused on the aspect gay visibility, and the dangers of gays as role models for children: "There is a real danger that homosexual teachers, social workers or counselors, simply by public acknowledgment of their lifestyles, can encourage sexual deviation in children."&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919647,00.html Voting Against Gay Rights], ''Time'', May 22, 1978. Retrieved November 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the very small and closeted gay community raised only $6,000; the National Gay Task Force was so pessimistic they offered no assistance at all. Bryant attended a rally stating the law would give homosexuals "special rights ... and next you will have thieves, prostitutes and people who have relations with St. Bernards asking for the same rights". The Wichita ordinance was defeated by a five to one margin leaving Ron Adrian ecstatic.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seattle, Washington===

Seattle in 1977 was a liberal city that had passed a gay rights ordinance in 1973, and whose mayor had just declared a Gay Pride Week for June. When a police officer named David Estes learned of the mayor's gesture, he decided to take action. Estes was a member of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], and regarded gay men as "mentally disturbed" according to his religious opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Estes designed a ballot measure named Initiative Thirteen that would overturn the existing gay rights ordinance, but also allowed the mere accusation of homosexuality to be the basis for dismissal from a job or eviction from a residence. Also included in the proposed law was the prospect of shifting the responsibility of enforcing Initiative Thirteen to a city department already overtaxed with investigating claims of bias against blacks and women.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Estes' organization attracted a $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes planned to use the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with him because he was a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of [[syphilis]]. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect who turned out to be a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone of the Seattle campaign against Initiative Thirteen was different from those in Miami and St. Paul; it focused consistently on privacy and civil rights. Instead of educating the public about different subcultures in the gay community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole and a family living in a fishbowl.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; High-profile liberal figures, labor unions, and other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; David Estes did not have the enthusiasm and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics. On election day, Initiative Thirteen was rejected by 63%.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
{{See|Briggs Initiative}}

A day after the Dade County repeal, State Assemblyman [[Art Agnos]], who represented portions of San Francisco with a very high population of gays and lesbians, decided not to submit a gay civil rights bill to the state legislature, reasoning that it no longer had any support.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts (1982), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; California state senator [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]], from [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] was in the crowd with Anita Bryant the night she and Save Our Children won the Dade County vote.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts (1982), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Greatly impressed by the voter turnout, Briggs had designs to win the race for governor of California for 1978. When he returned from Miami, since there was no gay rights law to overturn, he proposed a law to forbid employing openly gay public school teachers and other workers. The bill, Proposition 6—nicknamed the [[Briggs Initiative]]—was written so broadly that it also allowed the dismissal of any public school employee for supporting gay rights including voting against Proposition 6, regardless of their sexual orientation. He stated, "What I am after is to remove those homosexual teachers who through word, thought or deed want to be a public homosexual, to entice young impressionable children into their lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs announced the proposition on the steps of [[San Francisco City Hall]], after notifying several local gay organizations of his intentions. The city had experienced an influx of so many gay people in the past ten years that they counted as a quarter of its voting population.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay activists, newly alarmed at the threat to their rights, confronted vice president [[Walter Mondale]] at a political rally in San Francisco two weeks after the announcement of Proposition 6. Mondale ran with Jimmy Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human rights as their first priority, and he was there to address the subject pertaining to [[Latin America]]. When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts (1982), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Briggs named his organization California Defend Our Children (CDOC) to avoid legal problems with the Connecticut charity, and used the same strategies as Save Our Children: collages of newspaper headlines about child molesters, and because a proposition was on the ballot regarding the [[death penalty]] in California, CDOC campaign literature urged voters to "act now to help protect your family from vicious killers and defend your children from homosexual teachers".&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs placed minister [[Lou Sheldon]] in charge of CDOC.

A significant difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend [[Troy Perry]], who began his career as a charismatic preacher in the [[Church of God of Prophecy]] but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood stars [[Bette Midler]], [[Lily Tomlin]], and [[Richard Pryor]] came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1978 [[Harvey Milk]] took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, John (June 26, 1978). "An Ecumenical Alliance on the Serious Side of 'Gay' ", ''The San Francisco Examiner'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategies of gay activists were once again split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy and the rights of teachers. In ''The Advocate'', Goodstein urged gays not to live up to stereotypes and let the professionals try to win.&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as [[Morris Kight]], who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective. Women were highly visible in the campaign, raising about the same amount of money as men. However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by [[Rock Hudson]].&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the broad nature of the law, as it would have allowed the firing of public school employees for the way they voted or spoke their opinions in favor of gay rights, conservative Republican politicians spoke out against it. Primarily, former governor [[Ronald Reagan]] voiced his opinion, saying "Prop. 6 is not needed to protect our children. We have that legal protection now. It could be very costly to implement and has the potential for causing undue harm to people."&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's statement turned public opinion against the proposition almost overnight. Gay activists were not optimistic in light of the record of voter turnout against them in the previous year, but they were overwhelmed to learn that on election day more than a million voters turned out to strike down the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on Bryant==

Bryant and Bob Green were divorced in May 1979, in a dispute made public through newspapers.&lt;!-- [[ref=Miami Herald]] --&gt; Bryant moved to [[Alabama]] and gave a candid interview to ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' in 1980 where she told the details of her marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been "married for the wrong reasons" and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce.&lt;ref name="jahr"/&gt; Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ({{inflation|USD|700000|1976|fmt=eq}} dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family.&lt;ref name="jahr"/&gt; Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation.&lt;ref name="jahr"&gt;Jahr, Cliff (December 1980). "Anita Bryant's Startling Reversal", ''Ladies Home Journal'', p. 62–68.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way," and feminism: "The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible."&lt;ref name="jahr"/&gt;

Bryant's career did not recover. She attempted to stage comebacks in [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]] in 1992, [[Branson, Missouri]] in 1994 ("People who come to my performances are hungry for the truth. They thank me for reminding them of the importance of God and country."&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Harry (March 7, 1994). "Anita Bryant: It's Nice to Be Vindicated", ''People'' '''41''' (9), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] in 1997. However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent.&lt;ref name="tobin"&gt;Tobin, Thomas (April 28, 2002). "Bankruptcy, ill will plague Bryant", ''St. Petersburg Times'', p. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed [[bankruptcy]] in three states. As of 2006 Bryant was living in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anitabmi.org/3.html Anita Bryant Ministries], (2006). Retrieved on November 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Bob Green counted the campaign and its aftermath as factors in strengthening his faith. The breakdown of the marriage he attributed on the pressures put on Bryant, and blamed gays and lesbians for his emotional devastation after the divorce: "Their goal was to put (Bryant) out of business and destroy her career. And that's what they did. It's unfair."&lt;ref name="rothausgreen"&gt;Rothaus, Steve (June 9, 2007). [http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2007/06/bob_green_anita.html Bob Green: Anita's ex paid dearly in the fight], ''The Miami Herald'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Green said he would not have done it again if he had to: "It just wasn't worth it... The trauma, the battling we all got caught up in. I don't want to ever go back to that."&lt;ref name="rothausgreen"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Green died January 26, 2012 at 80 years old. (Elinor J.

==Significance==
===Moral Majority===
[[File:Save Our Children Fundraising card.jpg|thumb|250 px|Fundraising card used by Bryant and Save Our Children; their strategies offered a basis for the [[Moral Majority]], who claimed to be saving America from immorality and communism in the 1980s]]
{{See|Moral Majority}}

The Save Our Children campaign was an intensely focused effort by conservative forces, many of whom received inspiration from previous controversies in the 1970s. Not since the [[Scopes Trial]] about the legality of teaching [[evolution]] in public schools in 1925 had religious organizations made earnest attempts to influence politics on such a wide scale.&lt;ref&gt;Georgianna, pp. iii, 11–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Fejes credits the Save Our Children campaign as a significant factor in the rise of conservative Christian activism, noting "This was the beginning of the culture wars".&lt;ref name="tanasychuk"/&gt; Ruth Shack points to the connection between the rise of the [[New Right]] and the Save Our Children campaign: "Back in 1977, there was no organized religious right per se. Anita Bryant was a pioneer."&lt;ref name="rothaus"&gt;Rothaus, Steve (June 9, 2007). [http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2007/06/gay_rights_deba.html Gay rights debate rages on 30 years after Miami-Dade challenge], ''The Miami Herald'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s the Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]] moved from presiding over the [[megachurch]] [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] and hosting the ''Old Time Gospel Hour'', to being involved in politics. Falwell took credit for defeating the Dade County gay rights ordinance and the failure of the ERA in Florida. He developed a campaign called [[Clean Up America]] in 1977 that was a fundraising vehicle for his television show. Falwell sent letters asking for donations, which included questionnaires asking "Do you approve of known practicing homosexuals teaching in public schools?" that he promised would be sent to politicians; he distributed information about how to put together political groups to influence elections and lawmakers.&lt;ref name="fitzgerald"&gt;[[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|FitzGerald, Frances]], (May 18, 1981). [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1981/05/18/1981_05_18_053_TNY_CARDS_000336703 "A Reporter at Large: A Disciplined, Charging Army"], ''The New Yorker''. Retrieved November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Falwell spearheaded a coalition of religious groups that included Catholics, fundamentalist Protestants, Mormons, and Orthodox Jews that he called the [[Moral Majority]], which developed a branch dedicated to political action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1621300,00.html |title=Jerry Falwell, Political Innovator |first=Michael |last=Duffy |date=May 15, 2007 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falwell declared in 1965 that he had no business in politics,&lt;ref&gt;Georgianna, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; but justified his involvement and the inevitable mix of religion and government with evidence that the social problems of abortion, [[pornography]], sexual immorality, and drugs were bringing the United States to a dangerous precipice where [[communism]] would prevail over Christianity.&lt;ref name="fitzgerald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falwell, pp. 365, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falwell claimed that the [[grassroots]] efforts of the Moral Majority—registering millions of voters, informing the public, and using the media—had been a significant factor in the election of President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;Falwell, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982 they had a budget of $1 million and millions of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Falwell, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, gay men were being stricken with [[AIDS]], desperate for money for research and services. Spokesmen for the Moral Majority connected it to God's will, asserting the general public needed protection from "the gay plague", and warned, "If homosexuals are not stopped they will infect the entire nation and America will be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Shilts (1986), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay activism===

Just as the Save Our Children campaign was a motivational force for conservative Christians, it was also one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, "While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have marked the beginning of the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community".&lt;ref&gt;Fejes, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the [[Stonewall Library &amp; Archives]] sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the [[Broward County]] Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered "the best thing to happen to the gay rights movement. She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement".&lt;ref name="tanasychuk"&gt;Tanasychuk, John (June 4, 2007). "Exhibit Marks 30th Anniversary of How Anita Bryant Fought—and Helped—Gay Rights", ''The South Florida Sun-Sentinel'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco author [[Armistead Maupin]] was writing his installments of individual stories in a column for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' titled ''[[Tales of the City]]'' in 1977. He remembered, "I know what the battle did for me: It forced me to confront my own residual self-loathing and stare it down once and for all by coming out."&lt;ref name="maupin"&gt;Maupin, Armistead (November 12, 2002). "Gods &amp; Monsters", ''The Advocate'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Maupin used the next installment of ''Tales'' to have one of his gay characters come out to his parents who, by remarkable coincidence, Maupin had previously established as Florida citrus growers.&lt;ref name="maupin"/&gt;

Political activism in American gay communities was transformed by the arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used [[direct action]] tactics. [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP), formed by [[Larry Kramer]] and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups [[Queer Nation]], [[the Pink Panthers]] and the [[Lesbian Avengers]], that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

While Save Our Children may have been a temporary setback for the gay community in Florida, LGBT activists in Florida would go on to win numerous victories in the future, from the re-enactment of the non-discrimination ordinance in Miami-Dade County, to the enactment of such ordinances elsewhere throughout the state, to [[In re: Gill|the legalization of gay adoption]] to [[Brenner v. Scott|marriage equality]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18775">The '''School of Fascist Mysticism''' (Italian: ''Scuola di mistica fascista Sandro Italico Mussolini'') was established in [[Milan, Italy]] in 1930 by [[Niccolò Giani]]. Its primary goal was to train the future leaders of Italy's [[National Fascist Party]]. The school curriculum promoted [[Fascist mysticism]] based on the philosophy of [[Fideism]],&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Emilio Longo, I vincitori della guerra perduta (sezione su Niccolò Giani), Edizioni Settimo sigillo, Roma, 2003, pag.81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.123&lt;/ref&gt; the belief that faith and reason were incompatible; Fascist mythology was to be accepted as a "metareality".&lt;ref name="Payne 1996 215"&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|title=A History of Fascism, 1914-1945|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=9781857285956|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Mussolini described Fascism as "a religious concept of life", saying that Fascists formed a "spiritual community".&lt;ref name="Payne 1996 215"/&gt;

==The School==

===Founding of the School===
The School was founded through the efforts of [[Niccolò Giani]] and the Milan [[Gruppo Universitario Fascista]], a youth wing of the National Fascist Party for university students. It was formed April 10, 1930 at the ''Casa del Fascio'' (Fascist House) at piazza Belgioioso ([[Belgioioso Square]]), part of the [[Istituto Fascista di Cultura]] (Fascist Institute of Culture).&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Grandi, Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista, Milano, Rizzoli (Edizioni BUR), 2004, pag. 32-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Pollini]] presided at the meeting. These two organizations had the right to choose the nominal director.

Giani anticipated the opening on April 4, in an article in the GUF newspaper ''"Libro e moschetto"'' (''Book and Musket'')&lt;ref name=autogenerato3&gt;Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 50&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Fascist Mysticism was founded that same Spring in Milan, under the patronage of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s brother, [[Arnaldo Mussolini]], and in the presence of Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]].&lt;ref&gt;Attilio Tamaro, Venti anni di storia 1922–1943, Editrice Tiber, Roma, pag.430&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milanese institution was first located in [[San Francesco d'Assisi]] Street to gather its first staff members, and held its first directors' meeting on April 10, in the [[casa del fascio]] (Fascist House) in [[piazza Belgioioso]] ([[Belgioioso Square]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerato3 /&gt; Several active Fascist Party members participated, including the Secretary of the GUF, [[Andrea Ippoliti]]. Giani explained the objectives of the creation of the school were not to create a duplicate of one of the many organizations of the regime, but to achieve a complete education for students enrolled in GUF.&lt;ref name=autogenerato3 /&gt;

===Headquarters at via Pellico===
{{further|Fascist mysticism}}
Following its relocation via [[Silvio Pellico]] (Pellico Street), the School was named ''[[Sandro Italico Mussolini]]'', on November 29, 1931. On the same day, [[Arnaldo Mussolini]] gave the speech "''Coscienza e dovere''" (Conscience and Duty), launching the school year, and providing the blueprint for the fundamental principles, or rules, of the School,&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.33&lt;/ref&gt; expanded by Giani later.
From October 9 to October 15, 1932, [[Niccolò Giani]] wrote a type of program manifesto, establishing the founding principles of the School:
{{blockquote|Our task must focus only on coordinating, interpreting and processing the thought of the [[Duce]]. That's because it is a sort of mystical Fascist school and here is its task: to develop and specify the new values that are in the Fascist work of Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Giani, La marcia sul mondo, Novantico Editore, Pinerolo, 2010, pag.102&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The School proposed the goal of reviving the spirit of Fascism, the battlefield trench (recalling Italy's role in [[World War I]]) and the first years of the movement, delivered ideally through a new generation.&lt;ref name="pdfcast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pdfcast.org/pdf/la-scuola-di-mistica-fascista-una-pagina-poco-nota-del-fascismo |title=La Scuola di mistica fascista - Una pagina poco nota del Fascismo |publisher=pdfcast.org |accessdate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730103446/http://pdfcast.org/pdf/la-scuola-di-mistica-fascista-una-pagina-poco-nota-del-fascismo |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed in particular to be the center of political education for future leaders of Italian [[Fascism]]. The key principles on which the teaching was based were: voluntary activism; faith in Italy, from which it was believed faither in [[Benito Mussolini]] and Fascism derived; anti-[[rationalism]]; a mixture of religion and politics ; teachings against [[liberal democracy]] ([[Liberal democracy|constitutional democracy]]) and [[socialism]]; and a cult of [[Ancient Rome]] (''romanità'').

Giani was made the School's first Director, and the School's first President was [[Vito Mussolini]], Benito Mussolini's nephew. [[Ferdinando Mezzasoma]] was made Vice-President. [[Luigi Stefanini]] acted as an official "consultant" to the School for many years. In via Pellico, they had several offices, where it was easier to organize their work space, and inside they kept around five thousand volumes, mainly about Fascism but also other publications, such as a collection of issues by the socialist newspaper [[L'Avanti]] published by the [[Confederazione Generale del Lavoro]] (General Labour Confederation).&lt;ref name=autogenerato4&gt;Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 51&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous courses were given on a variety of subjects.&lt;ref name=autogenerato4 /&gt; The School's main activity was organizing conventions and conferences on issues related to Fascism.&lt;ref name="autogenerato4"/&gt; Courses covered a range of topics, but mainly focused on Fascism.&lt;ref name=autogenerato4 /&gt;

The School became the editor of a series of books dealing with different issues. From 1937, under the initiative of Giani, the School published a magazine, ''[[Dottrina fascista]]'' (''Fascist Doctrine''), and in 1939 published the "Decalogo dell'italiano nuovo", (''New Italian Decalogue (Ten Commandments)''), written and delivered as a speech by [[Arnaldo Mussolini]], brother of Benito Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Grandi, ''Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista'', cit., pag.34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of the "Covo" (Cave)===
In 1939, during a ceremony presided over by [[Achille Starace]], Secretary of the [[National Fascist Party]], the official headquarters moved to the offices that housed Mussolini's newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' during its infancy, called "il Covo" (the Cave). The "Covo" over the years had been transformed into a permanent museum of the Fascist Revolution, and since November 15, 1939 the entire building had been declared a "national monument" with an "honour guard" made of fighters from the [[squadrismo]] (squadristi) and veterans.&lt;ref name=autogenerato1&gt;Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 52&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, by an explicit decision by Mussolini,&lt;ref name=autogenerato1 /&gt; it was officially handed over to the students of the school, at an event that was conducted as a consecration of Giani's students, reunited around him.&lt;ref name=autogenerato1 /&gt; In reality the transition had been ordered on October 18, 1939, as shown on the sheet of orders of the [[National Fascist Party]] from that date,&lt;ref name=autogenerato1 /&gt; at which time the Board had been received in [[Rome]] by Mussolini. Mussolini had encouraged them to continue their activities. {{blockquote|Fascism must have its missionaries, that is, men who know how to convey the uncompromising faith and fight to the ultimate sacrifice for their faith. Every revolution has three stages: it begins with the mystical, it continues with the policy, you end up with the administration. When a revolution becomes an administration, one can say it's over, liquidated ...&lt;ref name=autogenerato2&gt;Giacomo De Antonellis, Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista, su storia illustrata n° 243 del febbraio 1978, pag 53&lt;/ref&gt;}} The School of Fascist Mysticism's directors intended to use the old location of "[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]" to turn it into a "Shrine of the Fascist Revolution", by creating displays with [[Fasci italiani di combattimento]] and early years of Fascism memorabilia on the first floor. On the second and third floors, memorabilia and documents relating to the years leading up to the 1922 [[March on Rome]] were to be displayed, and finally the most recent years were to be exhibited on the fourth floor.&lt;ref name=autogenerato2 /&gt;

==Conflict with the Catholic Church==
In 1929, Mussolini signed a Lateran Pact with the Roman Catholic Church. Intended to set down the rights of the Catholic Church in Italy, it was signed one year before the founding of the School of Fascist Mysticism. The religious component recalls the experiments in government-created religions during the [[French Revolution]]: [[Joseph Fouché]]'s attempts to install a [[Cult of Reason]], and [[Maximilien Robespierre]]'s attempts to install a [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], during the [[Reign of Terror]]. Fouché and Robespierre had the goal of eliminating the Roman Catholic Church in France and replacing it with a secular, state-organized religion. Mussolini denied that this was the goal of Fascist mysticism, or that it in any way represented a conflict with Roman Catholicism. At the time, nearly all Italians belonged to Roman Catholic Church, and the Pope was Italian and Bishop of Rome. The Catholic Church ran nearly all schools, hospitals, and many other institutions in Italy, and was powerful around the world. Shortly after the founding of the School of Fascist Mysticism, Mussolini began suppression of Catholic organizations, including the laypersons' [[Azione Cattolica]] organization, deemed to be interfering in the cultural and social activities under the control of the state. In 1931, the Pope was compelled to issue a public, formal [[papal encyclical]], ''Non abbiamo bisogno'', denouncing the "pagan idolatry of the state" being introduced to Italy by Mussolini.&lt;ref name="Payne 1996 215"/&gt;

In a 1934 interview with French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'', Mussolini stated, "In the Fascist concept of the totalitarian state, religion is absolutely free, and, in its own sphere, independent. The crazy idea of founding a new religion of the state or of subordinating to the state the religion of all Italians has never entered our minds". On the other hand, Mussolini also stated in the same interview that "the Fascist state could ... intervene in religious affairs ... only when the latter touch the political and moral order of the state". Fascist philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] had maintained that Fascism could contradict Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|title=A History of Fascism, 1914-1945|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=9781857285956|pages=215–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==10th anniversary of the School==

During February 19 to 20 in [[Milan]], to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the School, the "First National Conference of Mystical Fascists" was held in a room at the [[palazzo Marino]] ([[Marino Palace]]), with the intention that it would be the first in a series of such conferences.&lt;ref name=autogenerato1 /&gt; This objective failed with the start of [[World War II]]. [[Ferdinando Mezzasoma]] presided at the Conference, as the Deputy Secretary of the School and the [[National Fascist Party]]. The theme of the Conference was, "Why are we Mystics?" &lt;ref&gt;Aldo Grandi, ''Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista'', pag. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The meeting saw some 500 participants, among them most Italian intellectuals of the time, including deans and professors. [[Julius Evola]] was among the supporters of this initiative for the possibilities it could offer in the creation of an elite inspired by the traditional values he espoused. Numerous discussions were reported and published as "Notebooks" under the initiative of Giani.

==The "Mystics" volunteer for the war front==
After the entry of Italy into World War II on June 10, 1940, the School was entrusted to the regency of [[Salvatore Atzeni]],&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Grandi, ''Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di mistica fascista'', cit. pag. 129&lt;/ref&gt; and classes were suspended, in large part because most directors had left voluntarily under the instigation of [[Niccolò Giani]]. Giani was killed during the war in 1941, as were many other instructors from the School, including [[Guido Pallotta]] and [[Berto Ricci]]. In 1943, having lost most of its instructors in the war, the School's activities ceased.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Carini, Niccolò Giani e la scuola di mistica fascista 1930–1943, Mursia, 2009, pag.43&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Italy's participation in World War II was ended by the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]], 14 members of the school were killed, four of whom were decorated with Italy's [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]].&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Emilio Longo, Gli eroi della guerra perduta, edizioni settimo sigillo, 2003, Roma, pag.94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
The School of Fascist Mysticism has been the subject of limited research. Some eminent scholars have traced the brief notes and put them in works of broader scope: Bobbio, Casucci, Isnenghi,&lt;ref&gt;M.Isnenghi''Intellettuali militanti e intellettuali funzionari. Appunti sulla cultura fascista'', Einaudi, Torino, 1979, pp. 252-254&lt;/ref&gt; Nolte, De Felice, Gentile, Ledeen&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Ledeen ''Universal Fascism'', New York, Howard Fertig, 1972 (trad.it. a cura di Bertolazzi, ''L'internazionale fascista'', Laterza, Roma-Bari, 1973, pp.32-407&lt;/ref&gt; Greater depth was instead shown by Daniele Marchesini, Betri,&lt;ref&gt;''Tra politica e cultura: la Scuola di Mistica Fascista'' in ''Storia in Lombardia'', VIII, 1-2, 1989, PP. 377-398&lt;/ref&gt; Signori, La Rovere,&lt;ref&gt;''Storia dei GUF. Organizzazione, politica e miti della gioventù universitaria fascista 1919–1943'' con pref. di Bruno Bongiovanni, Bollati Boringhieri, Torino, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; journalists of the caliber of Bocca, de Antonellis&lt;ref&gt;''Come doveva essere il perfetto giovane fascista. La scuola di mistica del regime.'' in ''Storia Illustrata'', 243, febbraio 1978, pp.46-53&lt;/ref&gt; and  Giannantoni.&lt;ref&gt;Giannantoni, ''Fascismo, guerra e società nella Repubblica Sociale Italiana (Varese 1943–1945)'', prefaz. di Zanzi, Franco Angeli, Milano, 1984, pp. 69-70,73-74,181,183,235-236,287-291,294,675 e n.32,676 n.35,727 n.13, 751-753 n.15, foto 44,45.&lt;/ref&gt; The first to show interest in the topic was, from the political spectrum's right, the political scientist [[Marco Tarchi]].&lt;ref&gt;cfr. l'intro di M.Tarchi contenuta in Julius Evola, ''La Torre'', Il Falco, Milano, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; while Marchesini goes to the record of having been the only, until 2003, to have an entire study devoted to this subject.&lt;ref&gt;''La scuola dei gerarchi. Storia, problemi, istituzioni'', Feltrinelli, 1976 Milano&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004 blooms a certain interest in Fascist Mysticism: there are published, without the knowledge of the other one, two works: L. Fantini, ''Essenza mistica del fascismo totalitario. Dalla scuola di Mistica Fascista alle Brigate Nere'' a cura dell'Associazione Culturale ''1 dicembre 1943'', Perugia 2004 and A. Grandi ''Gli eroi di Mussolini. Niccolò Giani e la Scuola di Mistica Fascista'', Rizzoli, Milano 2004.

[[File:Seed swap.jpg|thumb|A seed swap in [[Urbana, Illinois]]]]
'''Seed swaps''' are events where [[gardener]]s meet to exchange [[seed]]s. [[Barter|Swapping]] can be arranged online or by mail,&lt;ref&gt;In England, the Cottage Garden Society organizes an annual seed exchange, where members mail in their seeds to the Society; members may then select a number of kinds of seed from a list of submissions. {{cite web

Swap meet events, where growers meet and exchange their excess seeds in person, are also growing in popularity. In part this is due to increased interest in [[organic gardening]] and heritage or [[heirloom plant]] varietals. This reflects gardeners' interest in "unusual or particular varieties of flowers and vegetables," according to Kathy Jentz of ''Washington Gardener Magazine'' (Maryland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Cultural and culinary significance==
Swapping seeds is of great cultural significance for many of the people involved, because it allows a culture which has become widely distributed, such as [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] in the United States, to continue to grow the food they are accustomed to, foods which often have great significance, and for which seeds are often transported over great distances. Mike Szuberla, organizer of a seed swap in [[Toledo, Ohio]], noted, "Seeds are, in a sense, suitcases in which people can transport their cultures with them...Many families have brought their favorite seeds on tremendous journeys."&lt;ref name="toledo"&gt;{{cite news

The Dixon Community Seed Exchange, in Dixon, NM has been taking place annually since 2003.  It distributes free seed of homegrown and commercial varieties as available and also provides a forum for the exchange of varieties peculiar to the high mountain areas of northern New Mexico.  It attracts several hundred participants and photos may be viewed at its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talondegato.com/talondegato/Seed_Exchange.html Talon de Gato Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological significance ==
Some seed swaps explicitly have a biological goal—usually either educating the public in [[organic gardening]] or the attempt to maintain [[crop diversity]].&lt;ref name="southern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oglethorpe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="north devon"/&gt; The larger global relevance and beneficial long-range effects of [[Sustainable agriculture|ecological farming]] sustained by seed swaps, and the effects of such practices in countering the effects of [[agrichemical]] [[monoculture]], are beginning to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Restrictions in the European Union ==
The [[European Court of Justice]] ruled in 2012 that farmers in the [[European Union]] are allowed under restricted circumstances to both produce and market seeds from plant varieties that are not officially registered and approved.  Sale of such seeds could not be categorically prohibited on the basis of an existing EU guideline on seed registering.  The corporation [[Graines Baumax]] had taken the domestic farmers' network [[Association Kokopelli|Kokopelli]] to court and demanded €50,000 (US$61,000).
&lt;ref name="dw_court"&gt;{{cite web|title=European court rules on trade in non-approved seeds|url=http://www.dw.de/european-court-rules-on-trade-in-non-approved-seeds/a-16090272|date=2012-07-12|accessdate=2013-02-19|publisher=dw.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kokopelli won this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procès Kokopelli c.

The '''Seoul Peace Prize''' was established in 1990 as a biennial recognition with monetary award to commemorate the success of the [[1988 Summer Olympics|24th Summer Olympic Games]] held in [[Seoul, Korea]], an event in which 160 nations from across the world took part, creating harmony and friendship. The Seoul Peace Prize was established to reflect the wishes of the [[Korean people]] and to crystallize their desire for everlasting peace on earth.  The nominating group consists of 300 Korean nationals, and 800 internationals.  The awardee receives a diploma, a plaque and honorarium of US$200,000.

Past Seoul Peace Prize recipients have gone on to be nominated and awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], including [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (1996 SPP, 1999 NPP) and Bangladeshi Dr. [[Muhammad Yunus]] (2006 SPP, 2006 NPP), the founder of [[Grameen Bank]] which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and also inspired programs such as the [[Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226809/Info-Ladies-bringing-internet-bike-remote-villages-Bangladesh.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/global-news/asia/bangladesh/3284-internet-info-ladies.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182454/http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Dnet (A Social Enterprise)]].

==Netanyahu`s speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly==

On September 29, 2014 Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] gave a speech to the [[United Nations]] focusing on the Iranian threat and the most recent [[Israel-Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Full-text-of-Prime-Minister-Netanyahus-UN-speech-376626|title=Full text of Prime Minister Netanyahu's UN speech|publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech Netanyahu claimed that he had come to the [[United Nations]] "to expose the brazen lies spoken from this very podium"  against [[Israel]] and the soldiers of [[Israel]].

This statement is referring to the 21st Special Session of the [[Human Rights Council]] on the Human Rights Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem on July 23, 2014. During this Session the [[Human Rights Council]] accused [[Israel]] of  violating the [[laws of war]] and called for an investigation and report on violations by both sides, in order to identify the responsible ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/23/human-rights-council-establish-fact-finding-mission-israelpalestine|title=Human Rights Council: Establish Fact-finding Mission in Israel|date=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister]] [[Netanyahu]] stressed that by investigating [[Israel]] rather than [[Hamas]] for war crimes, the [[UN Human Rights Council]] had betrayed "its noble mission to protect the innocent". Furthermore, he accused the [[Human Rights Council]] of sending a clear message to all [[terrorists]]: "Use civilians as human shields. [...] Because sadly, it works." He stated that the UN's [[Human Rights Council]] has turned into a Terrorist Rights Council by accepting and giving legitimacy to the use of [[human shields]].
[[Netanyahu]] reported in his speech that [[Israel]] had justly defended itself against terror tunnels and rocket attacks and had no intention in targeting innocent civilians. He mentioned that Israel " was doing everything to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties" by sending text messages, dropping flyers, making phone calls and announcing warnings on television. "No other country and no other army in history have gone to greater lengths to avoid casualties among the civilian population of their enemies."{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Prime Minister believes that not [[Israel]] but the [[Hamas]] has broken the [[International Law]] by hiding missile batteries in residential areas, using Palestinian as [[human shields]] and telling [[Palestinians]] to ignore the warnings of [[Israel]] to leave. Furthermore, he blamed the [[Hamas]] for deliberately placing rockets next to Palestinian children in order to create images of horror for the press. "Israel was using its missiles to protect its children. Hamas was using its children to protect its missiles."{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Abbas`s speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly==

Three days before Netanyahu`s speech the [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]] [[Mahmoud Abbas]] gave a speech to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Full-text-of-Palestinian-Authority-President-Abbas-address-to-the-UN-General-Assembly-in-New-York-376388|title=Palestinian Authority President Abbas' address to the UN General Assembly in New York|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "[[Israel]] has chosen to make it a year of a new war of genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people." He called for the support and recognition of the free and independent [[State of Palestine]] and for an end to the [[Israeli blockade]] and he blamed [[Israel]] for creating the "largest prison in the world for nearly two million Palestinian citizens". [[Mahmoud Abbas|Abbas]] emphasized that [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], other than [[Israel]], will maintain its commitment to [[international law]], [[international humanitarian law]] and the international consensus. He criticized that [[Israel]] had been acting as a state above the law with "impunity and absolving it of any accountability or punishment for its policies, aggression and defiance of the international will and legitimacy", therefore creating a ground for the rise of [[extremism]], hate and [[terrorism]] in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. He stated that the people of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] are the ones who need immediate [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|international protection]] and are in need of [[security and peace]].

==Human Rights Council on the Human Rights Situation in Gaza==

[[Joe Stork]], a member of the [[Human Rights Watch]] for Middle East and North Africa Division Deputy Director highlights at an event hosted by the [[Middle East Institute]] and the [[Foundation for Middle East Peace]] on the 5th September 2014,  that the [[law of war]] states, that the harm of [[civilians]] getting hurt or killed has to be minimized and that only evident military objectives are [[legitimate targets]].&lt;ref name="CSPAN Discussion" /&gt; However [[civilians]] can be considered as [[collateral damage]], which means that they are damage aside from what was intended. Store argues that in the case of the Israel- Gaza Conflict in 2014, investigations and interviews with surviving victims have shown, that in many cases the death of [[civilians]] could have been prevented.

Moreover, [[Joe Stork]] referred to the attacks on six schools, three of them inhabitant by displaced persons. The attacks were justified by claiming that the [[Hamas]] was using the school as a storage for their weapons. The victims described the school as empty from missiles and weapons. Stork also mentioned the shooting of a boy school in which 12 people were killed 8 of them children. The shooting was explained by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] by stateing that the attack was aiming to kill three Jihad terrorists who were passing by the school on their motorcycles. Why the motorcycle was shot in front of the school and not before or after passing it, was not answered by the IDF.&lt;ref name="CSPAN Discussion" /&gt; An UN school, used as a shelter for over 3,300 displaced people was hit by Israeli shelling on July 30.&lt;ref name="Leila Zerrougui"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/press-release/no-safe-place-children-gaza|title=Leila Zerrougui: No Safe Place for the Children Of Gaza|work=United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israeli army]] had clear information from the [[UN]] that the school was housing displaced [[civilians]]. Many of them, including children, were injured and killed. [[Leila Zerrougui]], Special Representative of the [[Secretary-General]] for Children and Armed Conflict condemn this as a grave violation of [[international law]].&lt;ref name="Leila Zerrougui" /&gt;

Joe Stork further stated that the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] claims that a person which politically belongs to the [[Hamas]] is a [[legitimate target]]. However under the law of court a member of the [[Hamas]] party is not necessarily a [[terrorist]] and therefore not automatically an official [[legitimate target]].&lt;ref name="CSPAN Discussion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?321319-1/discussion-political-humanitarian-implications-israelipalestinian-conflict|title=Discussion Political Humanitarian Implications - Video - C-SPAN.org|work=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Rights Council]] named on July 23 the following examples to prove the violations of [[international law]] and the [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/23/human-rights-council-establish-fact-finding-mission-israelpalestine|title=Human Rights Council: Establish Fact-finding Mission in Israel/Palestine - Human Rights Watch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the ground offensive began on July 17 the [[Human Rights Watch]] documented airstrikes which killed 30 [[civilians]], 11 of them children. On July 11 airstrike hit the Fun Time Beach café near [[Khan Yunis]], killing seven [[civilians]]. Two of them boys, as they were preparing to watch a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] game. The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] claimed that they were"targeting a terrorist" but no further information was provided to explain why they attacked the [[terrorists]] in a public place where other [[civilians]] were at risk to be killed and injured. On July 16 two young boys were killed and three boys were wounded, trying to flee, by an Israeli missile struck on a [[Gaza City]] pier. The Israeli military stated that they attacked  because they had "identified [[Hamas]] structure" but targeted the boys (age 10 to 13) by accident,  as "fleeing fighters." A hospital was attacked by ground and air forces from July 11 to 17. The hospital staff was forced to leave and to evacuate the patients (none of them mobile), under fire. Stork said that the repeated use of guided missiles and direct tank fire on a hospital, is considered to be a [[war crime]]. Furthermore, he said the shootings of residential buildings aiming at family members of supposedly members of an armed group are unlawful. He continued saying that even a giving warnings before an attack does not make an unlawful attack lawful.
In the speeches it is also mentioned that  Palestinian armed groups violated the [[laws of war]] as well. Twice rockets in empty [[UNRWA]] schools were found and the rockets launched on [[Israel]] killed and wounded [[civilians]] including young children, and destroyed civilian property.
Therefore, the "[[Human Rights Watch]] urges the [[Human Rights Council]] to [...] investigate and report promptly and publicly on violations by all sides, identify those responsible for grave crimes, and issue recommendations to the parties and the [[UN]], including on measures to ensure accountability."

[[Navi Pillay]] a high commissioner for [[human rights]] criticized at an emergency debate at the [[UNHRC]] in [[Geneva]] that [[Israel]] had not done enough to protect [[civilians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jul/23/un-high-commissioner-navi-pillay-war-crimes-israel|title=UN human rights body to investigate claims of Israeli violations in Gaza|author=Ian Black|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she accused [[Israel]] of committing [[war crimes]]. She highlights, that the killing of [[civilians]] in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], included dozens of children and had led to concerns over Israel's [[foreign policy]] and its respect for proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28437626|title=BBC News - UN's Navi Pillay warns of Israel Gaza 'war crimes'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 47- member [[Geneva]] state forum accepted the Palestinian resolution by a vote of one state against the investigations (United States) and 29 states in favour of the investigation. 17 states were abstentions (including [[Germany]] and other [[European Union]] members). The presented resolution called for "an independent, international commission of inquiry" to investigate "all violations of [[international human rights law]] and [[international humanitarian law]] in the occupied Palestinian territory, including [[East Jerusalem]], particularly in the occupied [[Gaza Strip]]".

{{more footnotes|date=November 2012}}
{{Elections}}
A '''swing vote''' is a vote that is seen as potentially going to any of a number of candidates in an election, or, in a [[two-party system]], may go to either of the two dominant political parties. Such votes are usually sought after in election campaigns, since they can play a big role in determining the outcome.

A '''swing voter''' or '''floating voter''' is a [[voter]] who may not be affiliated with a particular [[political party]] (Independent) or who will vote across party lines. In American politics, many [[centrist]]s, [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], and [[conservatism|conservative]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] are considered "swing voters" since their voting patterns cannot be predicted with certainty.

While the swing voter is ostensibly the target of most political activity during elections, in countries without compulsory voting the outcome is dependent on swing voters only to a limited extent. Another, arguably larger factor is the success of each party in rallying its core support. In a two-party system, those who become disillusioned with their once-favored party are more likely to vote [[Third party (politics)|third-party]] or abstain than cross over.

Smaller groups that use voting to decide matters, such as [[chambers of parliament]] and [[supreme courts]], can also have swing voters. The smaller the group, the more power swing voters can have. For example, on a court of seven judges, of which three are committed to each side of a case, the seventh judge may be seen as single-handedly deciding the case.

==Profile==
In an election, there are "certain" or "lock" votes, voters who are solidly behind or [[partisan (political)|partisan]] to a particular candidate and will not consider changing their minds whatever the opposition says. Swing voters are undecided about how they will vote. They are sometimes referred to as '''undecideds''', '''undecided voters''', or '''floating voter'''.

They may be dissatisfied party members who are open to the idea of voting for other [[political party|parties]], or they could be officially registered as "independents" or simply people who have never had a strong affiliation with any political party and will vote depending on certain things that influence them: [[healthcare]], [[Employee benefit|benefits]], [[election campaign]], etc.

Some might be people who have never exercised their [[right to vote]] before, such as those just reaching [[voting age]]. Some, but not all, swing voters are considered to be "[[Low information voter|low-information voters]]." Because the votes of swing voters are considered to be "up for grabs," candidates direct a fair proportion of campaign effort towards them, but they must also be concerned with voter turnout among their political base. There is a perception that swing voters are primarily motivated by [[self-interest]] rather than values or ideology and so are particularly susceptible to [[pork barreling]].

If a constituency contains a large proportion of swing voters it is often called a '''[[marginal seat]]''' and extensive campaign resources are poured into it.

==Demographics within the United States==

An April 2016 poll by the Progressive Policy Institute examined voters in the U.S. states considered "battlegrounds" in the upcoming presidential election (Florida, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada). Swing voters were slightly more likely to be women (52 percent women, 48 percent men) and slightly less likely to have a college degree (44 percent) than voters overall in these states (48 percent). By contrast, race was a significant determinant, especially for African-Americans. While 7 percent of poll respondents identified as African-American, only 2 percent of swing voters were African-American. Latinos (12 percent of poll respondents) were represented more proportionately (13 percent of swing voters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brodnitz|first1=Peter|title=Swing Voters In Swing States Hold Balance In 2016|url=http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016.04-PPI-Poll_Swing-Voters-in-Swing-States.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=Progressive Policy Institute|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sim|first1=Melissa|title=US Elections: Who are the swing voters?|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/who-are-the-swing-voters|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=The Straits Times|date=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Overall, white voters are likely to swing the outcome of a national election by an average of 10 percentage points—voting more Democratic in elections Democrats win and more Republican in elections Republicans win," according to a 2008 report by the Democratic Leadership Council. Most of this (6.7 of the 10 percentage points) is due to those white people who have only a high school education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=From|first1=Al|last2=Lynch|first2=Victoria|title=Who Are The Swing Voters?: Key Groups that Decide National Elections|url=http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/DLC_political_study_0.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=Democratic Leadership Council|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-term and presidential elections from 1992 to 2014, people who self-identified as "gay, lesbian, or bisexual" voted consistently "around 75 percent Democratic within a range of 67 to 81 percent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fenwick|first1=Wendy|title=Can the GLB Vote Swing an Election?|url=http://www.glreview.org/article/can-the-glb%E2%80%88vote-swing-an-election/|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 presidential election, people who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender cast 78 percent of their votes for the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Just 14 percent of LGBT people voted for Donald Trump, exit poll reveals|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/11/09/just-14-percent-of-lgbt-people-voted-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-reveals/|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=Pink News|date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among people who identify as gay and bisexual, men's support for Democratic candidates in the 1990s Congressional elections (held every two years from 1990 to 1998) was more consistent than women's. Across these five elections, men's support ranged from 67 percent to 75 percent, while women's support ranged from 53 percent to 82 percent. This suggests that lesbian and bisexual women may be more likely swing voters, at least over time, if not necessarily for any given election. There are also differences by state: "California GLB voters are more likely to identify as 'Independent' than are GLB voters nationally, and therefore have a greater potential to play the role of a swing vote in a close election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Robert W.|title=Out and Voting II: The Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Vote in Congressional Elections, 1990-1998|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/OutAndVoting2.pdf|website=The Policy Institute of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Swing voters occasionally play a huge part in elections. First-time voters and swing voters are usually credited for helping [[Jesse Ventura]] win the [[Minnesota]] gubernatorial election in 1998. Swing voters who support [[Third party (politics)|third-party]] candidates take potential votes away from the major candidates. Ventura was a third-party candidate; his opponents were seen as two weak major-party candidates, and this situation created many more swing voters than usual. This resulted in Jesse Ventura, the third-party candidate, winning the election.

In the Supreme Court of the [[United States]] the swing justice, such as [[Anthony Kennedy]], essentially decides the overall outcome of the ruling during a split, which can mean highly impacting [[landmark decision]]s such as the effective decision of the [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] was ultimately made by Kennedy in the ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' case.

==Examples==
Common examples of swing voters include "[[Reagan Democrat]]s" (Democrats who voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980s) and "Clinton Conservatives" (Republicans who voted for [[Bill Clinton]]). In her 2012 book ''The Swing Vote'', Linda Killian divides the American swing vote into 4 factions: NPR Republicans, America First Democrats, the Facebook Generation, and Starbucks Moms and Dads. On the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], Associate Justices [[Potter Stewart]], [[Byron White]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]] have been described as swing votes between the two factions of the court. In the United Kingdom, the "[[Essex man]]", "[[Worcester woman]]" and "[[Holby City woman]]" are examples of personifications of swing voters.

The '''UK Youth Parliament''' ('''UKYP''') is a [[Youth organization|youth organisation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], consisting of [[Democracy|democratically]] elected members aged between 11 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukyp.org.uk/204867/204929.html|title=How to become an MYP|publisher=UK Youth Parliament|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 2000, the parliament has 369 members, who are elected to represent the views of young people in their area to government and service providers. Over 500,000 young people vote in the elections each year, which are held in over 90 percent of constituencies. It is managed by the [[British Youth Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.byc.org.uk/uk-work/uk-youth-parliament.aspx|title = UK Youth Parliament|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-11|website = British Youth Council|publisher = British Youth Council|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140707111212/http://www.byc.org.uk/uk-work/uk-youth-parliament.aspx|archivedate = 2014-07-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members meet regularly to hold debates and plan campaigns at least three times locally a year and on a twice national level, which includes the annual debate within the Chamber of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] every November. Young people hold positions throughout the organisation's management, and it has been endorsed by the majority of the UK's political parties.

Those elected for UKYP hold the suffix of MYP (Member of the UK Youth Parliament).

During House of Commons sitting, UK Youth Parliament is chaired by [[John Bercow]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons]].

== Formation ==
The concept of a United Kingdom Youth Parliament first arose at an event in [[Coventry]] entitled "Heirs To The Millennium".&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/4655/46854.html |title=History |publisher=UK Youth Parliament |accessdate=2009-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818152512/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/4655/46854.html |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the event, the MP [[Andrew Rowe]] and the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] and youth worker Kate Parish began to develop a proposal for the youth advocacy group. In 1998, a steering committee was formed, led by Andrew Rowe and chaired by a young person named Jannik Ecke.&lt;ref name="About - UK Youth Parliament"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/about/|title = About - UK Youth Parliament|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-11|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Malcolm Wicks]], [[Department for Education and Employment]], agreed to employ a member of staff who would work full-time on developing the UK Youth Parliament alongside Kate Parish. Soon after, the first elections for the UK Youth Parliament were held, with the first Annual Sitting being held in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/about-us/history/]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is wide debate over who was key to the formation of the UK Youth Parliament with several people trying to claim that they were key to its formation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Composition ==

=== Membership ===
{{Main article|Member of Youth Parliament}}
A Member of Youth Parliament (MYP) works with MPs, service providers, and decision makers in order to present the views of their constituents to them. Deputy Members of Youth Parliament are also elected, although not every MYP has a deputy.&lt;ref name="About - UK Youth Parliament"/&gt; Deputies work with and support their Member of Youth Parliament locally and regionally, but are not entitled to attend the Annual Sitting or other national events – unless their MYP is unable to.

There are 369 constituencies that MYPs can sit in.

=== Elections ===
The UK Youth Parliament elections are held every one or two years (depending on the local authority), with all young people between the ages of 11–18 being entitled to vote or stand. In England, over 90 percent of the [[local education authority|local education authorities]] hold UKYP elections.

Young people elect their local area's MYPs, who provide a voice for the young people in their area. The number of MYP positions is proportionate to the population of young people in the authority.

Over one million votes were cast in the elections between 2006 and 2009. In 2008, 565,802 young people voted, with 1,625 standing as candidates from across [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/issue7/elections.pdf |title=Debatable Issue 7 |accessdate=2009-03-16 |publisher=UK Youth Parliament |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108053124/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/Issue7/elections.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of England, partner organisations undertake the elections; in [[Scotland]], elections are held every two years for young people to elect their local Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYP). The [[Scottish Youth Parliament]] then internally appoints sixteen of their members to represent the nation as their Members of the UK Youth Parliament which means that Scottish MYPs hold a [[dual mandate]] as both a MYP and a MSYP. In Wales a similar system is used by the [[Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales]], and in Northern Ireland by the [[Northern Ireland Youth Forum]].

== Meetings ==

=== Annual Sitting ===

{{Update|section|date=September 2017}}

[[File:MYPs at the University of Kent.jpg|thumb|right|Members of Youth Parliament in session at the 2009 Annual Sitting]]
The Annual Sitting is the parliament's main yearly meeting, which all MYPs attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukyp.org.uk/4655/index.html |title=About Us |accessdate=2008-11-14 |publisher=UK Youth Parliament }}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place on a university campus over three days. Proceedings include keynote speeches from political figures, followed by question and answer sessions. Past speakers include [[Hazel Blears]], [[Ben Bradshaw]], and [[Des Browne]]. MYPs also hold debates on topical issues, undertake training in [[political campaign|campaigning]], democracy and leadership, and consult with outside organisations such as the [[Ministry of Justice]], [[BBC Trust]] and [[Department for Transport]].

At each Annual Sitting, a [[manifesto]] is created, in which MYPs aim to fully represent the issues that affect their constituents in a single document. Policies are developed based on seven key areas: Culture, Media &amp; Sport, Education &amp; Employment, Empowering Young People, Health, International Matters, Law &amp; Society, and Transport, Environment and Rural Affairs. This manifesto is then presented to government as a current overview of young peoples’ views.

The 9th Annual Sitting was held at the [[University of Kent]] from 24 July to 27 July 2009. The keynote speakers were:
* [[John Bercow]], [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]

=== House of Commons debates ===

==== 2007–09 ====
Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] suggested that members of the UK Youth Parliament could have annual access to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] chamber in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/newsroom_site/pages/news/2007/03_07_07_gordonbrown.html |title=Gordon Brown calls for greater role for the UK Youth Parliament in constitutional reform |publisher=UK Youth Parliament |date=2007-07-03 |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722152020/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/newsroom_site/pages/news/2007/03_07_07_gordonbrown.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this did not come about until March 2009, when a motion was passed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/mar/17/youngpeople-houseofcommons|title=Smells like teen spirit: youths to sit in the Commons|last=Sparrow|first=Andrew|date=17 March 2009 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the UK Youth Parliament to use the House of Commons for that year's annual meeting. However, a Conservative Member of Parliament objected, which forced a vote to be taken on the issue, also employing a procedure called "[[Strangers (Parliament of the United Kingdom)|I spy strangers]]" (historically used to expel disruptive spectators, but now mostly to disrupt the House's business)&lt;ref name="ispystrangers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=180|title=TheyWorkForYou.com glossary: I Spy Strangers|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to take business in the House beyond 7:00pm and stifle any possible debate on the issue. On 12 March, a second debate was held in the House of Commons with a vote set to be taken four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/mps/press-releases/party-politics/labour/sharon-hodgson-mp-slams-tory-‘dinosaurs’-over-uk-youth-parliament-debate-$1280028.htm

On 16 March 2009, 189 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] voted to allow the UK Youth Parliament to debate in the House of Commons, with 16 votes of opposition by Conservative [[backbencher]]s. It was the first time in history that the House of Commons chamber was used by a group other than MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7947335.stm
 |title=Youth to meet in Commons chamber |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online vote was held from July to determine the debate topics, which were:
* [[Top-up fees|Abolish university tuition fees]]
* [[Juvenile delinquency|Youth crime]] and how to tackle it
* [[Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007|Free transport for over 60s]], but not for young people
* [[Capitalism]], [[Late-2000s recession|the economy]] and job opportunities for young people

The debates took place in the House of Commons chamber on Friday 30 October 2009, from 11am to 3:30pm. The session was recorded in [[Hansard]], and the morning debates were broadcast on BBC Parliament the same day. The final two debates were televised later in the week.

The debates were chaired by [[John Bercow]], Speaker of the House of Commons, who closed the event with a dramatic speech to MYPs in which he described the [[British National Party]] as "a poison which we could well do without".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8333161.stm|title=Speaker attacks "poison" of BNP |date=30 October 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Speaker is usually expected to remain impartial, so as not to compromise his authority, but in this case was able to express personal opinion because the ornamental mace that indicates Parliament is sitting was not in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bercow-breaks-convention-to-attack-bnp-1812274.html|title=Bercow breaks convention to attack BNP|last=Savage|first=Michael|date=31 October 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010 ====
In 2010 a debate was held to disuses the possibility of the youth parliament returning for a second sitting.  This resulted in the decision to allow their return not only for that year, but every year for the remainder of the sitting of the current parliament.

UKYP's 2010 Debate took place on 29 October, again chaired by [[John Bercow]], Speaker of the House of Commons with the topics chosen for debate being selected from an Online Ballot. It was broadcast live on Parliament's Website &amp; BBC Parliament.

As reported on the UK Youth Parliament's official website, the results of the five issues that were debated are listed as follows:
*Should sex and relationships education be compulsory from primary school onwards? FOR-211 and AGAINST-104 
*Should university tuition fees rise? FOR-57 and AGAINST-267
*Should the school leaving age be raised to 18 immediately in order to lower youth unemployment? FOR-56 and AGAINST-271 
*Should we withdraw all British troops from Afghanistan by 2012? FOR-137 and AGAINST-179 
*Should reduced transport fares for young people be protected from spending cuts? FOR-239 and AGAINST-80

Therefore, "Should reduced transport fares for young people be protected from spending cuts?" became UKYP's National Campaign for 2011.

==== 2011 ====
In 2011, the Members of Youth Parliament again debated in the House of Commons on 4 November. This time five topics were chosen by over 65,000 young people. The event was chaired by [[John Bercow]], Speaker of the House of Commons, after his persistence in supporting the youth parliament. The sitting was broadcast on [[BBC Parliament]] but this time live from 11:00am – 4:00pm.

Following the debates, the motion entitled 'Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all' was chosen as UKYP's National Campaign for 2012.

==== 2012 ====
In 2012 and for the fourth time, Members of UKYP gathered in the House of Commons on 23 November, with the topics again being chosen through the Make Your Ballot. There was a large increase in turnout. From 65,000 in 2011, over 253,000 took part to choose the five topics that were debated. Again it was chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and was broadcast live via Parliament's Website &amp; BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00. ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ received 154 votes from the 295 cast and therefore became UKYP's 2013 National Campaign.

==== 2013 ====
In 2013, Members of UKYP came together for the fifth year in a row to debate on the green benches on 15 November, the top five issues chosen through the Make Your Mark Ballot. A record 478,386 young people took part, an increase of over 225,000 from 2012. In a difference to choosing campaigns, Members of UKYP chose two campaigns for 2014; one UK-wide issue and one devolved issue (England only). It was chaired like the other debates by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and broadcast live on Parliament's Website &amp; BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00.

Following the debates in which [[Nick Hurd]] MP, then Minister for Civil Society stated that 'Old shouldn't dominate politics', ‘Votes For 16 and 17 Year Olds In All Public Elections’ was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ was voted as the priority campaign for England.

==== 2014 ====
The 2014 UKYP sitting in the House of Commons took place on 14 November with the biggest media attention in the sitting's six-year history. Once more chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, the topics were chosen through 876,488 ballots, around 14.8% of the UK's 11-18-year-old population. The proceedings were broadcast on Parliament's website as tradition but were only shown through the [[BBC]] via their Democracy Live Site; the reason for this was due to the [[Scottish National Party]]'s Annual Autumn Conference commencing that day. However, it was broadcast between 20:20-00:00 on [[BBC Parliament]] that day to give chance for viewers to watch if they couldn't watch online. Also, for the first time the event was covered by [[Sky News]] on the world's biggest video sharing site, [[YouTube]] through their 'Stand Up Be Counted' campaign, which was launched in the summer of 2014.

Before the debates on campaigns occurred, MYPs held a special commemoration marking the 100th anniversary of the start of [[World War I]]. Thirteen MYPs were selected by a video application process to speak from the Dispatch Boxes on how the war affected either their families of region followed by one minute of silence. This was agreed on at UKYP's Annual Sitting in Lancaster that summer.

Once the debates and speeches from [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[William Hague]], [[Natascha Engel]] MP and [[Tessa Munt]] MP had taken place, the following information shows the results of the two votes; one for the UK-wide 2015 issue and like 2013's debate, one devolved issue for England:

UK-wide issue: 
*Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 156 
*Votes for 16- and 17-year-olds in all public elections: 117

England-wide issue:
*Mental health services should be improved with our help: 176
*Better work experience and careers advice: 78
*Bring back exam resits in English and Maths: 32

Therefore, 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 whiles 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England.

==== 2015 ====

The 2015 sitting took place on 13 November, following the counting of 969,992 Make Your Mark Ballots that were cast through the ballot.

After the debates occurred, a special 30 minute debate entitled "My Magna Carta" was held, 800 years after the historic document was first signed.

The information below states the results of the ballots, to choose what of the debated topics would become the two priority campaigns for 2016:

UK Wide:

•	Working together to combat racism and religious discrimination: 155

•	Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 117

Tackling Racism and Religious Discrimination therefore became the UK Wide campaign for 2016, and became the inquiry subject for the year's Youth Select Committee.

Devolved:

•	Mental health services should be improved with our help: 176

•	A curriculum to prepare us for life: 110

•	Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all: 33

The existing Mental Health campaign was there re-selected as the devolved campaign for 2016.

==== Paul Boskett Memorial Trophy ====

In 2014 the introduction of the Paul Boskett Debate Lead Trophy was introduced. Every region elects someone to represent them and speak at the Dispatch Box and the strongest speaker is now awarded; the name comes from the late Paul Boskett MBE, who died in 2014 aged 59; he worked and was a lead figure within the [[British Youth Council]]. Paul is cited as a major inspiration for many young people and seen as a key champion of youth voice. The first Debate Lead Champion was Ife Grillo who sat as a Vice Chair to the British Youth Council between 2015-2017 and at the time of the Commons debate on 14 November 2014, represented the London Borough of Hackney.

== Regional ==
Members of Youth Parliament in England are split into nine geographical regions, which meet and work together regularly: [[London]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[South West England|South West]], [[South East England|South East]], [[North West England|North West]], [[North East England|North East]], [[Yorkshire &amp; Humberside]], [[East of England]].

Regional meetings known as conventions take place three times a year (June, October and December) and last around a day. Members share news, issues and resources, in addition to taking part in training to help them in their role, relevant Government Consultations and within the October Convention, Elections occur to decide regional representatives to be a Debate Lead for UKYP's House of Commons Debate and the UKYP Procedure's Group for the following year (1 February to 31 January).

== Campaigns ==
The UK Youth Parliament launched the "Make Your Mark" ballot in 2011. The purpose of the ballot to get young people from across the UK to determine which five topics the UK Youth Parliament would debate within the House of Commons. Over 65,000 young people completed the ballot after several months of campaigning.

The first five issues debated in the House of Commons chamber through 'Make Your Mark' were:
# "Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all"
# "No to tuition fees, yes to graduate tax"
# "Zero tolerance towards bullying in schools"
# "End child poverty"
# "A Greener future for Britain"

On 4 November 2011, Members of Youth Parliament came from across the UK to debate and vote at House of Commons the most important issue to campaign on in 2012. The winning campaign topic was "Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all".

2012's sitting chose ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ as the 2013 National Campaign. Over 253,000 young people took part.

In 2013, ‘Votes For 16 and 17 Year Old's In All Public Elections’ was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ was voted as the priority campaign for England. A new record of 478,386 young people cast a vote.

In 2014  876,488 young people helped to choose the House of Commons topics; over 14.8% of the UK's 11-18 year old population. 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 with a National Campaign Day occurring on 24 January 2015. Also 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England.

2015 recorded 969,992 votes and saw that year's Commons Debate select Mental Health chosen as the England Campaign issue and Tackling Racism &amp; Discrimination as the UK priority topic to campaign on.

2016 saw another increase in MYM's total, with 978,216 having there say and as a result of that year's debates on the famous Green Benches, saw Votes at 16 be selected as the England campaign issue and a Curriculum for Life for the 2nd time be the national priority campaign topic.

In 2017, the Make Your Mark for the first time in the ballot's history fell, to 954,766 - of which however was widely still seen as an impressive total considering the scale of Youth Provision cuts since 2010. Both issues chosen in 2016, of a Curriculum for Life and Votes at 16 were once again selected by MYP's to be the priority campaign topics, however with them being switched in relation to the campaign area, meaning Votes at 16 took national precedent and a Curriculum for Life reverted to England only focus.

2018's Ballot has written history and seen a initial total of 1,022,286 votes be declared, marking the first time Make Your Mark has exceeded 7 figures; with an increased and revised 2nd total to be announced on 24 October 2018, along with the Commons Debate topics for this year's proceedings - to be held on 9 November 2018.

== Organisation ==

=== Governance ===

==== Procedures Group ====
Decisions regarding the development and progression of the organisation is undertaken by the Procedures Group, made up of one MYP elected from each region and nation (known as "PGs"), for a 12-month term from 1 February to 31 January the following year. Their main focus is "key decisions relating to the membership and the programme of work, within the given strategic boundaries".&lt;ref name="Accounts2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends16%5C0001084716_ac_20080331_e_c.pdf|title=Democracy for Young People Accounts 31 Mar 2008|publisher=[[Charity Commission]]|pages=4|accessdate=2009-11-03}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} &lt;/ref&gt;

They meet a minimum of four times a year to represent their regions nationally, coordinate campaign efforts and organise events such as the Annual Conference. Reports are taken back to MYPs at their regional conventions &amp; other meetings.

==== Management and support ====
 
The [[British Youth Council]] manages the UK Youth Parliament. The British Youth Council won a bid in 2011, granted by the [[Department for Education]] to lead a national Youth Voice Service. Youth Voice will support young people in influencing local and national Government decision making in England, and provide continued support for the UK Youth Parliament.

The corporate and administrative governance is overseen by the Board of Trustees of the [[British Youth Council]].

== Reception ==

=== Praise ===
The organisation has been endorsed by former Prime Ministers [[Gordon Brown]] and [[David Cameron]]. It has also been endorsed by former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Party Leader and former Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epolitix.com/stakeholder-websites/stakeholder-website-page/sites/uk-youth-parliament/
 |title=UK Youth Parliament |publisher=ePoliticx |accessdate=2009-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Brown described the UK Youth Parliament as "a symbol of the politics we should all strive for - politics that bring people together to work for what is best for us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page21138|title=Youth Parliament takes over Commons|date=30 October 2009|publisher=[[10 Downing Street]]|accessdate=2009-11-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101012234/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page21138|archivedate=1 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the organisation's Head of Programmes Kate Parish was given a [[National Council for Voluntary Youth Services]] Award, for her "commendable dedication to the development of UK Youth Parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ncvys.org.uk/UserFiles/File/News/Press%20Releases/NCVYS%20Press%20Release_VYOs%20debate%20key%20issues%20around%20faith%20and%20young%20people_22.10.07.pdf|title=Voluntary Youth Organisations debate key issues around faith and young people in society at the NCVYS annual conference|date=22 October 2007|publisher=National Council for Voluntary Youth Services|accessdate=2009-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721121041/http://www.ncvys.org.uk/UserFiles/File/News/Press%20Releases/NCVYS%20Press%20Release_VYOs%20debate%20key%20issues%20around%20faith%20and%20young%20people_22.10.07.pdf#|archive-date=2011-07-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the UK Youth Parliament was given the Positive Images award by the ''[[Children &amp; Young People Now]]'' magazine for exposing young people’s experiences of the current levels of sex and relationships education in a high-profile publicity campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/newsroom_site/pages/news/2008/13_06_08_award.html |title=UK Youth Parliament Scoops Another Award! |accessdate=2008-06-13 |date=2009-03-16 |publisher=UK Youth Parliament |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722152010/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/newsroom_site/pages/news/2008/13_06_08_award.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the organisation also received a Brook special achievement award for this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/newsroom_site/pages/news/2009/25_03_09_brookaward.html |title=UK Youth Parliament wins Brook special achievement award for SRE campaign! |accessdate=2009-02-25 |date=2009-05-01 |publisher=UK Youth Parliament |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704223936/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/newsroom_site/pages/news/2009/25_03_09_brookaward.html |archivedate=2009-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The organisation has been described by ''[[Daily Mail]]'' columnist [[Tom Utley]] as "sublimely fatuous",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tom | last=Utley | title=Lack of sex education is not the problem | date=6 December 2007 | publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]] | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-500191/Lack-sex-education-problem.html | work =[[Daily Mail]] | pages = | accessdate = 14 November 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; after MYPs co-signed an open letter with public figures including [[Davina McCall]] and [[Polly Toynbee]] to ''[[The Times]]''. The letter protested against the lack of sufficient [[Sex education|sex and relationships education]] in schools, and that the UK Youth Parliament believe that this has led to increasing [[teenage pregnancy]]. Utley argues that there is already far too much sex education and that increasing it would only lead to more [[underage sex]].

A study by the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] found that youth participation organisations in the UK, including the UK Youth Parliament, needed to "tackle the unintentional practice of [[tokenism]]". The paper concludes that "failing to act upon [young people's] opinions 
or take them very seriously" once they are identified is often a cause of frustration amongst participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Youth Participation in the UK: Bureaucratic Disaster or Triumph of Child Rights?|journal=Children, Youth and Environments|year=2006|first=Emily|last=Middleton|volume=16|issue=2|pages=11|id=|url=http://www.colorado.edu/journals/cye/16_2/16_2_12_YouthParticipationUK.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217044158/http://www.colorado.edu/journals/cye/16_2/16_2_12_YouthParticipationUK.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-12-17|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auto scrapyard 1.jpg|right|thumb|Crushed vehicles ready for transportation to a steel mill.]]
__NOTOC__
'''Vehicle recycling''' is the dismantling of vehicles for spare parts. At the end of their useful life, vehicles have value as a source of spare parts and this has created a vehicle dismantling industry. The industry has various names for its business outlets including [[wrecking yard]], auto dismantling yard, car spare parts supplier, and recently, auto or vehicle recycling. Vehicle recycling has always occurred to some degree but in recent years manufacturers have become involved in the process. A [[car crusher]] is often used to reduce the size of the scrapped vehicle for transportation to a steel mill.

Approximately 12-15 million vehicles reach the end of their use each year in just the United States alone. These automobiles, although out of commission, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them. The vehicles are shredded and the metal content is recovered for recycling, while in many areas, the rest is further sorted by machine for recycling of additional materials such as glass and plastics. The remainder, known as automotive shredder residue, is put into a landfill.
The shredder residue of the vehicles that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials including 30% of it as polymers, and 5-10% of it as residual metals. Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those residual materials.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 75% of the materials are able to be recycled. As the most recycled consumer product, end-of-life vehicles provide the steel industry with more than 14 million tons of steel.&lt;ref name="benefits"&gt;

==Process==

The process of recycling a vehicle is extremely complicated as there are many parts to be recycled and many hazardous materials to remove. Briefly, the process begins with incoming vehicles being inventoried for parts. The wheels and tires, battery and [[catalytic converter]] are removed. Fluids, such as engine coolant, oil, transmission fluid, air conditioning refrigerant, and gasoline, are drained and removed. Certain high value parts such as electronic modules, [[alternator]]s, [[starter motor]]s, [[infotainment]] systems - even complete engines or transmissions - may be removed if they are still serviceable and can be profitably sold on; either in "as-is" used condition or to a [[Remanufacturing|remanufacturer]] for restoration. This process of removing higher value parts from the lower value vehicle body shell has traditionally been done by hand. A labour intensive process, that has meant it is uneconomical to remove many of the parts. A technique that is on the rise is the mechanical removal of these higher value parts via machine based vehicle recycling systems (VRS). An excavator or materials handler equipped with a special attachment allows these materials to be removed quickly and efficiently. Increasing the amount of material that is recycled and increasing the value the vehicle dismantler receives from an end-of-life vehicle (ELV). Other hazardous materials such as mercury, and [[sodium azide]] (the propellant used in [[air bags]]) may also be removed.&lt;ref name="autorec"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After all of the parts and products inside are removed, the remaining shell of the vehicle is sometimes subject to further processing, which includes removal of the air conditioner evaporator and heater core, and wiring harnesses. The remaining shell is then crushed flat, or cubed, to facilitate economical transportation in bulk to an industrial shredder or hammer mill, where the vehicles are further reduced to fist-sized chunks of metal. Glass, plastic and rubber are removed from the mix, and the metal is sold by multiple tons to steel mills for recycling.&lt;ref name="autorec"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Recycling steel saves energy and natural resources. The steel industry saves enough energy to power about 18 million households for a year, on a yearly basis. Recycling metal also uses about 74 percent less energy than making metal. Thus, recyclers of end-of-life vehicles save an estimated 85 million barrels of oil annually that would have been used in the manufacturing of other parts.&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt; Likewise, car recycling keeps 11 million tons of steel and 800,000 non-ferrous metals out of landfills and back in consumer use.
Before the 2003 model year, some vehicles that were manufactured were found to contain mercury auto switches, historically used in convenience lighting and antilock braking systems. Recyclers remove and recycle this mercury before the vehicles are shredded to prevent it from escaping into the environment. In 2007, over 2100 pounds of mercury were collected by 6265 recyclers.&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt;

===European Union===
In 1997, the European Commission adopted a Proposal for a Directive which aims at making vehicle dismantling and recycling more environmentally friendly by setting clear targets for the recycling of vehicles. This proposal encouraged many in Europe to consider the environmental impact of end-of-life vehicles. In September 2000, the [[End of Life Vehicles Directive]] was officially adopted by the EP and Council. Over the next decade, more legislation would be adopted in order to clarify legal aspects, national practices, and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/elv_index.htm Waste - Environment - European Commission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of vehicle manufacturers collaborated on developing the International Dismantling Information System to meet the legal obligations of the End of Life Vehicles Directive.

In 2018 the EC published a study [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/elv/pdf/ELV_report.pdf Assessment of ELV Directive with emphasis on the end of life vehicles of unknown whereabouts]. This study demonstrates that each year the whereabouts of 3 to 4 million ELVs across the EU is unknown and that the stipulation in the ELV Directive are not sufficient to monitor the performance of single Member States for this aspect. The study proposed and assessed a number of options to improve the legal provisions of the ELV Directive. 

===United States===
On 2 July 2009 and the next 55 days, the [[Car Allowance Rebate System]], or “Cash for Clunkers”, was an attempt at a green initiative by the United States Government in order to stimulate automobile sales and improve the average fuel economy of the United States. Many cars ended up being destroyed and recycled in order to fulfill the program, and even some exotic cars were crushed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/5365954/ten-most-exotic-cars-destroyed-by-cash-for-clunkers Ten Most Exotic Cars Destroyed By Cash For Clunkers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, as carbon footprints are of concern, some will argue that the “Cash for Clunkers” did not reduce many owners’ carbon footprints. A lot of carbon dioxide is added into the atmosphere to make new cars. It is calculated that if someone traded in an 18 mpg clunker for a 22 mpg new car, it would take five and a half years of typical driving to offset the new car’s carbon footprint. That same number increases to eight or nine years for those who bought trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111511131 Critics Say 'Clunkers' Program Isn't Very Green : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a vehicle is [[abandoned vehicle|abandoned]] on the roadside or in empty lots, licensed dismantlers in the United States can legally obtain them so that they are safely converted into reusable or recycled commodities.&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt;

==Facts==
*The typical passenger car consists of about 65 percent steel and iron, by weight. Also, car bodies typically are made 25 percent of recycled steel.&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt;
